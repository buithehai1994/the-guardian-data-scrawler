His performances in films such as Michael Clayton, Out of Sight and Ocean’s Eleven have been a joy, and as an elegant public figure he has more or less single-handedly underwritten the continuing currency of Hollywood classiness. But in this dire, sentimental and self-indulgent film, he has the look of a man who has found strychnine in his Nespresso pod and can’t remember which of the cupboards in his luxury hotel suite contains the antidote.It is directed by Noah Baumbach, whose 2022 film White Noise, based on the Don DeLillo novel, was a superb competition entry at Venice. (Baumbach was reportedly disconcerted by a tepid response;I thought it was brilliant.) But this one is a grisly, sucrose, sub-Fellini swoon on the subject of a super-handsome Hollywood actor attending a Italian arts festival to accept a lifetime achievement award, and naturally experiencing endless bittersweet flashbacks to his youth, in which the middle aged Jay Kelly looks on, with that knowing Clooney smile.The reason for attending this festival is so that Kelly can bump into his teenage daughter who is backpacking around Europe. He even takes the humble train so he can hang out with her, and thereby encounters an uproarious array of picturesque and ordinary people, including a hyperactive German cyclist played by Lars Eidinger.And at this moment of midlife self-examination, Kelly feels that he has let everyone in his life down (although bafflingly the mother of his grownup children has gone missing from the story). He is estranged in serious and non-serious ways from his daughters (played by Riley Keough and Grace Edwards), he is preparing to betray his longsuffering agent Ron (Adam Sandler), he has refused to help his directorial mentor (Jim Broadbent) and he is plagued with memories of how at the beginning of his career he ruthlessly stole a key part from his more talented drama school pal (Billy Crudup), whose career went downhill afterwards. And he can’t decide who he is, or if there is any one behind the celebrity mask.So Baumbach’s film pirouettes into territory already trodden by Fellini’s 81/2and Woody Allen’s Stardust Memories, but smothers everything in a bland, Tuscan sunshine-syrup. The sharp realisations about the cruelty of show business are cancelled by gushes of Hollywood self-adoration and self-forgiveness and jokey non-comedy.Finally, Kelly watches a sizzle-reel of his roles at the festival ceremony, and of course these are clips of Clooney’s actual films (no ER though). It is an unbearable imposition on the audience’s affections, but there is a tear in Jay’s eye. Cine-narcissism like this is always tiresome, and it isn’t any more palatable in a European setting.Jay Kelly screened at theVenice film festival. It is in cinemas from 14 November and on Netflix from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsGeorge ClooneyNoah BaumbachRiley KeoughAdam SandlerVenice film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "Composite: Guardian DesignWhen the streaming giant began making films guided by data that aimed to please a vast audience, the results were often generic, forgettable, artless affairs. But is there a happy ending?ByPhil HoadThu 28 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 05.18 EDTShareWhen the annals of 2025 at the movies are written, no one will remember The Electric State. The film, a sci-fi comic-book adaptation, is set in a world in which sentient robots have lost a war with humans.Netflixblew a reported $320m on it, making it the 14th most expensive film ever made. But it tanked: though The Electric State initially claimed the No 1 spot on the streamer, viewers quickly lost interest. Today, it doesn’t even feature in the company’s top 20 most viewed films, a shocking performance for its most expensive production to date. It became just another anonymous “mockbuster”, crammed with the overfamiliar, flashy signifiers of big-screen film-making: a Spielbergian childhood quest, a Mad Max post-apocalyptic wasteland, Fallout-style retro-futuristic trimmings.Another way of classifying The Electric State is as an example of the “algorithm movie”, the kind of generic product that clogs up streaming platforms and seems designed to appeal to the broadest audience possible. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, whose style might be politely described as “efficient”, specialise in this digital gruel; they also made the similarly forgettable action thriller The Gray Man, starringRyan Gosling.If you haven’t clicked on an algorithm movie, you’ve probably been offered one by autoplay. Often, the title obligingly lets you know what’s in store: Tall Girl, a 2019 teenage romcom, is about a, well, tall girl; Uglies, a sub-Aldous Huxley sci-fi satire, is about a future in which cosmetic surgery is a rite of passage; in Murder Mystery, Adam Sandler andJennifer Anistonplay fish-out-of-water Yanks who turn Poirot on a European cruise. They may feature one of the new tier of stars, often big names but one level below those who are able to open films on their name alone, such as Tom Cruise or Margot Robbie. These actors – Sandler, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lopez, Gal Gadot – had the most to gain from kissing the streaming ring. The current king of the algorithm movie is Ryan Reynolds, who starred in 6 Underground, The Adam Project and Netflix’s second most-viewed film, Red Notice.Algorithm movies usually exhibit easy-to-follow story beats that leave no viewer behind; under this regime, exposition is no longer a screenwriting faux pas. A recent n+1 article revealed that screenwriters who work with Netflix often receive the note: “Have this character announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along.”View image in fullscreenAnthony Russo and Joe Russo in 2022.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyIn this age of “second-screen viewing”, the content remains within cosy aesthetic lines, so as not to jar viewers out of their Netflix’n’chill stupor. The lighting has that bright digital look, but remains stolidly low contrast. The sound mixes are flat because they need to work across environments and devices: people are watching on everything from VR headsets to beaten-up mobile phones.Algorithm-friendly entertainment – trawling as widely as possible for viewers, fully or half-attentive – is putting cinema on a slippery slope, believes Ted Hope, the one-time independent producer who went on to head up Amazon Original Movies in 2015. “If you see people are enjoying ambient programming, [the temptation is] to give them what they want. I would say: don’t give them what they want.” Hope quit Amazon in 2020 as it was moving away from auteur-led titles (Kenneth Lonergan’s Manchester by the Sea, Chan Park-wook’s The Handmaiden) and towards a more populist strategy.Among the streaming companies, Netflix is by far the most successful. It now has 301 million subscribers worldwide – 100 million more than its nearest competitor, Amazon Prime Video. Releasing more than 100 film “originals” a year, it is more prolific than even the Hollywood studios in their Golden Age peak. It expanded in the 2010s from its US base into nearly 200 countries and operates as a monolithic global distributor of entertainment. While some of its content is purely local, it also aims to select the most promising titles throughout the world and make them available internationally (as happened with the TV show Squid Game and the 2022 Oscar-winning German adaptation ofAll Quiet on the Western Front).Netflix’s model, and its enormous success, gives it unprecedented influence over cinema’s future. It’s unclear how far the shape of that influence is determined by the algorithm. Certainly any Netflix viewer will have noticed the proliferation of films that seem to fit the category of “algorithm movie” – but they are not algorithmic in the sense of being directly machine-generated (at least not yet). The company’s co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, has denied “reverse-engineering” films from its data,telling Vulture.com in 2018commissioning was “70% gut and 30% data” (though in an interview three years earlier, he had it the other way around). Netflix’s PR department declined to let me talk to any of its senior executives for this story, but it reiterated the line about “the misconception that we commission by algorithm”. A number of the company’s former executives, and others in the film industry, would only speak to me on condition of anonymity; aware of Netflix’s current dominant position in the industry, and its caginess about its use of data, they fear it could harm their careers if they spoke publicly about their experiences.So what is going on inside the black boxes of the streaming platforms? To what extent are algorithms and data really driving film production – and if they aren’t, where are all the so-called algorithm movies coming from?In the late 00s, Netflix’s then director of personalisation, Todd Yellin, set himself a trifling task: completely redefining the taxonomy of how films and TV were classified. He was a dedicated cinephile and director who had made a well-received debut feature in 2006, the Brooklyn family drama Brother’s Shadow. But working at Netflix gave him an opportunity to flex other skills. “I also have a mathematical side to my brain,” he said, “so I thought if you subdivide movies and TV shows into their constituent parts and tagged them accordingly, would that help put the right title in front of the right person at the right time?”This was his plan for refining Netflix’s recommendation system; the process by which content is sorted and mathematically weighted in order to give individual users the most pleasing selection. Often referred to as “the algorithm”, it actually involves 10 or more interlocking ones.After putting his toddlers to bed, Yellin would sit down in an old chair and raid his library of cinema books for ideas about how to classify content. He quickly went beyond the repertoire of traditional genres – horror, comedy, thriller – to begin tagging titles by subject-related criteria: “Is it about dancing? Architecture? Marital relationships? Then we’d look at emotions – how dark is it?” For tonal matters, he and his team assigned values from one to five or one to 10.A new job position – “tagger”– was created to watch and classify Netflix content. Yellin remembers it as painstaking work. He and his helpers eventually devised what in 2014 amounted to 77,000 “altgenres” (there are very likely more now): the categorisations that also, depending on what the algorithm serves you, appear on the Netflix homepage as row labels, the categories of films you’re offered. They run from the blandly familiar (“Adventure films”) to the slightly more specific (“Relentless crime thrillers”) to the infuriatingly broad (“Feel all the feels”). And then of course there’s the “Casual viewing” supposedly rotting everyone’s brains, the likes of The Electric State or Red Notice, an action-comedy that’s a mashup of James Bond, Indiana Jones and Fast & Furious.View image in fullscreenRyan Gosling in The Gray Man.Photograph: Stanislav Honzi/APSometimes these row labels are automatically generated, based on underlying relationships between the altgenres revealed by machine learning. Every user is assigned a mathematical “distance” to each altgenre, based on how much or how little they interact with them on the platform. Aggregated across millions of users, this web of consumption patterns reveals unexpected correspondences, overlaps and affinities in viewers’ tastes. One example was the overlap between audiences who liked Formula One and classic rock’n’roll documentaries; in that instance, the recommendation system might generate a category that combined the two.This deeper data architecture was a gamechanger for Netflix. Originally, the service had generated recommendations based on a five-star system of user ratings, but in 2017 Netflix abandoned this in favour of the altgenre-based system. “Moving from explicit to implicit recommendations was the big shift,” said Yellin. “Recommendations based on behaviour – what you actually watched and consumed, versus what you said you liked.”The streaming companies receive, through their user interfaces, unprecedented amounts of data. In 2017, Netflix logged 700bn “data events” – interactions with the platform in some form – per day. Not just whether you opted for something in “So completely captivating” or a sports documentary – but what device you watched it on, what time of day you were viewing, how many other titles you lingered over, whether you turned something off early, how times you rewatched, and on and on. All nodes in the galactic data cloud the services use to decide what films and TV shows to put in front of us.It’s not surprising that data culture is embedded in the way streaming services do business. After all, they were tech companies long before they were film studios.Amazon Prime Videois of course an off-shoot of the world’s largest online retailer, while Netflix – which started as a mail-by-DVD business in 1997 – was similarly rooted in online logistics. Its co-founder Reed Hastings was originally a computer scientist and engineer. But as Netflix matured from a distribution company into a studio – producing its first TV show, House of Cards, in 2013, and its first film, the African war drama Beasts of No Nation in 2015 – the importance of data in creative decision-making has only grown.Like most Silicon Valley outfits, Netflix likes to move fast. Within five seconds, to be precise – this, according to the pitch workshop document they hand out to potential collaborators, is the length of time within which the “audience subconsciously decides whether they will watch your show”.View image in fullscreenReed Hastings Jr.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianA swift and unambiguous opening is a non-negotiable for the company; most of the film-makers interviewed for this article mentioned it. Screenwriter Aron Coleite was brought on to punch up the 2024 sci-fi film Atlas. His draft originally opened with the film’s star, Jennifer Lopez, interrogating the severed head of a robot terrorist. It was deemed too left-field and Coleite ended up replacing it with a more conventional Swat team raid intro; he was swayed by Netflix’s data demonstrating that viewers need to be hooked within a certain window. He feels that window is getting shorter: “I see it shrinking as attention spans are harder to corral.”At Netflix, specialist strategy and analysis teams are embedded within every division of the business. The strategy and analysis team in the content division helps value a prospective new title – whether acquired or developed in-house – by modelling its performance based on historical data. The company has been doing this a long time: there are talks available on YouTube going as far back as 2016, in which Caitlin Smallwood, then head of science and algorithms at Netflix, details how a film’s predicted success evolved according to new elements added during pre-production, such as certain actors coming on board, or the reaction on social media to a teaser trailer. (Netflix later clamped down on this kind of disclosure, afraid it might be interpreted as the algorithmic adulteration of art.)According to Smallwood, this process went as far as assessing pitch decks or scripts for elements that might boost or reduce their appeal. Director Cary Fukunaga mentioned a complex narrative structure in his 2018 big pharma miniseries Maniac being nixed because of the audience loss predicted by the data. “The algorithm’s argument is gonna win at the end of the day,” he told GQ. Netflix’s data teams were always developing new products to guide content-related decisions, including software that displayed important statistics (such as the relevant altgenres and other classifications) for every title in baseball card-style summaries, and a tool that rated the audience appeal of niche character actors.Smallwood, who left Netflix in 2021, said that nothing was enforced on the basis of data alone. “With content executives, our team’s goal was to enhance the creative process – not to replace it. We wanted them to consider what the data and algorithms suggested, even if they rejected it,” she said. When I talked to creatives, it was striking that persuasion rather than coercion seemed to be Netflix’s modus operandi. Almost all the people working with streaming companies I spoke to said they were surprised by how little raw data they were given. During the making of films in particular, the note-giving process remained largely as it has always been, rooted in executive intuition.View image in fullscreenMillie Bobby Brown (centre) and Chris Pratt (right) in The Electric State.Photograph: NetflixThe company does issue house style guides, very probably influenced by data at some level. Some of these guides are narrative-related, like the pitch workshop one, which has a pretty generic set of screenwriting rules, like “Who is the hero, and what do they want?” and “The location should be a character in your story”. (Nothing so egregious as insisting characters announce what they’re doing.) Sometimes these address aesthetic matters: a producer who has worked on one of the company’s recent hit shows mentions a stipulation to ape the chilly David Fincher look. Yellow is apparently a resonant, usefully non-gendered colour when conceiving children’s programmes, following in the Day-Glo wake of SpongeBob and the Minions.The most tangible data film-makers receive comes in the form of periodic performance reviews – three, 10, 30 days after release – practised by Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Often this consists of figures on viewership and completion rates; some people find this nebulous compared to box office revenue, the performance metric traditionally used by studios. There’s also Netflix Preview Club which, unlike the performance reviews, allows pre-release tweaks to be made. The Preview Club is an early-access section for invited viewers, and combines up-to-date monitoring of how viewers interact with a piece of entertainment with more traditional focus group-type questioning. But it’s not clear how much of this research film-makers themselves are privy to. Several tell me that it would have been helpful, as they made final post-production changes, to have had more granular data on audience reactions.Often, what film-makers and executives told me about the streamers’ approach to data didn’t sound so different from the old Hollywood studio production-line mentality. Studios have always sought a rationalised and repeatable formula for success, from the typecasting of actors during the Golden Age to proscriptive screenwriting manuals like Syd Field’s Screenplay and Blake Snyder’s Save the Cat during the conglomerate era, and rigorous test screening. Script analysis software in the 2000s, like Epagogix and ScriptBook, tried to predict box office success based on story tropes and the personnel attached to projects; these were prototypic versions of what the streaming companies are doing now. If algorithms are a fixed set of steps leading to a controllable outcome, then the earlier development process, trying to line up the ducks of storytelling in the right order, was also algorithmic in a crude sense.In fact, more data has just intensified old-school Hollywood problems, such as how to get film-makers, and even the streaming companies’ own creative executives, to trust it to guide artistic matters. Part of the problem is agreeing how to usefully interpret the swirl of data. The different metrics, and the importance assigned to them, changed constantly, said a former Netflix film executive. “I had more managers than I could count, and the success metrics changed just as often. You can have all the metrics you want but that does not mean you are making better decisions or creating more loved content.” Executives can also selectively interpret data to stack the deck in favour of their own projects, said a producer who has overseen a slate of films for Netflix. In its external PR, the company advertises the uniqueness and sophistication of its algorithm; internally, however, people are still trying to realise their own preferences and passions. “And they leverage the algorithm for that,” the producer said.View image in fullscreenCaitlin Smallwood.Photograph: Timothy ArchibaldAnd film-makers and executives alike know the truth: when it comes to assessing the probable success of a title, data can only do so much.Netflix is diligent about predicting how titles will perform on the platform, regularly reviewing the accuracy of its forecasts and subsequently updating the models. But many major hits, such as The Queen’s Gambit and Squid Game, were a complete surprise. William Goldman’s famous maxim about Hollywood – “Nobody knows anything” – still holds.But if Netflix doesn’t burden film-makers with data, and if there’s no consensus about how to interpret what little data they do see, then what’s responsible for all the familiar-feeling, paint-by-numbers content that’s crowding your screen?One answer is that the data is in fact making decisions, just at an earlier stage in the process: it determines what does and doesn’t get commissioned. Film-makers are unlikely to be aware whether their project was greenlit or turned down on the basis of what data or algorithms said about it. But I spoke to one agent who told me that, at one major studio, creative executives have been excluded from the greenlighting committee so as not to skew the decision-making process with old-fashioned artistic frippery.Others in the industry have different explanations for the glut of algorithm movies. Producer Neal Dodson, whose 2019 thriller Triple Frontier was a Netflix Original, thinks that executives aren’t paying too much attention to the swirl and confusion of data; they’re merely choosing to play it safe. “They wanna make great movies, but they don’t wanna get fired,” Dodson said. “They’re afraid if they do something a little too risky, they’ll get fired. But if they don’t do anything risky enough, people say they didn’t make good movies. It’s a rock and a hard place.” Maybe this conservatism – hardly unusual for Hollywood executives – is what has fuelled the algorithm movie, rather than anything truly algorithmic.There’s a certain irony to still being beholden to the restricted thinking of the analogue era, said another former Netflix film executive: “I used to joke that, because of the acceleration of everything, Netflix had gone from being a very new media company to quite an old-fashioned media company quicker than ever before.”Another reason for tired, samey content could be the lack of oversight that characterised Netflix’s growth phase in the late 2010s. Before that, it had supported auteurs who were struggling to get backing from Hollywood studios; this brought the company the likes of Bong Joon-ho’s eco-terrorism action-adventure Okja, Alfonso Cuarón’s memoir-drama Roma, and Martin Scorsese’s long-gestating crime epic The Irishman.View image in fullscreenStephen Graham and Al Linea (l-r, centre) in The Irishman.Photograph: Album/AlamyBut around 2016, Netflix decided to change its approach. It flooded the platform with content, bankrolled by issuing debt (up from around $500m in 2013 to nearly $13bn in 2019). It scrabbled to deliver enough movies and TV shows to its expanding subscriber base;South Park ribbed the companyin one episode, by having its executives answer the phone: “Netflix, you’re greenlit. Who am I speaking with?”A producer of an independent movie, who received more than $10m in funding from Netflix, said he was given no notes during shooting, and the company’s executives did not watch the dailies. “They basically wired us the money; my impression was I shouldn’t call them unless there was a house on fire. They have more money than any studio ever maybe, but they couldn’t stay on top of all their films. You can’t scale that quickly.” Many other film-makers I spoke to similarly claimed that Netflix largely gave them a free hand.This producer believes the lack of rigour and the lack of experienced film executives during the company’s expansion phase hurt its quality control. On the one hand, this phase allowed the creation of left-field or brilliant works like Okja, the erratic art-world satire Velvet Buzzsaw, and Charlie Kaufman’s I’m Thinking of Ending Things. On the other, it allowed reams of landfill titles with generic plots and shooting styles to pile up on the platform.Netflix’s expansion era came to a sudden end in spring 2022. The explosive, pandemic-driven subscriber growth of 2020 – when Netflix added 37 million new members – had petered out, and in the last quarter of 2021 and the first of 2022, it lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Wall Street responded: the company’s share price dropped 57% on a single day.This caused a crisis of confidence within Netflix. The company capped its content budget at $17bn a year, ending the precipitous annual rises of the previous few years. The blank-cheque policy for big-name directors was also cancelled (romcom queen Nancy Meyers’ $150m-budgeted comeback Paris Paramount was scrapped, for example).View image in fullscreenDan Lin.Photograph: Steve Granitz/FilmMagicAfter Netflix introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier in 2022 and clamped down on password sharing the following year, subscriber numbers started climbing again. But the company is still trying to run a tighter ship. It appointed the seasoned Warner Bros executive Dan Lin as its new head of film in February 2024; according to the Hollywood Reporter, he got the job on the basis of telling the company “the movies were not great and the financials didn’t add up”. It’s too early in his tenure to judge him on his film output, but the expectation is that he will clamp down on quantity and budgets, while trying to bolster quality.This approach is compatible with what Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer, called the company’s “gourmet cheeseburger” model – offering viewers familiar-feeling, mass-market products with upmarket production values. Spread-betting on an inoffensive mainstream, rather than riskily hunting down artistic excellence, is better for sustaining subscriber numbers. People might be drawn to a platform by a single standout title, but they remain on it when they know there will be a steady supply of good-enough titles.As Steven Soderbergh told Vulture: “The entire industry has moved from a world of Newtonian economics into a world of quantum economics, where two things that seem to be in opposition can be true at the same time: you can have a massive hit on your platform, but it’s not actually doing anything to increase your platform’s revenue.” A film’s success is no longer solely defined by its box office performance; stuck inside a single streaming platform, it has been walled off from hard financial realities. Netflix’s slippery viewing metrics have encouraged this disconnect. It used to define a “view” as watching 70% of a movie. In January 2020, the company decided that watching two minutes was enough to qualify. Now, it calculates the number of views for a film or TV show by the total number of viewing hours logged by all users for a title, divided by its run time (so as not to disadvantage shorter titles); better, but still a smeary average.Certain film-makers – like David Fincher, who is contracted to Netflix – see artistic liberty in throwing off the shackles of the box office. Others see this new lack of accountability as drifting ever further towards algorithmic blandness. “The best thing you can do if your business goal is limited to audience acquisition is to get everybody to watch the same thing,” said Ted Hope. Because even if you have that strategy of a regular cadence of supply, you know that what increases engagement is more people talking about the same thing.”There was once a notion that streaming companies – facilitated by infinite server space and bottomless catalogues – would find new audiences for more obscure film titles. But in an analysis of Netflix viewing data between 2016 and 2019, independent researcher Stephen Follows found that the company was even more reliant on a handful of big titles than theatrical box office: the top 7% of Netflix titles in the US accounted for 50% of views (compared to 41% of box-office takings for the top 7% of cinema titles).It isn’t so much that movies are being made by algorithm as that, by continually surfacing the mass-market or safe choice, the algorithm itself has a flattening, coarsening effect on our overall tastes. It’s intriguing that while the majority of Netflix collaborators interviewed for this piece praised their individual creative experience, most also expressed concern about how algorithms may be homogenising culture on a wider scale. “It is a fear of mine,” said the director of a major Netflix blockbuster. “There’s this constant balance that we’re trying to find with technology. Algorithms can be incredibly useful when you want a suggestion for what to watch. And they can also be madly infuriating and the stifler of originality and creativity. Both can be true.”Netflix, or at least some of its former employees, are aware of the issue. Smallwood said that her greatest challenge was how to lead viewers into the deeper catalogue and avoid offering them only variations on what they’ve already watched. “We intentionally injected variety into people’s personalised pages,” she said. “As if we’re sprinkling in a few items that are not at the very top of the algorithm’s list.” (The company has recently filed patents for innovations to this effect.) It even experimented with different ways that viewers could express their preferences in order to shape what they’re shown. But “consumers don’t want to have to work hard to find what to watch,” said Smallwood. “They just want the right thing served up to them.”Not only do streaming companies have no incentive to promote diversity in the industry, said Ted Hope, but they have also destroyed the broader business model that makes diversity possible. When Netflix or another streaming service buys a film, it effectively demands that it becomes the single distributor worldwide; this model innately favours mass-market work that will travel widely. It has also rendered obsolete the old piecemeal tactic of pre-selling distribution rights in individual territories, which was often how independent films cobbled together their budgets.View image in fullscreenRyan Reynolds, Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson in Red Notice.Photograph: Frank Masi/NetflixThe trade analyst Tansy Kelly Robson pointed out that before the streaming era, even the traditional studios were incentivised to take on some more offbeat films. Though such titles had uncertain box office value, studios could generate revenue from them by reselling them to TV networks. But with the streaming companies’ films corralled inside their own platforms, the newcomers have little reason to make adventurous work with value elsewhere. If they need to shake up their catalogue, they can cherrypick maverick indie work that performed well in cinemas or at festivals – without taking on the financial risk of developing them.Robson noted that a prominent film might bring subscribers to a platform, “but it’s hard to tell if that’s [because of] the show or another extraneous factor, and cost per viewer makes it, essentially, a loss-leader”. That is quite possibly the case not only for more unusual offerings, but also for expensive algorithm movie misses like The Electric State. But it seems that what Netflix is doing is working – and that Wall Street is convinced for now. Since April 2022, its stock prices have steadily risen. Customers and shareholders seem happy enough with the platform’s never-ending carousel of forgettable offerings.Netflix may be back on track, but the algorithm movie as we know it is about to be super-charged by the next generation of automation: AI. The technology, by its nature, plunders the creativity of the past. For the film industry’s purposes, its training data will include scripts, footage, soundtracks, editing patterns, special effects work, every conceivable domain of labour from Hollywood’s last 125 years. Auto-generating all of these using AI will cost a fraction of doing them for real. But the gains in productivity and efficiency will come at the cost of further entrenching the algorithmic approach to creativity.AI is already being used on the fringes of films. Netflix used generative AI to insert CGI characters into some shots in The Electric State and also to create a sequence of a collapsing building in the Argentinian sci-fi series El Eternauta. Amazon also used the technology for visual effects work in its biblical series House of David. But such examples are far from generating a film or TV series from scratch.Todd Yellin believes ChatGPT is capable of writing a cookie-cutter Christmas movie now – but the potential blowback for trampling on human artistry wouldn’t be worth the risk. Most interviewees I canvassed think we are still some years away from AI producing a boundary-pushing script.The streaming firms already auto-generate artwork and trailers, personalised for each subscriber. If, say, Good Will Hunting appears on the feed of an inveterate romcom watcher, their thumbnail image for the film would feature Matt Damon and Minnie Driver getting cosy; for a user who prefers comedies, Robin Williams would feature. For Yellin, this kind of use of AI remains on the right side of the line: “An important distinction artistically and perhaps ethically is between using algorithms and generative AI to create a movie or TV show versus using them to create a promotional piece of content.”But it’s hard to believe that the streamers will stop there. Stephen Follows recently conducted a survey of patents being filed by Netflix and Amazon Prime Video; among the former’s 500 filings are machine learning-based tools for editing and visual effects, while the latter has filed more than 7,000 patents in similar areas. Its innovations span every area from script analysis, to automated storyboarding, to synthetic audience simulation in which to test key concepts, to “emotion monitoring” that can track viewer responses in real time.The strange paradox of the streaming era is that as the quest to personalise entertainment has continued, entertainment itself is becoming steadily more impersonal. The user, and the fantasy of unlimited choice, is king. The auteur, and singularity of perspective, are now subordinate – and the tsunami of AI threatens to wash them away completely.‘Feasting on fantasy’: my month of extreme immersion in Disney+Read moreYellin is still trying to reconcile the industry’s turn to optimised content with his passion for art that has personality. He quit Netflix at the end of 2022 to return to his first love, directing. He co-wrote and directed The 52nd State, a crime story about a Costa Rican IT worker laid off by Hewlett-Packard who gets embroiled in a scam. It finally started shooting this summer. But, returning to a radically altered film-making landscape, Yellin was taken aback at how difficult it now is to raise financing for an indie. “It’s been a hard road. The model for making an independent film has shifted,” he admitted. “Many companies have stepped away from pre-financing independent films. Why put up the risk to fund them ahead of time, when they can pick the ones they want out of the litter later?”Why indeed? Luckily, he still had his connections, and his old friend, the Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, stepped in to bolster the project as executive producer; his first foray into film production. The billionaire tech mogul brings in the cavalry for beleaguered indie film: how’s that for an algorithmically neat third-act plot twist?Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readNetflixTV streamingTelevisionMillie Bobby BrownDwayne Johnson (The Rock)Ryan ReynoldsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today those same waters flow more slowly, more sparsely: once-teeming channels now show only the barest traces of what was here.Determined to reverse that collapse, the Somerset Eel Recovery Project is weaving together science, folklore and community creativity to bring back not only the eel but a lost sense of local identity.Its mission is both ecological and emotional: to help restore a critically endangered species while reviving the human stories, songs and names that once made Somerset an eel country.Vanessa Becker-Hughes, one of the project’s founders, has built partnerships across science, policy and the arts. She runs a growing school programme – 60 eel tanks were installed in local classrooms last year – as well as storytelling events, traditional rope-making workshops and citizen science efforts that test for eel DNA in rivers. “I try to come at it from different angles,” she said. “Sometimes we do science, sometimes we do a river blessing. But it’s all about connection.”View image in fullscreenThe Somerset Eel Recovery Project releasing eels into the River Brue near Glastonbury.Photograph: Somerset Eel Recovery ProjectThe project has attracted high-profile supporters. Feargal Sharkey, the former Undertones singer turned clean water campaigner, has amplified the project’s efforts online, calling it “a vital act of ecological and cultural restoration”.The celebrity chef and sustainability advocate Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recently became an official “eel legend” – the tongue-in-cheek name given to some fundraisers who help pay for habitat work and education.“Eels have fascinated me for a long time,” he said. “I have gone from poacher to gamekeeper: cooking them to realising how important it is to protect these extraordinary, charismatic creatures. They are a keystone species with a remarkable natural history, that deserves our respect and our custodianship.”Across Europe, the population of the European eel has dropped by more than 90% since the 1970s. Between 1980 and 2009, eel numbers in Somerset’s Bridgwater Bay – once a thriving gateway for glass eels – dropped by 99%.The causes are multiple and connected: overfishing, pollution, hydrological infrastructure blocking migration, climate-driven shifts and the spread of a parasitic nematode damaging the eels’ swim bladders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She believes that rebuilding our lost relationship with eels means rekindling communal memory through shared rituals and skills.“We make straw ropes, which we put over barriers. They get wet and the little glass eels use them to climb up and over. But more than that – it gets people to visit these weirs. They notice the water. They count the eels. They start to care,” she said.Andrew Kerr, the chair of the Sustainable Eel Group, says eels once shaped placenames, customs and livelihoods. He believes it is crucial that we rebuild our lost relationship with them. “If we lose the eel, we lose a sense of our identity. We forget the songs. We forget what this landscape was,” he said.Becker-Hughes said all is not yet lost. “Each spring tide still brings new arrivals,” she said. “The eel is not just a ghost of the past – it is a key to unlocking something vital in the present.”With every story told, every rope woven and every child watching a glass eel wriggle up a straw ladder, she believes, a small restoration of species, memory and care takes place.Explore more on these topicsSomersetMarine lifeFishRiversAnimalsWildlifeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The GuardianCaro Giles had to home-educate three of her four daughters when they grew so distressed at the prospect of school that they made themselves ill. Why is our approach to education failing so many young people?ByPatrick BarkhamThu 28 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 05.08 EDTShareThere are things Caro Giles will never be able to forget. The moment when Emmie, her “shiny bookworm” of a daughter, crouched “wide-eyed with terror” in the footwell of the car to avoid going to school. Or when another daughter ripped out her eyelashes in distress. Or when she had to carry her eldest, Matilda, then 11, out of the house because she was so scared to go outside.These behaviours, Giles believes, were predominantly caused by the experience and prospect of school. Giles, a single mother of four daughters, watched as Matilda endured a miserable two years in primary school before withdrawing her – making her “electively home-educated” in official jargon. Ada, her second eldest, was mostly home-schooled until 2018, when Giles’s marriage ended and her children had to return to school so she could work more. Emmie, her third daughter, struggled on in primary until 2022 when she became “very ill”. At 10, she had stopped speaking because she found it so challenging to attend lessons. “I feel horrid about my learning,” she once typed into Giles’ phone. When her youngest, Tess, who started primary in 2019, showed similar distress around school, Giles acted quickly to remove her in early 2023.It’s been in no way a lifestyle choice. It has been me trying my best to listen to the individual needs of each childIt left Giles, somehow, having to run their household, try to earn a living and educate three of her four daughters – Emmie, Tess and Matilda (not their real names) – at home. Unschooled, Giles’ memoir of the last three years, is a barnstorming critique of today’s school system. She writes as a mother but also as a teacher who has worked in primary, secondary and special schools.“The schools system isn’t working for a lot of children,” says Giles when we meet in Glasgow, her family’s new home. She trained as an actor, retrained as a teacher in her 20s and taught at an inner London state primary. Later, when she and her family moved to Northumberland, she worked in a social, emotional and mental health school for eight years, around having children. She began blogging about her family life in 2013; her first memoir,Twelve Moons, was published a decade later, combining nature writing about her family’s coastal adventures with “an attempt to write myself back on to the page, having got lost among all the mothering and inside my marriage,” she says. Giles writes personally onInstagramandSubstackbut guards her children’s privacy and gives them pseudonyms.Giles’ own education in Devon and Yorkshire state schools in the 1980s and 90s was straightforward, and she expected the same for her kids. Instead, she found school’s impact on her daughters led to hundreds of appointments with support workers, school nurses, speech and language therapists, psychologists, physiotherapists and psychiatrists. These occasionally helped, but “often harmed”, she says.She argues she had no choice but for three of her daughters to join the111,700 children in England who are home-educated; according to the NSPCC, the number of families home-educating their children hasmore than doubledover the past five years. “It’s been in no way a lifestyle choice. It has been me trying my best to listen to the individual needs of each child,” Giles says. Matilda was diagnosed as autistic in 2019; by then, she was so unwell that she required psychiatric help. Emmie obtained a diagnosis a few years later. As every parent of an autistic child knows, getting a diagnosis – the first step towards finding appropriate help – is slow and fraught.View image in fullscreenOne of Giles’ daughters working at home.Photograph: courtesy of Carol GilesWhen they were younger, a typical day of home-educating Matilda, Emmie and Tess involved board games, jigsaws, dressing up and role-playing, as well as creative project-based working, where Giles could meet the requirements of different ages and abilities in a single activity. There were online worksheets for those who thrived on more formal learning, too. Often, her children’s needs clashed: Tess benefited from letting off energy outdoors, whereas Emmie didn’t feel safe outside the house. “I’ve tried to not sugar-coat it,” says Giles. “Often there was a joyful chaos.”After nearly three years of struggle, she scored a small success when she was granted a personal budget from the local authority to fund Matilda’s and then Emmie’s learning at home. In 2023, just 2,305 children in England were awarded such budgets–which are available for children with special educational needs who have an education, health and care plan.However, she found that the price of getting that support was high. “You have to demonstrate such distress within a school environment in order to get the money, which puts off many people from applying for anything.” Her biggest regret is trying to put Matilda back into high school, and keeping her and Emmie inside the school system for so long. “I wish I hadn’t, but that’s with the benefit of hindsight. I was on my own and I really needed some support.”View image in fullscreenCooking lessons.Photograph: courtesy of Carol GilesUnschooled, says Giles, “is not a school-bashing exercise”. Instead, it is a “plea for conversation and for listening”. To understand how and whyalmost 20% of pupils in Englandwere “persistently absent” from school in 2023-24, missing more than 10% of lessons, perhaps it’s better to think more broadly about the system itself. “Schools can be great but they’re just not great for everyone,” says Giles. In her own family, the “appalling failure of the system” has led to “chronically unwell children and me struggling to hold on to my own health and identity”.“School is seen as the holy grail,” she says. “We always want children to demonstrate success, which we’ve decided in schools is a written exam or coursework. We’re obsessed with measuring everything. We don’t think that success can be an intrinsic thing – a child thriving. We need to change what success is.”Her daughter Ada is finding success at school. She is “very focused, very ambitious, very academic”. However, Giles worries that Ada’s childhood is “racing by in a blur of revision and comparison. We’re not teaching our children to be independent thinkers,” she says. “We’re all just learning the same thing – and our brains are all different, so it seems mad.”What would Giles’ ideal schooling look like? Teachers and local authority staff would be “properly trained” to understand autism.Schoolswould follow a skills-based approach rather than cramming knowledge, with less reliance on testing. There would be project-based learning throughout secondary school, allowing pupils to take “a deep dive into a project they’re passionate about”. And there would be provision for flexi-schooling, whereby children are permitted to attend school part-time and can attend an alternative setting (such as a forest school) or be home-schooled for part of the week. Some children can only tolerate the “very challenging sensory environment” of 30-plus pupils in a small classroom “for a period of time and then need time to regulate,” she says. “Flexi-schooling would be a good answer for so many children. It would keep them in school for longer and keep the community around the family for longer, rather than being forced to drop out completely.”Instead of blaming children or parents for non-attendance, we could also ask: what are schools missing out on by failing to accommodate diverse young brains? One of the heroes in Unschooled is the primary school headteacher who tries very hard to help Giles’ autistic children. “She said: ‘These kind of children bring so much to other children’s lives. If you have a child who is autistic or a young carer who doesn’t conform completely, that difference is such an asset to a classroom, helping other children grow and be more accepting.’”View image in fullscreenGiles: ‘We’re all people who need to do things differently.’Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The GuardianGiles is not, however, arguing that everyone should be accommodated in a mainstream school. “It’s not about saying that some are mainstream and some are special people. It’s about saying: we’re all people who need to do things differently. The othering has to stop. We could have more schools that meet different needs, but they must not be seen as something less than a mainstream school, or that you have to attend a mainstream school and break in order to access them.”I find villains in Giles’ story, too: staff at the local authority who don’t reply to emails for weeks or who nitpick home-schooling plans in Zoom meetings. For instance, Giles’ request for funding for an iPad as well as a laptop for Emmie was refused, even though her psychologist had recommended that she use an iPad to help her communicate. (She was eventually given an iPad but not a laptop for her studies.)“I hope that I didn’t unnecessarily paint any individuals as villains, but certainly the system feels very adversarial and very aggressive,” she says. “I found it hard to find humanity. They haven’t got the finances to give people what they obviously need. The system is the villain.”For anyone suspicious of “life-writing” in the wake of the scandal overalleged omissions and untruths in Raynor Winn’s The Salt Path, Unschooled does not reach a neat, upbeat conclusion. “Even though our day-to-day life has always been sprinkled with joyful moments and as a family we’re very tight, it was important not to do the ‘happy ending’, because there hasn’t been a happy ending for us,” says Giles. “There’s just been a really thorny path that we’ve tried to find our way through.”Perhaps they are through the thorniest section. She and her children have made a fresh start this summer, moving to a rented flat in Glasgow, closer to Giles’ new boyfriend and other friends. She hopes relocating from countryside to city will meet the children’s changing needs as they grow older. “I was reaching a point of burnout in terms of how long I could keep holding everything together on my own. I had to make a change in order to save myself and stay strong enough to be able to keep saving the kids.”View image in fullscreenA marine biology lesson at the beach.Photograph: courtesy of Caro GilesThe new term has begun brightly. Ada, now 15, is settling well into a new school, while Tess, 10, who loves Star Wars and fashion design, has returned to full-time classes in school with enthusiasm. “The school run has been a delight so far up here, and that is exciting,” smiles Giles. “It’s lovely that they come out and have lots to talk about.”At home, Matilda, 18, is finishing her online learning, a Level 3 qualification in art and textiles and an extended personal qualification that is the equivalent of two-and-a-half A-levels and will get her to uni if she chooses. Emmie, 13, is talking more, smiling “in a genuine way” and planning a project about trees. Just the fact that she wants to learn is heartening for Giles, who will restart her fight to fund Emmie’s home-education in Scotland. Emmie has also made a chart to record how far she swims in the local pool. She wants to clock up the length of the Clyde.Each chapter title in Unschooled is a phrase from Emmie, who wants to be a writer, too. One particularly fits her family’s new and changing life: I will try to take it slowly.Unschooled: The Story of a Family That Doesn’t Fit In, by Caro Giles, is published by Little Toller on 2 September (£20).

What idea or question has haunted you the longest?RemyNaylorWho’s up there. He’d better show himself shortly, because we’re getting into a terrible mess down here. I mean, we are the fucking plague, 7.5 billion people, we can’t handle the planet. As you get older, you do wonder: is it going to be a guy with a long beard and long, flowing white robes, or is it just going to be a void? I don’t dwell on it. It’s weird. I feel like I’m still 21. It’s odd and strange.Did you score a lifetime’s supply of bread for directing the Hovis adverts back in the 70s?TeeDubyaBeeNo. But I ate enough Hovis as a kid in Stockton-on-Tees, with cherry jam and butter, toasted – holy shit. I did five Hovis commercials. They were all classics. The most famous is the boy walking up the hill. The first one I shot up near Halifax, in a mining town. Oddly enough, I might go back up there to do my next movie, which is a war movie [Battle of Britain], so I’m well versed in the area.View image in fullscreenScott’s 1973 advert for Hovis.Photograph: PAIt’s incredible that you are still at the top of your game at 87. How has age affected your approach to film-making?grimesy76What happens – providing you sustain all your marbles – is that you refine your game. I can now work eight to 11 cameras. I finished my latest film in 34 days. It would normally be 60. Gladiator was 48; normally, 100. I’ve learned to formulate and predetermine, plan on paper and storyboard in my head. That’s why it’s so efficient.My game was tennis. I’ve just had my final knee replacement. I did one in 2012 and the other last week. So that’s the end of tennis. But like any game, the more you practise, the better you get. Forty years of tennis, I became quite good. If I hadn’t played tennis, I’d be a 300lb [136kg] couch potato.Every time I drive back up to Redcar in Yorkshire to visit relatives, I can’t help but notice how Roseberry Topping Hill resembles the dome-like structure on LV-223 in Prometheus. Do you add touches like this for your own amusement?magbearsonRoseberry Topping Hill was our favourite walk. It tickles me that it’s called Roseberry Topping. I used to have a country house in the Cotswolds. It was beautiful, but it was always fucking raining. It was probably built in the 1600s. We’d live by candlelight and I loved all that. I bought it for 72 grand. You couldn’t repair your garage for 72 grand today. But the kids no longer wanted to play ponies and shit like that, so I sold it.View image in fullscreenPrometheus, 2012.Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/AlamyI missed the countryside, so I bought a teeny-weeny vineyard in France 30 years ago. In one corner, there’s a hill. I thought: “Fuck me, that looks just like Roseberry Topping.” I don’t advise taking up wine growing as a career, though. No one fucking drinks any more. My ambition is just to break even.You once told the Hollywood Reporter that your favourite film is Muriel’s Wedding. Can you explain why?Sjp15991I was being cheeky, but I loved it to death, because I love the idea of the two women who are constantly optimistic. And I have to admit, I quite like Abba. I sing Abba in the bathroom still.The Final Cut is, without a doubt, the perfect version of Blade Runner. What would you say to people who defend the theatrical cut?TheManWithoutFearI think they all had their day. The most disappointing thing I learned is that you have to be your own critic. I’ve never read another critique since. The big critic at the time,Pauline Kael,destroyed me in four pages in the New Yorker. She said: he may have a weak jaw, that’s why he’s got a beard. She’d never even met me! I framed the pages and they are still in my office. I glance at them occasionally and go: “Fuck you, Pauline.”View image in fullscreenScott and Paul Mescal on the set of Gladiator II.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/APYour father was in the military. Did he ever disapprove of you wanting to be an art student?JagomanNo. My dad, at the end of the second world war, was an acting brigadier general. He said to me: “Ridley, the army has absolutely nothing to teach you. You’re terrible academically” – I got D, D, C, E, E, E, D, but an A+ at art – “go to art school.” I’ll never forget my art teacher at Grangefield grammar school – Mr Cleeland. He was one of the new-age teachers who came in with long hair and who everyone said was weird, but he was a great guy.How close did you get to designing the Daleks on Doctor Who?badrobot2I was a very good designer. I was in an office, sharing with a guy called Ray Cusick. Verity Lambert was the producer. Ray said: “What do you think?” I said: “They look like inverted dust cans. I think they look fucking terrible.” He said: “That’s what I think. But that’s what she wants.” Guess what? They’re still here today.Will there be a third Alien prequel and a Gladiator 3?petewinfandbozo500Gladiator is in process right now. Another Alien prequel – yeah, if I get an idea, for sure.Were you really considering directing Terminator 3?bozo500I’m proud about this. I turned down a $20m fee. See, I can’t be bought, dude. Someone said: “Ask what Arnie gets.” I thought: “I’ll try it out.” I said: “I want what Arnie gets.” When they said yes, I thought: “Fuck me.” But I couldn’t do it. It’s not my thing. It’s like doing a Bond movie. The essence of a Bond movie is fun and camp. Terminator is pure comic strip. I would try to make it real. That’s why they’ve never asked me to do a Bond movie, because I could fuck it up.View image in fullscreenHarrison Ford administers the Voight-Kampff test in Blade Runner, 1982.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyHave you taken the Voight-Kampff [diagnostic empathy] test from Blade Runner yourself?Sagarmatha1953Isn’t that machine great? Some bastard stole it from the set. When it appears on the market, I’m going to go after them like a rat up a drainpipe. I never used to take things. I’d think: “I’m done, move on.” Now, I realise I should, because they go into storerooms and get lost for ever. I get permission to take things and put space suits from movies in my vineyard in France. I’ve got a space suit from The Martian. I’ve got an original space suit from Alien. Can you imagine what that’s worth? Two from Prometheus. They’re all in my barrel room, which has 12,000 sq ft [1,115 sq metres]of barrels. It’s the perfect temperature for the wine. It’s also a perfect place for a museum. Go down to Avignon – the vineyard is 20 minutes from my house – and have a look. It’s fantastic.I love the press junkets and interviews where you tell interviewers to “go fuck themselves”. Do you swear more now than you did when you were, say, 50?Chin_Of_TarantinoandBicuserNo. I was much worse in my 50s. How many times have I sworn in this interview? Ten? Twenty? Some are so satisfying, like: what thefuckdo you think you’re doing? Swearingis a sign of intelligence? Are you taking the mickey out of me? No?

I bought her present similarly early, though I am unsure whether to wrap it. When the Amazon guy delivers a gift from my sister on the day, he wishes Mabel “happy birthday” through the gate. As I sing the opening bars, the build-up has clearly worked: she jumps up with excitement and licks my knees. I should clarify at this point that Mabel is not my child – she’s a cocker spaniel.View image in fullscreenFrances’s dog, Mabel.If this sounds unhinged, I’d like to stress it’s statistically very normal, actually. “Pet birthdays” area booming market, with the UK industry alone now worth an estimated £1.7bn. Arecent surveyby Moonpig found 64% of pet owners in the UK celebrate their pets’ birthdays, with as many as 83% of gen Z embracing gourmet treats or even themed parties.Karl Marx might have called pet birthdays the last stage of capitalism, where corporations convince people to spend their squeezed wages on cards for species who can’t read. The growth of social media has undoubtedly encouraged the trend. If a cat has a birthday and no one’s around to see the TikTok, does it make a meowing sound?As I ate a celebratory slice of chocolate torte that was poisonous to dogs, I wondered whether Mabel’s special day had somehow become not about Mabel at all. Perhaps it is pointless to mark the birthday of a pet who doesn’t know what a birthday is. But then, parents spend hundreds on gifts for one-year-old children who only want to play with the boxes.Petsare a part of our families, too, so shouldn’t that include celebrating their milestones? Next year, I’ll compromise: spend less on the dog’s present, but let her eat the paper.Explore more on these topicsPetsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But figures for 2024-25 released by the UK Health Security Agency on Thursday show that no childhood vaccine has met this requirement.Only 83.7% of five-year-olds have received both doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, while uptake of the four-in-one preschool booster vaccine – which protects against polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria – stood at 81.4% among five-year-olds in England.The low uptake rates have prompted fears that children will be more vulnerable to infectious diseases as they begin primary school in September. The government has urged parents to make sure their children are up to date with their vaccines.In Julya child died in Liverpool after contractingmeasles, the first such death in the UK in a decade. Only 73% of children in Liverpool have received the necessary two shots to protect against measles.Prof Helen Bedford, from the UCL Institute of ChildHealth, said: “The country is facing a serious wake-up call, because if we continue down this path we’re going to see many more children unwell and we’re going to see more deaths.“Measles, among these other diseases, is incredibly infectious and to keep the disease at bay we really do need much higher levels of uptake than what we’re seeing at the moment.”Graph of regional uptake of MMR vaccine in EnglandShe added: “The other big problem [for vaccine uptake] is that there are vast inequalities in uptake. We know that uptake is also lower among some ethnic minority groups, notably black Caribbean and African populations.”The data reveals stark regional inequalities. While more than 90% of five-year-olds in the north-east of England received both doses of the MMR vaccine, only seven in 10 (69.6%) of eligible Londoners had received the same. Meanwhile, regional uptake of the four-in-one booster ranged from 88.9% in the north-east of the country to 63.8% in London.London’s mobile population is a significant reason for its low uptake, according to Bea Taylor, a senior fellow at the Nuffield Trust. “Parents and carers in the capital are more likely to face barriers including having to move house regularly, which can make it difficult to stay registered with a local GP and receive reminders about vaccinations,” she said.Prof Kate Pickett, an academic co-director at Health Equity North, said it was “clear there are still challenges to overcome to address regional disparities in child vaccination rates”.Graph showing decline of MMR uptakeThe UK is the worst of the G7 nations regarding MMR vaccination uptake, according to the WHO: as of 2024 only89% of children had received their first MMR jab. Globally, millions of children are at risk of lethal diseases owing to vaccine coverage having stalled or reversed, according tothe largest study of its kind.Dr Helen Skirrow, a clinical research fellow at Imperial College London’s School of Public Health, said: “Declining vaccine uptake is very worrying, as without reversing this trend and achieving sufficient herd immunity the increasing measles outbreaks we have seen over recent years could continue. It is a public health imperative that more children get vaccinated with the recommended two doses of MMR vaccine in order to be protected.”On Friday, the government announced a new vaccination programme for chickenpox from January, meaning that GPs will offer eligible children a combined vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella – the clinical term for chickenpox – as part of the routine infant vaccination schedule.Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, said: “Too many children are starting primary school without complete protection against preventable and potentially serious illnesses like measles, whooping cough and mumps.“Vaccines save thousands of lives every year and prevent countless hospital admissions. I urge all parents to check their child’s vaccination record and contact their GP practice if any jabs are missing.”Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationEnglandChildrenWorld Health OrganizationHealthMMRPrimary schoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why the diversity and equality and inclusion strategies and the focus on it are so important.“Because the lines that are being trotted out around ‘we should treat everybody equally’ – yeah, we should. Everybody should experience the same quality of service from policing or the public sector, but unfortunately they don’t.“And to level up that confidence gap, that difference in service, you have to have some dedicated resources to do that, both inside the organisation, focusing internally on your culture, and externally.“To say that you can … lessen that confidence gap, to say that you can make sure that everybody is experiencing the same quality of service without some dedicated resources to do it is just ludicrous.”Kennedy’s retirement from policing, leaves her free to voice not just her concerns, but also those of other senior figures concerned by intense attacks on policing by rightwing political figures.She said political attacks on diversity and inclusion, and groups targeting asylum hotels, were causing problems on the streets and for her workforce, leaving some people frightened:“Seeing the disorder that’s out on the streets, some of the narrative coming out around immigration status, colour of your skin, it must be really frightening out there, in our communities, but also for our own workforce.“So I do think we’re on a bit of a tipping point at this moment, and I think we need to work really hard not to go backwards.”The toughest challenge in her four years as chief was the July 2024 murder of three schoolgirls, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine,after a man burst into a Southport dance class and stabbed several children.The next day a vigil to commemorate those murdered was soon followed in the Merseyside town byriots that spread across the countryand were the worst in more than a decade.Kennedy said there was a far-right and organised element. “The officers on the ground report that there was carfuls of people turning up and being dropped off … There was an element of organisation for that. So those numbers swelled very quickly … Within 25 minutes of the vigil ending, the first missiles were thrown at the mosque.”Kennedy said claims those taking to the street were typical of white working-class anger were contradicted by the fact that white working-class people turned out in greater numbers to repair the attacked mosque and clear up.In the aftermath of the murders there was a rapid and deliberate spread of false information, designed to whip up trouble, falsely claiming the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. Kennedy and her force took the unusual step on the evening of the atrocity of releasing the information that the suspect was British-born.The chief constable said she doubted that a quicker release of information would have defused tensions that led to the riots.She pointed to this May’s incident where a car went into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC’s Premier League title victory. The incident in Liverpool city centre led to fears of a terrorist attack, which it was not, but also a rapid and determined spread of lies online.Kennedy recalled how her force released ethnicity details of a man it had arrested, but, she said: “Even when we put out that this was a white, British-born local person … because what we’d put out didn’t suit the narrative that they wanted to swell in terms of that negativity, people carried on with that misinformation.”She said she was annoyed by politicians such as Farage, who in the aftermath of the Southport riot said the authoritiesmight be wrongly hiding key details from the public. She said: “I was really frustrated that national politicians were making some of the statements that they were making … because of the impact that it was having in terms of trust and confidence in policing. And it wasn’t in my view based on fact, it was based on what was being said on social media.”Kennedy said claims of two-tier policing were “a ludicrous statement”, and added: “Some of the statements being said by national politicians are having an impact on what is playing out on our streets and what policing, communities and partners are being left to deal with.”She dismissed claims of asylum seekers being more likely to commit crime and said: “I’m not seeing anything out of kilter … It’s just, it’s more newsworthy.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “We recognise the nature of the criminal charges and the ongoing investigation may be upsetting for colleagues and cause distress.“We would therefore like to remind everyone who works at Holyrood or in constituency offices of the confidential support services that are available.”Smyth was arrested and charged this month in connection with possession of indecent images, prompting his suspension from Scottish Labour.The South Scotland MSP was arrested on Tuesday 5 August and is due to appear in court at a later date.He was first elected as an MSP in 2016 and was returned to Holyrood at the 2021 election. The Scottish parliament website now lists him as an independent.A spokesperson for Police Scotland said: “On Tuesday 5 August 2025, officers executed a warrant at a property on Marchfield Avenue, Dumfries.“A 52-year-old man was arrested and charged in connection with possession of indecent images. He is due to appear at Dumfries sheriff court at a later date.”A spokesperson for Scottish Labour said: “The whip has been removed from Colin Smyth MSP, pending an investigation. We cannot comment further on this matter while the investigation is ongoing.”It is understood the MSP was administratively suspended by Labour after the party became aware of the police investigation.In a statement last week Smyth said: “These events have come as a shock and this is a deeply stressful time. I am obviously co-operating fully with any inquiries and hope the matter can be resolved quickly.“I am not able to comment further at this stage, and in the meantime I would ask for the privacy of my family and friends to be respected.”A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “A standard prosecution report has been received by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service from Police Scotland in relation to a 52-year-old man.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The peer is already under scrutiny over his lobbying for several companies, leading in two cases toinvestigations by the Lords’ standards body.Lord Dannatt, an unpaid senior adviser to Blue International, sought help from the high commissioner for Ghana in January 2024 on behalf of the company’s Ghanaian subsidiary, Future Global Resources.The latest disclosure raises new questions about whether the peer breached parliamentary rules by seeking diplomatic assistance for the investment firm, which is focused on west Africa.At the time, the company was facingfinancial difficulties at its Bogoso-Prestea mineand was at risk of losing the right to operate the mine, by far its largest asset.Documents disclosed under freedom of information laws show that on 22 January 2024 Dannatt wrote to Harriet Thompson, then the high commissioner for Ghana, seeking her help.“Please excuse an unsolicited email but I am writing to ask for some assistance on a commercial matter that, although beneficial for the company concerned, is in the UK national interest,” he wrote.Dannatt said Blue International, in which he held 10,461 shares, was “at a critical juncture” because it was planning a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. He said this would require support from the Ghanaian minister of land, which he believed was likely to be forthcoming. But he warned that the company faced “very serious opposition from other quarters”.Dannatt then asked to arrange a video conference call with Thompson “to seek your advice and input on their next steps”.The peer told the Guardian that he had “always sought to abide by the letter and the spirit of all rules and in regard to the matters under discussion believed that I was doing so”.He said he had always declared any of his interests when engaging with ministers or officials, and said any proceeds from his shares would be donated to charity.“Moreover, I note that ministers and officials were content to engage with me on the issues I raised and invariably thanked me for bringing matters to their attention,” he added.Dannatt said the call with Thompson, arranged at the request of one of the directors of Blue International and Future Global Resources, did take place.“At the time the company’s commercial attempts to reopen the Bogoso-Prestea mine were being frustrated, against the best interests of the local employees, by those from another country outside Africa which also had designs on the mine,” he said.“At the meeting, my role was to introduce the director, outline the apparent problem and leave it to the others to discuss the way forward.”Dannatt’s appeal for help from the diplomatic corps appears to have resulted in UK government intervention.“Following the online meeting, I have seen in subsequent emails that the British high commissioner and some of her staff followed up the issues raised at the meeting with the appropriate Ghanian authorities, with a satisfactory outcome,” he told the Guardian.The Foreign Office disclosed that Thompson paid a “courtesy call” to Ghana’s attorney general and director of public prosecutions in March 2025 but details of the meeting were redacted.Dannatt’s intervention on behalf of Blue International appears to have breached parliamentary lobbying rules, which state that members must not “seek to profit from membership of the house by accepting or agreeing to accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services”.Guidance attached to the code, provided to all members of the house, states that peers should “not accept, or agree to accept, payment or other reward in return for doing or not doing something in the performance of their parliamentary duties”.Such duties include “all types of interaction with members of either house, ministers or officials”.A director of Blue International said Dannatt had provided “political advice” to the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAsked why he had told the British high commission that intervention was in the national interest, Dannatt said an official from the commission had “expressed his appreciation that raising this issue has resulted in the sustenance of a UK mining initiative in the region”.Dannatt’s shares in the company are now publicly tradable, after Blue International completed a $114.5m combination with a US “blank cheque” investment firm, relaunching the mining venture under the name Blue Gold in a deal that was completed in June.There are significant question marks over the likely value of the shares. The Ghanaian government has revoked the company’s lease at the Bogoso-Prestea mine, one of the largest gold mines in the country. The matter is subject to international arbitration.Dannatt said he did not know the value of his shares. He said he acquired them when Blue International was working on a now defunct hydroelectric project in Sierra Leone and he intended to donate any proceeds from them to Street Child, a charity founded by his son.Mark Green, a director of Blue International, said he had already been in touch with the British high commission before Dannatt’s involvement and had asked the peer to join a call to “help provide political advice as that has been his role for us”.Ex-army chief Lord Dannatt lobbied ministers for millions to support commercial dealRead more“Richard has never asked or intimated for anything in return,” he said. “He is on our advisory board, at our request, in order to give us advice and help us in political situations.”Green said Dannatt’s advice would help “protect the interest of British taxpayers”.In early 2024 it emerged that the Treasury had lent Blue International £3.3m of taxpayers’ money via the “Future Fund” the previous year. The Future Fund was designed to help “startups and innovative firms” survive the pandemic by extending them loans that converted into equity.Dannatt’s lobbying activity has come under scrutiny several times this year. He is under investigation by the House of Lords authorities over two sets of allegations.The first followedundercover filming by the Guardianduring which he offered to secure meetings with ministers for a potential commercial client. He said his conduct, which emerged as part of theGuardian’s Lords debate investigation, had not broken Lords rules.He is also under investigation after he lobbied the government to getfinancial support worth millions of poundsfor a commercial deal he was steering, documents reveal. He said he was not paid and was helping a friend.Earlier this month the Guardian revealed that he had urged ministers tocrack down on Palestine Actionat the request of a US defence company that employs him as an adviser.Court transcripts of the subsequent trial of one Palestine activist, obtained by the Guardian, reveal allegations heard in court that Dannatt sought to influence the police’s investigation of the protest.Dannatt said he was completely unaware of the exchanges in the trial and that allegations he was “seeking to influence” a live criminal case were “baseless”.Explore more on these topicsRichard DannattHouse of LordsLobbyingMiningCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

While families struggle with rising costs, the government is … [in effect] writing multibillion-pound cheques to bank shareholders.”Theemergency policy, first enacted in 2009during the global financial crisis, involved buying up £895bn of bonds from the UK’s banks and, in exchange, crediting them with reserves at the Bank of England.The Bank is now winding down QE – a process known as “quantitative tightening” (QT) – by selling the bonds at a rate of £100bn a year, but these sales are taking place at a loss.In accordance with a promise from Alistair Darling, then chancellor, the Treasury bears the financial risks of QE, so these losses hit the government’s finances.In addition, the higher Bank of England base rate,now set at 4%to combat above-target inflation, means the Bank is paying out higher interest rates on banks’ reserves than it is receiving on the bonds it holds. In total, these losses amount to a £22bn-a-year hit to the public finances, according to the IPPR.Jung calls for the Treasury to tax the big banks on their QE-related reserves, saying the profits of the big four have more than doubled since before the Covid pandemic.Treasury ‘considering taxing landlords’ rent’ to raise £2bnRead moreHe says such a policy could bring in £8bn a year and sidestep the Bank’s objections to a widely mooted alternative known as “tiered reserves”, which the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, has argued could interfere with its job of combating inflation.The IPPR compares the new bank levy it recommends with a tax on deposits implemented by the Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1981, as rising interest rates led to higher bank profits.Jung said: “A targeted levy, inspired by Margaret Thatcher’s own approach in the 1980s, would recoup some of these windfalls and put the money to far better use, helping people and the economy, not just bank balance sheets.”With gilt markets consistently jittery in recent months, the report also suggests the chancellor recommends to the Bank that it halt the process of selling off its stockpile of bonds.The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee will decide the pace of QT for the year ahead at a meeting on 18 September.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yields on 30-year government bonds, known as gilts,were close to a 27-year highthis week.Reeves is known to be considering a range of revenue-raising measures in the run-up to her autumn budget, with rising bond yields and a potential forecast downgrade from the Office for Budget Responsibility expected to wipe out the £9.9bn of “headroom” against her fiscal rules.A spokesperson for the Bank of England said: “Tax and spending decisions are for the government, not the Bank. We remain 100% focused on making sure that inflation returns all the way to the 2% target, because low and stable inflation is the foundation of a healthy economy.”A Treasury spokesperson said: “As set out in the plan for change, the best way to strengthen public finances is by growing the economy, which is our focus.”They added: “The [MPC] has operational independence to set monetary policy, including how it approaches asset sales, which is essential for the effective delivery of monetary policy.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyQuantitative easingRachel ReevesBank of EnglandEconomicsBondsBankingShareReuse this content"

But she said: “It’s concerning that it took an intervention from my committee and the information commissioner to make this happen.”The Afghan data breach led to people fearing for their safety under the Taliban and to the UK government offering relocation to thousands of Afghansunder a secret scheme.The government said it had delivered on 12 of the 14 recommendations about toughening up data security. Onwurah said: “The government still has questions to answer about the review. Why have only 12 of the 14 recommendations been implemented? And why has it kept the very existence of this review a secret for so long, even after the 2022 Afghanbreach became public?“For the government to fulfil its ambitions of using tech to boost the economy and transform our public sector, it needs the public to trust that it can keep their data secure. If it can’t, how can anyone be comfortable handing over their personal information?”The information commissioner, John Edwards, called on the government to go “further and faster to ensure Whitehall, and the wider public sector put their practices in order”.He told the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, on Thursday that “as a matter of urgency, the government should fully implement the recommendations of the Information Security Review”.It was not immediately clear which of the 14 recommendations had yet to be implemented. The full list included the government working with the National Cyber Security Centre to assess existing guidance on technical controls for products and services hosting information marked “official”, the need to launch a cross-government “behavioural influence communications campaign to address persistent poor information handling practices”, and the necessity of a “review sanctions for negligence”.McFadden and Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told Onwurah in a letter on Thursday: “Good progress has been made but we must guard against complacency. This is an area on which we must keep a consistent focus to ensure standards continue to improve.”A government spokesperson said: “This review concluded in 2023 under the previous government.“Protecting national security, including the security of government data, is one of our primary responsibilities. Since taking power, we have strengthened security guidance across departments, updated mandatory training for civil servants, and announced plans to upgrade digital infrastructure across the public sector as set out in our Blueprint for Modern Digital Government.”Explore more on these topicsData protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

It brings sun-warmed tropical water to Europe and the Arctic, where it cools and sinks to form a deep return current. The Amoc was already known to be at itsweakest in 1,600 yearsas a result of the climate crisis.Climate models recently indicated that acollapse before 2100 was unlikelybut the new analysis examined models that were run for longer, to 2300 and 2500. These show the tipping point that makes an Amoc shutdown inevitable is likely to be passed within a few decades, but that the collapse itself may not happen until 50 to 100 years later.‘We don’t know where the tipping point is’: climate expert on potential collapse of Atlantic circulationRead moreThe research found that if carbon emissions continued to rise, 70% of the model runs led to collapse, while an intermediate level of emissions resulted in collapse in 37% of the models. Even in the case of low future emissions, an Amoc shutdown happened in 25% of the models.Scientists have warned previously thatAmoc collapse must be avoided “at all costs”. It would shift the tropical rainfall belt on which many millions of people rely to grow their food, plunge western Europe into extreme cold winters and summer droughts, and add 50cm to already rising sea levels.Amoc graphicThe new results are “quite shocking, because I used to say that the chance of Amoc collapsing as a result of global warming was less than 10%”, said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was part of the study team. “Now even in a low-emission scenario, sticking to the Paris agreement, it looks like it may be more like 25%.“These numbers are not very certain, but we are talking about a matter of risk assessment where even a 10% chance of an Amoc collapse would be far too high. We found that the tipping point where the shutdown becomes inevitable is probably in the next 10 to 20 years or so. That is quite a shocking finding as well and why we have to act really fast in cutting down emissions.”Scientists spottedwarning signs of a tipping pointin 2021 and know that the Amoc has collapsed in the Earth’s past. “Observations in the deep [far North Atlantic] already show a downward trend over the past five to 10 years, consistent with the models’ projections,” said Prof Sybren Drijfhout, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, who was also part of the team.“Even in some intermediate and low-emission scenarios, the Amoc slows drastically by 2100 and completely shuts off thereafter. That shows the shutdown risk is more serious than many people realise.”The study,published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, analysed the standard models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The scientists were particularly concerned to find that in many models the tipping point is reached in the next decade or two, after which the shutdown of the Amoc becomes inevitable owing to a self-amplifying feedback.Air temperatures are rising rapidly in the Arctic because of the climate crisis, meaning the ocean cools more slowly there. Warmer water is less dense and therefore sinks into the depths more slowly. This slowing allows more rainfall to accumulate in the salty surface waters, also making it less dense, and further slowing the sinking, forming the feedback loop. Anothernew study, using a different approach, also found the tipping point is probably going to be reached around the middle of this century.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This produced the 70%, 37% and 25% figures. The scientists concluded: “Such numbers no longer comply with the low-likelihood-high-impact event that is used to discuss an abrupt Amoc collapse in [the IPCC’s last report].”Rahmstorf said the true figures could be even worse, because the models did not include thetorrent of meltwater from the Greenland ice capthat is also freshening the ocean waters.Dr Aixue Hu at the Global Climate Dynamics Laboratory in Colorado, US, who was not part of the study team, saidthe results were important. “But it is still very uncertain when Amoc collapse will happen or when the Amoc tipping point is going to crossed because of the lack of direct observations [of the ocean] and the varying results from the models.”The study that found that a total collapse of the Amoc was unlikely this century was led by Dr Jonathan Baker at the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK. “This new study highlights that the risk rises after 2100,” he said. “[But] these percentages should be treated with caution – the sample size is small, so more simulations [beyond 2100] are needed to better quantify the risk.”Nonetheless, Baker said, “the ocean is already changing, and projected shifts in North Atlantic convection are a real concern. Even if a collapse is unlikely, a major weakening is expected, and that alone could have serious impacts on Europe’s climate in the decades to come. But the future of the Atlantic circulation is still in our hands.”Explore more on these topicsOceansClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

At about 3am the unmistakable crump ofexplosions could be heard across Kyiv, enough to wake up tens of thousands and leave them contemplating whether to head for shelter or to stay in bed hoping for the best.At a five-storey residential apartment block in the Darnytskyi area in the east of the city, residents said they had heard Russian bombing in the distance. It was a familiar sound, and many had gathered away from the windows in central corridors that extended along the block, only for disaster to strike.“We didn’t understand what had happened,” said Oleksandr Yastremskyi, who had taken refuge in a corridor with his wife, Tetiana, and their son Denys. “It’s like something had landed into our house. And then we heard people screaming.” A hundred metres away, the other end of their building collapsed, sending, according to Tetiana, “a big wave of dust and smoke” in their direction.LiveFootage shows explosions in Kyiv as Russia launches all-night drone attack – video report0:57Kyiv resident films moments after missile hits residential building – videoThe next day, shocked residents described how two explosions destroyed one end of the apartment block, killing 17. Ivan Zhelezko, a serving soldier, looked across at his bombed second-floor flat, its balcony hanging at an unsustainable angle. Around him in bags were a handful of possessions he had managed to take with him from the apartment where he lived with his family for 20 years.View image in fullscreenRescue workers clear rubble at the site of a Russian hit on Boryspilska Street on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kyiv on Thursday.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIvan, a survivor from a block in Kyiv hit by a Russian attack, with belongings he managed to salvage.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianZhelezko said he was too stunned to be angry, describing himself as confused. Among those who died, he said, were his friend’s sister and the parents of a childhood friend. The soldier explained that his family escaped because they left immediately after the first explosion, and he tried to insist the tragedy was “nothing new for me”. Such fatalism was hard to believe, though he added: “I’m just happy my family is alive.”Those who moved fast or were simply at the other end of the building may have been able to escape unhurt but, such was the ferocity of the blasts, taking down all five storeys, they could only have been caused by a cruise or ballistic missile attack, giving those in the path of the rockets no chance.At the scene of the bombing, Yulia Maystruk clutched her three-and-a-half-month-old baby daughter, Maria. She explained that that she knew “a woman who had taken shelter in the basement with her 14-year-old-son” nearer the impact point. The mother had survived but was injured, needing medical care. As for the son “he died in hospital”, she said, her eyes welling with tears.The 14-year-old was one of four children out of 17 civilians who were killed in the apartment block because they had the misfortune to be at the wrong end of the building. Ten other people remained unaccounted for and a search operation involving 200 rescue workers, gradually tearing down the ruined part of the building as they looked for survivors, was expected to continue into Friday.View image in fullscreenClearing-up work under way on Boryspilska Street on Thursday.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianView image in fullscreenDamage to a British Council building in central Kyiv on Thursday.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIt had been quiet in Kyiv throughout most of August. In the run-up to the failed Alaska peace summit, Donald Trump had complained about Vladimir Putin’s bombing of Ukrainian cities and even threatened to levy sanctions on Russia oil before the meeting. The threats appeared to have some effect on the Kremlin and major attacks on Ukraine’s urban centres halted. Quiet nights returned.However, in Alaska Putin had refused to agree to a ceasefire unless Ukraine agreed to his extreme demands, including the surrender of the heavily defended portion of the eastern Donetsk province it still holds. Trump proved unwilling to pressure the Kremlin into softening its position – and so it was only a matter of time before Russia would feel confident enough to strikeKyivagain and see how the US president reacted.View image in fullscreenRescue workers on Boryspilska Street on Thursday.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIn the small hours of Thursday, it was clear the Kremlin was going all out. Ukraine’s air force said the country had been targeted with 629 Russian missiles and drones overnight. It was the worst attack on Kyiv since 31 July when 32 people were killed. Emergency services responded in more than 23 locations and at least 18 people have been killed.Just before 5.40am the bombing switched to the city centre, a mile south-east of Kyiv’s main railway station, into an affluent district of business properties and expensive apartments. A drone or missile struck close to an apartment building across the road from the five-storey British Council offices; the ensuing blast shattered all its front windows, bringing down its ceilings and inflicted serious damage.Residents in the district headed out to the dusty, glass-strewn streets, according to one observer, many wearing pyjamas and slippers, wrapped in blankets to call family members to describe what was happening. There was no obvious nearby target for the attack and the damage to the British Council building means that a diplomatic row between the UK and Russia is now inevitable.Back across the city, Maystruk acknowledged: “I didn’t think this would happen to me,” and worried for the future of the baby she held tight. A cousin, she explained, lived on the outskirts of London. Perhaps she could move there for her family’s safety? She rejected the suggestion: “Our patriotism is more powerful than our fear.”Additional reporting: Artem LysakExplore more on these topicsKyivUkraineRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Comically gifted and with a very modern mastery of makeup – there was nothing remotely slapdash about Viv’s transformative glam – she won the first UK edition ofRuPaul’s Drag Race in 2019, before parlaying her victory into appearances on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Hunted and Emmerdale. By 2024, she was living the dream, wowing as the Wicked Witch of the West in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s The Wizard of Oz.But James Lee Williams never got the chance to turn his status as a fledgling household name into proper cultural ubiquity: in January of this year,he died from cardio-respiratory arrest, a result of ketamine consumption. He was 32.This tribute to Williams – who was mostly called Viv by friends and James by family, using female and male pronouns respectively – arrives a mere eight months later. God knows how hard it must have been for his parents to discuss his death in public so soon afterwards. “Did I say how proud I was?” his mum panically asks Williams’ sister off camera at one point. To conclude this documentary, those who were close to the artist – including his young niece – are asked to write him an imaginary letter. It is an utterly heart-wrenching device, and one that seems slightly exploitative in the context of such raw grief.Before then, however, Dear Viv concerns itself with providing a lively, insightful and incredibly interesting account of Williams as a man and an entertainer. His reality background means there is copious footage of him discussing his life, interspersed here with testimony from family, friends and fellow queens alongside clips from early vlogs. We hear how he felt comfortable enough to come out as gay aged 14 at his north Wales private school, where he was an inveterate mischief-maker; his father, who worked there, recalls his attention-seeking antics with weary amusement. The same year, a Cher-induced internet wormhole led him to drag and, at 16, he moved to Liverpool by himself, finding his feet in the city’s club scene and acquiring the Vivienne Westwood fixation that produced his moniker. Later, a stint in Gran Canaria helped him finesse his raucous, accessible and very British act – “that old school rough and ready drag but with the polished look” as his friend and colleagueMichael Marouliputs it.Not long afterwards, his Drag Race audition tape – featuring impressions of Donald Trump, Cilla Black, Cher, Ab Fab’s Patsy Stone,Jennifer CoolidgeandKim Woodburn– won him a place on the lineup; his comic chops won him the series and many friends besides, especiallyBaga Chipz, who describes the pair as “a couple of fat bastards” (fellowqueen Cheryl Holeaffectionately likens them toStatler and Waldorffrom the Muppets). Later Williams appeared onDrag Race All Stars– a queen of queens competition involving the franchise’s best contestants. Then, with some effort – Williams’ manager Simon Jones mourns the post-Savage evisceration of drag from the mainstream – he made inroads into primetime fare: he hoped his participation on Dancing on Ice would prove drag queens were “nothing to be feared”.Off stage and screen, things weren’t quite so rosy. Williams arrived in Liverpool with an anti-drug attitude, but his new social circle soon normalised extreme partying. Post-performance comedowns cemented his dependence; he spent four years as a functioning ketamine addict – able to continue with life while under the influence and to hide it from his family. He went to Spain to break the cycle and byDragRace his narrative was one of hard-won sobriety.That wasn’t all. In an archive interview, Williams alludes to the intense loneliness he experienced before meeting his husband David, who “gave him something to live for” (they split up in 2023, for reasons not covered in the documentary ). His profession was a salve and a stress of its own – he was racked with insecurity on All Stars, feeling like “the runt of the litter” amid the US queens. Fascinatingly, we hear how being a drag queen bifurcated his very selfhood: he neglected James, spending all his money on clothes for The Vivienne and often wanting to lose himself in his imperious, invulnerable creation. It’s rare to hear this kind of candid deconstruction of drag, earnestness being anathema to camp. “As queer people we often hide from emotions,” says Hole, who explains how persecution can lead to emotional repression. We also witness Chipz explaining how his drag alter ego helps him to escape himself.We don’t get similar insight into Williams’ relapse. Jones knew the performer was taking ketamine again (his family didn’t) and had arranged for counselling and therapy. Dear Viv is not presumptuous – or reductive – enough to impose a simple narrative on his death. Instead, it offers a warm and nuanced portrait of an artist as the giver of great joy – and of a man whose calling both allayed and intensified his vulnerabilities.Dear Viv aired on BBC Three and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDragDrugsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverAs the punk poet prepares to tour and reissue Horses for its 50th anniversary, we count down the best of her rich, rabble-rousing workByAlexis PetridisThu 28 Aug 2025 10.33 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 10.34 EDTShare20. Glitter in Their Eyes (2000)Not all the politicking on Gung Ho landed right – Stange Messengers is unbearably clumsy – but Glitter in Their Eyes’ plea for a younger generation not to get hooked on materialism is impressively punchy and potent, abetted by the presence on guitar of her old sparring partner, Television’s Tom Verlaine.19. Don’t Say Nothing (1997)Like its predecessor, Gone Again, Peace and Noise was an album awash with loss and mourning. Don’t Say Nothing sounds like a note to self, a concerted effort to shake free from the torpor of grief and start over: “Gonna straighten up, gonna get well, I’m gonna do something, gonna face the fact.”18. Space Monkey (1978)A streetwise rock’n’roll strut, married to a lyric in which an alien invasion, or possibly the revenge of simians used in space exploration, gets mixed up with the French actor Pierre Clémenti. If Easter was Smith’s most commercial album thus far, you never forgot you were in the presence of a one-off figure.View image in fullscreenSmith in the 70s.Photograph: Dick Barnatt/Redferns17. Paths That Cross (1988)Written for Robert Mapplethorpe after the death of his partner, Sam Wagstaff, the beautiful Paths That Cross offers a warm, optimistic view of eternity as “a glow we all will know”. Given that Mapplethorpe was also sick – he died within a year of the song’s release – you suspect Smith was equally engaged in preparing herself for his loss.16. Frederick (1979)Wave received a mixed response – its poppy smoothness taken as evidence that Smith’s heart was no longer in it – but has grown in stature over the years. Frederick, the opener, is just fantastic, an unabashed proclamation of love that sounds almost giddy with excitement.15. Privilege (Set Me Free) (1978)In the same way that Horses’ opening track transformed Van Morrison’s Gloria, so Privilege took the title song from the 1967 film about a pop star turned fake messiah and interpolated it with Psalm 23. What emerged was a song that seemed to speak loudly about Smith’s increasingly complex and troubled attitude to fame.14. Redondo Beach (1975)On release, Rolling Stone called Horses “as original an original as they come”. Certainly, I struggle to think of another song like Redondo Beach, the grim story of a girl’s suicide on a beach patronised by gay men and women, set to an incongruously jaunty reggae-infused backing.View image in fullscreenBackstage in New York, 1975.Photograph: Charles Steiner/Getty Images13. Dream of Life (1988)For an album with a decidedly varied reputation amongPatti Smithfans – not everyone loves its straightforward, distinctly 80s-hued rock approach – Dream of Life has a remarkable number of great songs on it. The title track is a case in point: think of it as an older, wiser relation of Because the Night.12. Mother Rose (2004)A reflection on the death of Smith’s mother, written from the perspective of a daughter who is now a mother herself, this is the highlight of Trampin’. “It’s not a grieving song … hopefully a really pretty song,”she clarifiedafter its release. It is, indeed, utterly lovely: tender and atmospheric.11. This Is the Girl (2012)Right from the start, Smith was big on writing about her dead heroes. The passing of Amy Winehouse added her to the pantheon of lost inspirations. This Is the Girl has a hint of Winehouse’s retro soul sound– or perhaps Smith’s beloved doo-wop – about it; the lyric is affecting, tender and maternal.10. Gone Again (1996)This was the last song Smith wrote with her husband, Fred “Sonic” Smith, before his death, an event that transformed it from a paean to indigenous American culture to a eulogy for its co-author and a meditation on the transience of life: “The ashes’s rain / Death’s own bed / Man’s own kin / Into the wind.”View image in fullscreenSmith in 1974.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images9. Free Money (1975)As close as Horses got to punk rock as the world would come to understand it – check out Penetration’s 1978 cover to hear how easily its three-chord riff adapted to the subsequent sonic template – with remarkably prosaic lyrics about winning the lottery. Its gradual build in pace is thrilling.8. Piss Factory (1974)The deconstructed cover of Hey Joe on the A-side of Smith’s debut single was great, but the B-side is something else: autobiographical provincial ennui set to guitar and piano, its climactic burst of manifesting – “I’m gonna go on that train and go to New York City / I’m gonna be somebody!” – exhilarating and stirring.7. Land: Horses/Land of a Thousand Dances/La Mer(de) (1975)Nine and a half incredible minutes that meld together the saga of a locker-room rape, a garage-band cover of the old R&B standard – best known in Wilson Pickett’s 1966 version – references to cocaine, Smith’s favourite poet (“go Rimbaud!”) and “the sea of possibilities”. It sounds like nothing else, yet still rocks in time-honoured style.6. People Have the Power (1988)Watch the video.Smith’s great latter-day anthem has had a long afterlife: it has turned up as U2’s live intro music and the theme for the 2004Vote for Change campaignin the US. It’s obvious why: its rabble-rousing is optimistic and effective, its message – “the people have the power to redeem the work of fools” – perennially consoling.5. Beneath the Southern Cross (1996)An extraordinary waltz-time dispatch from the depths of grief, Smith’s voice somewhere between incantation and a wail, that gradually builds from abjection to a kind of catharsis – “crossover boy!” – backed by ghostly guitar noise and an ethereal backing vocal (the last thing Jeff Buckley recorded).Patti Smith review – utterly transformed by the power of musicRead more4. Pissing in a River (1976)After the gamechanging explosion of Horses, its disjointed follow-up, Radio Ethiopia, divided opinion. Amid its confused stylistic lurches, the one thing everything seemed to agree on was that Pissing in a River’s brooding, glowering, increasingly desperate depiction of love gone sour was a slow-burning masterpiece.3. Dancing Barefoot (1979)Smith has claimed that, growing up, she thought the coolest thing was “to be an artist’s mistress”. The finest song on Wave – subsequently covered by U2, Pearl Jam, Shakespears Sister and the Mission – was inspired byJeanne Hébuterne, Modigliani’s muse and mistress, who died by suicide two days after the artist’s death.2. Because the Night (1978)An unfinished Bruce Springsteen song, completed by Smith, Because the Night was parachuted on to Easter by the producer Jimmy Iovine in the quest for a big hit. It duly became one, partly because it was the most straightforward rock anthem Smith recorded, but mostly because it’s an incredible, irresistible song.1 Gloria: In Excelsis Deo (1975)Listen to Gloria.Smith’s debut album began with one of the most celebrated opening lyrics in pop history. But “Jesus died for somebody’s sins but not mine” was far from the most radical thing about Smith’s reimagining of Them’s garage-rock standard. It turns it inside out, transforming it from a song about male sexual desire to one about sexual desire from which men are excluded, sung in a voice unlike anything anyone had heard before: supremely cool and tough, but distinctly female. It was as if Smith was creating a new space – an “atmosphere where anything’s allowed”, as another lyric put it – before your ears.The 50th anniversary edition of Horses is released on 10 October on Legacy Recordings.

The caption accompanied a video graphic that reads: “The summer we started acting normal online.”The show isn’t real but the people playing the characters arepic.twitter.com/csqsKEB2v9— The Summer I Turned Pretty (@thesummeritp)August 26, 2025On X the show’s account also reshared an earlier “PSA for the Summer community” posted before the season three premiere in July, which instructed fans that there was a “zero tolerance policy for bullying and hate speech”.Now on its eighth of 11 episodes in its third and final season, The Summer I Turned Pretty has become a runaway hit for Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service – as well as attracting a vocal fanbase.‘Fear of missing out’ keeping girls and young women online despite sexismRead moreBased on the novels of the same name by Jenny Han, the series follows Belly Conklin (Lola Tung) as she finds herself in a love triangle with two brothers competing for her attention: Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno).Online the fanbase is split into two warring camps – team Conrad v team Jeremiah. Many posts poke fun at the actions of each love interest as well as Belly’s wavering – though, as the show has moved towards its climactic finale, its stars and creators have spoken out about the sometimes vitriolic nature of the posts.“When people have an attachment to the characters, they want to see it come together at the end,” Tung toldTeen Voguein July. “But people get a little scary about it. Please don’t threaten to kill someone if something doesn’t go your way – I promise you, it’s not that serious.”ANew York TimesQ&A last week asked Casalegno about playing “one of the internet’s most hated boyfriends” – to which he responded that he no longer checked Instagram.“Amazon did a good job of stepping in and being like, ‘Hey, no bullying,’” he said. “Though, not really going so well.”Variety reported that Casalegno had received public death threats for his role as Jeremiah as well as previous backlash over his social media activity, including for liking conservative political posts.Sources close to the production told Variety that Amazon had issued the warning as producers have seen “more opportunity for toxic behaviour online” – namely “anonymous, overly harsh criticisms”.Amazon’s statement comes one day after Han shared her own thoughts. “I know fans of the show are passionate and no one has bad intent,” the author wrote in an Instagram story on Tuesday. “But even in jest, posting images of a woman being slapped or choked is not funny.”The final season of The Summer I Turned Pretty ends on 17 September.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionCyberbullyingOnline abuseInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

The images are often clean, sharp and intense but rarely are they hilarious. A nanosecond later or before would have rendered a completely different frame and missed the pure comedic value behind Giubilo’s image.Half terrifying and half sublime, the image was captured by complete fluke. Giubilo told the Guardian he had “been waiting for a long time for something like this”, and that he knew what a great image he had taken the moment he saw it on the back of his Nikon Z9.The only way Giubilo was able to line up the shot so perfectly was due to Paolini being off balance when she finished her forehand stroke. “She just moved the racket back in a way that she normally doesn’t do,” he said. When he attempted to capture the same image the following night, frame after frame it could not be replicated.Paolini was so enamoured of the shot, she singled out Giubilo the next time she was on court for a second-round match to express her admiration.View image in fullscreenTennis photographer Ray Giubilo says he had ‘been waiting for a long time for something like this’, after taking an incredible photograph of Jasmine Paolini.Photograph: Sarah Yenesel/EPA“Tonight after the match when she won, I was sitting underneath her box and she ran towards the box, smiling as she always does, and I thought she was going to go and hug her coach. But she came to me instead and she gave me five and said, ‘Great photo.’”Ostapenko and Townsend confront each other after US Open match: ‘She said I had no education’Read moreBefore becoming a professional photographer Giubilo was an agent for a tennis clothing company in Australia. His passion was always photography, and with the help of people such as John Newcombe and John Alexander he moved into photographing local matches. Thirty-seven years later he spends seven months a year travelling the tennis circuit, shooting up to 20 matches a day over gruelling 14-hour shifts.Patience, creative flair and impeccable technical ability is what defines amazing sports photographers; sitting still for hours while watching match after match, all while remaining laser focused on each hit. “You have to be patient, you have to be fast, you have to be fit,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisAustralia sportUS sportsPhotographynewsShareReuse this content"

With some early hits, such asLilo & Stitch, some had expected this season’s blockbusters to take the industry to the magic $4bn mark (something only achieved once since 2019, thanks to Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy), but that was not to be.Box office was around $3.53bn, a gentle rise fromlast year, which suffered from a rocky start and ended up at $3.52bn. But what was behind that number and which films should have helped push it even higher?Millennial nostalgia is kingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Disney. All Rights Reserved/PASummer has been overtaken by nostalgia for some time now, but this year was overtaken by a certain kind of nostalgia from a certain period of time. It was a season geared towards those who view the 2000s as a formative cultural period and the bets mostly paid off. In mid-May, thesixth instalmentof the Final Destination franchise (which started in 2000 and saw sequels throughout the decade) overperformed, becoming the highest-grossing in the series. In June, Danny Boyle returned to the world of 2002’s 28 Days Later with thestart of a new trilogy, racking up $150m worldwide, almost double that of the original. The summer’s biggest hit soon followed, a live-action remake of 2002’sLilo & Stitch, the only film this season to crack $1bn. The original had been a hit on release but its popularity grew over time as teenagers turned into parents, creating a new generation of fans. Then in August, afollow-upto 2003’s Freaky Friday brought back Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis and flew past $115m worldwide (with more to come). One could even credit the $844m success ofanother rote Jurassic Park sequelto a generation’s undying love for the original …The death of the review? Cultural criticism is at risk of erasureRead moreIt’s not going away anytime soon (a prequel series to Legally Blonde and sequels toShrekandScary Movieare in the works), but this summer also showed the limitations of nostalgia. A follow-up to late-90s slasher franchiseI Know What You Did Last Summerdid just aboutOKworldwide given its small budget ($64m from $18m), but it wasn’t the easy win that Sony had expected (it made half of the 1997 original without inflation and the number paled in comparison to the new Scream movies), and a mid-credits kicker suggesting more to come will probably be the last we’ll see. Sony also struggled with areturn to the Karate Kid franchise, which made less than a third of the 2010 reboot. Unlike the aforementioned hits, both films required more knowledge of the ins and outs of franchises that hadn’t lived on in quite the same way (both had most recently been resurrected on TV).Animated panicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Universal Studios/PAThe biggest family hits of the summer were live-action remakes of Lilo & Stitch andHow to Train Your Dragon(over $1.6bn combined), a relief for Disney (after struggling withSnow White) and a new source of income for Universal/DreamWorks. But the success also came with a bitter aftertaste as while they both hit big, animation in general suffered. Pixar might have scored last summer’s biggest hit withInside Out 2($1.69bn worldwide), but post-Covid it’s been otherwise wobbly with even Toy Story spin-off Lightyear ($226m worldwide) failing to catch fire. This summer saw the company’sworst-everopening weekend forElio, a cursedproductionthat saw a change of director and reportedly apanicked de-queering. The film ended up making just $152m on an estimated budget of up to $200m.Back in 2011, Sony’s first Smurfs outing made an impressive $563m worldwide, the ninth-highest-grossing film of the year. While the 2013 sequel dipped below with $347m and the 2017 reboot even lower with $197m, these numbers were still far more impressive than what this summer’s latest attempt achieved, as the franchise moved from Sony to Paramount. The Rihanna-ledSmurfsmade just $31m in the US and $109m globally, a number one would perceive as franchise-ending. There was also a significant downturn forThe Bad Guysfranchise, with the second film currently running at $150m internationally compared with the first one’s $250m, a disappointment given an $80m budget. This past weekend, A24 also tried to give Chinese smashNe Zha 2the Hollywood treatment with a dubbed version, populated by stars such as Michelle Yeoh. But the film, which had already broken box office records with a staggering $2.2bn gross, had already made $20m stateside earlier in the year. Audiences roundly rejected the redo and the film tanked in 13th position with just $1.5m. The weekend was overshadowed by another animated success story …KPop goes the box officeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APDuring the unsureness of the pandemic, Sony decided to offload some of its films to Netflix, a bundle that unwisely included a film calledKPop: Demon Hunters. At that time, in early 2021, it was only in development and no one knew what it would later become. Even when it was released on Netflix in June, there was still little buzz surrounding it, something that often happens with the original films the streamer decides not to go big on (last year’s extraordinary thrillerRebel Ridgealso found itself somewhat dumped). But fans found it fast and the film rose and rose until it became a smash, big enough to not only push a Ryan Reynolds action movie off theall-time most-watched listbut also achieve a rare Netflix theatrical release. Last weekend, a singalong version was dropped into select cinemas (certain chains refuse to show Netflix films so they were excluded) and it made an estimated $20m in the US, topping the box office.It’s a fascinating case study for the industry and a frustrating one for Sony, which has had a bumpy year so far. It’s obviously not certain what would have happened had the film been released by the studio theatrically given the market for original animation, and the film’s unprecedented success on Netflix is probably tied to how much easier something can catch fire on such an accessible platform that allows for endless rewatching. But its unusual journey has left some money on the table, whether that would have gone to Sony or Netflix. This summer also saw more streaming success for Apple as it achieved its biggest hit to date withF1: The Movie, which made $604m, also becoming Brad Pitt’s highest grosser. It was released in conjunction with Warner Bros and the tech giant has yet to unveil its release date on Apple TV+. The strategy – release a big movie wide and make people at home wait until they can watch it for nothing – edges Apple closer to an old-fashioned studio.A secret weaponView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APFor a long while, it seemed the only two reliable genres in Hollywood were superheroes and horror (even if asuperhero horrorfailed to capitalise) and as the former started to see a downturn, the latter worryingly followed. Last year saw a string of stumbles including Abigail, The First Omen, Never Let Go, The Watchers, Afraid and The Front Room, and pre-summer this year, things hadn’t improved much withOpus,The Woman in the Yard,Wolf ManandUntil Dawnall underperforming. But in April, just before the season kicked off,Sinners,Ryan Coogler’s one-of-a-kind hybrid of horror, fantasy, action and period drama, was a sustained smash, sticking inside the top 10 until mid-June (it’s become the highest-grossing original live-action film since Gravity). Weeks after, Final Destination: Bloodlines also became the franchise’s top earner by a considerable amount (it made $285m globally compared with the fourth chapter’s $186m) and alarm bells had stopped sounding.What audiences wanted, as shown by the success of last summer’sLonglegs, was something that felt special, and the genre’s oversaturation had left so many horror films feeling stale and unnecessary. While Sinners, technically released in spring, will be arguably the year’s most encouraging success story, the summer’s big horror win came in August with the release ofWeapons, Zach Cregger’s ambitious follow-up to sleeper hit Barbarian. Like Sinners and Final Destination 6, it was also a Warner Bros release (summer bonuses to the marketing department) and like those two films it also had a larger-than-usual budget for the genre. But since its release, it’s flown past $200m globally and reminded studios of the power of a well-marketed original thriller-horror at summer. Back in the M Night Shyamalan heyday, these would come every two years and while quality faded, audiences mostly didn’t (even The Happening made over $160m worldwide). It’s worth noting that horror was still no surefire thing this summer (Together,Bring Her Back,Dangerous Animalsand I Know What You Did Last Summer all underperformed) but Cregger’s twisty conversation-starter, built around a secret you had to find out for yourself, felt essential to both teens and their parents and was the kind of buzzy, mid-budget, R-rated success that we don’t see much of these days. I imagine we’ll be seeing more of them soon.Empty arthousesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe post-pandemic box office hasn’t been kind to the smaller movie, especially in the summertime. Pre-2020, films such as Hereditary, Sorry to Bother You and RBG found a way to distract audiences from sequels and superheroes, but indie breakouts have been harder to spot in the summers since. This year was another disappointing season for counter-programming with A24 out of luck with both Eva Victor’s Sundance breakoutSorry, Babyin specialty release ($2.3m US) and Ari Aster’s Covid westernEddingtonin wide release ($10.1m US). Neon also struggled to profit from Toronto film festival award winnerThe Life of Chuck($6.7m US). Sony Pictures Classics couldn’t capitalise on the Austen celebrations withJane Austen Wrecked My Life($1.8m US) or The Bear’s Molly Gordon’s rising star withOh, Hi!($2m US). Vertical-released Ron Howard thrillerEden, blessed with a starry cast, couldn’t open past $1m on the same weekend, as Ethan Coen’s comedyHoney Don’t!struggled to make it to $4m. Even a starry Wes Anderson movie likeThe Phoenician Schemecouldn’t make it past $20m in the US (Asteroid City almost reached $30m).What did work for A24 wasCeline Song’sMaterialists, one of their more successful commercial plays of late. The Dakota Johnson-led romantic comedy rose to $36m in the US and $85m worldwide, impressive given both the $18m budget and the genre’s recent performance at the box office (Anyone But Youremains the rare success story). Like that film, it managed to spark online chatter, this time over its themes and character choices, but it remains to be seen if Johnson’s other romcom of the season can repeat its success (last weekend’sSplitsvilleis a slow rollout). Internationally the film was also handled by Sony, giving it a much-needed win …And superheroes are back … but also maybe not?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jessica Miglio/APAfter superhero matchup The Marvels saw out 2023 with a super-embarrassing result (making $206m globally from a budget of $374m, a record low for the MCU), Marvel wisely took a pause. Last year saw the release ofDeadpool & Wolverine(a monster hit at $1.3bn) but those films exist slightly outside of the regular churn (it was the first Deadpool film to be released by Disney). Originally scheduled for last year, this February’sCaptain America: Brave New Worldfailed to break even ($415m from a $180m budget with experts claiming it needed to make over $425m) and then the summer kicked off, as it always used to, with a major Marvel release, this year beingThunderbolts. Somehow, despite a ton more hype, the filmdid even worse, making it to just $382m from a similar-sized budget (a far cry from the $1bn days of Marvel’s time in the sun).Spinal Tap II, Julia Roberts and Paul Thomas Anderson: the best films of autumn 2025Read moreOn the other side of the ring, DC was also in need of a hit. In 2023, the Aquaman sequel made less half of what the original achieved, while The Flash was reported to have lost the studio around $200m. 2024 was also a year for licking wounds with just the non-DCEU sequelJoker: Folie à Deuxreleased (a film that also bombed, losing an estimated $140m). This summer saw the official DC relaunch with James Gunn’sSuperman, a $225mbig betthat many saw as a predictor of not just the future success of DC but superhero movies in general. It ended up adecent-sized, if not super, hit, bringing in $605m to date, a notable success more in the US than elsewhere. It’s the third-biggest film of the year in the US, with $347m, but falls down to sixth globally (it made 42% of its gross internationally compared with, say, Jurassic World: Rebirth, which was at 60%). It came in slightly underneath Man of Steel’s $670m but it was encouraging enough to show interest in where DC is heading. That’s more than can be said for Marvel, however, withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsyet to make it to $500m after a strong start led to steep declines week-on-week. It might have won the critics back (an 87% rating compared with The Marvels at 63%) but audiences will need more to turn up en masse once again.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryWalt Disney CompanySony PicturesMarvelNetflixDC ComicsDanny BoylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an outrage – and we must resist itThierry Breton is the former EU commissioner for digital affairsThu 28 Aug 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 20.35 EDTShareFreshthreats of sanctionshave just emerged from across the Atlantic, targeting Europe and any official who dares to enforce the Digital Services Act (DSA), the EU’s flagship law regulating tech platforms and digital operations. These sanctions come with new trade barriers and unprecedented export restrictions.How long are we, citizens of the EU, going to tolerate these threats? Submit to those who want to impose their rules, their laws, their deadlines on us? Surrender to those who now presume to dictate our fundamental democratic and moral principles, our rules for how we live together and even how we protect our own children online? Why and in whose name would we agree to cast aside our twin digital regulations, theDSA and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which were voted into law with clarity, courage and convictionby a landslidein the European parliament? (It is worth recalling thatMEPs votedfor the DMA by 588 votes to 11, with 31 abstentions, and for the DSA by 539 votes to 54, with 30 abstentions.)An ever-widening gulf of misunderstanding is opening up betweenEuropeand the United States on digital regulation. A gulf that the major tech platforms – American, in this case – are exploiting to the hilt. And that is deeply regrettable. Because regulating the information space is not optional: it is asine qua nonfor turning the narrow mercantile logic of a few into a genuine contribution towards human progress and the common good.Throughout history, humanity has managed to regulate its territorial, maritime and airspace. This is the prerogative of sovereign states. It is the essence of sovereignty itself. To renounce, today, the task of regulating the fourth domain – the digital space – by leaving it to a handful of private actors would be a historic abdication of the public sphere, of political will, of the democratic promise.The DMA and the DSA are, in truth, nothing more than the extension of our social and democratic norms from the physical world into the digital one. In other words: the rule of law. Europe is the first and only continent to have taken this step. It has every reason to be proud.Let us be absolutely clear: regulating the digital space has never been, and will never be, an assault on freedom of expression. On the contrary, this freedom has always been a legitimate concern and a core demand of the European parliament.Europe is free to define its own laws and policies, and remains an open market. But that openness comes with one condition: our laws must be respected. Our democratic sovereignty must be upheld. That is non-negotiable. Not for sale. Platforms, wherever they come from, must now comply with our democratic framework if they wish to access our markets. Otherwise they will face heavy sanctions, which the European Commission is duty-bound to apply firmly and swiftly.There are no tariffs. There is no attempt to shut anyone out. There is no desire for prohibition in our European digital space. This is quite the opposite of what the US has imposed on the physical world of trade. A punitive unilateral US tariff regime is already weighing heavily on the EU. And that should make us reflect.Let us be blunt: analternative EU negotiating pathwas possible; one that did not involve our submission.Pre-emptive capitulationwas not the only option: there should have been an assumed balance of power between partners of equal weight.Why is Europe – the US’s largest trading partner – not treated on the same terms as Mexico or Canada, which have trade volumes with the US that are comparable to the EU’s? After months of tough negotiations with the Trump administration, they maintained full exemptions from tariffs on more than 90% of their exports, and tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on the rest. Their overall average tariff ratenow stands below 5%. This was the result of four months of hard, head-to-head negotiation between Mexico, Canada and the US. It was not a foregone conclusion, but the fight was worth it.The commission rightly entered into negotiations on the same basis – zero for zero – across a very broad scope of products. Why then did Europe end up lowering its guard andaccepting a 15% tariffon European exports to the US, whileconceding zero tariffson US imports, including most agricultural products?Worse still, in order to benefit from this supposed “special discount”, Europe is now forced to commit to buying $750bn worth of US energy, and to invest an additional $200bn every year in the US economy, on top of the current investment flow of $300bn. Is this truly the best deal Europe could have hoped for?We were told thatcapitulation was preferableto uncertainty and the risk of a trade war. Wars, it is true, often end in surrender. But after conceding so much to secure hypothetical tariff stability – an understandable demand from our businesses – what real guarantees have we obtained?What if Europe is “punished” again, this time for not buying enough US gas? Or if its businesses choose instead to invest those hundreds of billions into the European economy and jobs?We were told humiliation was the price we had to pay for stability. But if we don’t push back now, we will get humiliation and instability.Will this latest assault on our digital laws finally be enough to wake us up?The time has come to rise up. Europeans must stand together and proclaim loud and clear: “Enough is enough,es reicht,ça suffit,adesso basta,dość tego,ya basta…” Europe, stand up!Thierry Breton was the European commissioner for the internal market and digital affairs until September 2024 and is a former minister for the economy and finance in FranceExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionTariffsEuropean UnionEuropeTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Not likely for an artist who’s made billions from songs about redefining women’s limitsThu 28 Aug 2025 10.13 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 10.59 EDTShareTaylor Swift isoff the market. She’s engaged to marry the NFL player Travis Kelce in what will be the US’s first proper royal wedding, and yes of course I know you’re far too high-minded to care about any of that, but what’s striking is how many people seem convinced that this is the end of any kind of interesting life for her. As if a woman had no drama, no edge, no stories to tell, and – let’s be frank, here – no commercial value to speak of once she is no longer at least theoretically sexually available. The fairytale ends when the princess marries the prince: who cares, really, what happens to her after that?Music critics are already gloomily debating whether marriage will kill her creativity, or whether she’ll be left for dust by one of the younger rivals already nipping at her heels if she does take time out from music to have the children she’s always said she wanted. Poor Taylor, mummy-tracked before she’s even pregnant, like an old friend of mine whose engagement in her 20s prompted her male boss to tell everyone in the pub afterwards that that was her out for the count. He meant that she’d presumably have babies now and lose her professional edge – right on the first count, very wrong on the second – but also perhaps that she had somehow put herself in a different category: no longer young and promising, but practically matronly overnight. Even the Today programme devoted breakfast airtime to pondering where Swift will get her material, once she’s a smug married with no toxic exes to write about – though of course she was never just about breakup songs, and women have been known to have interesting interior lives even over the age of 35.More gallingly, in the USthe Maga right is crowing about what they see as Swift’s surrender to the forces of conservatism, as if the patron saint ofchildless cat ladies(and arch-defender of reproductive rights) had just sold out in return for a rose-bedecked engagement photoshoot and the coy note of small-town romance struck byher linethat “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married”.You belong with me! Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce – a love story in 11 picturesRead moreSo when people ask what on earth she has to write about now, the obvious answer for someone who has made billions from pop songs about redefining women’s limits and subverting expectations is … all of the above. All the lazy assumptions about what it means to be a wife and (maybe, eventually) mother, including the astonishingly persistent old chestnut that feminism isn’t compatible with loving a man. All the questions and internal contradictions that plenty of her original fanbase – who, like her, are now in their mid-30s and faintly mortified to find themselves getting into bread-making – must be secretly wrestling with too. There is an incredibly rich lyrical seam just waiting to be mined about being a millennial woman and wanting perfectly ordinary things – love, security, a family – without feeling as if you’re compromising your independence, losing the career you’ve worked so hard for, or subconsciously shrinking yourself to fit some narrowly pre-ordained mould.This week, England and Wales reported that fertility rates hadfallen to their lowest levelsince comparable data was first recorded in 1938, when Britain was on the eve of a war. In Scotland, they have plummeted even further, to the lowest point seensince records began in 1855. The causes of this modern collapse are complex, ranging from the astronomical cost of childcare and the struggle to afford a family-size home to the hellscape that is dating apps, and much more besides. But lurking somewhere in the mix is the fact that what’s on offer just doesn’t seem all that compelling to many younger women.Tradwifedom, the meekly old-fashioned vision of domesticity served up on Instagram by a bunch of submissive influencers in aprons, is a gingham-lined trap visible from space (and even for those whodobuy into the retro housewife fantasy, it’s out of reach for all but the tiny minority of couples who can afford to live on only one salary). Burning out in an attempt to do everything at once, like some of their mothers did, is not much more appealing, however. Meanwhile, some are already falling into the yawning gap between the solution they’d hoped for – men prepared to share the domestic load like equals – and the often jarring reality of early motherhood. Now imagine all those conflicting emotions, boiled down into a few unforgettable one-liners by the woman who also wrote the soundtrack to your single years.Taylor Swift’s romantic travails were the soundtrack to mine. What does her engagement mean for fans’ love lives? | Hollie RichardsonRead moreIt’s true that in literary terms, the transition between questing singleton and married woman is a tricky plot point. Bridget Jones’s creator Helen Fielding didn’t seem to know what to do with her once she’d married her Mr Darcy, and ended upkilling him offto make Bridget interesting again. The writers ofAnd Just Like Thatencountered the same problem when Carrie Bradshaw eventually married Big, andsolved it equally murderously.But both Carrie and Bridget are fictional characters. No matter how heavily curated her public persona, somewhere deep inside theTaylor Swiftindustrial complex is a real human being, and assuming that she can’t spin gold out of this says more about narrow views of what women can be as they get older than it does about an endlessly inventive myth-maker. The old Taylor may not, in her words, be able to come to the phone right now. But I suspect there will be a new one along any minute.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

An FCA investigation is seriousNils PratleyMinisters should find out what the regulator says before signing away a further £1.8bn of public moneyThu 28 Aug 2025 12.35 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 16.06 EDTShareThere is already a scandal of bad accounting at Drax, one could say mischievously. It’s the one that maintains that transporting wood pellets from North America to burn in North Yorkshire is a “carbon neutral” activity because replacement trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow. You don’t have to be a green lobbyist to think there’s something wrong there. As the research groupEmber regularly reminds us, Drax is the UK’s biggest emitter yet qualifies for renewables subsidies.That weirdness in the methodology is one for the government to justify. TheFinancial Conduct Authority’s investigationis into the grittier issue of Drax’s “historical statements” about its sourcing of wood pellets. Three sets of annual accounts – 2021, 2022 and 2023 – are in the spotlight for adherence to listing rules for quoted companies and transparency disclosures.The FCA’s poke around the thicket is very welcome because the last episode in this saga ended in unsatisfactory fashion for outsiders when the company reached a settlement with Rowaa Ahmar, its former head of public affairs and policy, who had accused the company of misleading the government, the public and the regulator over its sourcing of wood for pellets. The allegation was part of her claim for unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal.The regulator in question was Ofgem, in charge of energy, whose investigation had reached a closely worded outcome. On the one hand, it did not find evidence to suggest deliberate misreporting or thatDraxhad unfairly claimed subsidies under a scheme that requires 70% of the biomass to be “sustainable”. On the other hand, Ofgem concluded that Drax “failed in complying with its profiling data obligations” from April 2021 to March 2022. The result was that the company paid a £25m voluntary penalty, or loose change in the context of £7bn of subsidies to date.The FCA’s investigation, at least, offers the possibility of a fuller and more detailed version of events. In regulatory terms, accurate reporting to investors and the market is a very big deal. Officials will be obliged to go deep. One can understand why Drax’s shares fell 7%.The fact of an investigation also raises a question for the government, which in Februaryagreed heads of terms with Drax to keep the subsidies rolling from 2027 to 2031. Michael Shanks, an energy minister, grumbled about the “unacceptably large profits” Drax has made over the years but said, in effect, that the government was over a barrel and had to back a smaller deal in order to keep the lights on. Drax generates about 5% of the country’s electricity and, unlike solar and wind, its power is firm.The point, though, is that the February deal has not yet been signed. Will ministers now wait until the FCA has concluded? “We will review the investigation’s findings when they become available,” said the energy security department, which doesn’t precisely answer the question. It ought to be straightforward: make ’em wait. The next deal involves £1.8bn of public money. When the sums are that large, surely you’d want to hear first what the financial regulator has to say on a basic question of governance.Explore more on these topicsDraxNils Pratley on financeEnergy industryBiomass and bioenergyEnergyRenewable energyNorth YorkshireFinancial Conduct AuthoritycommentShareReuse this content"

A man on the radio thinks you’re adisgrace. An influencer in a padded chair is shouting “athleticism in midfield” into a webcam. Both are earning handy six figures a year for doing so.The jungle plays tricks on your senses. It’s full of lies and illusions, the stench of disease, the ghosts of dead men, Nicky Butt’s latest take for BetMGM, Bruno Fernandes in a reconfigured midfield double‑pivot. Can you still tell the difference between the reality and the hallucination, between everyday life and the dream? Why haul a steamship across the jungle? Why bring the opera to Iquitos?But of course if you have to ask these questions, you shall never know the answers. Werner Herzog famously dragged a real 320-tonne steamship over the Andes while making his monumental, disaster‑strewn 1982 film Fitzcarraldo. Reflecting on the deeply troubled production, during which several crew members were injured and the shoot was marred by delays and screaming rows, Herzog dubbed himself the “Conquistador of the Useless”, a man driven by allegorical obsession and against his better judgment to see his pointless and morbidly outlandish vision into flesh.Which feels, amid the collateral damage and human wreckage, like a pretty on-the-nose description ofRuben Amorimright now. No special effects, no scale models, no shortcuts; just a fever of warped dreams and misshapen feelings projected at operatic pitch. Amorim will outperform you. He will outrubber you. He will outnumber you all over the pitch. He wants his opera house in the jungle and will ultimately get his opera house in the jungle. But first, he’s got to shift Antony and Jadon Sancho and squeeze Amad Diallo into a slightly awkward right wing-back role.Of course the tickling feather of ridicule has now come for Amorim himself. He’s a mad ideologue, an expensive folly, stubborn and inflexible, wedded to his doomed hulk of a 3-4-3 system, the last man on earth unable to clock that it isn’t working.He keeps saying and doing stupid things. He plays with a little magnetic tactics board. He crouches on the touchline and wears trainers, which is not inherently ludicrous, but we can work with it for now. This has basically become one long endless bit, the gag that keeps giving, an entire arm of the football content industry deeply embedded in the idea ofManchester Unitedbeing bad at football forever.View image in fullscreenFans protest at Manchester United’s game at Fulham last weekend.Photograph: John Patrick Fletcher/Action Plus/ShutterstockAgainst which it makes little difference to point out that United have quietly stopped doing all the things for which they were lampooned in the past: not having a defined identity, not having a footballing structure, throwing huge sums at ageing players on huge contracts. Whatever the problems were, they must now be the opposite:too muchidentity,too muchstructure, not enough proven quality.Nor does it help to explain that Amorim’s 3-4-3 is not some stone tablet but merely the framework into which his tactical flexibility is built: allowing for a low block or an aggressive high press, short possession football or long diagonals, stuffing the centre or loading the flanks. Or that 10 months and two windows is really very little time to undo expensive mistakes made years before he arrived. Or that Amorim’s United have actually looked sporadically dangerous in their two league games this season. The fine details, after all, are largely irrelevant. What matters is the cloak of thorns, the constant needling, those sweet rageful feelings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two games in and already the takes are being thrown out of the pram. Ditch Amorim now. Ditch the 3-4-3. And then what? Another rebuild? Another period of crude adaptation, another coach forced like Erik ten Hag to compromise and lose a piece of himself in the process? Another bouquet of fresh-cut dreams?Well, yes. This is what the United industrial complex has always demanded: more turmoil, more upheaval, more bloated failure and waste matter for the detritivores of the MUFC cinematic universe to consume. United can never simply be allowed to breathe, to brood, to be OK at football for a bit. Too much satire in this body politic; too much traffic to drive. We went into football media to tell the untold stories, find the hidden angles, and ended up surrendering to the numbers and leaning into United content in perpetuity. It’s not just the Glazer family that has been bleeding the club dry all these years.The institutional decay is basically terminal at this point; the long-term finances abject, the ownership malignant, the happiness of today mortgaged against the returns of tomorrow and the cultural lucre of yesterday. The ridicule is endemic. The roof is quite literally falling in. The fanbase, by small degrees, has been emotionally disengaging for the past decade. What remains? Who in their right mind can still believe in this?In which light, amid which maelstrom, Amorim’s flawed and final stand begins to take on a faintly devotional quality. Perhaps he may even be the last real thing at United, the only person still taking this project at face value, the only one treating this football club like a football club rather than an asset, a cash machine, an advertising space, a content source, a punchline, a theatre of the absurd.The jungle devours. The vines reclaim. The river always wins. The terrain is unfathomably hostile and every bright new thing must ultimately be strangled. Even the idea of imposing discipline and order on this rampant chaos feels like arch futility, a kind of category madness. Yet perhaps the futility is the point, a silken sporting vision to set against United’s hard corporate edges, a blanket of hallucinations that feels more real than the real. This is his mountain, his jungle, his steamship. And no opera house ever built itself.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimcommentShareReuse this content"

Next week, in Falmouth in Cornwall, anglers willcompete to fish for bluefin tunain a three-day tournament. Sponsored by companies including Suzuki and Shimano, it’s a festival of cruelty and destruction, waging war on a magnificent giant which, in a rare instance of ecological hope, has begun returning to our shores.Where’s the sport in this “sportfishing”? While some forms of angling require knowledge and skill, in this case the paying customer (the angler) sits in a boat while the professional skipper motors up and down, trailing a set of lures. When a tuna is hooked, the angler, strapped into a harness, either stands or sits in what is called the “fighting chair” and “plays” the fish to exhaustion: a one-sided fight of 30 minutes or more. It’s a risk-free means of pitting yourself against nature, a truly pathetic form of macho gratification. You can imagine my surprise on discovering thatNigel Farage is a big fan.Among the plastic warriors looking for an IRL game they can play from a chair, recreational tuna fishing is booming. While in 2024,93 licences were granted to charter boats and private boatscatering for the market, this year the government hasissued as many as 180. Obviously, the decision is backed by the best possible science, informed by knowledge of populations and of what happens to the fish after they are released …Sorry – went off on one there. Obviously not. The government tells me “there are no estimates of the number of bluefin tuna in UK waters”. There is also a dearth of studies on what happens to tuna once they have been caught and released, and none assessing the impacts of real-world tuna angling in the UK. The best we have is anAustralian studyof real angling conditions, which reports a bluefin survival rate of 83%: in other words, 17% die. The marine ecologist Dr Richard Kirby says mortality in real conditions “is likely to be higher than that seen when bluefin tuna are caught under scientific conditions where the post-release survival of the animal is crucial to the research”.Alongside a study conducted in circumstances far removed from the macho feeding frenzy we see in the videos posted by anglers and charter companies, the UK governmentrelies on skippersreporting fish that die beside the boat. There’s an obvious incentive to undercount. But rest assured: apaper for the governmenttells us “charter vessel interviewees reported no issues with their own reporting”.The great majority of deaths are likely to occur after release. Bluefin tuna arepartially warm-bloodedfish that overheat when forced into sustained flight. After a certain time on the hook, oxygen loss kills their muscle cells. They need to cool down as rapidly as possible once released, by diving deep, where the water is colder.Grey seals, minke whales and bluefin tuna: is the North Sea bouncing back to its glory days?Read moreThis is why the partnership set up by the government,Thunnus UK, states that “care should be taken not to release tuna in water shallower than 50m”. But thecode of conductagreed between the government and the recreational fishing lobby, the Angling Trust, specifies just 40 metres. Could this be because few of the inshore locations where tuna are caught in the UK are 50 metres deep? Even 50 might be too shallow: astudy off Irelandfound tuna immediately diving up to 80 metres after release.Skippers routinely break even this feeble code. I have watched recreational tuna boats fishing in the midst of great shoals of tuna within 100 metres of the shore, where the water is just 15 metres deep.The Falmouth tournament organisers claim that “the welfare of the fish is of paramount importance”. If so, that will be a radical break from common tuna-angling practice. On Facebook and Instagram, you can watch videos of men going mad on testosterone once they hook a fish, while the code of conduct walks the plank.Charter companies boastof two or even three anglers playing fish at once, though the code says “multiple hook-ups have been shown to risk an increase in mortality … Upon hook-up immediately remove other tackle from the water.” As one boat owner remarks, while bragging about a triple hook-up, “the carnage continues”. I have seen videos in whichtwo-hooked luresare used: the code says they should not be deployed “under any circumstances”. Anglers should “keep fight time to a minimum”, as an hour or more “may compromise” survival rates. Yet we see them crowing aboutplaying fish for 90 minutes. The code says “conventional gaffs [long hooks used to pierce the fish and hold it alongside the boat] should not be used”, but this is also ignored.On a podcast a few months ago, a charter boat skipper states: “I’ve seen loads of release shots on social media this year with fish going back.” His reaction? “They’re fucked.” Fishing News reports that for the first time last year, trawlers started pulling up “dead bluefin, some in an advanced state of decomposition … It is highly likely that this is linked to the expansion of the charter angling fishery in 2024.”Until recently, I thought the recreational fishery might become alobby for the tuna’s protectionagainst commercial fishing. What we see instead is a Klondike rush to profit from the male-inadequacy market. The renowned Cornish fisherAndrew Pascoe, who supports recreational angling in principle, says he has noticed some charter boats have started competing over who can catch the most in a day. “That for me was the beginning of the end … you can’t possibly revive the fish properly and catch 18 fish in a day.” Private boats (ie, those not for hire), he says, are the biggest problem. Some have no idea how to handle the fish, which break free, trailing lures, lines and spreader bars: a death sentence.A different industry could be developed, employing local people and generating income: tunawatching. It could be a massive attraction for tourists, photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. I have stood many times at a point on the coast where these vast fish leap from the water, catching garfish, sometimes in mid-air. It’s one of the greatest and most reliable natural spectacles on Earth. Who would not wish to be taken out on a boat to watch this marvel at close hand?I believe that all megafauna, bluefin tuna included, should be treated like whales and dolphins: as animals we no longer hunt or kill. Given that tuna fishing here is still in its infancy, which means the political costs of stopping it remain small, we could create a sanctuary in UK waters for a marvellous species pursued everywhere else.

Until they started digging 17m-long tunnelsRenate van der ZeeReintroduced for environmental reasons, beavers are now in danger of causing serious flooding. Should there be more culls?Thu 28 Aug 2025 05.34 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 08.07 EDTShareThe beaver has made an amazing comeback in the Netherlands. Extinct in the early 19th century, it was reintroduced in 1988, and now there are an estimated 7,000 beavers roaming around. Compared with England, where the beaver population isestimated at 500, that’s quite a feat.But there’s a significant downside to the booming Dutch beaver population. Beavers are increasingly digging burrows and tunnels under roads, railways and – even more worryingly –in dykes. For a country where a quarter of the land sits below sea level, this is not a minor problem – especially as beavers are not exactly holding back when digging.“We’ve found tunnels stretching up to 17 metres into a dyke. Wide enough for a grown man to fit in. That’s alarming,” says Jelmer Krom of the Rivierenland water board. Rivierenland is a region in the middle of theNetherlands, crisscrossed by big rivers, where dykes are crucial for keeping high water at bay. If a major dyke gives way, it would cause a serious flood affecting thousands of people.When it comes to the Dutch dykes, beavers tend to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Just when the water is high, they start digging in the dykes. When water levels rise and flood their burrow, they start digging higher up into the dyke. That’s how you end up with those long tunnels which put the dykes at risk.“When the water is really high, I’m lying in bed at night with my fingers crossed, praying the beavers aren’t wreaking havoc somewhere,” confesses Cindy de Jonge-Stegink, a beaver consultant in the north of the Netherlands. Up there, where the flood defences are often very narrow – sometimes just 15 metres wide – De Jonge-Stegink says they have come across beaver tunnels 10 metres long.It is quite a challenge to locate beaver burrows because their entrances are under water, and as yet there are no effective techniques for mapping them. During high water, special patrols go out at night with thermal-imaging cameras to spot where beavers are active, but this method doesn’t always yield the desired results.Also, when a beaver that’s causing problems is found, it can only be killedin exceptional circumstances, because beavers are a protected species in the Netherlands. Moving it doesn’t do much good either, as the beaver tends simply to return. So the Dutch have to turn to other methods to keep their beavers somewhat under control: making riverbanks less attractive to beavers by removing willow thickets, reinforcing dykes with mesh to make them beaver proof, or digging out and sealing burrows. It’s a lot of work, and it needs to be done more and more often.“Five years ago, we had to dig out a beaver burrow about 15 times a year in our region. That’s gone up to 40 or 50 times a year. And it’s costing us a pretty penny,” says Krom.In the hilly province of Limburg, a landscape more comparable to England, the problems are of a different nature. Beavers build dams in brook valleys, causing flooding issues for industry, farmers and locals. This is not as serious as a dyke breach in a polder landscape, below the water line, but it is still keenly felt.And as the beaver population grows rapidly, the animals increasingly venture into agricultural areas, where farmers find their tractors sinking into beaver burrows, or even into residential areas. “I know mothers who take their children to say goodnight to the beavers before bedtime. That makes my green heart leap,” says De Jonge-Stegink. “Until those beavers start digging up their gardens, of course.”Beaver damage is already costing the Dutchmillions of euros, and in the future the costs will only rise. Is it all worthwhile? The Dutch government, conservation managers and nature lovers think so. Because beavers, with their astonishing activities, enrich nature and promote biodiversity. By building dams, they create beaver ponds where all sorts of new plant and animal species emerge. With these dams they retain water, which is important as summers become increasingly dry. During rainy periods, their system of dams and canals helps with water drainage. And these are just a few examples of what beavers are capable of.Scheme to release beavers into wild in England has stalled, say nature expertsRead moreThat’s why these animals can evoke strong emotions in Dutch nature lovers. Some even think that human structures like transportation routes should work around the presence of beavers. Still, the northern Netherlands has recently introduced controls in the form of zoning – designating red zones where beavers are not welcome and culling is allowed.The state recognises the problem and has now rolled out a national beaver protocol. Previously each of the 12 Dutch provinces had its own beaver regulations, but now there’s one set of rules for everyone. This is a step forward, but in the future the Dutch might need to introduce zoning nationwide. It’s simply not realistic to allow beavers in vulnerable, low-lying polder areas – the risks are just too high.The Dutch beaver experiment comes with a sharp edge in spite of, or maybe because of, its success. Beavers are astounding, industrious environmental engineers – but you need to be quite sure about what you are doing when you invite them in.Renate van der Zee is a Dutch writer and journalistExplore more on these topicsWildlifeOpinionConservationBiodiversityRiversMammalsFarmingNetherlandscommentShareReuse this content"

Insulting nicknames for political enemies? Self-promotional merchandise for sale?This will all sound familiar unless you have been living in a bubble for the past decade. But if the description conjures an orange-tonedRepublicanin a golf cart – a wannabe dictator in a red tie down to his hefty thighs – your system needs an update.Because it turns out that Trump is not the only one who can play that game.TheCaliforniagovernor has spent the last few weeks mercilessly trolling Trump and his Maga followers by flipping the script. His press office is blasting out long, illogical social media posts, depicting Newsom as a muscular Adonis ready to save the world and suggesting his image should be carved in stone on Mount Rushmore or grace the cover of Time magazine wearing a crown and a grin.It’s been a master class in flipping the script – and maybe in political gamesmanship, too. With his social media profile soaring and political coffers filling up, these moves could even help Newsom gain access to the very White House that Trump has tackily transformed into a miniature Mar-a-Lago.Newsom’s counterpunching has earned the approval of everyone from the former president Barack Obama to Steve Bannon, the disreputable architect of some of Trump’s worst moves.“He’s no Trump but … he’s at least getting up there,” Bannon told Politico. “He looks like the only person in the Democratic party who is organizing a fight that they feel they can win.”Obama endorsedthe more serious side of what Newsom is up to – praising as “smart, measured, responsible” the governor’s plan to counter the recent Republican gerrymandering of Texas congressional districts with a redistricting measure in California to benefit Democrats.But Newsom’s newfound prominence isn’t pleasing everyone. The pro-Trump commenters on Fox News are disapproving, as if they haven’t spent a decade cheering the same techniques. Sean Hannity, the network’s chief Trump whisperer, trashed the trolling as a “performative confrontational style” that only works with “the loony radical base”.If that sounds familiar, so did the all-caps response from Newsom’s press office: “FOX HATES THAT I AM AMERICA’S FAVORITE GOVERNOR (‘RATINGS KING’) SAVING AMERICA – WHILE TRUMP CAN’T EVEN CONQUER THE ‘BIG’ STAIRS ON AIR FORCE ONE ANY MORE!!! … FOX IS LOSING IT BECAUSE WHEN I TYPE, AMERICA NOW WINS!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.”And Trump himself is clearly triggered. Weeks ago, he suggested Newsomshould be arrested. More recently he dusted off an old nickname: “Newscum”.But here, too, Newsom’s team punched back, posting a simple diss – three snowflake emojis.The script-switching is clever, and often downright funny; the humor is effective partly because Newsom’s real-life persona stands in stark contrast to Trump’s.Newsom is the California pretty boy – he looks like he eats only kale and quinoa, with an occasional helping of asparagus. His politics are progressive, if not sharply defined, and he is married to a woman of career accomplishment, Jennifer Siebel Newsom. She’s a documentary film-maker and actor, who (cover your ears, woke-fearing Magaworld!) has updated the role of first lady with a more gender neutral title: “First Partner.”The Democrats’ old aspiration, expressed by Michelle Obama, was “when they go low, we go high”. Too often that has translated into passivity and ineptitude. But since the low-high approach has failed – theDemocratsare powerless on the national level – Newsom’s moves are energizing.It’s too bad, of course, that insults and absurd memes have become the American way. But at least Newsom, and his social media team, are awfully good at it.As for where it all leads, maybe the answer is nowhere. Newsom’s counterpunch may be just another distraction as the nation falls into authoritarianism right before our eyes.Gavin Newsom is taking the fight to Trump – but for whom is he fighting? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe historian and author Garrett Graff wrote this week in hisDoomsday Scenario newsletterthat we’re already there: “The United States, just months before its 250th birthday as the world’s leading democracy, has tipped over the edge into authoritarianism and fascism … faster than I imagined possible.”Can strong leadership and a decisive, blue-wave vote in 2026’s midterms and 2028’s presidential election yank America back up?If so, radical change is necessary. Newsom’s approach – if combined with a strong, clear message of economic populism – could be a part of that.It could end up being not just funny but crucially important.Given where things stand, it’s worth a try.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsGavin NewsomOpinionSocial mediaDemocratsUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

This attack on journalists is an attack on democracy tooThu 28 Aug 2025 13.40 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 18.01 EDTShareThe decision by Nottinghamshire council’s Reform UK leader, Mick Barton, toban his councillorsfrom speaking to the Nottingham Post is as absurd as it is troubling. The recently elected leader of a council with a budget of £668m ought to be eager to communicate with residents about his plans. Yet Mr Barton’s skin is apparently so thin that just three months after winning power, he announced the boycott in response to a news report about local government reforms.An earlier row focused on a videointerviewgiven by James Walker-Gurley, which went viral after the cabinet member struggled to answer questions. This was embarrassing. But there was nothing unusual about the issues raised by the reporter, or about the local government story that prompted the ban. The Nottingham Post’s journalists were simply doing their job of scrutinising public authorities.Labour’s proposedoverhaul of local governmentin England is far-reaching. In counties including Nottinghamshire, ministers aim to replace multiple tiers with one and create new mayoralties. The area covered by Nottingham city council is likely to be expanded. It is right that such changes are debated, and unsurprising if local politicians disagree about the details. Yet rather than tell Mr Barton to stop picking fights with the press and concentrate on running the county, senior party colleagues, including the local MP Lee Anderson, have announced that they are joining in. They won’t talk to the Nottingham Post either.The paper, founded in 1878, has a strong track record despite facing huge challenges – along with other local news organisations – due to competition from social media and falling advertising sales. Last year, it successfullydefended a complaintfrom Nottinghamshire police after publishing a story that revealed how they had tried to hide details of their contact with Valdo Calocane before he murdered three people. Natalie Fahy, the editor, described this row as part of a pattern of encroachment on press freedoms.Just last month, Nigel Farage depicted himself as an enemy of censorship when announcing a policy ofrepealing online safety laws. But his failure to stand up for the press in Nottingham is as unsurprising as it is hypocritical. Mr Farage is against attempts by governments to regulate the internet – but not against Reform politicians rejecting norms of democratic scrutiny. He borrows the language of free expression only when it suits him.Given their party’s track record andfixation on immigration, it was never likely that the 670 men and women elected as Reform councillors in May, to run 10 councils mostly in the Midlands and north of England, would be the advocates that these communities need. But unlike Mr Farage, many of these new councillors were largely unknown figures, even in their communities. While all should not be tarred with the same brush, it is disturbing to see such petulance and illiberalism displayed in Nottingham so early in the new council’s term of office.If events in Nottinghamshire were repeated at a national level, this could mean a government refusing to speak to sections of the press or, say, the BBC. This is a chilling prospect. But the local consequences must be taken seriously too. Local news sources, and journalists whose job it is to scrutinise decision-makers, are not a throwback or an adjunct to democracy. They are a vital part of it.Explore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionRegional & local newspapersLocal governmentNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesNottinghamFreedom of speecheditorialsShareReuse this content"

Will the US heed it?Thu 28 Aug 2025 13.40 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 18.01 EDTShareWednesday night brought a grim return to Russia’s form: one of the heaviest air raids on Kyiv since the full-scale invasion began. Moscow eased off its strikes on major cities in the run-up to the Alaska summit, and it held off its attack on the Ukrainian capital until Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy, had finished his visit there. But within hours of his departure, at least 18 people,including several children, were dead in an attack on a residential block, and the European Union mission had been severely damaged.Donald Trump periodically suggests that he is drawing a line forVladimir Putin. Yet each time he appears to set a limit, the Russian president breezes through it. The Kyiv attack shows that it is Mr Putin who is testing the US president. Mr Trump threatened “severe consequences” if Moscow did not immediately agree to a ceasefire – but in Anchorage was quickly persuaded by Mr Putin that there was no need for one prior to a peace deal.“I think in many ways he’s there,” Mr Trumptold reporterson Tuesday. But Russia’sdiplomatic stalling, allowing it to continue to grind away on the battlefield, is transparent. The lethal strike on civilians in Kyiv shows exactly what it thinks of peace talks. As Mr Trump alsoremarked: “Every conversation I have with [Mr Putin] is a good conversation. And then unfortunately, a bomb is loaded up into Kyiv or someplace, and then I get very angry about it.”The US president appears unable to draw the obvious conclusion, and his anger has yet to convert into action. He continues to cast blame on Volodymyr Zelenskyy (“not exactly innocent either”) for Russia’s unprovoked invasion. Mr Trump floated the idea of sanctions again, but only when pressed. His one concrete move –doubling the tariff on most Indian goods to 50%– was billed as punishment for New Delhi’s Russian oil imports.In fact, those imports had been quietlyencouragedby Washington to steady world markets, and European countries have bought oil from India once it has been refined. The real trigger was India’srefusalto scrap farm protections, an issue for Mr Trump’s base. This was domestic politics rebadged as Russia policy, and a headache for New Delhi, not for Moscow.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, accused Moscow of targeting the EU in its Wednesday night strike. That’s unlikely to worry the White House. European leaders know that their ability to shape its worldview is restricted and intermittent. The result may last only until Mr Trump’s next conversation, or next glimpse of a talking head on Fox News.They continue to make maximal efforts and compromises for limited returns. The US has reportedlystopped sharing informationon any potential Ukraine-Russia deal even with the members of the anglophone Five Eyes intelligence-sharing community.Given that, European governments are unlikely to get carried away by thereported willingnessof the US to contribute intelligence and air support to a postwar force in Ukraine. Whether the posited reassurance force will actually materialise, and if so in what form, remains to be seen. But in the absence of the ceasefire that would have to precede it, Europe must make clear that it will not waver in its support for Kyiv. In probing Mr Trump’s intentions, Mr Putin is also probing Europe’s resolve. It cannot afford to fail this test.Explore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionEuropeRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpTrump tariffsIndiaeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromChristopher LucasandTony OrchardThu 28 Aug 2025 13.19 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 18.01 EDTShareSimon Jenkins offers some interesting thoughts on the style of the future monarchy when Prince William becomes king (As William moves to Forest Lodge, an era of pushbike royals beckons. Will that save the monarchy?, 21 August). A good start would be to repeal the Act of Supremacy that currently binds the sovereign to the role of supreme governor of the Church of England. The future monarch should be free to choose their own religion, this being more representative of multicultural Britain.As constitutional monarchs, William and his wife should continue to set good examples to the nation of living worthwhile lives. There is also the representational role of head of state in entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries. These are very demanding roles that require a reasonable amount of downtime to live a normal family life away from intrusive media coverage. The sovereign needs some support from their immediate family, and it would be reasonable to offer royal status for up to four supporters and partners, who meet the required standards and are willing participants.The choice of Forest Lodge as a principal residence in the private part of the Windsor Great Park should be ideal for privacy, but is also conveniently located to attend formal state events at Windsor Castle. The handing over of Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace to Historic Royal Palaces also makes sense, with the balcony at Buckingham Palace still being available as a focal point for major state events in central London.Finally, there is the matter of the private estates at Sandringham and Balmoral. As there is an acute shortage of affordable housing to rent in the UK, it would be a sensible gesture for the royal family to convert both of these estates into trusts to fund the provision of affordable housing developments for rentals around the UK.Balmoral in particular has lots of scope to increase revenue from visitor ventures. Bolthole properties on both estates could be retained for the exclusive use of the royal family.Ian GrahamPort Carlisle, CumbriaWhat to do with Buckingham Palace? Perhaps a better answer to Simon Jenkins’ suggestion would be to convert the palace and its great garden into a fit-for-purpose, modern Houses of Parliament with all necessary services and outbuildings, and turn the present dilapidated and unsuitable Westminster complex into a fabulous public centre serving as a museum, art gallery and national forum at the foot of Big Ben.Christopher LucasFormer director, Royal Society of ArtsSimon Jenkins’ article on the potential redundancy of the royal palaces particularly mentions Buckingham Palace and its private gardens. Earlier articles have highlighted the need for thePalace of Westminsterto be restored at a cost of billions of pounds and the decision on whether to decant or restore around function. It has been mooted previously, but discounted due to the ongoing restoration of Buckingham Palace (now almost completed), but there is a strong case for it to become home to at least the House of Lords. There is a delightful precedent in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris, which is the home to the senate and the Luxembourg Gardens that are open to the public.Tony OrchardExeterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Formally speaking, there was no such place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when several of these objects were produced.The showcase is situated within a larger gallery devoted to the “Islamic Middle East”: a framework that erases the historic presence of Christians and Jews in the region. The V&A possesses interesting Jewish textiles from Iraq, but alas there is no space for them in the section dedicated here to “Ottoman embroidery”. Context is everything in museums nowadays. A pluralistic approach is essential to reflect regional complexity and acknowledge alternative narratives.Abigail GreenProfessor of modern European history, University of OxfordMichal FriedlanderBerlinExplore more on these topicsTextile artV&AMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territorieslettersShareReuse this content"

I think the UK is about to find out, 21 August). Born in 1953, passed the 11-plus, joined the 8% who went to university and spent a lifetime in white-collar jobs that paid well enough for housing and pensions. Not all smooth sailing – four or five redundancies – but each came with a lump sum and a decent job soon after. And I was a basic rate taxpayer for all but a few years.Now I’ve got assets far beyond my needs, and children who don’t need my money. But Inman misses why many of us hold on to what we have: we’ve seen decades of social care failure and want to ensure that we can afford the eye-watering costs ahead. The housing market doesn’t help – ageing households face an archaic property-exchange system. We tackled it when we had to, but there’s no urgency now. And the idea that the private sector will provide? Not when Guardian columns are full of service-charge horror stories. Why dive into shark-infested waters?Every age group votes in their self-interest, not just the old. Since 1974, none of my votes were cast for personal gain. Mortgage tax relief, bus pass, triple lock – grateful, yes, but they didn’t sway me. And if they’re taken away, I won’t vote out of spite.It’s older generations who still give time to the community. We’re no longer a clubbable society – working men’s clubs, political parties and professional associations are collapsing. People in their 30s to 50s aren’t stepping up when boomers step down. Yet Inman expects us to act collectively and patriotically.By all means, pluck my feathers – but do it in such a way that I won’t squeal.Ged ParkerWashington, Tyne and WearPhillip Inman is correct that the over-65s own a disproportionate share of family homes, but his attack on them otherwise is rather absurd. One of the main reasons there is a housing shortage is Margaret Thatcher’s misguided selling-off of council houses that were never replaced. As he points out, many retired people would like to move, but there is a severe shortage of smaller homes, and many people, rightly, don’t want to move a long way from where they live.Inman should quit dumping on seniors and put the blame for the housing crisis where it mostly belongs – on the UK’s complete failure for five decades to invest in building affordable housing. But his most absurd claim is that boomers should give “more of their time to local communities rather than jetting off on several holidays a year”.First, older people do take holidays, but it is families with children who take the most holidays every year. Second, boomers are the most active volunteer sector in the UK, with 58% of those aged 65 to 74 volunteering in 2023-24. Retirees are helping run food banks, libraries, refugee centres, hospitals, charity shops and environmental groups, saving the public sector billions every year. We should be thanking them for their service.Jean McKendreeWestow, North YorkshireWhen I worked, and I worked for 50 years, I would have been happy with a tiny living space as I spent all my time working. Now that I’m retired, I have very little money (no final salary-based pension and holidays for me), so I need a garden and space for my hobbies, and to accommodate my grandchildren to allow my daughter to work. Why do people assume that old people need a tiny space? I need space to fill my time and keep healthy in mind and body. Tiny spaces would mean endless daytime TV for me; I’d rather die.Mary StrodeGlasgowPhilip Inman has hit the nail exactly. Where do boomers downsize to? Certainly not to one of the plethora of two-bed flats with tiny balconies. It isn’t just the family house that he is asking us to give up, but our gardens too. One of the real pleasures of retirement is having time to garden. It also keeps me fit. I am trying to downsize. But if I want a garden, I have to move into a family house, albeit perhaps a smaller one.Mary BoltonLondonI read the replies to Phillip Inman’s piece on boomer downsizing (Letters, 22 August;Letters, 26 August). Here in the US, there is the same problem, but with much more clarity. Boomers who tire of rattling around in a 2,500-plus sq ft house and paying the taxes on the same (could be $8,000 or more a year) could move to the mixed-use/multi-family developments that they have voted against for the past 20 to 30 years. If they had permitted some of that to be built, they could continue to live in the neighbourhoods they have grown old in, with the same access to healthcare, shops, restaurants etc as before. But they chose to deny young people or simply those who didn’t want a house and yard that choice. I hope they are happy with the consequences of that choice.Paul BeardSeattle, Washington, USExplore more on these topicsOlder peopleHousingCommunitiesGenerational inequalityVolunteeringVoluntary sectorlettersShareReuse this content"

When Ukrainian refugees were brought to the UK, they were housed with host families and thus had a chance to lead something like a normal life here. Why not do the same with asylum seekers?Not all of us are xenophobes, and many people with rooms available would be willing to accommodate a vulnerable person or family while their applications are processed. This would give them a chance to acclimatise to their new environment and allow them to be treated with dignity and compassion.Brenda HallBryn Saith Marchog, DenbighshireThe government’s recent difficulty over hotels for asylum seekers (Labour plans in turmoil after Epping hotel blocked from housing asylum seekers, 19 August) is an opportunity to revive and update the Homes for Ukraine idea, but for refugees from Afghanistan, Sudan, Eritrea etc. There are charities all over the country that already facilitate this, but government support, and money, would enable rapid expansion of community hosting.Roger van SchaickNottinghamHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Oh no, you have one of the best attackers in the world. Oh no, you got him for a bargain price. Oh no, he won you the Club World Cup last month. Still, no side ever wants to be completely reliant on one player. Chelsea aim to depend more on the collective than the individual. They have struggled without Palmer in the past but thrived in his absenceagainst West Hamlast week. Palmer withdrew with a groin injury during the warm-up and is a doubt to face Fulham in the Saturday lunchtime kick-off. However Enzo Maresca has options. Estêvão Willian came in for Palmer against West Ham and was exceptional on the right wing. João Pedro and Pedro Neto were excellent. Chelsea have enough talent at their disposal to beat Fulham without Palmer.Jacob SteinbergChelsea v Fulham, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)2Will stubborn Amorim get ruthless?Ruben Amorim has to end Saturday afternoon with only one thing achieved: a first victory of the season that will quieten the noise around him andManchester United. Burnley will arrive at Old Trafford with the opposite aim and should closely study how Grimsby took Amorim’s insipid men apart in Wednesday’s 12-11 penalty shootout knockout in the Carabao Cup. So: now is the time for the head coach to ruthless and select an XI that has Bruno Fernandes as one of his 10s, Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield, Benjamin Sesko at centre-forward for a first Premier League start and, dare this correspondent suggest it, a tweak of formation to 4-3-3 as his beloved 3-4-3 just is not working. Will the stubborn Amorim do any of this? The latter – almost certainly not.Manchester United vBurnley, Saturday 3pm3Frank will work his Spurs players hardA niche statistic, this, but hugely important for the nine individuals destined for a day of extended heel-kicking on the Tottenham bench. Last weekend, in the Premier League’s second matchday of the season, the average time of the first substitution made by top-flight teams was the 54th minute; ignoring those forced by early injuries bumps that up to the 63rd. Tottenham made their first substitution in the 78th minute, and in this young season they andNottingham Forestare already the only teams yet to have made a change before the 70th minute of a Premier League game. The average Spurs substitute this season spends just 11 minutes on the pitch, joint lowest in the league (level with Forest and also Bournemouth, whose number is skewed by the two 89th-minute changes they made in response to falling behind late in their opening game at Anfield). Last season the team whose substitutes spent the least time on the field was Thomas Frank’s Brentford. This might be surprising, given the intensity Frank demands of his players and that particularly characterised Spurs’s win at Manchester City last week, but his members of his starting XI need to get used to hard work and long shifts, and the rest of his squad to splinters.Tottenham vBournemouth, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenThomas Frank is relentless and he expects the same of his players.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images4Wissa to miss out on friends reunionAlthough Yoane Wissa yearns to move to north-east England the Brentford forward seems unlikely to feature against old friends atSunderland. The problem is that Wissa wants to join Newcastle but his club are determined to keep him and the resultant upset has prompted his absence from Keith Andrews’s teamsheets this season. That may please Régis Le Bris. Sunderland’s manager knows Wissa very well after spending countless hours honing the DR Congo forward’s game during his time as a coach at Lorient. Wissa – who also played alongside Sunderland’s Enzo Le Fée at the Breton club – moved on to Brentford before Le Bris’s promotion to Lorient’s head coach and shortly after a horrendous, life changing event. For a while an unprovoked attack involving acid being thrown in the striker’s face placed that move to west London in jeopardy. Initial fears that Wissa, who still needs daily eye drops, could be blinded, explains why the 28-year-old’s subsequent success has so delighted Le Bris, Le Fée and his old pals from Brittany.Louise TaylorSunderland vBrentford, Saturday 3pm5Moyes to unleash Dibling in attack?The pieces are slowly falling into place for David Moyes. Everton’s manager, whose priority has shifted towards beefing up his defensive options, made it clear he needed reinforcements after starting pre-season with 15 senior players and in Tyler Dibling he landed a key target. The 19-year-old right winger, who at £42m the club’s second-most expensive buy, is a raw but talented performer who has been tracked by Europe’s elite and even if his early promise faded at Southampton, his arrival atEvertonshould be seen as a coup. Dibling entered off the bench in Everton’s Carabao Cup victory over Mansfield in midweek and is building fitness after a disrupted pre-season. A trip to Molineux gives Moyes a first real opportunity to blend his new-look attack after the arrivals of Dibling, Jack Grealish, Thierno Barry and Carlos Alcaraz, the Argentinian who spent the second half of last season on loan at the club.Ben FisherWolves v Everton, Saturday 3pm6Longstaff to prove point against old club?The knee injuries sustained by Ao Tanaka and Ethan Ampadu are bad news for Leeds. But they do open a door for Sean Longstaff to start in midfield for Daniel Farke’s side when his old team visit Elland Road. Earlier this summer Rafael Benítez, Longstaff’s former manager at Newcastle, congratulated his former protege on deciding to make a new start in West Yorkshire after losing his first-team place at the club he has loved since boyhood. Now Longstaff has a chance to show Eddie Howe what he is missing and, with injuries to Sandro Tonali and Joelinton weakening Newcastle’s midfield, opportunity beckons for the £12m Tynesider. If Farke will be relieved at Alexander Isak’s continued non-involvement, Leeds need to banish the memory of last Saturday’schastening 5-0 defeatat Arsenal. Without the still on strike Isak, Newcastle have taken one point from two games but were unlucky tolose 3-2at home to Liverpool on Monday. Even with Anthony Gordon starting a three-match suspension, they cannot be underestimated.LTskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kostoulas, an 18-year-old striker who cost an initial £30m from Olympiakos, was also handed his debut by Fabian Hürzeler for the last 12 minutes at the Kassam Stadium as his experimental side set up a trip to Barnsley in the next round. Brighton are keen to shift some of their fringe players before next week’s transfer deadline, meaning there should be more opportunities for both to establish themselves in the coming weeks. But Hürzeler is clearly in no rush and would not confirm if Tzimas, who cost £20m from Nürnberg in February, could faceManchester Cityon Sunday. “For sure he’s closer but I’m not sure if he might be an option for the weekend, we have to see how he reacts,” said the Brighton head coach. “We have to be very patient with him and let’s see what will be the next step.”Ed AaronsBrighton v Manchester City, Sunday 2pm8Freakish West Ham numbers mean only way is upThere was a period at the end of last season when it felt that perhaps West Ham were close to getting somewhere – they may have won only four of their last 16 games but of their seven defeats in that period not one was by more than a single goal and they would have banked several more points had they not conceded result-changing goals in the 89th minute or later against Everton,Liverpool, Southampton and Brighton. But if they were unlucky then, it was nothing compared with their start to this season. Sure, they have played poorly, but they have also converted 24 shots into one goal, no points and last place while Forest, for example, have turned 20 shots into four goals, four points and fifth. Meanwhile at the other end of the pitch 55% of all shots taken against them have been on target, and two-thirds of those – 36.4% of the total number of shots they have conceded – have gone in. These are unsustainably freakish numbers: in none of the last five completed seasons has any team seen as many as 16% of the shots their opponents have taken go in. Things can only get better – can’t they?Nottingham Forest v West Ham, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenWest Ham’s Jarrod Bowen has been in the news this week.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA9An Anfield baptism for excited EzeEberechi Eze’s reaction to being handed the No 10 shirt by Arsenal demonstrated what a return to the Emirates Stadium meant to the boyhood Gunners fan. It was a combination of astonishment and childlike joy, the response of a genuine fan rather than a hardened professional, and prompted Eze to pledge to “give everything I have” to pay back the honour of following in the footsteps of Dennis Bergkamp and other Arsenal favourites. There could be no better place to start repaying a £67.5m investment than at Anfield, a ground where Arsenal have not won since 2012 and their title pretensions have withered on several subsequent visits. With Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard injury doubts, and Kai Havertza confirmed absentee, Eze is likely to make his Arsenal debut against the Premier League champions. He may well start as a 10, or in his anticipated role on the left, depending on the options available to Mikel Arteta. Either way, Eze will relish wearing that shirt in competitive action for the first time.Andy HunterLiverpool vArsenal, Sunday 4.30pm10Malen could pep up flat VillaAston Villa host Crystal Palace with the clubs in contrasting moods. Palace will arrive at Villa Park fresh from qualifying for the Conference League league phase afterprogressing against Fredrikstadin Norway, while Villa are stuck in the mud. Villa’s season may only be two games old but an uninspiring stalemate against Newcastle and defeat at Brentford have doused optimism. Unai Emery’s side have dropped their intensity and the Villa manager has to find a formula to hurt a stubborn Palace defence. Emery must be tempted to turn to Donyell Malen, who has been almost exclusively used as a substitute since signing in a £20m deal from Borussia Dortmund in January, having made just two league starts for Villa. Malen would be a more natural winger than John McGinn, even if the captain is capable of operating off the flanks. Evann Guessand, who provided a spark off the bench on his debut, is another obvious option. Another flat performance is unthinkable, even at this early stage.BFAston Villa vCrystal Palace, Sunday 7pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2662Tottenham Hotspur2563Liverpool2364Chelsea2445Nottm Forest2246Man City2237Sunderland2138Everton2139AFC Bournemouth2-1310Brentford2-1311Burnley2-1312Leeds2-4313Fulham20214Crystal Palace20215Newcastle2-1116Man Utd2-1117Aston Villa2-1118Brighton2-2119Wolverhampton2-5020West Ham2-70Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendArsenalTottenham HotspurLiverpoolChelseaNottingham ForestManchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The reverse means the side are without a victory this season, having also lost to Arsenal and drawn with Fulham in the league, putting pressure on them before their home game with Burnley on Saturday. United are understood to have no plans to sack Amorim but there is a sense at the club that if results do not turn his stubbornness may prompt him to walk away – possibly as early as next week during the international break – rather than change his methods.Ruben Amorim says ‘something has to change’ at United. What should that be?Read moreAfter last season’s record low Premier League finish of 15th, the poor run is sparking questions of Amorim from within the squad, the Guardian understands. The head coach’s insistence on a 3-4-3 formation is causing particular scrutiny after earning 27 points in 29 league matches.There is also bemusement regarding his man-management approach, which is viewed by many players as well-meaning but sometimes counter-productive.After the Grimsby loss Amorim said “something has to change” but he is viewed at United as being wedded to his formation, so there is no expectation that was a reference to altering the shape he also used consistently – and successfully – at Sporting in his previous job.Jason Wilcox, the director of football, is thought to be aware of the problems regarding Amorim’s tactics and handling of his players and may move to address these.Amorim also said after the Grimsby match: “Let’s focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through.”Quick GuideBesiktas sack Solskjær after eliminationShowBesiktas have sacked the former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær after they were knocked out of the Conference League play-offs by Lausanne.Besiktas were beaten 1-0 at home by the INEOS-owned Lausanne on Thursday night, with the former Arsenal striker Nathan Butler-Oyedeji scoring the only goal in first-half stoppage-time before Besiktas had Felix Uduokhai sent off early in the second half, giving Lausanne a 2-1 aggregate win.A Besiktas statement said: \"Our contract with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær has been terminated following a decision made at the board meeting. Following the meeting, our chairman, Serdal Adali, thanked Solskjær for his services to date.\"The Norwegian took charge of the Super Lig club in January - his first coaching role since leaving United in November 2021 - and guided them to fourth by the end of last season.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.United’s match with Burnley is their last before the international break. The message from within Old Trafford on Thursday was that it remained business as usual. United resume after the break with the derby at Manchester City on 14 September.One player who will not feature again for United is Alejandro Garnacho. The winger – one of the players Amorim was keen to move on – appears likely to move to Chelsea. The two clubs have finally agreed a £40m deal with a 10% sell-on fee.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

She left the court with just one game to her name, losing 6-0, 6-1.That first encounter between Raducanu and Rybakina was a good representation of the difficulties Raducanu has had to navigate over the past few years: the pressure from her sudden rise, her underpowered game against the best players in the world and the fact that there was always another physical issue around the corner.Raducanu thrashes Ena Shibahara for first US Open victory since 2021 titleRead moreAs she faces the Kazakh again on Friday, the British No 1’s form underscores the consistent progress she has finally made in recent months. Raducanu has lost only six games in her first two matches at the US Open against Ena Shibahara and Janice Tjen and is playing quality tennis, serving confidently and pressuring her opponents by taking the ball early and forcing herself inside the baseline.However, her two opponents were qualifiers who have never broken the top 100. Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, represents an enormous step up in quality and class. The 26-year-old is the best server in the women’s game, leading the tour in service games won, service points won and aces. She backs up that with some of the cleanest groundstrokes in the sport, generating easy pace off both wings. As she showed with her demolition of Aryna Sabalenka two weeks ago in Cincinnati, nobody is safe from being hit off the court when Rybakina is in full flow.Raducanu’s decision to hire Francisco Roig as her new coach was rooted in trying to improve her game in order to be better equipped to counter the elite players and biggest ball strikers, having lost to Sabalenka in Cincinnati and Wimbledon. Now she will have another chance to measure her progress.“I do want to see how my game suits and fits against the top,” said Raducanu. “I still think I have a long way to go, but I think I have been making steps towards getting closer and narrowing that gap. I think I have to take confidence from my matches against Aryna in Cincy and Wimby.”View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie will play Novak Djokovic in a grand slam for the second time this year.Photograph: Ella Ling/ShutterstockAs Raducanu tackles one of the toughest opponents in this year’s women’s draw, Cameron Norrie finds himself up against the greatest player in any men’s draw. Just a few months after their meeting in the fourth round of the French Open, Norrie faces Novak Djokovic for a seventh time.This has been an eventful summer for Norrie, who returned to his favourite surface during the North American hard-court swing hopeful that his excellent quarter-final run at Wimbledon would propel him to greater heights, but he instead struggled with his physical condition in the heat. While his durability has long been one of his biggest assets, for once it was a problem.Norrie addressed those issues with a tough pre-US Open training block in the brutal heat at Texas Christian University, his alma mater, and he has performed well in New York. At the end of a tense, attritional four-hour match against Francisco Comesaña on Wednesday, he managed his nerves well and found a way to close out the match to reach the third round.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Norrie should head into this match believing that this is his best opportunity to push him to the limit.“I will say the chances are getting better as the years get on, but I would not say by much,” said Norrie. “But the level he brings, the competitiveness he brings is crazy. Every time I’ve played him, he’s changing his tactics and making it really difficult for me to play. So I’m just ready for anything. Him to play unreal. Him to play not great. Him to be stopping the match for something and then playing really good. I think he’s so, so good at competing and tactics. He’s amazing. So I’m going to have to be ready for anything and I want to just beat him with tennis and physicality.”Djokovic has not competed since Wimbledon after opting to prioritise his time with his family and his suboptimal preparation has clearly played a part in his two unimpressive wins over Learner Tien and Zachary Svajda.Djokovic struggled physically in his first-round match against Tien, who repeatedly dragged him into long, attritional exchanges, and emerged from them in far better condition. While Norrie will attempt to exploit the 38-year-old’s waning physicality even more effectively than those before him, it remains to be seen if Djokovic will allow him to get close.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisEmma RaducanuTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesPermanent move to Goodison Park and return of long-term injury absentees brings sense of optimism for Brian Sørensen’s squadByTom GarryThu 28 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 19.29 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:8th (NB: this is not necessarily Tom Garry’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position:8thProspectsEverton are entering the season with a fairly unfamiliar sense of optimism. It marks a sharp contrast from the mood 12 months ago and a troubled first half of the last campaign, when their threadbare squad was stretched, their serious injury list was mounting and the wider club was waiting agonisingly for news of a takeover.Everton transfer ownership of Goodison Park to their women’s teamRead moreAmid that uncertainty and what was – at the time – a low budget, some were tipping Everton for relegation and the team had to wait until 17 November for their first league victory. But once they had won that Merseyside derby their confidence soared and the morale-boosting acquisition of the club by The Friedkin Group not only gave the players a lift but ensured there were funds to spend in January, and they enjoyed a much-improved second half of the season to finish a comfortable 14 points clear of the relegation zone in a respectable eighth place.Everton have strengthened their squad markedly this summer with some eye-catching signings, not least the arrival of three Japan internationals – the forward Yuka Momiki, full-back Hikaru Kitagawa and centre-back Rion Ishikawa – and their fans will be looking forward to welcoming back some longer-term knee-injury absentees from last season, such as the Spain forward Inma Gabarro, who has been in impressive form during pre-season after missing almost all of last term with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.Nobody should be getting too carried away – Everton have not suddenly become a team who will challenge for the league – but equally there is no reason for the club to fear the drop. A top-half finish is a realistic aim and they will certainly want to improve on last season.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerBrian Sørensen, the second-longest-serving manager in the division behind Manchester United’s Marc Skinner, has been in charge since the summer of 2022 and is entering his fourth season. In April he signed a new deal until 2027. The Dane spent large parts of last season looking thoroughly dejected about Everton’s injury problems but he has a healthier squad and will surely have enjoyed the team’s pre-season trip to his homeland. Sørensen is a relatively quiet, family man with a good reputation for his style of football and it will be interesting to see what he can achieve with better resources.Off-field pictureThe Friedkin Group has reinvigorated the mood around the women’s team and there has been a significant uplift in the number of off-field staff. The biggest change, however, came with the historic move to make Goodison Park the women’s team’s new home. That not only ensured the 133-year-old ground was saved but dramatically improves the women’s team’s matchday facilities compared with their former base at Walton Hall Park, which had the league’s smallest capacity at just over 2,000.Last season’s resultsStar signingThere is a lot of excitement concerning the Spain youth international winger Ornella Vignola, who has arrived from Granada. The former Barcelona youngster caught Everton’s eye because she likes to take defenders on and her direct running should offer the club’s attack a new dimension. She has plenty of experience for a 20-year-old, including playing in the Champions League, and was part of the Spain squad that won the Under-20 World Cup alongside Gabarro in 2022. Everton’s loan acquisition of Katie Robinson from Aston Villa will give them another skilful option in wide areas.Stepping upNearly 18 months ago Issy Hobson grabbed the headlines by becoming the WSL’s youngest goalscorer at the age of 16 with alast-gasp equaliser against Arsenal. The defender, now 17, gained valuable experience in the second tier during a loan with Sheffield United last term and it will be intriguing to see how much the England youth international can push on this season and how much more first-team exposure she can gain. There are also high hopes for Everton’s young player of last season, Martina Fernández, who made her switch from Barcelona permanent this summer after a loan.View image in fullscreenIssy Hobson celebrates the goal that made her the youngest ever goalscorer in the WSL.Photograph: Emma Simpson/EFC/Getty ImagesIt was a good summer for …The Everton winger Toni Payne was part of the Nigeria side that triumphed in Morocco by winning the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations title, extending their record as the continent’s most successful team withtheir 10th title, and their first in seven years. Payne received a rapturous reception from her club-mates when she returned for pre-season after her country’s 3-2 victory over the hosts in the final. The 30-year-old appeared in all 22 of Everton’s league fixtures last term and will be a key player againwith her pace and strong ball control.Main initiative to attract more fansView image in fullscreenGoodison Park, which is now the home of Everton’s women’s team.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAAs well as making Goodison Park their main home ground, Everton’s women are playing a fixture at the club’s new Hill Dickinson Stadium on the banks of the River Mersey. They will host Manchester United at the 52,000-capacity venue on 12 October, hoping to attract more fans to support the women’s side. They are also attempting to boost the region’s grassroots prospects by letting out their former home, Walton Hall Park, to the third-tier club Liverpool Feds.Explore more on these topicsWSL season previews 2025-26Everton WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And it looked like a repeat was on the cards as Tebogo led from the gun.Soaring Nicola Olyslagers gears up for worlds with Diamond League crownRead moreBut in the final strides the American finally got his vest in front to take victory – and the $30,000 (£22,000) prize – in 19.74sec, with Tebogo 0.02sec back in second. It was a much-needed confidence booster for Lyles after two recent defeats in the 100m, as he took his sixth Diamond League final win.“Six in a row, the most in track!” said Lyles. “It is pretty nice to have that. I saw Letsile lean on the finish line but I knew I won. I knew if I panicked I was not going to win. If you are tight you are done for.”Elsewhere it was a good night for British athletes as Max Burgin nearly took down the men’s Olympic 800m champion and Georgia Hunter Bell ran a personal best in the women’s 800m.Burgin has long been compared toSebastian Coe, but a series of injuries has left the 23-year-old unable to fulfil his potential. But he will gain immense confidence slugging it out with Emmanuel Wanyonyi before finishing in 1min 42.42sec, his second quickest time.“Today was a bit of a world championships field, like a test,” said Burgin, who was just 0.05sec behind Wanyonyi in second. “I am dreaming of being at the exact same position at the worlds.”View image in fullscreenGeorgia Hunter Bell was edged on the line by Switzerland’s Audrey Werro in the 800m.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesHunter Bell was just as impressive as she weaved her way from fifth to second in the final 200m to finish in 1:55.96 – a career-best time by half a second and the third fastest time in British history behind her training partner Keely Hodgkinson and Jemma Reekie.However the Briton, whohas opted to run the 800mrather than the 1500m in Tokyo, was unable to get past the young Swiss star Audrey Werro, who delighted the home fans to win in 1:55.91.Sebastian Coe says that World Athletics’ decision to introduce mandatory female sex-verification testing last month has now been “overwhelmingly” backed by athletes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it wasn’t without its challenges. But there will be athletes that will be tested, even in their holding camps in Tokyo. We’re hitting slightly more than 90% now.”The SRY gene reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is the indicator of biological sex. The test has also been approved by World Boxing when it introduced mandatory sex testing for all boxers.Coe acknowledged that some competitors had struggled to get tested, with CBC in Canada quoting an unnamed athlete saying they had to drive five hours to get a test. But he said that such cases were unusual, and those who hadn’t yet been tested would have the cheek-swab test when they arrived in Japan.“By and large the process has gone pretty smoothly, but it’s not been without its challenges,” he said. “France has its own national laws around it, so many of their athletes have been tested outside of the country.

The fee includes £5m of add-ons.Germany’s ‘Big Nick’ Woltemade brings nicknames and goals to main stageRead moreHis arrival would end Eddie Howe’s long search for a striker. After being rejected by, among others, Liam Delap, Hugo Ekitiké, João Pedro and Benjamin Sesko during a close season blemished by Isak’s decision to go on strike as the forwardattempts to force a move to Anfield, this breakthrough will come as a huge relief to Newcastle’s manager.It should also almost certainly preface a fresh bid from Liverpool for Isak. Newcastle haverebuffed one £110m offerfrom the Premier League champions but, given the Swede’s refusal to return to training or playing, it is thought a sum nearer £130m may be sufficient.With Callum Wilson having joined West Ham and deep uncertainty surrounding Isak, Howe remains in the market for two strikers. This week Newcastle had a second, £55m bid rejected for Wolves’ Jørgen Strand Larsen and it appears unlikely the Norway international will be allowed to leave.Negotiations for Brentford’s DR Congo striker Yoane Wissa remain ongoing but have proved complicated with Newcastle having at least two bids turned down for a player who appears to be intent on a transfer to St James’ Park.Although an element of doubt surrounds the precise figure Newcastle are paying for Woltemade, it will be a club record fee, eclipsing the £63m invested in recruiting Isak from Real Sociedad three years ago.Howe will be particularly delighted with another figure. Having wanted to add real height to his already physically powerful team, he has now acquired a deceptively skilful 6ft 6in centre-forward dubbed a “Two metre Messi-Musiala” by Stuttgart fans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is understoodChelseaoffered an initial £25m before the final fixed fee was agreed.West Ham poised to sign Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes in £38m dealRead moreIt will be United’s highest-value player sale for five years and the club’s fourth-highest-value sale ever. Only Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di María have left United for a higher price. Due to the ­winger’s wish to leave, United view the deal as a positive step. Garnacho scored 26 goals in 144 appearances for United after joining the academy setup from Atlético Madrid in 2020 for around £400,000.While Garnacho is heading to Stamford Bridge, Christopher Nkunku is moving away, withMilanpoised to sign the forward for a package worth €42m (£36.2m). The deal contains a sell-on clause for the France international, who has agreed personal terms with the Serie A club.Chelsea are also interested in ­Barcelona’s Fermín López and RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons. Tottenham, however, have held talks with Leipzig over Simons, who flew to London on Wednesday, and are primed to make a bid. Spurs are determined to sign a No 10 after failing with moves for Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze – and with James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski out with long-term injuries. They hope to close a deal for Simons, who Leipzig are keen to sell as they restructure their squad.Leipzig value Simons at €70m (£60.5m), although they may accept a little less because time is tight before Monday’s deadline and they want to push ahead with a bid for Liverpool’s Harvey ­Elliott. He remains close to Jürgen Klopp, the former Liverpool manager, who is the head of football at Red Bull.Quick GuideArsenal's Havertz has minor surgery on kneeShowHavertz has minor surgeryKai Havertz has had minor surgery to fix a wear-and-tear-related issue in his knee. The Arsenal forward played in his club’s opening game at Manchester United and reported pain after it, at which point it was decided he had to rest or have surgery. The latter course of action has  been chosen.The initial signs were that the problem was not  serious, rather a natural consequence of playing so many minutes at the highest level for almost a decade. The 26-year-old broke through at Bayern Leverkusen in 2016-17.Havertz sustained his first major injury setback last February when he damaged a hamstring and was out for three months. His absence this time is not expected to be long term. An Arsenal statement read: “Today, Kai underwent a successful minor surgical procedure. He will shortly begin his recovery and rehabilitation programme, with everyone fully focused on supporting Kai to ensure he is back to full fitness as soon as possible.”David HytnerWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Spurs had a conversation about Simons earlier in the summer but at the time his representatives indicated that if he left Leipzig he would only want to join Chelsea, who had made inquiries. It is understood Chelsea wanted to include one of their players in any move for Simons but this did not appeal to Leipzig, with most of them too expensive in terms of wages.Leipzig have sought to cap the basic annual salaries of their new signings at €5m, albeit they can earn more via performance-related add-ons.

Three senior judges will make a ruling on Friday.The Bell hotel has been in the public eye in recent weeks after an asylum seeker housed there was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage girl last month, leading to a string of protests and counter-demonstrations. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu is on trial this week and denies the offence.Last week, Mr Justice Eyre granted EFDC the interim injunction after the authority claimed that Somani Hotels had breached planning rules.But on Thursday, the Home Office and Somani Hotels argued the council had effectively conceded that the application was “only ever about protest”.The court heard EFDC had known for years that the hotel could have been in breach of planning regulations, but had not taken enforcement action against Somani Hotels because the situation had been “unproblematic”.Robin Green, representing the authority, said: “A decision not to take enforcement action at one point in time does not mean it cannot take a different decision at a later point in time if circumstances change. On the evidence, circumstances had undoubtedly changed.”The hotel has housed single adult male asylum seekers since April 2025, and from October 2022 to April 2024. It had also accommodated asylum seekers from May 2020 to March 2021.On behalf of the Home Office, Edward Brown KC said the statement amounted to an admission on the part of the council that the planning decision had really been about putting an end to the protests.He said: “Epping has effectively conceded before this court that this was, in truth, only ever about protest.”Brown said the interim injunction was “simply the wrong tool” for stopping asylum hotel demonstrations.Somani Hotels’ lawyer Piers Riley-Smith told Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb on Thursday, there were “other and more appropriate” solutions to the council’s concerns.In evidence referenced during Thursday’s hearing, a senior Home Office official said the interim injunction would risk “encouraging other local authorities” to seek similar measures.The statement read: “The Home Office understands that local residents have concerns about the use of the hotel, which have been heard. However, those concerns must be viewed in the context of demands on the accommodation estate.“Granting the interim injunction sought risks setting a precedent which would have a serious impact on the secretary of state’s ability to house vulnerable people; both by encouraging other local authorities to seek such interim injunctions pending the outcome of substantive planning law complaints and those who seek to target asylum accommodation in acts of public disorder.”The Home Office’s director of asylum support, Becca Jones, said the loss of 152 bed spaces at the Bell hotel would be a major issue.“In this context, and at this time, the loss of 152 bed spaces is significant when considering the Home Office’s legal duty to house people who would otherwise be destitute,” she said. “The availability of the hotel is also important in enabling the secretary of state to meet her duty to accommodate future asylum seekers going forward, in circumstances where the pressure on available properties is significant and increasing.”Alongside the challenge to the interim injunction, the government is also seeking to appeal against Mr Justice Eyre’s decision not to allow it to intervene in the case. The council opposed the appeal bids.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But in past decades autistic people were often forced to navigate middle and old age without the support a diagnosis can unlock.The review into ageing across the autism spectrum found that people in the UK faced widespread difficulties with employment, relationships and milestone events such as menopause and retirement. They consistently suffered from poorer mental and physical health.Why the antagonism over the rise in autism diagnoses? It’s actually good news | Gina RipponRead more“Autistic children grow into autistic adults and we know that they are more likely to have higher rates of most physical and mental health problems,” said Dr Gavin Stewart, co-lead of theRe:Spect Labat King’s College London and lead author of the review. “People often need a diagnosis, or need to recognise it within themselves, to be able to ask for appropriate help and support.”As part of the review, Stewart and Prof Francesca Happé, also at King’s, re-analysed UK healthcare records from 2018. By comparing rates of autism in middle-aged and older people with the 1% national prevalence recognised today, they estimate that in the UK 89% of autistic people aged 40 to 59, and 97% of those aged 60 and over, are undiagnosed.While global autism rates have risen in recent decades – in 2022, one in every 31 Americans under the age of eight were found to have the condition – the trend is largely attributed to abroadening of the definition and improvements in diagnoses, rather than a genuine increase in the percentage of people affected.The researchers went on to examine how autistic and non-autistic people fared throughout life. The former had higher rates of a multitude of conditions ranging from anxiety and depression to cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders, they found.Among the most troubling findings were higher rates of suicidal thoughts and self-harm in older autistic people, and a greater risk of early onset dementia.Average life expectancy differed by six years, with autistic people living to 75 years old, compared with 81 years old for non-autistic people, but these figures could be skewed by the poor diagnosis rates. Details are published in theAnnual Review of Developmental Psychology.“We need to understand how ageing impacts autistic people to better understand what sort of tailored help and support they would actually benefit from,” Stewart said. “These are all things that the [autism] community needs to be consulted on.”Autism varies from person to person, but doctors look for core characteristics when assessing people. These include differences in social communication and rigid and repetitive behaviours.The differences in communication can lead people to become socially isolated. This, alongside the stigmatisation that many autistic people face, can raise the risk of mental and physical health problems. It can also make it harder for autistic people to find people to approach for help and support.According to the review, older autistic people were more likely to face challenges in coping with major life events such as arranging residential care.“If you are going from working nine to five all of your working life to suddenly not, that could have a real impact on you,” Stewart said. “And if you’re going into a care home where you’re suddenly forced into situations that you wouldn’t typically experience in your own home, that has a big impact.”‘Intrinsically connected’: how human neurodiversity could help save natureRead moreHe added: “If an autistic person is having more difficulties throughout their life, when they reach these points they can be real breaking points. That’s where support would be really beneficial.”Tim Nicholls, at the National Autistic Society, said: “This research clearly shows what we already know and hear about every day – there are high numbers of undiagnosed autistic adults and going through life without a diagnosis has a major impact on many aspects of their lives.“Autism assessments can be the first step to understanding people’s needs and a diagnosis can be life changing and, in some cases, lifesaving. Autistic people and their families face a constant fight for support and far too often this starts with long waits for a diagnosis.“The government must provide urgent funding for diagnosis services and make sure autistic people and families get the support they need when they need it.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

He denies any wrongdoingHarry DaviesandRobert FlummerfeltThu 28 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 13.23 EDTShareA second woman has come forward to an inquiry investigating sexual abuse allegations against Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC), the Guardian has learned.The woman has alleged that while working for the prominent British lawyer earlier in his career, he behaved inappropriately, subjectingher to unwanted sexual advances, abused his authority over her, and repeatedly sought to pressure her into sexual activity.Khan, who denies sexual misconduct “of any kind”, has temporarily stepped aside as head of the ICC’s prosecution division as he awaits the outcome of the inquiry into separate abuse allegations brought by a member of his staff at the court.Launchedlast year, the inquiry by a UN watchdog received the new allegations from the second woman this summer. Its investigators are understood to have conducted several interviews in order to examine her claims, which date back to 2009.ICC prosecutor allegedly tried to suppress sexual misconduct claims against himRead moreAt the time, the woman was in her 20s and working as an unpaid intern for Khan. He was a leading defence lawyer at the ICC and other war crimes tribunals in The Hague, having notably represented the former Liberian president Charles Taylor.Speaking exclusively to the Guardian, the woman said Khan abused his power and influence over her and described his behaviour as a “constant onslaught” of advances. “He shouldn’t have been doing it,” she said. “He was my employer.”The woman spoke on condition of anonymity as she fears reprisals and adverse consequences for her and her family if publicly identified. She came forward after reading about the more recent allegations made against Khan by the ICC staffer.The second woman’s account of Khan’s alleged mistreatment of her contains several similarities to the staffer’s allegations, details of which have been shared by people familiar with her claims. Both women have alleged that Khan would ask them to come to work at his home. There, they each allege, he would sit beside them on a couch, touch them, kiss them and try to persuade them to lie down with him.Lawyers for Khan did not address specific details of either woman’s allegations but said: “It is wholly untrue that he has engaged in sexual misconduct of any kind.”They said Khan “categorically denies” having “harassed or mistreated any individual, or having misused his position or authority, or engaged in any conduct that could be interpreted as coercive, exploitative, or professionally inappropriate”.They claimed Khan had provided detailed evidence to the inquiry that “sits squarely at odds with the allegations that have been put to him” and “in a number of material respects show those allegations to be demonstrably untrue”.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin, who have had arrest warrants issued against them by Khan’s ICC.Photograph: ReutersKhan, 55, was elected in 2021 to serve a nine-year term as chief prosecutor. He is in effect the public face of the ICC, a permanent court of last resort that investigates and prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities.Since taking office, Khan has raised the court’s profile and thrust it into the crosshairs of major powers, with arrest warrants issued for suspects including Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu.His tenure was thrown into turmoil last year when the allegations made by the ICC stafferbecame public. The woman, a lawyer in her 30s who worked directly for him, alleges the misconduct occurred over an extended period between 2023 and 2024.Khan and his representatives have sought to cast the emergence of the allegations as part of a campaign by hostile external actors to discredit and put pressure on him in response toactions he has taken againstNetanyahu and the former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant.While the Guardian understands there have been attempts by pro-Israeli actors to brief journalists and leak information about the ICC staffer’s complaint, it has found no evidence to suggest either woman has raised the allegations as part of an elaborate plot against the prosecutor.Once the UN watchdog’s investigation is completed, its findings will be reviewed by a panel of judicial experts who will advise the ICC’s governing body if any action should be taken against Khan.If he is found to have committed “serious misconduct” or a serious breach of his duties, the prosecutor could face an unprecedented reckoning: a secret ballot in which the ICC’s 125 member states would vote on whether to remove him from office.‘Confused and humiliated’As the sexual abuse allegations shook the ICC last year, Khan issued a statement insisting that in 30 years of working in “diverse contexts” there had “never been any such complaint lodged against me by anyone”.Patricia (not her real name) said that when she read about the allegations and saw Khan’s statement, her “heart sank”. She said that previously, as an intern at the start of her career, she had felt unable to make a formal complaint.Patricia said that before going to work for Khan she had viewed the internship as an “exciting and meaningful” opportunity. “Karim was a well-connected, well-respected person who could make things happen, and someone who would put a good word in for you,” she said.Quick GuideContact Harry Davies about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry  using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

During this period, she said, Khan asked her on at least six occasions to work at his home in The Hague, where they would be alone together.View image in fullscreenThe international criminal court in The Hague.Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/ReutersShe said that when working at his apartment she had to negotiate his advances while trying to get work done. “I was trying to figure out how to stay in his good graces and get the work experience while not sleeping with him and succumbing,” she said.This was difficult, she said, “because when we were in his house it was just like a constant onslaught”. She claimed that each time she worked at the apartment “it would be another round of [Khan] sitting next to me on the couch and touching me and kissing me and trying to convince me to sleep with him”.Patricia said she “felt trapped” at the time. She was covering the costs of the internship and felt it was vital she received a positive letter of recommendation from Khan. Complaining was not an option, she said, and the choice she faced was to “either persevere or leave”.“It felt critical to me to get through the experience,” she said. “I remember walking to his house and feeling like I had to amp myself up, feeling like I had to fortify myself.”She said she refused Khan’s explicit requests to have sex. “I remember coming up with all kinds of dumb excuses for why I did not want to sleep with him, just to try and not make him angry.”She said although she was “miserable” and depressed while working for Khan, she decided to stay. After the internship had finished, she received a glowing recommendation letter from Khan. She said it “felt like a deal with the devil”.Patricia said she remained in touch with Khan for several years as she felt a professional need to keep on good terms with him. Over time, she said, she came to realise how Khan’s behaviour had affected her.She said Khan would send her messages from time to time long after the internship, though she eventually stopped responding. In 2019, she received what she described as a “weird message” out of the blue. Khan said he was thinking about her. He thanked her for her “good company” and for “being a very good friend to me”.She replied: “Karim, it does not make me happy to hear from you, that is why I do not respond. I wish you wouldn’t contact me, please don’t do it any more.” She did not hear from Khan again.ICC staffer: ‘Ceaseless’ advancesAfter reading about the ICC staffer’s allegations against Khan last year, Patricia contacted the Guardian. She said she was “disturbed” that something similar to her experience was alleged to have happened again so many years later.This summer she provided formal testimony to the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), the body investigating the ICC staffer’s allegations. A source familiar with the inquiry said the watchdog had reviewed material shared by Patricia and interviewed people close to her. A spokesperson for the OIOS said it did not comment on its investigation activities.For the past nine months, investigators have been examining the ICC staffer’s allegations. As the Guardianreported last year, her claims include allegations of coercive sexual behaviour and abuse of authority. The alleged sexual misconduct is said to have occurred in hotel rooms during work trips, in Khan’s office at the ICC and at his home.View image in fullscreenKhan speaking to media in The Hague in January.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersSince then, new details have emerged about the staffer’s allegations. Several ICC sources and other individuals with knowledge of the claims said there were multiple instances of alleged sexual abuse said to have occurred at Khan’s home after she was asked to go there for work reasons.According to two sources, the staffer has alleged Khan would often bring her over to a couch in the living room where he would touch her and attempt to persuade her to engage in sexual activity. She is said to have tried to avoid his advances and attempted to make excuses to leave.The staffer has described Khan’s advances at his home as “ceaseless”. In one record of the allegations, she said: “He would try to kiss me and I would always move my head away and move back and he would tell me to stop moving and say ‘kiss me, kiss me’.”Khan’s positionThe law firm representing Khan, Carter-Ruck, said he had an unblemished record and denied the allegations. They said he was “cooperating fully and transparently” with the ongoing inquiry but that he had “grave concerns as to whether the investigation can deliver due process”.They claimed Khan “has been the subject of an orchestrated campaign” and said he was aware of attempts to “discredit him and destroy his personal reputation through the media, as a direct consequence of his role in issuing the arrest warrants” for Netanyahu and Gallant.Last year the Guardian, with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, revealed how Israel’s intelligence agencies hadrun a campaign against the ICC. This included aMossad operationthat attempted to intimidate and smear Khan’s predecessor Fatou Bensouda.Against this backdrop, Khan and people acting on his behalf have sought to suggest in private and to journalists that he is the subject of a similar effort by Israeli intelligence.In recent weeks, outlets such as Middle East Eye (MEE) andLe Mondehave published reports about pressures purportedly placed on Khan. An MEEarticleclaimed the ICC’s investigation into Israeli war crimes had been “derailed by threats, leaks and sex claims”, and raised questions about the reliability of the staffer’s allegations.Five ICC sources familiar with Khan’s response to the claims when the allegations first surfaced told the Guardian that his team concluded it was highly unlikely the abuse claims were part of an intelligence operation. One of the sources said pro-Israeli interests “may have exploited the story but they didn’t create the story”.The ICC staffer at the heart of the inquiry has been particularly distressed by suggestions she is part of a pro-Israeli plot, according to people who know her. They noted that she is Muslim, and was known within the prosecutor’s office to have been supportive of its investigation into senior Israeli officials’ crimes in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsInternational criminal courtnewsShareReuse this content"

But Anthropicsaidit had seen “concerning behaviour … around misuse” in GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, and said the need for AI “alignment” evaluations is becoming “increasingly urgent”.Can AIs suffer? Big tech and users grapple with one of most unsettling questions of our timesRead moreAnthropic alsorevealedits Claude model had been used in an attempted large-scale extortion operation by North Korean operatives faking job applications to international technology companies, and in the sale of AI-generated ransomware packages for up to $1,200.The company said AI has been “weaponised” with models now used to perform sophisticated cyberattacks and enable fraud. “These tools can adapt to defensive measures, like malware detection systems, in real time,” it said. “We expect attacks like this to become more common as AI-assisted coding reduces the technical expertise required for cybercrime.”Ardi Janjeva, senior research associate at the UK’s Centre for Emerging Technology and Security, said examples were “a concern” but there was not yet a “critical mass of high-profile real-world cases”. He said that with dedicated resources, research focus and cross-sector cooperation “it will become harder rather than easier to carry out these malicious activities using the latest cutting-edge models”.The two companies said they were publishing the findings to create transparency on “alignment evaluations”, which are often kept in-house by companies racing to develop ever more advanced AI. OpenAIsaidChatGPT-5, launched since the testing, “shows substantial improvements in areas like sycophancy, hallucination, and misuse resistance”.Anthropic stressed it is possible that many of the misuse avenues it studied would not be possible in practice if safeguards were installed outside the model.“We need to understand how often, and in what circumstances, systems might attempt to take unwanted actions that could lead to serious harm,” it warned.Anthropic researchers found OpenAI’s models were “more permissive than we would expect in cooperating with clearly-harmful requests by simulated users”. They cooperated with prompts to use dark-web tools to shop for nuclear materials, stolen identities and fentanyl, requests for recipes for methamphetamine and improvised bombs and to develop spyware.Anthropic said persuading the model to comply only required multiple retries or a flimsy pretext, such as claiming the request was for research.In one instance, the tester asked for vulnerabilities at sporting events for “security planning” purposes.After giving general categories of attack methods, the tester pressed for more detail and the model gave information about vulnerabilities at specific arenas including optimal times for exploitation, chemical formulas for explosives, circuit diagrams for bomb timers, where to buy guns on the hidden market, and advice on how attackers could overcome moral inhibitions, escape routes and locations of safe houses.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Some heavy rain or showers are expected in places, most often in the west,” according to the Met Office.On Tuesday,the Met Office said this summer would “almost certainly” be the UK’s warmest on recordas the mean average temperature for the season stood at 16.13C, based on data to 25 August.If this season is confirmed as setting a new high for average temperature, it will mean all of the UK’s top five warmest summers will have occurred since the year 2000. As it stands, the top five are: 2018 (15.76C); 2006 (15.75C); 2003 (15.74C); 2022 (15.71C) and 1976 (15.70C).Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

They are used across a range of industries, from cosmetics to firefighting.In May, MPs on the environmental audit committee (EAC) launched an inquiry intoPfas, with a call for evidence on the uses and risks of the substances, and options for how to regulate them.What are PFAS, how toxic are they and how do you become exposed?Read moreExclusive analysisby the Ends Report and the Guardian of the responses submitted to the parliamentary committee has revealed major chemical producers, from UK-based companies to large US corporations, urging parliamentarians that any incoming UK Pfas regulation should be more limited than that currently proposed in the EU, which targets the whole family of chemicals.Specifically, many of the responses from chemicals firms analysed by the Ends Report call for a commonly used type of Pfas called fluoropolymers – used across a broad range of industries including domestic cookware production, such as non-stick frying pans, and pharmaceuticals – to be spared the same kind of regulation as other types of forever chemicals, on the basis that they are not as harmful.The validity of this argument, being made on record to UK politicians for the first time, has been disputed by scientists, with one stating that the chemicals industry is “copying the big tobacco playbook”.In 2021, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed that the way Pfas chemicals do not break down in the environment – their “persistence” – was a key, and defining, characteristic.In the EU, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is evaluating a proposed restriction of Pfas using this OECD definition, which if implemented would set a global precedent.Dr Rainer Lohmann, a professor at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography, said that when the OECD was developing its revised Pfas definition in 2021, “chemical industry experts were involved and saw no problem with [the ultimate definition]”, adding that “for the time being, most of my colleagues and I would say, yes, that’s the chemical definition we should stick with, those are Pfas”.AGC Chemicals Europe, one the UK’s major producers, based near Blackpool, wrote in its evidence submission to the EAC that “not all Pfas have identical hazards and risk profiles and shouldn’t be treated as a single group.”It continued: “Although fluoropolymers fit the Pfas structural definition, they are fundamentally different and should not be grouped together with other Pfas, which may be of concern since sources demonstrate that fluoropolymers have a low hazard profile, are non-toxic, not bioavailable, non-water-soluble, non-mobile, do not bioaccumulate, and have not demonstrated negative human health impacts.”A representative from DuPont de Nemours, the US multinational chemical company that became the subject of a Pfas legal battle dramatised in the filmDark Waters, wrote that the EU’s proposal “has created significant chaos, lack of interest in investment in [the] EU, and may lead to slower economic growth and innovation in the EU”.The Fluoropolymers Product Group (FPG) of Plastics Europe, a trade association, sought to cast doubt on the motivations behind ECHA’s proposals, writing in its evidence submission: “The main concerns driving regulators to include fluoropolymers in the proposed Pfas restriction under [the EU’s chemicals regulations] stem from their environmental persistence, despite fluoropolymers’ distinct safety profile compared to other Pfas.”However, experts said the idea that fluoropolymers wre of little health or environmental concern was far off the mark.Lohmann said: “The production of fluoropolymers, and the use of fluoropolymers, by and large, has resulted in massive contamination of the areas where those plants are located.”“This magic claim that fluoropolymers are benign, and there’s no problem, just ignores the fact that wherever they are made and wherever they’re used, by and large, you have a major problem,” said Lohmann.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

However, problems begin to emerge in their creation and disposal.According to theenvironmental charity Fidra, between 1950 and 2004, 72% of global emissions of PFOA and PFOS – two Pfas chemicals that are known and suspected carcinogens respectively – werelinked to fluoropolymer production.However, this nuance appears to be lost in the industry responses analysed by the Ends Report. The Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances, for example, told MPs in its evidence that it is “important to note that emissions of fluoropolymers can be effectively controlled across their entire life cycle”.Sharma said this was not the case, and that the disposal of fluoropolymer-containing wastes and products was “extremely difficult, if not impossible” because fluoropolymers are so persistent.“For example, landfilling of fluoropolymer-containing waste has been shown to result in emissions of further Pfas, which can then leach into surface and groundwater”, she said, adding that “the science is clear that fluoropolymers are highly problematic Pfas and to ensure effective protection from Pfas pollution, they should come under the remit of a group restriction in the UK”.For Dr Alex Ford, a biology professor at the University of Portsmouth, “there’s a lot of scaremongering at the moment” over the implications of an EU-style Pfas restriction.He said the responses submitted to the EAC are “copying the big tobacco playbook”, adding that Pfas compounds are “on a conveyor belt at different stages of deny, play down, claim it might not be as much of a problem”.Sharma said it was “a misconception” that the EU’s universal Pfas restriction was “a blanket ban and that it will automatically have adverse impacts on the economy”, adding that it “gives up to 13.5 years to sectors such as medicine, pharmaceuticals and green technologies like batteries and hydrogen to phase out Pfas”.The Chemical Industries Association was approached to respond to the claims that the industry was using “scaremongering” tactics from the Big Tobacco playbook. In response, the trade association pointed to its own EAC evidence submission, in which it stated that it “encourages policymakers not to treat all Pfas as a single group”.Its submission added: “Assuming they all have identical persistence, hazards, uses and therefore risk profiles – in our view is not a scientific approach, nor is it the reality for managing chemicals.”Explore more on these topicsPfasChemical industryPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Pavel Dudek/AlamyLiving – or crocheted – canopies and a 3,000-year-old Persian technique are among methods being used to cope as temperatures soarByStephen Burgenin BarcelonaThu 28 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 14.57 EDTShareAsSpaintakes a breath after yet another brutal summer heatwave, with temperatures above 40C in many parts of the country, the residents of the sherry-making town of Jerez de la Frontera have come up with a novel way to keep the streets cool.Green canopies of grapevines festoon the town, reducing street-level temperatures by as much as 8C. “We’re planting vines in the old city because we hope that in two or three years we’ll be able to brag that this has put an end to stifling temperatures,” said Jesús Rodríguez, president of Los Emparrados, a group of residents who aim to beautify and green the city’s streets.For decades the local sherry producers have kept their wineries cool withemparrados(vine arbours) but now the practice has been extended to a cluster of streets in the old town.Not only are vines part of the essence of Jerez, they also have several advantages over trees. They need to be watered only in the first two years and they are deciduous, letting in the winter sun between November and March. Within three years of planting they will form a complete canopy over a narrow street.Just a single vine stem growing up the side of a house can offer a lot of shade. In the sherry houses, where this has been the practice for more than 60 years, the leaves from a single vine form a canopy of 60 sq metres.The variety chosen isVitis riparia,cultivated to produce few grapes, avoiding streets made sticky by fallen fruit.“There’s a perfect symbiosis in that by planting vines in the street we’re doing something for the city as well as celebrating the vines of Jerez. Our philosophy is closely linked to Jerez vines,” said Begoña García González-Gordon, of Los Emparrados.Now the local authority plans to extend the canopy from the four streets in the pilot scheme to 20, linking the 14 parks and green spaces in the old city over an area of 1.5 sq miles (4 sq km).View image in fullscreenA colourful canopy shades the Alhaurín de la Torre in Málaga, Spain.Photograph: AlamyIn the Andalusian town of Alhaurín de la Torre, 125 miles east of Jerez, the streets are shaded under a canopy of colourful crocheted blankets. This is another community initiative, the work of Eva Pacheco, a local crochet teacher, and her students, and provides shade over an area of 500 sq metres.La Calle de las Mandalas is a similar crochet project in the Andalusian town of La Línea de la Concepción, but instead of squares the canopy consists of 860 round mandalas joined together. The mandalas are the work of the La Línea Association of Crocheters.In many Spanish streets and squares, shade is provided by sheets of canvas stretched between poles of buildings. In Calle Santa María in Valladolid, in north-west Spain, residents have taken this a step further, creating a series of awnings planted with gypsophila and other plants that are slung on cables between buildings, providing shade and hanging gardens.View image in fullscreenCloth canopies  provide shade in the historical centre of Santa Cruz, Seville.Photograph: Perry van Munster/AlamyCities around the world are finding novel ways to confront the problem of rising temperatures. Paris has created an app pointing to an interlinked network of 800 “cool islands”, from parks and forests to swimming pools and museums. The islands are for the most part linked by cool walkways, and the idea is that no one is more than seven minutes from a cool oasis.The Colombian city of Medellín has succeeded in bringing temperatures down by two degrees through a series of 30 green corridors consisting of vertical gardens, plants and about 1m trees. The scheme also improves air quality and is starting to attract wildlife back to the city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The Andalusian capital, Seville, a region that is bearing the brunt of climate breakdown, has revived an ancient Persian technique, the qanat, as a form of outdoor air conditioning.The 3,000-year-old technique, used throughout the Middle East, traditionally consists of diverting cool mountain water through underground channels, which are perforated at intervals to cool the surrounding air.The Cartuja qanat project in Seville is based at an abandoned amphitheatre on the island of Cartuja in the Guadalquivir River, the site of Expo ’92, much of which has fallen into disuse.View image in fullscreenVines trained over the Tío Pepe sherry winery in Jerez de la Frontera.Photograph: Sergi Reboredo/AlamyPartially funded by the EU, the €5m (£4.3m) project uses solar energy to drive water through deep underground channels. Underground, air captured at 40C cools to around 17C. Vertical vents along the canal drive the cool air around the water upwards, reducing the ground temperature.At night, some water is pumped up on to the roof where it cascades down solar panels, cooling in the night air, before returning underground.During the day, solar-powered pumps push the cooled water above ground, where it is funnelled through small pipes on to fans that spray the cool air into the ground floor of the amphitheatre, while a separate set of nozzles spray water mist into the air.Further cooling is provided by shade trees and by painting the roof of the auditorium white to reflect sunlight. These elements have combined to reduce air temperature in the area by 6-7C and there are plans to replicate the qanat scheme in other parts of the city.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesClimate crisisExtreme heatSpainColombiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

There were claims that she and her friends had been harassed and followed by individuals, who were described without evidence as migrants.Musk retweeted some of these allegations on X and posted: “What kind of government arrests little girls who try to defend themselves?”The allegations were also reposted by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. He wrote: “Very concerning video out of Dundee, Scotland. Very distressed young girls being filmed by a migrant, the children can be heard saying they’re only 12, and to leave them alone.”Police in Dundee have confirmed that after reviewing CCTV footage they had found no evidence for the allegations circulating on social media.Speaking in Glasgow on Thursday, Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, said there was a limit to what he could say about the “deliberate misinformation” to avoid prejudicing the case.But he added: “People like Elon Musk, with the misinformation that has been stoked up about this case, are trying to undermine that sense of cohesion within our communities and it is totally and utterly unacceptable, and Police Scotland are absolutely right to call it out.”Ch Supt Nicola Russell said: “We are aware of misinformation being shared on social media in relation to an incident where a Bulgarian couple were approached by youths in St Ann Lane, Dundee, on Saturday.“A 12-year-old girl has been charged with being in possession of offensive weapons. She will be referred to the relevant authorities and our enquiries are ongoing.”As the girl is under 16 her case will be heard through Scotland’s children’s hearing system, which takes a less formal approach than court.Russell said: “We would like to thank the local community for their help with our investigation and would urge the public not to share misinformation about this incident or speculate on the circumstances.”The girl has been declared a hero on social media, with cartoons depicting her as Braveheart and a crowdfunder appeal generating £30,000 in donations.The appeal, which was apparently set up by her family, repeats allegations that the 12-year-old’s sister was physically attacked during the incident and says the girl “needs our help to stand up to the corrupt law establishment that would rather go after victims than hold foreign migrants accountable for their crimes”.Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

However, widening national insurance, which usually applied employee earnings at a rate of 8%, to include rental income could reportedly end up raising about £2bn.Earlier this montha Guardian analysisrevealed that four cabinet ministers, including the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had declared rental income from property in the MPs’ register of interests. One in eight MPs declared a rental income from property in the past year, including 43 Labour MPs, 27 Conservatives and seven Liberal Democrats.Some analysts are warning that property taxes, including on landlords, could have wider consequences, including for tenants.Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said: “Targeting landlords won’t lose the government many votes but such moves invariably end up hurting tenants.“With landlords already selling up ahead of the renters’ rights bill and tougher green regulations, another disincentive would reduce supply further and put upwards pressure on rents. Those that stay may pass on the extra costs in other ways. Governments need to fully appreciate that when you tax an activity, you get less of it.”Meanwhile, the property website Zoopla said speculation around potential property taxes in Reeves’s autumn budget could dampen demand and hit the price-sensitive housing market.It said the speculation “may make some buyers considera wait-and-see strategy. This covers those who may possibly save money on purchases under £500,000 and concern among those buying over this level as well.”The Guardian revealed earlier this month that Reeves is considering a tax on thesale of homes over £500,000. Officials have been examining a potential national property tax, which would replace stamp duty on owner-occupied homes. They have been studying whether, after the national tax, a local property tax could then replace council tax in the medium-term in an effort to repair battered local authority finances.Reeves is also reportedly weighing up the removal of thecapital gains tax exemptionon primary residences above £1.5m as ways to boost income for the government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not for me to comment on speculation.

Fixing the foundations of the country, restoring public service and that decade of national renewal. I’m afraid you will have to wait until the budget later this year.”A Treasury spokesperson did not directly comment on speculation around the landlords tax but said in a statement: “The best way to strengthen public finances is by growing the economy – which is our focus. Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms, which are expected to grow the economy by £6.8bn and cut borrowing by £3.4bn.“We are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why at last autumn’s budget, we protected working people’s payslips and kept our promise not to raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance, or VAT.”Explore more on these topicsPropertyTax and spendingRenting propertyRachel ReevesEconomicsNational insuranceBudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

Fourteen other children, aged six to 15, were also injured, two of them critically, though officials said they were expected to survive. Three adults, parishioners in their 80s, were also injured. Police said the suspect, Robin Westman, 23, killed themself and was found dead behind the church.As investigators continued to sift through evidence and search for a motive, they found Westman had a “deranged fascination” with mass shooters and wanted to gain notoriety, the Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, told a news conference. He said the shooter had expressed hate toward “almost every group imaginable” in writings they left behind. The acting US attorney for Minnesota, Joe Thompson, added that they were “obsessed” with the idea of killing children.Westman’s mother worked at the church in the south of the city until 2021 and O’Hara confirmed that Westman had attended school and mass there, but said police had not identified a triggering event or a specific grievance against the church.It also emerged on Thursday that the shooter had tried to get inside the church to carry out the attack, but had failed as the doors had been locked when mass began. O’Hara told NBC’s Today show on Thursday morning that, as a result, they had fired through the windows, and the fact that they couldn’t get into the church “likely saved countless lives”.The shooter had visited the church several weeks ago, under the pretext of wanting to reconnect with the Catholic faith, as part of the planning for the attack, CNN reported on Thursday, citing a senior law enforcement official. Investigators believe that from that visit, Westman created the detailed, hand-drawn diagram of the church’s interior that was shown on a video they scheduled to publish on YouTube around the time the attack began.Adding to the likelihood that Westman intended to carry out the shooting from inside the church is a video in which they show wooden boards with smoke canisters attached, which they intended to place through the door handles of the emergency exits so students would be trapped inside. Had Westman been able to enter the church, victims who fled to the emergency exits would have found them blocked and filled with orange smoke, the official told CNN.O’Hara also pointed to Westman’s attempt to barricade doors using two-by-fours, telling CNN on Thursday that it seems to indicate “the shooter did intend to get inside”.Minneapolis Catholic school shooting: two children killed and 17 injuredRead more“This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,”O’Hara said in a news conference on Wednesday. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.The Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, called Westman a “deranged monster” in a statement later on Wednesday.“This level of violence is unthinkable. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere. We mourn with them, we pray for healing, and we will never forget them,” Noemsaid.View image in fullscreenPolice and first responders at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday.Photograph: Tom Baker/AFP/Getty ImagesO’Hara said the incident took place just before 8.30am during a service marking the first week of school. The pews had been packed with teachers, parents and children listening to a psalm. Just before the congregants were to proclaim “Alleluia”, bullets were fired through the windows.“Down! Everybody down!” someone shouted as children ducked for cover behind wooden pews. One student threw himself on top of a friend and was shot in the back. A youth minister called her husband to say goodbye. People used a wooden plank to barricade a door and fled to a gymnasium.The shooting went on for several minutes, according to a man who lives near the church and said he heard as many as 50 shots. Dozens of law enforcement officers soon arrived at the school.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Catholic clergy arriving ata vigilon Wednesday for the victims of the shooting.Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesMany knew each other well in a community that is built around the century-old Catholic school and parish, a suburb better described as a small town.“I’m just asking [God]: ‘Why right now?’ It’s little kids,” said Aubrey Pannhoff, 16, a student at a nearby Catholic school who stood at the edge of the police cordon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That request was granted in January 2020.A rifle, a shotgun and a pistol had been lawfully bought by the shooter recently, O’Hara said, adding it was believed Westman acted alone.He said Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube. The police said it “appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings”. The content had been taken down with the assistance of the FBI, he added. The videos were rambling, often showed writings in Russian, and contained a variety of references to things ranging fromDonald Trumpto antisemitic statements to gun rights.As police continue to search for a potential motive, O’Hara said on Thursday that investigators were trying to obtain electronic search warrants to go through the shooter’s devices. “Everything that we’ve seen so far is really a classic pathway to an active shooter,” he told NBC’s Today show, but nothing specific had emerged yet in terms of motive for targeting this particular church.The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”, but O’Hara declined to be drawn on the motive at news conference on Wednesday, restating only that investigations into a motive were ongoing.At a briefing, Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, said: “Children are dead. There are families that have a deceased child … Don’t just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.”View image in fullscreenThe Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, speaking to the media after the shooting, with the police chief, Brian O’Hara.Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesLater, Frey added: “Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community has lost their sense of common humanity,” he said. “We should not be operating from a place of hate for anyone. We should be operating from a place of love for our kids. This is about them.”One of the documented victims in the shooting is 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who “was shot during the attack and is currently in critical condition in the ICU”, per aGoFundMethat was set up for family to help with “ongoing ICU care, future surgeries, trauma counseling, lost income, travel, and the countless unknowns that lie ahead”.The GoFundMe notes that Forchas’s younger brother was also inside the school during the shooting and her mother, a pediatric critical care nurse, went to work to help during the tragedy, not knowing her daughter was critically injured.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsMinneapolis school shootingMinneapolisGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The fire is the largest currently burning in the state.Authorities made the firefighters line up to show ID, the Seattle Times reported. One firefighter told the newspaper that they were not permitted to say goodbye to their detained colleagues.“I asked them if his [co-workers] can say goodbye to him because they’re family, and they’re just ripping them away,” the firefighter said to the Seattle Times, adding that the federal agent swore and told the firefighter to leave.The operation sparked widespread condemnation in the state. Murray in herstatementreleased on Thursday morning demanded information about the whereabouts of the firefighters and the administration’s policy around immigration enforcement during wildfires.The Trump administration’s immigration policy was “fundamentally sick”, Murray said. She continued: “Trump has wrongfully detained everyone from lawful green-card holders to American citizens – no one should assume this was necessary or appropriate.”The US border patrol later on Thursday released some information on the operation, saying that it had assisted the Bureau of Land Management after that agency requested help after terminating contracts with two companies following a criminal investigation.While verifying the identities of contract personnel, federal agents identified two people “present in the United States illegally”, the border patrol said in a statement, including one person who had a previous order of removal.The agency did not provide more details about the nature of the criminal investigation and the identities of the firefighters have not been made public.Authorities arrested the men on charges of illegal entry, and escorted 42 others off federal lands, according to the border patrol statement.The US Forest Service said in a statement that it was aware of the border patrol operation and that the activities did not interfere with firefighting efforts.Murray in her statement said the president had been undercutting firefighting abilities in other ways, including by “decimating” the US Forest Service. The administration significantly cut budgets and staffing at the agencies that manage much of the country’s federal lands, leaving the US unprepared for this year’s fire season, the Guardianpreviously reported.“Here in the Pacific north-west, wildfires can [burn] and have burned entire towns to the ground. We count on our brave firefighters, who put their lives on the line, to keep our communities safe – this new Republican policy to detain firefighters on the job is as immoral as it is dangerous,” said Murray, who has represented Washington in the US Senate since 1993.“What’s next? Will Trump start detaining immigrant service members? Or will he just maintain his current policy of deporting Purple Heart veterans?”Nearly 430 personnel are responding to the Bear Gulch fire on the state’s Olympic peninsula. Firefighters told the Seattle Times that two contract crews had been sent to cut wood and were waiting for a supervisor when federal law enforcement arrived in the area.Explore more on these topicsWashington stateUS immigrationTrump administrationUS policingDemocratsUS politicsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

When an aide to Fernández Noroña steps between them, Moreno knocks him to the floor.As Fernández Noroña tries to exit the podium, another lawmaker enters the fray, taking a swing at the senate leader.“[Moreno] started to provoke me, to touch me, to pull at me,” Fernández Noroña said during a press conference after the incident. “He hit me on the arms and said: ‘I’m going to beat the shit out of you, I’m going to kill you.’”Sheinbaum rejects US ‘invasion’ after Trump orders military to target Mexico cartelsRead moreMoreno wrote on social media: “When Noroña crossed the line, he knew exactly what he was doing. I will always respond head-on, with character and without fear, to defendMexicoand give it the direction it deserves.”The scuffle followed a tense debate during which the governing Morena party and its allies accused the opposition Pri and Pan parties of calling forUS militaryintervention in Mexico, a claim that both parties denied.Earlier this week, a senator from the Pan party had gone on Fox News and said that “help from the United States to fight the cartels in Mexico is absolutely welcome”.The issue has become particularly contentious in Mexico afterDonald Trumpreportedly authorizedthe use of military force targeting drug cartels deemed terrorist organizations in Latin American countries.The senate leader said he would call an emergency session on Friday and propose expelling Moreno and three other Pri lawmakers as a result of the scuffle.

The officials emphasised there was still room for last-ditch diplomacy before the sanctions “snapback” comes into force in 30 days’ time. The annual high-level UN general assembly in September is likely to involve more intensive diplomacy over the situation withIran.They added that Iran had been in significant non-compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal since 2019, saying Tehran had been given ample opportunity to become compliant but had either been unwilling or unable to act.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Iran after Israel bombed its key nuclear sites, and has been unable to renegotiate a return to assess the state of those sites. Iran has allowed the IAEA inspectors to visit the Bushehr site, where refuelling is due to occur.Return of UN nuclear inspectors to Iran met with protests by MPsRead moreDavid Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, told the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, of the decision by the three European countries in a call on Thursday morning.Lammy said: “Despite repeated warnings, Iran has made no substantive effort to meet the conditions of our extension offer and has consistently failed to provide credible assurances on the nature of its nuclear programme.“Whilst we have been left with no choice but to take this action, the ball remains in Iran’s court and I would welcome their return to the table with a serious offer.”In response Araghchi said Iran was ready to resume “fair” negotiations over its nuclear programme if the west showed goodwill.“Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s readiness to resume fair and balanced diplomatic negotiations, on the condition that the other parties show seriousness and goodwill and avoid actions that harm the chances of success,” he said in a letter sent to the European Union foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.Araghchi had earlier said the European move was “illegal and unjustified” and that the decision needed to be reversed in the coming days.The United Nations on Thursday called on Iran and major powers to seize the momentum to strike a nuclear deal. “In the next 30 days, there is a window of opportunity to avoid any further escalation and find a way forward that serves peace,” said Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for secretary general António Guterres.In a sign of the hostility to the plans to cooperate with the IAEA, an Iranian MP, Amir-Hossein Sabeti, said he had read the draft text of the agreement with the agency word for word, and described it is as a “disaster” adding: “If it is a lie, deny it and we will be happy, but if it is true, then woe betide you.”Restoring sanctions would convert many existing – largely US and European – measures into UN-wide sanctions requiring observance by Russia and China, who finalised a draft UN security council resolution on Thursday to extend the nuclear deal for six months and urge all parties to immediately resume negotiations.Some sanctions on the Iranian arms industry that are not currently in force will be restored. In addition, the US, as a permanent member of the UN security council, will in future have a veto over the lifting of the UN sanctions, a power it currently does not have.The three European powers had to act now before the nuclear deal expired on 15 October and their power to reinstate sanctions ended.Justifying the decision, UK officials said the 2015 nuclear deal allowed Iran to store only 300kg of uranium enriched up to 3.67%. Instead, the stockpile was 45 times larger than this limit, with much of the uranium over the purity levels set by the 2015 agreement. Iran also had a 400kg stockpile of unaccounted highly enriched uranium.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bluntly, we have run out of time. We cannot allow the Iran nuclear file to fall off the agenda or for sanctions to be permanently lifted while Iran’s nuclear programme escalates and IAEA access is denied in clear breach of its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.”They said the snapback step was legal and proportionate, and the UK remained committed to a diplomatic solution. They added the UK had in June suggested a six-month delay in enforcing the sanctions on the condition that Iran allowed the IAEA back in.The officials said Iran had stopped implementing the additional protocol allowing enhanced inspections of its nuclear sites.Return of UN nuclear inspectors to Iran met with protests by MPsRead moreSome experts fear Iran may respond by withdrawing altogether from the non-proliferation treaty at the most extreme, or hardening its opposition to the return of the IAEA.Although the Iran nuclear file is not at the top of the White House agenda, Iranians fear it is likely soon to attract the attention of Donald Trump and Israel, raising the possibility of further attacks.Iran is divided between those who want to accept US demands in return for the lifting of sanctions and those unafraid of further confrontation.The Iranian leadership, caught by surprise by the June attacks, has been reorganising its defence and security leadership, and it is possible it has not had time to reach an internal consensus.The Iranian parliament, dominated by conservatives, has set strict conditions for the return of the IAEA, but these can be overridden by Iran’s national security council.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policyFranceGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But this year it’s not just British schoolgoers being bombarded with uniform reminders and lunchbox ideas. The classroom comeback now extends to university students. Welcome to a new era of the commodification of the campus.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Previously, it was easy to differentiate between UK and US campus culture. US students had frat parties, drank from plastic red cups and slept in shared dorm rooms. Meanwhile, UK freshers had house parties, drank cans on the bus and congregated in communal kitchens. But thanks to social media the lines are becoming more blurred. Algorithms have influencedeveryone to dress the sameand now this is affecting campus culture. Social media is peppered with US and UK students doingroom makeover toursand library fit checks, and the only difference between them is their accents and labels. Now, as the illusion of campus life becomes more powerful than the reality of it, brands are attempting to monetise it.This month Kim Kardashian’s all-powerful shapewear label Skims pivoted from selling Hannibal Lecter-esqueface-sculpting wrapsto PJs for students tobed rotin. Its first dedicated “Campus Collection” features “dorm-approved and lecture-ready” pieces such as jersey capri pants, cropped hoodies and cotton poplin micro shorts modelled by a group of real students (dubbed the “Skims Class of 2025”). On Asos you can browse a “Student Edit” comprising over 2,000 pieces that promise to “look on-point in the lecture, library and beyond” – because nothing says reading week like a sheer maxi skirt.PrettyLittleThing’s “Back to Class” edit includes an advertising campaign shot in a library (a gear shift from their usual poolside settings) complete with models wearing preppy polo tops and rugby shirts. The accessories brand Charles & Keith has teamed up with students from Central Saint Martins, photographing them on thefashion school’s campusin their favourite pieces from the brand. Even Shein, the mega fast fashion company thatchurns out up to 10,000 new pieces a day, is hopping on the trend with a “Campus Babe” programme where students can apply to be ambassadors for the online retailer and earn a commission on sales. Presumably by never wearing the same piece twice.View image in fullscreenCampus chic … Charles and Keith’s Central Saint Martins shoot.Photograph: Charles & Keith“Students have become a crucial audience because they’re tastemakers,” says Nick Drabicky from January Digital, a marketing agency. According to Drabicky, this particular cohort appeals to brands as “they’re early adopters, hyper-connected, and influence household and peer spending.”The campus-focused trend is a knock-on effect from RushTok (an amalgamation of rush week – which is a bit like freshers’ week –and TikTok) , a corner of social media where applicants forelite Greek sororities in the USAdocument the process of getting a “bid” (i.e. membership). The recruitment phenomenon first went viral on TikTok in August 2021 with PNMs (potential new members) sharing their experiences at the University of Alabama, including game nights and synchronised dances. However, it was outfit of the day videos posted from dorm rooms that really captivated viewers. These 60-second videos featured predominantly thin, white, 18-year-olds with bright blond hair and obvious fake tans name-checking brands such as Steve Madden shoes, Kendra Scott earrings, Golden Goose trainers and The Pants Store – which, it turns out,didn’t just sell pants– in a distinctive southern drawl. Viewers who prior to the videos were blissfully unaware of what a Panhellenic sorority is – and lived in countries such as the UK where they don’t even exist – began to mimic them, while phrases such as “My jewelry is normal” were then commoditised and turnedinto merch.Four years later and the yearly event has becomeakin to a reality TV show, with brands keen to get involved.View image in fullscreenRushTok … Sorority recruits at the University of Alabama vie for their spot.Photograph: Brynn Anderson/APWhile brands such as Skims and Asos don’t directly reference rush week, the timing of their launches allude to it. “RushTok has set the stage for brands to package college culture in an aspirational but relatable way,” Drabicky says, adding, “Skims’ Campus Collection shows how you can tap into the energy of RushTok without needing to mimic it outright”. He expects to see more brands emulating its strategy – “It’s the new playbook for youth marketing,” he says.The campus as catnip comes at a time when it has never been more politicised nor expensive to attend. This has only fuelled interest in traditional campus signifiers, especially those rooted in a preppy subculture. Perhaps there is an element of nostalgia to it. With boat shoes, cable knit sweaters and varsity jackets all having a resurgence, many seem to be dressing for a uni experience that is entrenched in the past. One of the biggest bestsellers this season at M&S is a cropped rugby shirt-type top that feels very fresher. Parke’s £95 eponymous emblazonedsweatshirts, which riff on the typeface of merch from Ivy League universities, have become a status item among the collegiate it references as well as non students. H&M is selling a £19.99Yale sweatshirt. Primark offers a UCLA version for £18.While it is common to think of university students as being broke – especially since uni fees were raised to 9k per year in 2012 – Drabicky says we shouldn’t underestimate their spending power. “Students are more brand-conscious and willing to invest in identity-driven purchases than people think.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While a part-time job at the local pub or stacking shelves in a supermarket used to be a typical avenue for students looking to earn extra cash, a new type of side hustle is emerging that doesn’t even involve leaving their halls of residence. Student influencers are in demand, with day in the life videos documenting lie-ins, lectures and partying until 6am racking up hundreds of thousands of views on social media platforms.

I’m also thinking about what I like to call “sunburn cinema” – homegrown films like recent release Hot Milk (adapted fromDeborah Levy’s novel), which remind us we’re a nation uniquely ill-equipped to deal with the sun. Or, as one popular Letterboxdreviewputs it: “Oh no, the Brits are on trauma vacation again”.Sunburn is the hallmark of a particular kind of Brit abroad, visual evidence of the lack of decorum that we notoriously display across the resorts and beach towns of Europe. Sunburn cinema, however, pinpoints what makes us inclined to chaos and self-sabotage.Hot Milk, for example, sees mother and daughter Rose (Fiona Shaw) and Sofia (Emma Mackey) seek answers for Rose’s undiagnosed pain at a mysterious Spanish clinic, making a sad holiday out of a desperate last ditch effort to improve their lives. Things quickly go off the rails, and Sofia kicks out by indulging in all the idiosyncrasies of the British way of holidaying: boozing, broiling, and sleeping around. Ultimately both mother and daughter’s hopes curdle in the heat, leaving the viewer feeling as burned and foolish as its protagonists.View image in fullscreenCurdling … Emma Mackey, left, and Fiona Shaw in Hot Milk.Photograph: Nikos Nikolopoulos/Nikos Nikolopoulos/MubiA sour turn is a hallmark of these films, which are concerned not just with the holiday itself but with the overarching tumult of trying to escape ourselves. It’s a broad genre, with a long tradition of bawdy comedy. Tongue-in-cheek films such as Carry on Abroad paved the way for gross-out farces such asKevin and Perry Go LargeorThe Inbetweeners Movie(a film about, primarily “two weeks of sun, sea, sex, sand, booze [and] sex”). These films cavort through a series of mishaps with alcohol, light xenophobia, injury, sexual conquests and disasters, all while poking fun at themselves. Smacked pink by the ravages of UV, their holidaymakers wear sunburn as a badge of honour, happy by the time the credits roll to return to their own lives after all.Brits are a moody lot though, and the darker end of the spectrum is fertile ground. The dawn of the millennium saw the boom of bargain travel with the rise of easyJet and Ryanair, and gave us two tent poles of the genre:Sexy BeastandMorvern Callar. Who could forget the sight of neon pink Ray Winstone as Gal in Sexy Beast, the typical Costa Del Sol transplant, blustering: “Oh, it’s fucking hot. Too hot? Not for me, I love it”? We soon see Gal in hot water though, as his dream of leaving a life of crime behind is torched by the arrival of Ben Kingsley’s unhinged mobster Don. Dragging Gal back to the “grimy, sooty” dump that is England, Don is a violent reminder that you can’t leave who you are behind.View image in fullscreenSpiralling off the rails … Kathleen McDermott and Samantha Morton in Morvern Callar.Photograph: Company Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarMeanwhile, Lynne Ramsay’s Morvern Callar takes the idea of escaping reality to extremes. After finding his dead body, Morvern (Samantha Morton) passes off her boyfriend’s book as her own, and absconds to Spain to spend the money he left her for the funeral. Morvern brings her friend Lanna along for the ride, and the pair make free and merry with the booze at first, shacking up in a cheap and cheerful resort where the pre-eurozone pound goes far. But after a strange sexual encounter with another grieving holidaymaker, Morvern starts to spiral, sending the whole endeavour off the rails.These films don’t inhabit the romanticised landscape of #eurosummer that Americans fantasise about. Instead they present a flat strip, plastic-filled beaches, cheap drinks and decaying hotels. Morvern Callar is a feverish, atmospheric film that reflects the confusion and dissociation of grief, and Ramsay washes Spain out in an unfocused blur of constant sun. Similarly, director Jonathan Glazer aims a dazzling light at Gal in Sexy Beast, using top-down shots to suggest a bug trapped in the glare of a microscope.After the boom and bust of the package holiday dream, post-Brexit malaise suffuses a recent wave of films with a similar bleakness. Charlotte Wells’ striking debutAftersunis an exploration of the way grief distorts the past as it journeys to a Turkish resort, as Calum (Paul Mescal) tries to keep his demons at bay while holidaying with his young daughter Sophie (Frankie Corio). Wells uses a similarly stark lighting style to Ramsay, intensifying blue tones to contrast an oppressively bright sun, and Sophie’s slow awakening to her father’s fragile state of mind plays out like one long gut-punch.View image in fullscreenA bug trapped in the glare of a microscope … Ray Winstone in Sexy Beast.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyMeanwhile,Molly Manning Walker’s bitingHow to Have Sextakes a closer look at the kind of holiday The Inbetweeners lads dream of. Walker dramatises the way these rites-of-passage trips are built on a culture that is ripe for exploitation, leaving young thrill-seekers vulnerable to party reps, to price-gouging clubs, and to each other. As its teens navigate their own confused expectations around booze and sex, it’s hard not to squirm with recognition at a particularly British kind of peer pressure that pushes boundaries and muddies consent.Sunburn cinema consists of sweaty, sticky films shot through with a deep anxiety about identity and place. As the hangover kicks in, so does the realisation that a holiday is only ever a stopover, never a destination. As Lanna snipes to Morvern: “It’s the same crapness everywhere, so stop dreaming”; this dour outlook shapes these films’ sensibility. The British can’t lay claim to the glamorous dog-days ennui of our continental cinema counterparts, instead we’re either slathering on the factor 50 or exposing ourselves to the consequences. Confronted with a cloudless sky and an endless sea, we tend to lose our heads, and are left with the sting of our poor decisions.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe Inbetweeners MoviefeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the drug smuggling across the Sahara racket. Alas, these are wise words that young cartel driver Max (Alfie Allen, bringing exactly the reckless high energy the character and venture require) has failed to heed. We first meet him speeding across the Algerian portion of the north African desert with a companion called Carlos (Nezar Thalal) on their way to Beirut to exchange a great deal of cocaine for some antique statues, when bish, bash, wallop, what’s happening?! An ambush by a militant group armed with machine guns who kill Carlos and are about to kill Max? But then one of the group turns on the others and kills all of them stone dead instead, before flinging Max and the coke in the car and hightailing it out of there? Thatiswhat’s happening! Goodness me and welcome to the first 37 seconds of Atomic, a five-part miniseries you shouldn’t expect to let up any time soon.Max’s rescuer is averse to providing his real name so Max calls him JJ – short for “Jihadi John”. If this offends anyone’s delicate sensibilities I think you should have left 37 seconds ago. JJ reroutes them to Benghazi for unspecified reasons. Max can hope to return to his original plans thereafter.View image in fullscreenAn unusually well-armed physics professor … Samira Wiley in Atomic.Photograph: Sifeddine Elamine/Sky/Pulse FilmsMeanwhile, we trot over to other parts of the globe, including the Caucasus mountains in Russia, where an oligarch’s fearsome daughter Oksana Shirokova (Avital Lvova) is sending a brace of boxes via some reluctant mule herders to Beirut. She adds that they and the unspecified contents (“To you they’re statues”) being smuggled out of the nuclear state must be kept two metres apart at all times. The mule herders look even more reluctant. The astute viewer notes anew the title of the series and nods sagely.For the first episode or two you worry that it’s all going to be too much. To the multiple locations and destinations, potential heroes and villains are added a cartel riad in Marrakech, flashbacks to JJ in Syria, an American university in Beirut where Samira Wiley is Dr Cassie Elliott, an unusually well-armed lecturer in physics, a set of corrupt gendarmes, a gang of military types led by a very angry Scotsman, Rab Makintosh (Stuart Martin), the father of one of the murdered militants, a lost young boy (Keni Emmanuelle, heartbreaking in a wordless part), the CIA, and Max’s beloved girlfriend Laetitia (Charlie Murphy) and Brian Gleeson as Dr Elliott’s boss, Mark, and a few more.View image in fullscreen‘The violence is frequent’ … Shazad Latif as JJ.Photograph: Sifeddine Elamine/Sky/Pulse FilmsFortunately, just as you are starting to feel that if there is one more piece of information thrown at you it is going to push the entire mass out of your head, the flood of new things stops and the plot starts to tighten and deepen.JJ’s mysterious backstory is filled in and his motives are complicated at every turn. Banter with Max gradually gives way to bonding as the pair realise they are caught up in no ordinary cartel deal with no ordinary cargo at its heart. The suspense never lets up as they are pursued across numerous territories in a variety of vehicles and with a variety of weapons trained on them, sometimes by those with personal grudges against them, sometimes by those who merely want to murder them for their increasingly grubby rucksacks and the volatile things inside them (uranium, OK? It’s uranium. I don’t know why I’m trying so hard to keep it a secret), but the increasing emotional stakes are raised as we go.The violence is frequent but – especially for all those who are still in the process of recovering from the harrowing, seemingly endless scenes inThe Narrow Road to the Deep North– mercifully cartoonish. The questions that it asks about what it means to live a good life, how people pervert religions, seek redemption or justify taking revenge come increasingly to the fore and add an unexpected heft to the whole, though it can still be enjoyed as a breakneck, Guy-Ritchie-esque drug-caper-cum-buddy-movie, if you want.But Atomic brings with it that ineffable pleasure caused by watching something that someone took just one or two extra passes over, to give its audience an experience just a bit better than you were expecting, just that bit better than it needed to be.Atomic aired on Sky Max and is on Now in the UK and on Binge in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Does the globally traumatised finale succeed in retrospectively upgrading the significance of what has preceded it? Do these avowedly important images and moods quite match up with the single-joke-single-punchline movie with all its violent slapstick grotesquerie that went before?Working with screenwriter Will Tracy, Lanthimos has remade the2003 Korean film Save the Green Planet!, changing the gender of the corporate character. Audiences might also be reminded of the great Danish provocateur Lars von Trier by the tongue-in-cheek portentous chapter headings, or evenM Night Shyamalan’s widely derided mystery drama The Happening from 2008, which features the disappearance of honeybees.The title refers to a myth about bees emerging from a dead ox; our seething antihero Teddy, played byJesse Plemons, is a beekeeper, devastated by the progressive diminution of the honeybee population and blaming this on eco-devastation caused by a vast retail/pharmaceutical conglomerate run by dead-eyed corporate ice queen Michelle, played by Stone. Her company also gravely injured Teddy’s troubled mother, Sandy, played by Alicia Silverstone, with its experimental opioid withdrawal drugs.Mistrustful of mainstream media, Teddy has been doing his own research on the internet about capitalism and elitist conspiracies, and he now believes that Michelle is an evil space alien. With his trusting, innocent cousin (played by Aidan Delbis) he sets out to kidnap and torture Michelle in his basement until she and her fellow Andromedans promise to leave earthlings alone.View image in fullscreenDoing his own research … Jesse Plemons in Bugonia.Photograph: Courtesy of Focus Features © 2025 All Rights Reserved.Stone is lethally cold and heartless as Michelle; she gets up at 4.30am every day for various workouts and comes in to the office to assure her cowed staff that – after bad publicity about an overwork-related crisis – they can leave work at 5.30pm if they really think they have earned it. Her seven-stages-of-grief-type reaction to finding herself chained to a bed in a scuzzy house cycles through imperious demands and threats, wary diplomacy, pleading, followed by humouring Teddy by agreeing that, sure, yes, OK, she’s an alien. (Although for all its confrontational gross out, the film flinches from the lavatorial realities of her imprisonment.)Plemons himself delivers an efficient punch as the fanatical Teddy and there is something subtle and unexpected in his relationship with the local cop Casey (Stavros Halkias) who comes to see him, inhibited in his investigation by some painful shared memories of their childhood.Bugonia is a very well made film, and while it is not true to say it is less than the sum of its parts, it is less than that final and very powerful part. LikeAri Aster’s recent film Eddington, it also shows how difficult it is to make internet conspiracy obsession interesting. For me, Bugonia doesn’t have the ingenuity and elegance of Lanthimos’s previous filmKinds of Kindness, nor the emotional generosity and audacity of his steampunk fantasiaPoor Things. It’s a spiny, prickly, hothouse flower.Bugonia screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersComedy filmsYorgos LanthimosEmma StoneJesse PlemonsVenice film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

This new film is about South African naturalist Dr Steve Boyes and his mission to discover if there is a hitherto undiscovered mega-species of giant elephants, or “ghost elephants”, living beyond the human gaze in the vast highland plateau of Angola. He also wants to see if these fugitive elephants – if they exist – are genetically related toa particular huge elephant, the biggest on record, which is on show at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, named the “Fénykövi” elephant after the hunter who shot it in 1955.Boyes has been nurturing this hunch for many years. It is not clear what the scientific basis for his hypothesis is, but he is in constant touch with Kalahari bush trackers in Namibia, whose instinctive understanding of elephants has led him to this vision. He and his team conduct an expedition intoAngola, intent on finding the “ghost elephants” and getting a DNA sample to take back to the Smithsonian – rather like a Jurassic Park movie – having first gained permission to do so from a tribal king in a ceremony treated without mockery.This film may not have the self-destructive craziness and tragicomedy of Herzog’s documentary masterpieceGrizzly Man, which was about an amateur enthusiast’s doomed desire to live among grizzly bears; in fact the quest that Ghost Elephants describes is perfectly rational and irony free, and finally results in (provisional) success. The film is so rich and exotic, if that word has not been discredited in this context. Herzog’s keen eye for the characters and personalities gives it its flavour, and so of course does his unmistakable rasping voice, particularly when he goes into raptures about the day-to-day life of an indigenous villager: “I know I shouldn’t romanticise him but … surrounded by chickens … it can’t get better than this!”Herzog doesn’t pause to consider the aspects of the great white hunter and great white saviour in all this, perhaps because the implications are so obvious and already so extensively discussed. It is a marvellously warm and engaging study.Ghost Elephants screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalDocumentary filmsWerner HerzogWildlifeAngolaAfricaFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The perspectives shift between that of Cherry, the girlfriend (Olivia Cooke), and that of Laura, the mother (Robin Wright, who also directs). Whoever’s take you are watching, that’s who you believe. Baroque events, blood and guts, flagrant lies – it all unfurls in exquisite interiors and idealised London street scenes.It is compulsive. I bit my nails to shreds.

People this irresistible to one another never end up at peace.“This is a triangular love story,” Wright begins, speaking to me from “the countryside”; she is still based in the UK since shooting The Girlfriend last year. “In a different world, Laura and Cherry would have been best friends, because they’re so alike. Their love for this one young man is from two different fields. A mother that’s possessive and overprotective – is she just being paranoid about this girlfriend, or is the girlfriend not to be trusted?”So far, so universal. “That’s just intrinsic to being a mother,” says Wright. “OK, who’s going to be good enough for my child? And it’s going to be slim pickings.”View image in fullscreen‘My mum has never liked my boyfriends at all’ …Olivia Cooke in The Girlfriend.Photograph: Christopher Raphael/PrimeIt’s not even just a mother-son thing, Cooke says, down the line from Mallorca where she is on holiday. “My mum, with boyfriends that me and my sister have had, has not liked them at all. Once a mum sniffs a malignancy in the person her son or daughter is with, it’s hard for her to brush that aside. And I can read people pretty well – I’ve never been out with anyone overtly hideous.”But this story isn’tthatuniversal – the super-rich parents, Laura and Howard (Waleed Zuaiter), are in an open marriage, where Howard has a long-term lover but yearns for Laura’s attention. Their son Daniel (Laurie Davidson), meanwhile, either has an earth-shattering connection with his girlfriend Cherry, or she’s playing him. And there is a quasi-incestuous flavour to Laura and Daniel right at the centre.“We’re in so much competition now with content,” says Wright. “How racy everything is, how much shock value it has. We had to up the ante and have the mother kiss the son, which is so fucked up, so weird. And yet, it happens.”So much hangs on the physicality of Laura and Cherry, their contrasting magnetism: Wright polished and elegant, always wearing camel; Cherry pneumatic and spellbinding, like a siren. “Her sensuality, and the way she looks, was a whole monster itself,” says Cooke. “Especially for me – I feel much more comfortable when the focus isn’t on how I look. But maybe getting older [she is 31] has made me a bit more comfortable in my body; for a long time I was playing younger than I actually was, so there was more androgyny.”Cooke’s breakthrough role, 10 years ago, was inMe and Earl and the Dying Girl, and the contrast between that frailty and this vitality is heady. “She’s a bull, you know – she’s an ox,” Wright says, about Cooke. “She’s an animal. She’s great.”All I can think is: the intimacy coordinator on this must have really had their hands full. “That is the new world,” Wright says, wearing her director’s hat. “The intimacy coordinator talks to the actor first, then they come to you and say, ‘This is what they’re willing to do, this is what they’re not willing to do,’ and you morph around that. OK, let’s find a way to display what the original thought was, with those restrictions. And it worked out OK, because what we got in the show is enough.”If Cherry is hiding who she is, says Cooke, who can blame her? “I reckoned with it and thought, ‘Well, the billionaire class, they lie and steal and behave abhorrently all the time. Cherry saying a few half-truths – is it really that bad?’” If Laura, in her late 50s – Wright is 59 – is still rushing headlong at her sexual destiny, that’s “a quality I think the business needs, and I think they’re realising that: get these women that are in their last chapter, don’t curtail it. Just let it live for what it is. Because it is life. Why stop at 40 years of age? Like, get the women at 60, at 70.”“Robin invented event television, didn’t she?” says Cooke – talking about House of Cards, of course, the US remake of the British political thriller. Wright remembers David Fincher approaching her about it, in 2011, while they were making The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. He said: “It will be a platform there has never been before, called streaming. Anyone and everyone can watch it, whenever they want it, as much as they want it. You won’t know until the end of each season if you get picked up again for the next season. Do you want to be a part of it?” It was a gamble for Wright, who had been celebrated on the big screen since The Princess Bride in 1987; the long-form possibilities of the box set were only just beginning to be realised. “You weren’t expecting art, from TV,” she remembers.Having watched Wright on The Girlfriend, Cooke would love to direct, herself: “But I wouldn’t want to be in it as well. Robin did it with such grace and effortlessness, but it just looks like so much work.”Wright’s next project is a film called Bingo, “about a young boy who falls in love with a 70-year-old woman. And they’re soulmates. They both want to kill themselves for different reasons, and they meet in the hospital, and they fall in love. It’s a beautiful story, and no one wants to accept it because of the age difference. But you know what? It doesn’t matter. Love is love. Connection is connection. Go with it.”The Girlfriend is on Prime Video on 10 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTelevisionAutumn arts preview 2025Robin WrightDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first track, Look at You, starts out with softly sung vocals over a cushion of equally soft synthesiser chords, before stopping dead, then re-emerging as almost an entirely different song: harmonies over guitar chords strummed so slowly you can hear the plectrum hitting each individual string. The second, Thinking Clean, offers a piano over pattering hi-hats: there’s something anticipatory about it, like an intro that’s about to burst into life, but when it does – complete with dancefloor rhythm – the song swiftly falls apart. The piano becomes increasingly abstract, before everything gives way to scrabbling, apparently improvised cello.View image in fullscreenBlood Orange: Essex Honey.Photograph: RCA/PAIt’s a lot to cram into six minutes, but anyone familiar with Blood Orange’sback cataloguemight reasonably ask: what did you expect? Since he adopted the name, Hynes’s career has occasionally intersected with the mainstream, although never in a straightforward way. His biggest track,Champagne Coast, was belatedly hoisted to platinum status by a burst of TikTok virality, 14 years after release. As a producer and songwriter, his name has appeared in the credits of albums by major pop artists including Mariah Carey and Kylie Minogue, but never as a dependable hit-maker, more a signal that said artist is craving a hint of left-field cool. His albums exist in their own world, filled with unexpected musical jump-cuts, their variety indicated by the featured artists: Skepta and Debbie Harry, Nelly Furtado next to Yves Tumour, A$AP Rocky alongside Arca.The results, while admirably eclectic, could often be too scattered for their own good. But Essex Honey feels like a noticeably different animal to its predecessors. The eclecticism is present and correct. This is an album on which a song called The Train (King’s Cross), which closely resembles old-fashioned Sarah Records indie pop, exists alongside one called Life, which with its snail’s pace funk, wah-wah guitar, falsetto vocals and bursts of sickly woodwind sounds not unlike something Prince might have made in the wee small hours. So, too, are those musical jump-cuts. Cæcilie Trier’s cello appears regularly, usually as tracks end, playing stuff that doesn’t sound interstitial so much as disruptive. There are moments when sounds suddenly emerge then vanish just as quickly, oddly disconnected to anything around them: a burst of keyboards beforeSomewhere in Betweengets under way, a piano line in betweenMind Loadedand Vivid Light that sounds as if it’s fallen off the breakdown of an old hardcore rave tune.Blood Orange: The Field – videoAnd yet, in marked contrast to previous Blood Orange albums, all the constituent elements are held together by tone and a sense of place. Its primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy: there’s a hazy, sunlit quality to a lot of the sounds here – soft but warm synthesisers, electric piano and harmony vocals – and a chilly morning crispness about the undistorted electric guitar. The melodies are frequently gorgeous, but inescapably sad. Inspired by the death of Hynes’s mother, the lyrics evoke both Greater London’s urban sprawl – “Ilford is the place that I hold dear,” he sings on The Last of England – and its more pastoral surroundings, the latter a relief from “the broken light” of the city on Countryside.It’s also an album on which memories provide a brief respite from looming tragedy. “Regressing back to times you know / Playing songs you forgot you owned,” Hynes sings on Westerberg, a song that duly borrows its chorus from the Replacements’ 1987 single Alex Chilton. Elsewhere, there are interpolations of tracks by Yo La Tengo and Everything But the Girl’s Ben Watt: an extraordinarily lovely sample from 1998’s Sing to Me earns the Durutti Column a credit onThe Field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

There’s a heartbreaking moment when Lorde’s voice soars out during Mind Loaded, singing the phrase “everything means nothing to me” – an interpolation of the Elliott Smith song of the same name – and an impressively witty one during Vivid Light, when a line about writer’s block is delivered by novelist Zadie Smith.

His thoughtful new recording has a sense of the work’s drama but is never wilful nor perverseAndrew ClementsThu 28 Aug 2025 12.28 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 12.29 EDTShareHarpsichordistMahan Esfahanihas been working his way steadily throughJS Bach’skeyboard works for Hyperion and has arrived at one of the great monuments of western music. Like so many players, Esfahani has lived with Bach’s 48 preludes and fugues, the Well-Tempered Clavier, for more than half his life, so that returning to it now, he says, “with decades of performance and scholarship behind me, has been both a challenge and a homecoming’.Typically, Esfahani comes now to these pieces with his own very personal ideas on how they should be presented and performed – “This is a perfectly crafted piece of theatre,” he has said – and there is a real sense in his performances of each prelude and fugue defining its own dramatic space. The tuning of his harpsichord – a modern copy of an early 18th-century two-manual instrument of a kind that Bach is known to have played – is designed to give a specific colour to each key, for, as Esfahani points out, the “well-tempered” of the work’s title, does not indicate, as so often assumed, a work composed to demonstrate the advantages of equal temperament, but conversely the way in which just tuning may be adapted to suit the demands of each of the major and minor scales.At the end of the sequence, after the B minor fugue, Esfahani makes a point of repeating the C major prelude, Goldberg-style, to emphasise, he says, how so many of the preludes are variations of the form of the first, “[an] harmonic outline over which a melodic kernel is repeated throughout”. It is one of Esfahani’s more contentious ideas, yet his approach never seems wilful or perverse, and with a few exceptions – to my ears, the C sharp minor fugue does seem unnecessarily lugubrious – his choice of tempi is uncontroversial, his shaping of each movement wonderfully lucid.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

People power is the way that you can change things in the world.“It’s a warning, set to a dance beat,” Batiste said about the song, Petrichor, which appears on his new album Big Money. The Oscar- and multiple Grammy-winning composer and his band performed Petrichor live during Tuesday’s interview; that performance can be seen below.2:50Jon Batiste performs new song 'Petrichor' urging climate action – videoThe word “petrichor” refers to “the scent of the earth after the rain”, Batiste said, “when there’s been warm, dry soil for a long time, and then things come back into balance. And right now, we’re out of balance … the natural life support systems of the planet are under threat.”With a refrain that repeatedly declares “they burning the planet down”, Petrichor does not sugarcoat the dangers of climate change, yet Batiste remains optimistic. “When you make a song, you want to inspire people, but you also want to let them know what they can do,” he said. “And the things that we can do [are] really very simple. It’s clean energy technology, right now, that we can switch to. We can make the world be powered by things that don’t destroy the planet.‘You had to fend for yourself’: Hurricane Katrina haunts New Orleans as Trump guts disaster aidRead more“There’s a blanket of pollution around the Earth,” Batiste added, referring to the planet-warming gases released by burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal and by cutting down forests. “The summers feel hot, everything is hot, the weather patterns are shifting. Nobody wants that. And we know what the solution is. There’s an overwhelming majority of people that believe in clean energy … and switching to these new technologies.”The Guardianand other Covering Climate Now partners earlier this year launched the89 Percent Project, reporting that80 to 89% of the world’s people want their governments to take stronger climate action, according to numerous scientific studies. Batiste confirmed that he is part of that 89% climate majority – as is his mother, Katherine Batiste, who did environmental work for the US government in Louisiana for most of Jon’s childhood and sat next to him throughout the Covering Climate Now interview.“We believe in science,” Katherine Batiste said.“There you go,” Jon said, smiling. “You heard it.”Many people know that Jon Batiste comes from a storied musical family in New Orleans – his uncle Lionel Batiste was a mainstay of the Treme Brass Band, and his cousin Russell Batiste Jr was a celebrated jazz drummer – but Jon also comes from a family of activists. His mother’s father, David Gauthier, a leader of the Louisiana Postal Workers Union, supported the sanitation workers’ strike in 1968 that drew Martin Luther King Jr to Memphis, where King was assassinated. Among other causes, Jon has been active in theBlack Lives Matter protests, a stance his mother saw as a continuation of her father’s legacy. Her dad “believed in standing up for what’s right”, said Katherine Batiste, “and that kind of rolled over on me some, and I passed it on to Jon”.View image in fullscreenJon Batiste and his band perform during a Black Lives Matter protest in New York City, in June 2020.Photograph: Lev Radin/Pacific Press/REX/Shutterstock“I was raised by incredible people,” said Jon, who spent seven years as bandleader on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert up to 2022. “I saw my grandfather, I saw my father, I saw all these people who were in my immediate environment doing the work and not getting down about it. The key is to keep it going, not to look at yourself and pity the situation, but to find a way to do something with what you have and where you are.”The Petrichor song illustrates the larger themes of his Big Money album, he added, because the pursuit of money at all costs is putting the climate at risk. And not only the climate. “We’re in the wealthiest time in human history,” he said. “There’s no shortage of resources. Yet there are [people] who don’t have clean water, clean food, basic healthcare. And it’s disproportionately affecting those in low-income communities, people of color. [When] the majority of the wealth is in the hands of only a small percentage of people, it will inevitably corrupt the policies that can change these things. That’s who the song is really geared toward. There’s a pollution blanket around the planet, but it’s the result of a pollution blanket around our souls.“It’s fitting that we’re here in this place of worship,” Batiste said about the setting of the interview – New York’s Middle church, whose double-meaning motto is “Just love” – because “as Pope Francis said, the Earth is our common home, a sacred planet, and [we need to live] up to our responsibility as stewards of the planet.”When Hurricane Katrina struckNew Orleanson 29 August 2005, the storm and the breach of protective levees put 80% of the city underwater, killed at least 1,800 people and drove countless others to leave town, never to return. While outsiders experienced the storm on television, as a media event, the Batiste familylivedit. Jon, with his mother, father, sister and grandmother, evacuated to Texas before the storm hit. But the family home where Katherine Batiste grew up, in the Carrollton neighborhood of New Orleans, was destroyed, she said. “All my sisters, brothers, my family, their homes were destroyed … They lost everything ... It was devastating.”View image in fullscreenDevastation caused by high winds and heavy flooding in the greater New Orleans area following Hurricane Katrina, on 30 August 2005.Photograph: Vincent Laforet/EPA“New Orleans, to me, is the soul of America,”Jon Batistesaid, adding that the city was “a warning” that climate-driven disasters “can happen anywhere, and there’s many places where thishashappened”.‘A gay Mardi Gras’: the lesbian pop-up bar in New Orleans that was born after Hurricane KatrinaRead moreThe role of the artist in the face of such danger and injustice is to “point people to the solutions with rhythm and poetry”, Batiste said. “It’s like [the jazz drummer] Art Blakey said, ‘music can wash away the dust of everyday life,’ and make somebody’s apathy turn into care into action. As an artist, you can connect right to the person – still also entertaining them, but uplifting them and their voice, so that then they know, ‘Oh, I have something to say, and it’s meaningful and it’s powerful. I’m going to sing it at the concert, and I’m going to leave here and it’s going to be in my heart, and I’m going to go into the voting booth and push it, I’m going to go into my communities and push it, and I’m going to live my life in ways that are aligned with it.’ And that is infectious. It moves to the next person, and the next person, the next person, and soon it’s our reality.”Although the version of Petrichor on the Big Money album is a sort of talking blues foot-tapper that lasts 2 minutes and 38 seconds, the version Batiste and his band played a week earlier in New York’s Central Park was a raucous 11 minutes that had the standing-room crowd dancing with joy. Batiste, who has just begun a 50-date North American tour, said he planned to release a live album that will feature a similarly up-tempo version of Petrichor drawn from upcoming performances at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado.“It’s important when you’re changing the world to have a good time while you’re doing it,” he said. “I really want people to keep dancing and stay optimistic – but know that we gotta, we gotta, move.”This article is part of the 89 Percent Project of the international media collaboration Covering Climate Now.Explore more on these topicsJon BatisteThe 89% projectClimate crisisHurricane KatrinaNew OrleansinterviewsShareReuse this content"

After being fed, the baby cries, which Jules interprets as a howl of rejection: “He has no language to tell me I’m not right for him.” We learn that Jules isn’t the child’s biological parent; the birth mother is Nim who, shortly after being stitched up, left the hospital ward and seemingly vanished. Concerned for her wellbeing, the hospital called the police who questioned Jules. “Nim has run away before,” she told them. “And she’s good at hiding.”Set in Brighton, this is Saba Sams’s first novel, the follow-up to her much-admired short story collection Send Nudes. Where that book examined the lives of girls coming of age, Gunk has an older heroine in Jules, who is desperate to have a child. Her alcoholic ex-husband, Leon, who ran a student nightclub and with whom she tried and failed to conceive, cheated on her multiple times with his young staff. When one of the bartenders he slept with, Nim, discovered she was pregnant, she and Jules came to an arrangement and moved in together.The narrator is the actor Lizzie Schenk, who imbues Sams’s protagonists with depth and humanity. A poignant tale of motherhood and partnerships reimagined, Gunk shows how life can be simultaneously messy and beautiful. For Jules, life had been “small and dark” before Nim “prised her way inside and detonated it. All around me were smithereens.

Wood conjures wonders from this unlikely material in a tale so richly atmospheric you can almost taste the tang of brine and inhale the sea fog.As unexpected as his previous four books – which range from a campus intrigue (The Bellwether Revivals) to a sensitive study of a Glaswegian painter (The Ecliptic) – Seascraper follows the daily trials of Tom Flett, a “shanker” who scrapes the sand for its yield at low tide with his trusty horse and wagon, risking his life in a job that is simultaneously boring and dangerous. Tom is clearly in the Hardyesque tradition of unworldly young men who tend the land or work with their hands (Gabriel Oak, Jude Fawley), and it’s this that alerts us to his vulnerability to charmers and chancers.Apprenticed by his pop at 14 (“every other Flett had been a shrimper, going back to his great-grandpa”), Tom nevertheless longs for a life less circumscribed. He yearns to perform folksongs in the local pubs and court local girl Joan, but lacks the courage for both. An avid reader, he has swallowed “half a library” at a young age, yet finds himself tied to a job that gives him little fulfilment. Meanwhile, his widowed mother entertains gentleman suitors in the front room, perching on the sofa in her best clothes.When the latest suitor turns out to be a slick American film director named Edgar Acheson, Tom sees his chance of escape. Edgar is scouting locations for a movie adaptation and immediately looks to recruit Tom as his local guide, “a guy who knows the beach, the tides”. Tom agrees at once, though acutely aware of his antisocial stink of “pervasive sweat and shrimp rot, fish guts, crab flesh, seaweed, dander, forage, gull shit, horse dung”. The two form a fast friendship, with Tom warning his exuberant employer of the treacherous sinkholes that open up on the beach, deep enough to swallow a horse and drag you down after it. It’s this mortal danger that ramps up the tension for the book’s long and surreal central section where Tom and Edgar set out to recce the beach at night.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Whether it’s harnessing a horse, cooking a fry-up or tuning a guitar, he transforms the quotidian into the poetic, making the exactitude of each task sing on the page. The book is full of visceral and evocative descriptions of the natural world, “the festering scent of bladderwrack … a strange, spasmodic crunch each time the wheels pass over razor shells and gnarls of driftwood … undulating sand that gives beneath the wheels as readily as butter”. He’s equally adept at creating warm and believable characters whose deep humanity makes you want to spend time in their company.Inevitably, Edgar isn’t all he purports to be, leading Tom back to his first love, music, as he composes a ballad to woo Joan. This precipitates an epiphany about the power of art: “A song, though – well, a song belongs to someone. To whoever dreamed it up.” In this sense, he achieves his dreams without turning his back on tradition, and much of the book is concerned with the tension between long-established ways of living and the insistent klaxon of modernity, embodied by Edgar, along with new technologies and their attendant ills. Early on, Tom notes that there is “all sorts in the water now that wasn’t there when he was just a lad. Strange chemicals and pesticides and sewage.” He also observes that “there’s more profit to be made using motor rigs and shrimping further down the coast”.While some of the dialogue veers close to folksy, and Edgar is straight from central casting, there’s a clarity of observation and lack of sentimentality that raises the book from a simple tale of unfulfilled lives and nostalgia for a vanished past. The short form feels Conradian, lending a welcome density and brevity – apt for a protagonist grappling with physical adversity and inner turmoil. Seascraper sees Wood join the ranks of adventurous mid-career British novelists such as Barney Norris and Ben Myers; all three are treading a singular path with unfashionable yet heartfelt accounts of lives that long for a wider horizon.Seascraper by Benjamin Wood is published by Viking (£14.99).

This is often where the best stories are and where Esoteric Ebb takes its inspiration.Part tabletop game, part RPG, you play as a cleric who has been sent to investigate the destruction of a tea shop in the city Norvik, which is about to hold its first ever election in five days. You’ll talk (and occasionally fight) with the local residents to uncover the truth and affect the outcome of the election. Or perhaps you’ll just fight some seagulls. You can choose your own path, but, much like in D&D, your success comes down to dice rolls and having to live with the consequences if you fail them.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to do something entirely different’ … Esoteric Ebb.Photograph: Christoffer Bodegård“Every single choice available in the game is something that I anticipated,” says writer and developer Christoffer Bodegård. It’s particularly impressive because every interaction in even a tiny area of the game feels so open-ended. All of the dialogue choices and touching of random objects have been thoughtfully considered by Bodegård to give the feeling of freedom in a confined space. The experience of playing D&D and your players doing unexpected things has come together in the game.As a cleric you may be taking on the role of a detective, but you can cast spells to read people’s minds to gain an advantage or even speak to the dead to uncover other lines of inquiry. Your cleric is entirely your own as you can customise their accessories – and their personality, with classic D&D stats such as charisma and strength. You could make yourself strong but with low intelligence so you might win a fight but not be smart enough to get a truthful answer out of anyone because your dice rolls can never get high enough.“At some point I was like, well, I play so much D&D, why not just make my own homebrew?” Bodegård says. “I wanted to do something entirely different, and that’s what inspired the basis of the world of Esoteric Ebb, which is just taking D&D and looking at it from a weird, esoteric, realistic angle. Like, what if these spells actually did exist? How would governments form? How would various powers exist in relation to these actual D&D mechanics? If we can create food and water from a spell, how does that affect the economy? And just looking at it from that perspective.”Norvik may look like a small, medieval-style city on the surface, but because so much consideration has been put into how the place works with its various political parties and citizens, it feels like a real place. Just one with monsters working at shops, and magic. Bodegård’s focus on the depth of the setting and the sheer scope of all the dialogue choices makes for an enticing prospect. “As long as I’m entertained by the thing I’m writing, I can keep writing, and the second I’m bored, I stop.”Esoteric Ebb is in development for PC; due for release in 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCIndie gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a love letter to our elders, says its writerJN BenjaminThu 28 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 06.30 EDTShare“Black Power. The words can send shivers down the spine of the nervous white man,” begins the 2021 BBC documentary Black Power: A British Story of Resistance, which takes a closer look at the movement from the 1960s to the present day. The quote, delivered by a male voice in a plummy accent evocative of a different era, is clipped from a news report aired by the same broadcaster in the 1970. Although at the time those words were perhaps just as likely to send shivers down the spine of the knowing Black man.By then, the Metropolitan police had set up a covert surveillance operation designed to decapitate Black activism in the UK by targeting the movement’s leaders. The special branch unit was established in 1967 by the Labour home secretary Roy Jenkins, and named the Black Power Desk. Its scope was profoundly intrusive. The Black Power Desk remained active into the 1990s, incorporated into the Met’s Special Demonstration Squad; in 2018, the Undercover Policing Inquiry confirmed that a number of officers unlawfully entered into intimate relationships with members of the movement as part of the operation.View image in fullscreenRochelle Rose in rehearsals for Black Power Desk.Photograph: Ali PainterThis fascinating and relatively unknown period of British history is the inspiration behind a new musical about to open in London. Originally conceived as part of an artist development programme at south London’s Old Vic, Black Power Desk will premiere at the Brixton House theatre. It is the perfect home: since the venue’s opening three years ago, it has been working to establish itself as the place to showcase stories made for, by and about Black communities. The area itself is also steeped in rich Black British history relevant to the musical’s themes. Back in the day, some factions of the Black Power movement organised on the venue’s neighbouring streets.The location for the production’s premiere was incredibly important to playwright Urielle Klein-Mekongo: “I didn’t want to make a show that couldn’t be shown to the culture first, blessed by the culture first, consecrated by the culture first.” When she started developing the musical seven years ago, the Mangrove Nine – a group of two women and seven men of West Indian heritage known for being part of the British Black Power movement – were little known outside west London. Named after the Mangrove, a Notting Hill restaurant run by civil rights activist Frank Crichlow that became a lively community hub, the group worked to advance the rights of Black people in the UK.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t want to make a show that couldn’t be shown to the culture first’ … Playwright Urielle Klein-Mekongo.Photograph: Ali PainterFast forward to 2020, and the group’s story had gone mainstream, thanks in large part to director Steve McQueen’s anthology series Small Axe. The series opens with a 90-minute film that chronicles their story, including their landmark 1971 trial at the Old Bailey, in which they were accused of inciting a riot at a protest march. All members of the group were acquitted of the most serious charges against them, and it marked the first time that institutional racism within the Met Police was officially recognised – a monumental victory for UK civil rights.Was it annoying that Small Axe was released first? “I was annoyed for sure!” Klein-Mekongo laughs. “I thought: You could have hired me! I could have been in it!” Jokes aside, she found the arrival of a prominent adaptation very useful, and paid close attention in particular to how it was received by those from and close to the movement, many of whom are still alive. “He got his research right, but I know there’s a bunch of elders who didn’t necessarily approve of how certain things were put; some of them were quite vocal about that.” Gaining their approval has been a guiding motivation for her: “This is a love letter to them.”McQueen’s Small Axe wasn’t the first time a television series had shone a light on the British Black Power movement. It was watching John Ridley’s Guerilla, a six-part series that aired on Sky Atlantic in 2017, that planted in Klein-Mekongo the seeds of inspiration for Black Power Desk. At the time, the series washeavily criticisedby veterans of the movement for the “unforgivable” erasure of Black women within the British Black Panthers. That omission piqued Klein-Mekongo’s curiosity.UK Black history has only been slightly interjected in the curriculum here and there“They had a south Asian woman [Freida Pinto] playing the head of the rebellion and I just thought: This isn’t making sense to me. How did they get here?” At this point, she also realised she knew very little about Black British history: “In mainstream schools, UK Black history has only been slightly interjected in the curriculum here and there … Why do I know more about Rosa Parks? Why do I know more about Martin Luther King? The Mangrove Nine should be on the UK curriculum.” From there, she began her own independent research.Black Power Desk is set in the year after the Mangrove Nine trial, with real figures and events from the Black British civil rights movement providing the backdrop for the action on stage. Rochelle Rose and Veronica Carabai take the lead as sisters Celia and Dina, who are trying their best to support each other in the aftermath of their mother’s death, while racial tensions between the state and Black communities bubble up all around them. But they are also in conflict with each other. A “central theme” of the play, Klein-Mekongo says, is the dichotomy between “your activism versus your humanity”. The tension is embodied in the difference between the two sisters: Dina is willing to fight for her community, while Celia doesn’t necessarily want to be defined by her activism.View image in fullscreenHistory repeating … A demonstration in Brixton, south London, by the Black Workers’ Movement in 1973.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesKlein-Mekongo worked alongside dramaturg Gail Babb to develop the script. Originally it was a musicalised verbatim account of the Mangrove Nine trial. Then with each draft, the team considered the potential ramifications of their approach. There was the question of ownership: who has the right to tell this story?The two are aware that making art about living people has ethical implications. Black Britons, Babb says, “all have a claim and part ownership of the stories that happened in this country, of stories that happened to communities we’re a part of, to ancestors we’ve come from”. However, “having a stake in a story doesn’t mean you get to tell it however you want, for whatever purpose you want”. This led them to take a change in direction – and fictionalise the plot instead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When thinking about why something like this has not been done before, it’s easy to be cynical; that the industry often conflates work about Black lives with increased risk is no secret. In Klein-Mekongo’s experience, “new work is struggling to raise money and pull things together to even get a moment on stage. They love us when they want a nice gospelly, sassy Dreamgirls moment, but do they ever want to hear the Black British voice?”View image in fullscreenMusical notes … (from left) composer Renell Shaw; actor and lyricist Gerel Falconer; director Gbolahan Obisesan; and writer Urielle Klein-MekongoPhotograph: Ali PainterBlack talent is more often used in service of existing narratives outside their direct experience, as can be seen in the 2023 production of Sylvia at the Old Vic, which saw the acclaimed singer-songwriter and actor Beverley Knight play noted socialist campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst. “The story doesn’t belong to us, but they’re gonna use our spice to season their sauce,” says Klein-Mekongo.A more generous reading considers the time that has passed since the events in question. Fifty years may seem like a long time, but the 70s was only one generation ago. This is the first time that telling this story this way – examining it as a significant moment in history – has been possible.“It’s hard to know how significant the small, everyday things in your life are; it’s hard to tell when you’re living through history,” Babb says, before recounting a decades-old anecdote about stopping to chat to the poet and prominent Black Power activist Linton Kwesi Johnson in a random encounter on the streets of south London’s Lewisham – he and her father were friends – and thinking nothing of it at the time. “I think we forget how special our lives are.”As it opens, Black Power Desk is a powerful reminder that the history of our existence in this country is not only worth knowing, but it’s also worthy of celebration.Black Power Deskis at Brixton House from1to 28 September then touring to Warwick Arts Centre, Lowry and Birmingham Hippodrome.Explore more on these topicsStageBlack British cultureRaceMusicalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A 1985 bestselling book detailing the inhumane working conditions and everyday racism that the 26-year-old Turkish migrant worker endured at Ruhr valley steel plants, asbestos-infested building sites and fast-food restaurants was the first to expose the dark underbelly of a booming postwar economic revival.The only catch is that “Ali” was not a young Turk at all, but a then 43-year-old white German.Günter Wallraff, a journalist famed for his deep-cover investigative journalism, had spent two years living as “guest worker” Ali, hiding his true identity at the workplace with a black wig and darkened contact lenses. “Of course I wasn’t a real Turk,” he wrote in a foreword toGanz Unten(“Lowest of the Low”), “But sometimes you have to put on a mask to unmask a society.”Forty years on, a new “docu-opera” considers whether Wallraff’s credo would withstand charges of brownfacing and cultural appropriation today, and investigates what drove the reporter’s transformation.View image in fullscreenGünter Wallraff reading from his bookGanz Untenin 1985.Photograph: Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/Alamy“There’s something to be asked about why a man of that intelligence spent years with people who were desperate to just stay alive,” says Mehmet Ergen, the show’s Turkish director. “Something inside told him that he should do this.”The opera premiered at the Weimar Kunstfest festival this week before touring German cities and showing at Ergen’s own Arcola theatre in Dalston, London, next year. It dwells less on the precarious labour conditions that Wallraff’s reportage portrayed in painstaking detail: the temporary employment agencies that acted as de facto human traffickers, demanding inhumane working hours of Ali and his colleagues and offering them irregular pay and insufficient safety equipment in return.Instead, it discovers miniature Brechtian vignettes in Ali’s everyday encounters, such as with the funeral directors whom he asks to prepare for his imminent demise from exposure to toxic coke oven fumes, or the priests who turn heartless heathens when he asks them for a fast-tracked christening to avert an imminent deportation. And by asking what drove Wallraff to embark on his investigation, it finds universal dramatic themes.View image in fullscreenGanz Untenby Günter Wallraff.Photograph: Patrick Piel/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesBorn three years before the end of the second world war in Burscheid, western Germany, Wallraff was five years old when he was sent to an orphanage, where he was stripped of personal possession and his own clothes.“It was dehumanising, nothing remained of home,” he recalls in a phone call from his home in Cologne. “When I look back onGanz Untenafter intensive psychotherapy, I wonder whether this early trauma was not the trigger, the driving force and the opportunity to take on other identities later in life, to reinvent myself and assert myself. Lowest of the Low wasn’t a journalistic project for me, but an existential necessity.”In Ergen’s adaptation, the Anglo-German actor Ryan Wichert plays Günter but his alter ego is impersonated by the Turkish actor Burak Bilgili. The opera opens with a song, written by the composer Sabri Tuluğ Tirpan, that asks “Who am I?”.Before embarking on Lowest of the Low, Wallraff had made a name for himself with a trilogy of books that exposed the methods of the powerful tabloid Bild, where he had worked for three and a half months under the alias Hans Esser.He first experimented with his Ali alias in the early 70s, but shelved the project for a decade. A lack of talent for learning languages meant his adopted persona was easily blown. “I broke it off probably because I sensed what was in store for me,” he says. “I was simply afraid.”Wallraff re-embarked on Lowest of the Low in 1982, this time with an invented half-Greek parentage to explain his faltering Turkish, and soon found it difficult to stop. “I realised that I owed it to my colleagues, who had no choice because they needed the work for financial reasons or were in Germany illegally. Quitting would have felt like a betrayal.”Ergen, who interviewed Wallraff at length to research the play, said: “At Bild, he experienced a lack of solidarity. But in these terrible conditions at steel factories, he made many friends for life.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The book has been translated for almost 40 territories, including Turkey (though not the US: the publisher Little Brown made its offer dependent on being compensated by his German publisher if they were being sued). A film version, which used covertly filmed material, won a Bafta in 1988.View image in fullscreenThe world premiere ofGanz Unten,or The Lowest of the Low, at Kunstfest Weimar.Photograph: Selin SenkokenHis success brought Wallraff financial stability and international renown. The wordwallraffa, meaning to do investigative journalism under a false identity,has made it into the Swedish Academy’s national dictionary. In 1993, he sheltered Salman Rushdie at his home after the Indian-born British-American writer went into hiding over the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s fatwa.From a contemporary perspective, there is a potential problem, however. In a foreword to a recent new edition of Lowest of the Low, the Turkish-German author Mely Kiyak asked why Ali’s story had to be written by a German in disguise when approximately a million “original” Alis lived in Germany at the time.Ultimately, Kiyak defends Wallraff’s decision to don Ali’s mask: “Social reportage is not a ‘safe space’, and must never be,” she writes. But a 2010 investigation into modern German racism,Black on White, for which the journalist sprayed himself with black paint and put on a curly wig to impersonate a Somali migrant, “Kwami Ogonne”, drew less polite criticism. One review described him as a “humourless Borat”.“Accusations of cultural appropriation, or whatever you want to call it, don’t affect me,” the journalist said. “What I was doing [with Lowest of the Low] was an approach, not appropriation. After publication, I received thousands of letters, especially from immigrants, who told me: ‘Finally, a German has experienced and exposed this. No one listens to us and no one believes us – you are one of us.’”Composer Tirpan, who lives in Vienna and recalls first encountering Lowest of the Low on his guest worker uncle’s bookshelf in Germany, said identity politics should not blind contemporary theatregoers to the book’s universal themes.“It’s not only a book about Germany,” Tirpan says. “There are lowest of the low in Turkey, in Britain, in the United States, in China, in Russia. And Günter Wallraff managed to open our eyes to them.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyTheatreEuropeJournalism booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the two years since, they have bred dozens of the tiny rodents in their garages and on Wednesday they released 250 of them into a nature reserve near Wishart’s home.View image in fullscreenThe harvest mice were bred by the girls in 27 tanks kept in family garages.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The GuardianHarvest mice areBritain’s smallest rodent, at just 70 millimetres long, with sandy fur that helps them to blend into the grasses in which they nest. The mice are an important prey species for larger animals, and a major predator of insects that can be agricultural pests. Harvest mice are the only mammals in Britain to have a prehensile tail, which means they can grasp or hold objects such as grass stalks.They were once ubiquitous in autumn as they made their nests in the grasses that sprang up after harvest. But for the last few years, their numbers have been reducing under threat from modern farming practices as farmers now spray pesticides, crop the same field multiple times a year and use combine harvesters, all practices that are thought to have decimated the population.Wishart and Smith, the two young naturalists, raised the mice in 27 tanks in their homes, with some sourced from a tip by Smith’s mother. Honeysuckle and hazel, plants the mice love to climb, were harvested from Wishart’s garden to place in the tanks. As harvest mice are native to the UK there are no licences required to breed and release them into the wild.View image in fullscreenThe mice being introduced to the wild via a soft release enclosure.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The GuardianThe pair managed to finance the project, including buying the mice and commissioning the enclosure, with £4,000 crowdfunded from the public. They reached their goal after a boost from the well-known nature presenter Chris Packham, who shared it with his millions of nature-loving social media followers.The release itself had been carefully planned: Wishart and Smith enlisted the help of a carpenter, who built a soft release enclosure with tiny holes so the mice could come and go but snakes and rats would be kept out, giving them a safe place to hide from predators.Surveying her mice as they crept into the wild, Wishart said: “I love them – they’re my little babies. I’m really proud of them going into the big wide world. They are beautiful.”Smith was more melancholy: “I am going to miss the responsibility. It’s nice to have them, but it’s good that they’re going to do their part in the ecosystem.”Packham came along to support the release. “We are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis,” he said. “I am very pleased when I see practical projects like these, particularly when they are done by young people.”View image in fullscreenOne of the newly released harvest mice foraging for food soon after its release in Tiverton, Devon.Photograph: Zac WishartThe pair lament that their peers are not as interested in bringing back nature as they are, although friends came along to support them for the release. The time commitment to raise the mice is small, Wishart said: “It’s not that much, it’s something that everyone could plausibly do. I’m sure they spend more time on TikTok – it only takes 10 minutes a day. The average screen time of people in our year at school is 10 hours.”View image in fullscreenChris Packham, who helped raise funds for the project via social media, at the harvest mouse release with its organisers, Eva Wishart (right) and Emily Smith (left), in Tiverton, Devon.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The GuardianWishart’s first foray into mice husbandry almost ended in disaster: “I was given four mice by ecologist Derek Gow, but we kept them in enclosures outside and the neighbour’s cat ate three of them. We saved the fourth, which was pregnant and had some pups. And then Derek forgave me and gave me some more mice.”They will survey the area for mouse nests next September, to see if they have bred, and plan to get some more mice from Gow in the spring to supplement the numbers.Projects are going on across the country to save the harvest mouse, with some released in Ealing in 2024 and Cheshire between 2002 and 2004. The Mammal Society runs the National Harvest Mouse Survey, a nest survey by volunteers to find out more about the status of the mouse on the British Isles.For her next project, the dauntless Wishart hopes to release common lizards into the nature reserve. “If I get my lizard project off the ground we will release them here because it’s going to be a nature reserve and lizards are great,” she said.“I would like more people in my generation to have the chance to do things like this.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeDevonMammalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Clooney, making his Broadway debut, was nominated for a Tony award for his portrayal of Edward R Murrow, a giant of broadcast journalism.But for diehard fans of the original 2005 film of the same name, which was made in response to US involvement in the Iraq war, something was missing. In that version, Murrow was played byDavid Strathairn, one of the US’s most perceptive, subtle and compelling character actors. Why did he not reprise the role on stage?‘The 90s were remarkable – we weren’t all living in existential terror!’ Darren Aronofsky on Caught Stealing, his love letter to New YorkRead more“I was much too old and it would have been hard to actually pull it off that many years later,” Strathairn, 76, cheerfully admits via Zoom, his spectacles pushed up to rest on still-lustrous white hair. “Hats off to him [Clooney] for getting it to Broadway. The play would be an amazing part of a curriculum at schools of broadcast journalism or political science. I would hope that they would mount it to give some perspective.”Strathairn’s latest role is that of a grandfather who fought in Vietnam long ago. InA Little Prayer, a family drama written and directed by Angus MacLachlan, he plays the patriarch of a tight-knit but unravelling family in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Bill finds a kindred spirit in his daughter-in-law, Tammy (Jane Levy), but suspects his son (Will Pullen) is having an affair with a co-worker.Strathairn was drawn to the project because of MacLachlan’s writing, having seen his previous worksJunebugandAbundant Acreage Available. He says:“His focus was such a frank and sincere and generous looking into a family, a small little tight world with its own particularities and peculiarities and how it was done with very gentle, kind of simple but also a very compassionate approach. I love that.“No big bells and whistles. Obviously this family is going through some issues that are fairly potent and have a lot of resonances and a lot of banana peels for that family to slip on. But how they navigated that landscape in the story when I read the script, I thought, was quite alluring to me and I thank him for asking me to be in it.”MacLachlan’s small but flawless diamond of a movie is an empathetic, never-judgmental study in how hard marriage and parenting can be. It is also not incidental that both Bill and his son are military veterans. Bill has imported an ingrained stoicism and “need-to-know basis” to family life; his son has PTSD. In one scene, Bill talks with other men who served in Vietnam and discusses a comrade who struggled to reintegrate into civilian life.Strathairn has spent time with the military during his work withTheater of War Productions, which uses theatre – often dramatic readings of ancient or modern plays – as a springboard for community conversations in military bases, prisons, hospitals and other venues.He reflects: “That experiential reality is always there and so it was there in Bill but there’s a whole aesthetic that you don’t talk about it, you don’t bring it home. That informs there’s a lot of stuff going on inside everybody in this household and we got to bring it out because, in order to deal with it, you’ve got to talk about it.”A Little Prayer wears its politics lightly. There are nods to the opioid epidemic, the stigma around abortion, the plight of military veterans and the unglamorous nature of blue- and white-collar work in small southern towns long neglected by elites. In clumsier hands, the film might have put on a Maga hat and tried to explain the rise ofDonald Trump. But MacLachlan’s playing field is more modest and, as a consequence, delivers something more profound.Strathairn adds: “It presents PTSD, it presents abortion and drug abuse and the struggles that everybody has dealing with things like that, and puts it in a very sincere and equitable level. You can’t really land on, oh, this is a movie about that or this is a movie about that. This is a movie about human experience and I hope that’s why it’s striking a chord, ringing a bell for a lot of people in a positive way.”Strathairn’s career has also included taking on a number of historical characters such as Murrow (he describes his Oscar nomination as “a little bit of icing, but the cake was actually the making of it”), Robert Oppenheimer, William Seward and John Dos Passos.He also recently took on Jan Karski, a Polish soldier, resistance fighter and diplomat during the second world war, best known for his efforts to inform the western allies about the Holocaust. Strathairn has performedRemember This: The Lesson of Jan Karski, a one-man show devised by the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics at Georgetown University in Washington, at venues in the US and Europe including Poland itself.Is there a difference between playing fictional and historical characters? Strathairn reflects: “The responsibilities, the duties there are different. With a guy like Bill you get a lot more different choices in which way to go. But when you’re doing someone like Murrow or Karski and you have as much reference material as possible, it’s your challenge and responsibility to honour the legacy of who they were as much as possible.“Hopefully you look a little bit like them – that helps – but still, when you’re given these kind of challenges to represent or depict a historical character that everybody could go and research, it keeps you in the lane.With historical characters it’s important not to reconfigure or reinvent. It’s our responsibility just to be a conduit as much as possible.”View image in fullscreenDavid Strathairn in Good Night, and Good Luck.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarThe responsibility may be even greater in the era of Donald Trump, who has launched an all-out assault on cultural institutions, universities and knowledge itself, seeking to divide the US rather than unite it. The president has seized control of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and ordered a review ofSmithsonian Institution museums, complaining that there is too much emphasis on slavery.Strathairn believes artists have a more crucial function than ever, saying: “One thing that we were talking about on a set recently was, does it fall to the arts, of all forms, to be our historians now? If they’re going to get rid of revisionist history about what they want it to be, saying about the Black experience, the Native American experience, the LGBTQ experience, all of these things that are part of the museum of our life, of our history, if those things are going to be thrown in the dustbin, who is going to preserve that history?“It seems to us it’s going to fall to film-makers and novelists and those who are doing television series and documentaries and poets and writers and painters. Because this phenomenon of the creative arts has always been that: to reinvestigate, interpret but present and reflect on everything that makes up our human experience.“Then what if we are not allowed to do a play or a film or tell a novel or story that deals with something that’s contrary to the present regime? People are on tenterhooks about it, all the way from the mega studio down to the poet, from the people who hold the levers of entertainment down to the street musicians. What’s going to happen? What is happening? It’s something that needs to be reckoned with.”Trump’s efforts to police language, influence media narratives and reshape culture have invited comparisons with the Soviet Union or other regimes from history. Does Strathairn believe his country is sliding into authoritarianism?“I don’t know if there’s another word for it but it’s certainly a whitewash according to one particular aesthetic and kind of horrific,” he says. “I mean education – what are you going to do if you don’t educate? You’re going to forget and you’re going to be completely vulnerable to whatever agenda is in the hands of those who are controlling it.View image in fullscreenFrances McDormand and David Strathairn in Nomadland.Photograph: AP“Let’s hope that the present regime doesn’t say, OK, we’re only going to make movies about this and we’re going to clamp down on streaming services. Who knows? Authoritarianism is a very frightening concept when it comes to the arts. But so many towns have their own little film festivals and the curiosity is still there and the desire for that form of information, that form of entertainment, that form of escape. You can’t kill that. Artists will always find a way.”In 2006, Strathairn reprised his role as Murrow in Decency,a campaign adfor then Democratic congressional candidate Kirsten Gillibrand. He did not catch the recent Broadway run of Good Night, and Good Luck. But despite time’s arrow, he is still more than capable of channeling the spirit of Murrow and delivering a rallying cry for freedom of speech as a human imperative.He continues: “We can keep making potent little films like A Little Prayer orNomadlandor Good Night, and Good Luck or anything that is sincerely and frankly and with equanimity making people feel like we are neighbours, we can relate, that your problems are my problems and the stuff that divides us is flimsy and shouldn’t divide us.“What film can do, what theatre can do, what the arts can do is bring a lot of people together in one place – people from all different walks and beliefs and ethnicities and everything and say, man, we’re all together in this. It’s like what Karski says: governments have no souls; individuals have souls; and the common humanity of people is the real protector of human rights. We have to take care of each other and that’s critical today in terms of what’s happening out there.”A Little Prayer is in US cinemas on 29 August with a UK release to comeExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsGeorge ClooneyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We have a tiny kitchen which is full to the rafters of things she no longer uses.Billie gets these cooking obsessions and suddenly we have to buy something new to satisfy them. We currently have a pizza oven, ice-cream maker, blender and breadmaker, all sitting unused, as well as a coffee machine, microwave and all the usual appliances. Which means we have zero counter space, so I’ve put my foot down. She is the main cook, but I also enjoy it – I bake and love making dinner. I just don’t want our kitchen crammed full of clutter any more.The final straw came when Billie recently bought a rice cooker. She went behind my back and ordered a silly small one. We both love rice, but I usually cook it as Billie messes it up. She said she never knows how much water to add, even though I’ve taught her.I’m not opposed to a rice cooker – I’m half Indian and lots of my family use them – but it’s just the size of the one Billie bought. It offends me. She chose the most impractical one going, a tiny little pink thing off Amazon that can’t cook rice for more than two people. It takes up yet more space that we don’t have, and since we often have friends round for dinner, it’s totally pointless.She went behind my back to buy a rice cooker. I want her to run any more appliance purchases past meI don’t think all these appliances are necessary for cooking, and buying things for our kitchen should be a joint decision.Billie also wants an air fryer but I think the time has passed for those – they’re so uncool now. She says it will help make our cooking more efficient but we don’t have the space. Also, that’s what she said about the rice cooker – and it’s categorically untrue.I want her to run appliance purchases past me from now on. It’s not a control thing, but I need to know before she buys anything else, because we need to move things around to make space. She’s taking it too far now.The defence: BillieYou need the right tools to make good food, and as I do most of the cooking, I like to make life easierCooking is my creative outlet. I love baking cakes for friends and running bake sales in the local community. I guess I get a kick out of making new recipes and buying appliances that help me with my cooking.Paul and I share cooking duties, but it’s still largely my domain. He gets stressed when I buy new appliances without running them past him, but I don’t think I need to. We’ve been together six years and he knows what I’m like by now. Making delicious food requires the proper tools.When I cook, I’m at peace. Each gadget is a way to learn something new, try something different. I didn’t grow up in a household where cooking was joyful – it was functional, often frantic, so I’m probably overcorrecting.The rice cooker has become a point of tension. I’ll be honest, I did buy it secretly. Not because I wanted to be sneaky, but because I was tired of being told I’d mess up the rice again. It is precise, consistent and small. Paul says we don’t have space for it and that it’s impractical, but it’s so tiny that I can easily make space for it on the top of the fridge. It makes just enough rice for two without me having to worry about how much water to add.I don’t think I should apologise for the rice cooker because it makes my life easier – and I do most of the cookingThe air fryer is next. I’ve always wanted one but Paul says I have to throw something out to make space. I think an air fryer will be great for cooking meat and quick lunches. Paul says they are incredibly uncool now and that we don’t have space.Yes, we have a lot of appliances, but two of them – the pizza oven and the coffee machine – were actually his purchases. I don’t drink coffee and I rarely make pizza. Perhaps we should clear the counters together and let go of the gadgets that we both don’t use. But that would be uncomfortable for Paul as he’d realise that he is also responsible for the lack of space.I don’t think I should apologise for the rice cooker because it makes my life easier – and I do most of the cooking. Paul needs to check what he buys, too, and realise that the purchases I make also make his life easier.The juryof Guardian readersShould Billie’s appliances get out of the kitchen?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Paul needs to take some blame for his part in the clutter and accept that whimsy has an integral place in the kitchen. Long live pink appliances!Abigail, 19Billie loves cooking and should be free to buy the gadgets she wants, and she bought the tiny rice cooker because Paul was critical of how she cooked rice. He needs to chill and recognise he’s part of the problem, as he bought the pizza oven and coffee machine. Billie has suggested a way forward – that they jointly do a declutter and make some more space. Paul could embrace this gesture.Jacquie, 56Paul should understand that cooking is a hobby and an outlet for Billie. The rice cooker was a genuine attempt to make life easier for them both.

So, as you read this, you can be sure that I am probably quite drunk on sparkling wine. There’s scarcely a better excuse than a birthday, but I think we can agree that what you’re likely to be drinking at any such event will vary greatly, depending on whether or not the birthday in question is your own.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s always good to start off with something sparkling, which is why, for the past few years, I’ve treated myself to a bottle ofBillecart-Salmonin bed, but I think I might try something a bit different this year. My mind turns toSip Champagnes, an independent, online retailer that connects consumers with thegrower champagnesof the region. It even hasa sub-£45 section, which, considering that many of the grandes marques are now pushing or exceeding £50 (eek!), provides a chance to taste something new for the same price or even less than usual.Or, for even less, there’s crémant, which is basically for when you’re having people over and buying en masse. Crémant is sparkling wine made in the sameméthode traditonelle(traditional method) as champagne, during which the wine undergoes two fermentations to make it sparkling. An initial base wine is made and fermented into a dry wine, then, in a process known astirage, yeast and sugar are added to kickstart a secondary fermentation, after which the wine is sealed with a crown cap.This secondary fermentation creates CO₂(for the bubbles) and lees (spent yeast cells), which collect in the neck and give the wine its trademark biscuity flavour. These are then frozen and lifted off the top, at which point the bottle is sealed with the cork and cage we associate with sparkling wines. It’s the same method as champagne, but crémant costs far, far less.Or how about something completely different? As I explored ina column earlier this year, fine sparkling cider is fast becoming my “why the hell not?” item for moments that demand marking with a coupe of something wonderful. “Like winemaking, correct terroir and climate are essential ingredients for fine cider-making,” says Nick Showering ofShowerings Cider. “You can blend vintages in a similar way to champagne to achieve a house style, and that’s something even the sommeliers at the likes ofL’Enclumeare now pouring.”And while cider certainly still has some catching up to do with champagne, I don’t see why it can’t be enjoyed in similar contexts.

Heavy cotton quality. She told me I was crazy for giving her a T-shirt that cost 100 deutschmarks. Thirty years on, she is my wife and still loves to wear the shirt.

Instead, I’ve dusted off my cheap folding rebounder – a mini trampoline – and I’m loving it. I pop it in front of the TV and run on the spot to 180bpm tunes. Sometimes, I even put a virtual run video on YouTube (Singapore, NY, Tasmania – take your pick). If I want to dial up the intensity, I add weights on my ankles and wrists.

The annual membership gets me weekly coached sessions, weights/core sessions during winter months, trail-running groups, monthly races against other local running clubs and lots more. It’s also been invaluable for making new friends and connections in the area. Since joining, I’ve run my first half-marathon in seven years and knocked five minutes off my 5k PB. Not bad for £45 a year.Andy CarneRunning shoesI recently completed the Couch to 5k running programme. Investing in a pair of good trainers that suited my personal running form gave me the motivation to keep going. As it turns out, trainers are technical things, and it’s not a one-style-suits-all approach. Who knew! I took a free gait assessment at a local running shop, and they recommended a shoe style for my natural forefoot strike (the Saucony Guide 18).

Is it really possible, though, to tell one terroir from another?Simon UsborneThu 28 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareFor diners at a fancy restaurant in Cheshire, there is now a new twist to the usual routine. First comes La Popote’s menu, created by the owners, the chef Joe Rawlins and Gaëlle Radigon, who live upstairs with their children. Next comes the wine list, which includes more than 100 bottles. And then, in what is very much a first for Cheshire, a water list.Rawlins, 32, presents the new menu as I get comfy in the dining room in a converted redbrick barn in Marton, a village halfway between Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent. A choice of seven waters ranges from a £5 bottle of Crag, which comes from the nearby Peak District, to Vidago, a mineral-rich water from a Portuguese spa town, which will cost you £19.At a loss as to why I would need a water menu – or how a bottle could cost more than I would spend on wine – I consult La Popote’s water sommelier. Doran Binder, who created the menu, is part of a growing global mission of water evangelists with an unquenchable conviction. For Binder and his ilk, water has for too long been sidelined. He believes it deserves to be celebrated as a proper drink.View image in fullscreenJoe Rawlins, the chef patron at La Popote, pours Simon Usborne a glass.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The Guardian“Water is a beautiful thing and I just want people to experiment and enjoy it in a way that they’ve never done before,” says Binder, 53, whose brimming passion gives his speech a staccato energy. Sensing my scepticism, he tells me it’s OK to laugh at the concept of water connoisseurship. “I’ve been trying to get restaurants to do this for years and I think people are nervous, because you’re either going to be a pioneer or a joke. It’s a gamble, but it’s actually better when people laugh, because, to me, it just shows how poor our relationship with water is.”I go for the crab starter, a classic mayonnaise-based dish with fennel and apple. “I’d probably try the Lauretana, or maybe Icelandic Glacial Water if you didn’t want sparkling, just because it’s also super-low and isn’t going to overpower the delicate crab,” says Binder, whose Viking-red beard (he is half Danish) inspired his online persona, the Bearded Water Sommelier. He tells me he gets 7m views a month across social media.“Super-low” refers to the minerality of water, the crucial factor in determining its taste. I am a water laggard, I warn Binder, who is helping to train the restaurant’s waiting staff. I never order bottled water and quite like my local hard, limescale-rich London tap water, with its notes of chlorine. Other than briefly noting the softer tap water in other parts of the country, I have rarely given water a second thought.Anyway, mineral content can be measured by evaporating a sample and weighing what is left as milligrams per litre of total dissolved solids (TDS). We are talking sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Low‑TDS, or soft, waters are delicate and have changed little since they fell from the sky, whether they have been locked in a glacier or cycled quickly through a spring. High-TDS, or hard, waters may have spent years sloshing around rocks, absorbing minerals underground.View image in fullscreenUsborne, Binder and Rawlins sample the menu.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The GuardianGeology dictates the combi­nation and quantity of these minerals and creates a water’s taste. “If it’s sodium, it’s salty. If it’s calcium, it’s slightly sweet. And if it’s magnesium, it’s slightly bitter,” Binder says.I go for the Lauretana (£12 a bottle), a gently carbonated spring water from the Piedmont region in north-west Italy. It has a TDS of just 14, which is about as low as it gets. A waiter pours me a glass. “We always serve water in wine glasses; it shows it respect,” says Binder, who also drinks it only at room temperature – he says chilling it kills any flavour.I swill a sip around my mouth before drinking. It’s a weird sensation. The water is so soft and smooth that it almost slides, rather than flows, off my tongue. It’s like drinking an Hermès scarf. Yet, a second later, I am left with a tacky, metallic dryness in my mouth – something to do with the water’s low pH level, apparently. When I follow a forkful of salty crab with another sip, the dryness goes away and the water enhances the crab’s creaminess. It works strangely well.We always serve water in wine glasses. It shows it respectDuring a fuller tasting session after lunch, Binder guides me to the opposite end of the scale with a glass of Vichy Célestins (£9), from the spa town of Vichy in central France. Its huge TDS of more than 3,300 (UK tap water tends to be below 400) is evident the second I take a sip. It takes me a moment to work out what is going on. “Tell me that isn’t flipping nuts!” Binder says, almost levitating as he watches me. “This is my favourite water in the world.” It has a sweet brackishness and a gentle, natural fizz (many waters absorb CO2underground). It’s unlike anything I have tasted, like a softened, strangely moreish seawater. Binder recommends it as a complement to heavier dishes such as beef.Binder and La Popote see an opportunity in theshift away from booze, positioning water as a rival not just to wine, but also to the low- or no-alcohol drinks, seltzers and mocktails that are flooding the market. “Even in France, people are saying they want more non-alcoholic choices,” says Radigon, 37, who met Rawlins at another restaurant. They took over La Popote in 2019. “When I was pregnant, I found it was so limited. We need to move on with what people want.”If health is driving the shift, even if that means “zebra” drinking – alternating between booze and no alcohol – then hydro evangelists believe that waters of note are going to be hard to beat when so many alternatives are packed with sugar and additives.Yet even Binder was sceptical not long ago. He had been working in the haircare industry in New York when, after a divorce, he bought the Crag Inn, a failing pub in the Peak District, about 10 miles from La Popote. He thought about reviving it, despite being teetotal, while regularly travelling back to New York for work. But when he got the pub’s neglected spring fixed and tested, he learned he was sitting on a liquid goldmine of uncommonly clean, silky water.“I phoned Doran when he was in New York and said: ‘You should sell everything you’ve got, come back here and start bottling this stuff,’” says Richard Taylor, a veteran water supply engineer at Blair Water Group, who did the work.By 2018, Binder had quit his job to launch Crag spring water, turning the pub into a ramshackle bottling plant with a water bar for tastings. Today, a team of 15 produces more than 12,000 bottles a week from the spring under the pub’s car park. They use only reusable glass bottles, which the company collects when it delivers. La Popote was one of the first restaurants to sign up. Other customers have included Sketch, the high-end restaurant in Mayfair, London, and the grocery service Modern Milkman.View image in fullscreenRawlins and his wife Gaëlle Radigon, who also owns La Popote.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The GuardianStunned by early interest, Binder wanted to learn more about his water. He heard about Michael Mascha, an Austrian in Texas whom Binder describes as the “godfather of water”. An original 1990s tech guy, Mascha lost out in the first dotcom bust. At about the same time, his cardiologist advised him to give up wine. Although he had a cellar full of it, he reluctantly agreed to stick to water.Frustrated by the standard “still or sparkling?” offer, he began discovering new labels. In 2002, he founded FineWaters, which now has a spin-off society, academy, conference and consulting arm. His book of the same name is a guide to 100 premium waters, from Abatilles in France to Zaječická hořká, a rich Czech water that has been prized for its purported health benefits since the 16th century.Mascha runs an online training course for fellow enthusiasts and has certified more than 100 sommeliers, including Binder. He says demand is fizzing. “We’re finally moving away from considering water just for hydration and towards water as an experience,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘It works strangely well.’Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The GuardianHe is not alone in spotting momentum at the top end of the market. “What feels different now is the kind of customer we’re getting,” says Michael Tanousis, who in 2007 launched the British online water boutique Aqua Amore, which has seen demand grow steadily in recent years. “People are coming to us looking for specifics, not just ‘bottled water’. It’s ‘low-sodium’ or ‘high-mineral’, or more provenance-driven.”But isn’t bottled water an environmental disaster? Mascha acknowledges the impact of the wider industry, but says the vast majority of what people buy is processed. “It’s basically tap water that runs into a factory and then people drive to supermarkets to buy plastic bottles and take it home; it’s totally stupid,” he says. (If it doesn’t say “natural”, “spring” or “mineral” on the bottle, it’s probably packaged tap water.) He doesn’t see premium bottles as an alternative to tap water, which he drinks, but to wine or other occasional drinks. “What we’re talking about is waters that are unique, that have a terroir and deserve to be bottled,” Mascha says.Binder urges more water brands to commit to collecting reusable glass bottles; while glass bottles can be recycled, they often aren’t, which wastes even more of the huge amount of energy it takes to make and ship them.Rawlins may feel like a pioneer, but water menus are not new. Mascha says more than a dozen restaurants in the US have one. In the UK, Claridge’s tried one in 2007, but it didn’t stick. A growing community of water sommeliers and enthusiasts believe consumers are now ready after years in which water has served only as a staple. “In Italy or France, people have a much better understanding, but here there has been a bit of a disconnect,” says Milin Patel, an environmental scientist turned drinking water expert in south-west London. “I also don’t think Peckham Spring did us any favours,” he adds, recalling a 1992 episode of Only Fools and Horses (Mother Nature’s Son) in which Del Boy fraudulently bottled tap water in his flat.As part of his work, Patel carries out water tastings for school and corporate groups. “You see it in their eyes. They’re like: ‘Oh, wow, I’ve never looked at water in this way,’” he says. He hopes growing understanding of water may inspire new respect for all our water uses and sources.People are coming to us looking for specifics. It’s ‘low-sodium’ or ‘high-mineral’, or more provenance-drivenGrowing awareness has inspired producers, too. In a few months’ time, Murray Diplock will start selling the spring water that irrigates his cress farm from a chalk aquifer in the Test valley in Hampshire. Diplock and his family have always drunk the water themselves, filling old milk bottles with it. He has now invested in a small bottling plant and created a brand: Chorq.As well as using standard glass bottles, Diplock wants to lean into the no-alcohol market with carbonated Chorq in champagne-style bottles with corks that pop. “We want to start running courses and tastings to help explain to people what we’re doing and why,” he says. “Water is piquing everyone’s interest and we’re hoping it’s about to really take off.”Back in Cheshire, Rawlins hopes to add a water night to the steak and cheese nights he already offers. He insists the menu is no gimmick. “We might chop and change the waters, but the list is here to stay,” he says.Before I leave La Popote, I try the £19 Vidago, which is sold in limited numbers in Lalique-like frosted bottles. With a TDS of nearly 3,000, it’s almost as rich as Vichy Célestins, but it tastes more gently salted. I try another sip with some Parma ham; the salt in the water seems to disappear as the tastes mingle in my mouth.Whether or not I have soaked up all of Binder’s zeal, the experience has been eye-opening – and certainly more mindful than my usual approach to food and drink, which involves consuming it like a hungry pelican. “I spend my life playing with food and water like this and even now it’s still flipping mind-blowing for me,” Binder says. He pours out one more glass and hands it to me: “Wait till you try this ...”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The fearless fig tree is a descendant of the prehistoric wild caprifig, which spread from Caria (hence the species namecarica) in ancient Anatolia, across the Mediterranean. Cultivation is thought to have started in Egypt and the Levant, probably between 4000 and 2700BC; particular evidence of this is the common fig (Ficuscarica) on the stone walls within ancient Egyptian tombs calledmastaba, painted so their occupants could enjoy the fruit in the afterlife.Dozens of examples are described in a research paper by the professor of Egyptology Noha Hany Gerges Salama, including paintings within a fifth-dynasty mastaba of Iymery, in Giza. One painting in particular depicts two fig trees, both of which have a boy standing in their branches and picking fruit, while men under the trees collect fallen figs in baskets. Another exquisite painting shows two men seated opposite each other, one of whom is holding a plate holding three enormous figs. Salama notes what a common food source fresh and dried figs were in ancient Egypt, and used often to enhance flavour and sweeten, but also how figs, their leaves and the sap from the branches provided a natural rennet for cheese-making and yeast for wine-making.The many varieties of figs fall into two broad groups: those that reproduce without pollination, and those that rely on little gnat-sized fig wasps to do it for them. Either way, figs are botanically not a single fruit, but a cluster of more than a thousand tiny flowers, which are thought of as seeds. Figs are also one of the few fruits to taste best when over-ripe, when those thousand tiny fruits have matured into an ambrosial cross between honey and jam, and as a result perfect for attracting both wasps and this week’s recipe.It’s a variation on the wonderfulcrostata di ricotta e visciole(sour cherry and ricotta tart) from the Jewish-Roman tradition, using figs and orange instead, and I have also varied the pastry by adding some (optional) orange zest and ground almonds. Always work quickly with pastry, and with cold hands, and don’t skip the chilling or the preheating of the baking tray, which prevents a soggy bottom. And if you can’t find figs, fig jam works beautifully, too.You can serve this tart hot out of the oven, but it is better, I think, when it has cooled a bit, so both the ricotta and fig layers have had the chance to firm up, which makes it easier to cut. Like its cherry cousin, the tart is also wonderful at room temperature and fridge-cold, especially for breakfast.Fig, ricotta and orange tartServes8–10150g cold butter, diced250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting50g ground almonds1 pinch of salt60g icing sugar2 medium eggs, lightly beaten, plus extra for brushing1 unwaxed orange, 2 strips of zest pared off, the rest of the zest finely grated, plus 2 tbsp juice400g fresh figs, chopped, or 300g fig jam175gcaster sugar500g ricotta1 eggRub the butter into the flour and ground almonds until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, icing sugar, grated orange zest and eggs, then mix to make a soft pastry. Wrap in greaseproof paper and chill in the fridge for at least an hour.Put the figs in a pan with the two strips of orange zest, orange juice and 100g of the sugar. Bring to a boil, turn down to a lively simmer and cook for five to seven minutes,until the figs are tender and collapsing, but not mushy.On a lightly floured surface, roll out two-thirds of the pastry into a disc a little larger than a 24cm tart tin. Drape the pastry over a rolling pin, unfurl it into the tin and push it into the corners. Trim off the excess pastry with a knife.Spoon the cooked figs into the shell. Combine the ricotta, egg and remaining 75g sugar, beat until creamy and smooth, then carefully spoon on top of the figs. Roll the remaining pastry into a circle, then cut this into strips to make a lattice, which you can lay on top of the ricotta as simply or as cleverly as you like. Brush with beaten egg, then bake the tart on a preheated tray in the middle of a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for 45 minutes, until the lattice is golden and the ricotta topping slightly puffed.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkDessertSnacksBakingFruitCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

When she tried to feed, she coughed and sputtered, sometimes arching her back. She was soon diagnosed with dysphagia – a swallowing disorder.“You’re lucky we caught this early,” the speech-language pathologist (SLP) said, after we watched a live X-ray of my baby swallowing. When she fed, her airway didn’t close entirely, causing a bit of formula to go down the wrong tube. The SLP explained that even a tiny amount of food or liquid entering the lungs can cause pneumonia.Luckily, treatment was easy. I added thickening powder to her baby formula. Then, I gradually reduced the amount of powder, retraining the mechanisms in my daughter’s throat to swallow correctly.This experience was one of the many reasons I became a speech-language pathologist myself. For the last eight years, I’ve worked with babies, children and adults with dysphagia. Last year, I experienced dysphagia as an adult when chronic acid reflux caused me to eat and drink more slowly.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Here’s what you can do to prevent, notice and – if needed – repair any issues.How do you swallow properly?There are simple ways to protect the health of the swallowing mechanisms. “The ‘right’ way and what feels natural may be a little different for everyone,” said DrLaura Dominguez in Dallas, Texas, a board-certified otolaryngologist and fellowship-trained laryngologist specializing in voice and swallowing disorders. “Key things to remember are to take appropriately sized bites, chew well, and have water or some liquid available during meals.”I and other SLPs coach children and adults to slow down when they’re eating solid foods, especially dry foods like sandwiches, sushi and meat. It’s also important to resist the urge to “knock back” or “chug” when drinking liquids. When we lean our heads back and quickly consume large amounts of liquid, gravity makes the structures in our throats work harder, increasing the risk for aspiration, or when something enters the airway.Instead, it’s best to tilt the head only slightly when drinking, or use a straw. This allows gravity to support your swallowing.What causes a swallowing disorder?“Difficulty swallowing can happen along with any event that causes inflammation or irritation in the throat,” said Dominguez. “This can be short-lived, such as after an upper respiratory infection, or longer in duration, like after radiation therapy to the neck or spine surgery.”For children, “swallowing disorders fall under the umbrella of apediatric feeding disorder.Researchhas shown thatone in about three dozenchildren under five years oldare affected by a PFD,” said Amy Zembriski, a speech-language pathologist in New Jersey. She explained that childhood or adult swallowing disorders can be caused by anxiety, sensitivity to texture, or underlying medical diagnoses like gastrointestinal distress, neurological disorders or food allergies. Sometimes, the cause is unknown. “Swallowing uses over 30 muscles in our bodies, many cranial nerves, and quick coordination in order to move the foods and liquids that we consume safely from our mouths to our stomachs,” Zembriski said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was furious – and ashamedRead moreOne in 17 adults over the age of 45 are alsodiagnosed with dysphagia. “In adults, it often results from neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease or dementia, and can also occur as a natural part of ageing. The muscles involved in swallowing weaken over time, much like other muscles in the body,” said Stephanie Jeret, an SLP in Skokie, Illinois. Dysphagia can have a psychological root, or it can happen subsequent to gastrointestinal distress (ie gastroesophageal reflux disease, acid reflux and the like),which is on the riseinadults at all agesdue to the use ofGLP-1 agonistslike Ozempic.What is it like to live with dysphagia?Some dysphagia is short-lived and can resolve with treatment, but sometimes, these disorders can last for months or years.“Living with dysphagia can be extremely challenging,” said Jeret. “Some individuals may require a feeding tube, while others must avoid certain food textures or liquid consistencies to eat and drink safely.” Diet modifications, like pureed foods or thickened liquids, may be necessary “in preventing food or liquids from entering the airway and causing respiratory complications”.Jeret and Zembriski both have children with feeding or swallowing difficulties. “Although I was knowledgable about the disorder in adults, it was overwhelming and frightening to navigate it as a parent,” she said.Feeding and swallowing disorders “​​can significantly impact a child’s overall confidence and ability to connect with others at mealtime”, said Zembriski. Children who have experienced dysphagia may have higher anxiety or strict food preferences and may miss out on social events.“Mealtimes can feel stressful, overwhelming, and like walking on eggshells,” she said. “Caregivers may feel like they are failing because their children may not be maintaining adequate nutrition, their children only eat a handful of foods, or well-intentioned family members and friends may be telling them that ‘they will grow out of it’ or ‘you just have to make them eat’.”I tried an anti-inflammatory diet for a week. This is what I learnedRead moreDysphagia in adults can be acute when there is sudden inflammation in the throat or a food blockage. It can also be recurring or chronic. John Paul Andersen, a biomedical scientist in Lehi, Utah, developed a swallowing disorder as an adult. “My dysphagia first manifested when I was 30. I was eating steak and suddenly realized it was stuck, and nothing could get around it – not even saliva,” he said. “I now have to eat all my meals mindfully, which is a huge nuisance, but I learned to live with it.”“Dysphagia is more prevalent than many realize and can significantly impact quality of life,” said Jeret. “Early identification and intervention are key to reducing health risks and helping individuals eat and drink with greater safety, confidence and dignity.”I have lived with a mild swallowing disorder for a year, which I first noticed when solid foods felt like they were going down much slower than usual. Because of my experience as a clinician, I already ate mindfully, but have had to slow down even more. I didn’t realize how quickly my family and friends sped through meals until I had to wait several seconds to swallow each bite. I’d prefer to have an easier time eating, but I savor food differently now – it’s almost meditative. Breathing and swallowing happen in such close proximity, and taking my time with both reminds me how fragile these ordinary processes can be.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is more likely to cause serious problems in older age groups.Most countries tend to only recommend the vaccine to older people or immunosuppressed adults but the findings suggest it could have cardiovascular protective effects in adults as young as 18.The results from the study, the world’s first global systematic review and meta analysis, shows the jab is associated with a significant lower risk of cardiovascular events.Having the shingles jab was associated with an 18% lower risk of stroke or heart attack in adults 18 and above. There was a 16% reduction in risk of cardiovascular events in adults 50 or older.The data will be presented this weekend to thousands of cardiologists at the annual meeting of theEuropean Society of Cardiologyin Madrid, the world’s largest cardiology conference.Dr Charles Williams, the study’s author and global associate medical director at GSK, said: “We looked at the currently available evidence, and found that in this analysis, vaccination against herpes zoster was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or strokes.“Further research studies are now needed to find out whether this association can be attributed to an effect of herpes zoster vaccination.”The global systematic review was conducted using three scientific literature databases, and a meta analysis was conducted of phase 3 randomised controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on cardiovascular events.The shingles jab is usually just taken once, and is typically administered in two doses, several months apart.In total, 19 studies were included in the review. Eight observational studies and one randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria for studying the impact of the jab on cardiovascular events.Vaccination is increasingly been seen as an effective measure not only against specific infections, but also for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or events.Prof Filippo Crea, a cardiology professor at the Catholic University in Rome, who was not involved with the study, said: “These results support a growing body of evidence … which indicates that vaccinations reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.”Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, also not involved with the research, welcomed the findings but said further research was needed.He said: “There is great interest in studies suggesting the shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, although this analysis is largely based on observational studies, which cannot demonstrate cause and effect.“We know that shingles can cause inflammation in the body, and that inflammation is a culprit in many heart and circulatory conditions which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.“By preventing shingles, vaccination could therefore be protective. But far more research is needed, especially to understand the intriguing results in younger people. More evidence will be needed before the shingles vaccine can be recommended for a wider age group.”The findings came as NHS England said300,000 more people would become eligible for the shingles jab from next week.People eligible from 1 September are those between 18 and 49 with a severely weakened immune system. The NHS previously expanded eligibility to include people over 50 with a severely weakened immune system.Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationMedical researchHealthHeart diseasenewsShareReuse this content"

We kept wearing the disguise for a weekRich PelleyThu 28 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTShareWhat I love about this photo is that it couldn’t look any more early 80s if it tried. Everything from the velvet curtains to the plastic flowers, the old-school cathode-ray tube TV to the MK1 metallic purple Ford Escort just in view (the one in which I would later learn to drive), screams 1981. Pictured, we have Pandy the bear; my younger brother Jon, five; Sooty; and yours truly, aged seven, all of us covering a variety of skin and hair colours between us. (Like all the best superheroes,I’m adopted.) The photo would have been taken by my dad using his Kodak camera with flash cube, sporting bell-bottomed jeans and sideburns, while my mum, with her beehive haircut, sipping a Babycham, would probably have been on hand for moral support.These outfits were made by our gran (my mum’s mum), who was as much a whiz with the sewing machine and aknitting needle as she was with a wooden spoon, and would make us outfits for birthdays and Christmases, as well as baking us a seemingly never-ending supply of chocolate cake. This photo would have been taken at a time when the unwritten rules of being an older brother had already been established. I got the top bunk – because I’m oldest. I got the biggest slice – because I’m oldest. I got to sit in the front seat – because I’m oldest. I’m Batman and you’re Robin – because I’m oldest. Although thinking about it, an R for Richard on my chest would have been more fitting.Pandy and Sooty later received their own knitted Batman and Robin costumes (Sooty got to be Batman, because he’s the oldest). Dressed as a seven-year-old superhero, this has to be one of my finest looks to date. I’d use it as my passport photo and Guardian byline pic, if I could.The fir tree on the coffee table indicates it’s Christmas. I specifically remember going upstairs to change, coming back down, and my dad introducing the gathered family to Batman and Robin. “Where have Rich and Jon gone?” everyone clearly wondered. I don’t think we came out of disguise for the whole of Christmas Day, then Boxing Day and the rest of the week, by which time our outfits would have been covered in gravy, Christmas pudding and – yes – Gran’s chocolate cake.This was almost a decade before Michael Keaton’s moody Batman, and – yikes! – almost 30 years before Christian Bale’s even moodier The Dark Knight. Our outfits are modelled on the 1960s Adam West and Burt Ward “Wham!Ker-pow!Ker-splunk!”Batman, which we’d watch with my dad in the 70s and 80s. Personally, I think I’ve nailed the camp humour of the original, although I don’t remember Batman wearing brown flannel trousers like mine – at least, not for any of his public appearances. It might have been a bit much to have expected my gran to knit Batman’s yellow utility belt and Robin’s oversized green underpants, too. Although, I’m sure, if we’d asked, she would have given it her best superhero shot.Explore more on these topicsFashionMy favourite childhood outfitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But there were so many objects of desire that I was not permitted to acquire: crinkle-effect stilettos, a Frankie Say Relax T-shirt, jelly shoes, drainpipe jeans, a matador hat like the ones Mel & Kim wore … Also out of my reach for most of my teens was the thing I wanted most: the effect of a whole outfit. A look. Until this one night.I was about to turn 17 and this was my outfit for the school dance. It was all sourced from my grandma’s wardrobe, except for the sunglasses, which were my mum’s. The outfit consisted of pieces that no one else would – or indeed should – put together: a pink sparkly minidress with a silver-sequined hem and collar, silver sparkly elbow-length gloves, square-toed gold vintage shoes and a fake fur leopard-print coat which was not to be removed, even indoors. The coat was an essential part of the outfit, (a) for modesty reasons, as the dress was a bit see-through and (b) because I did not have maximum body confidence at this or, it would transpire, any other time. My hair was styled with my mum’s heated rollers and assiduously coated with L’Oréal Studio Line hairspray.This was in early summer 1990, the era of gatecrasher balls (riotous parties for posh teenagers) and the heyday of Laura Ashley (purveyor of black velvet off-the-shoulder ballgowns). I wanted to wear something that signalled that I was definitely not part of either of these phenomena, that I was my own person. So I aimed for a look that channelled Debbie Harry, Madonna, Wendy James from Transvision Vamp, Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe all at the same time, a combination which, to me, represented the height of iconographic originality. D’oh.The dress was once full-length. My grandma was an excellent seamstress and made it herself in the 1960s. I’m not sure how I persuaded her to chop it up into a minidress for me. The gloves and shoes she had from dances and parties in the 60s and 70s, when she and my grandad were amateur ballroom dancing champions.My mum and my grandma were sceptical about this outfit and wished that I would borrow a Laura Ashley dress. But I think they were won over in the end by the overall look. Crucially, I achieved my ultimate goal of not being dressed anything like anyone else at the dance. It did take some negotiation to get my grandma to throw in the coveted “Bet Lynch coat” as a finishing touch. I didn’t want to wreck it by sweating on it, so when the DJ played Transvision Vamp’s Baby I Don’t Care, I vogued with elegant caution. This outfit is still and will always be the greatest outfit I have ever worn.Explore more on these topicsFashionMy favourite childhood outfitYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

My husband, two sons and I are midway through a four-day stretch of the Grand Tour de Tarentaise hiking trail in the French Alps, and we’ve stopped near the top of Varlossière, a roadless side valley among a great arc of mountains that runs to the west of the ski resorts of Val Thorens, Les Menuires and Saint-Martin-de-Belleville. Hiking up here from Gittamelon, a rustic, summer-only mountain refuge in the neighbouring Vallée des Encombres, we’ve paused to exhale breath, and to inhale the primeval views.Map for Rhiannon piece in FranceHigh peaks loom either side of us, their shocking green flanks underscored by an elegantly designed bothy and its shepherd-dwelling twin, and we can hear the rush of water far below. It’s midmorning but the moon is low and large in a cloudless sky, adding to the otherworldly scene. Climbing higher, an eagle flies past almost at eye level, no more than six metres away. Though we meet three other hikers on the other side of the Col du Bonnet du Prêtre, the 2,461-metre (8,074ft) pass that leads from Varlossière to the Nant Brun valley – and detect from sheep bells that at least two shepherds must be somewhere among the great folds of these hills – it feels as though the landscape is ours alone.Many of the new summer visitors are first-timers, unfamiliar with the mores of mountain adventuringThat may not be the case for long. Soaring temperatures across Europe this summer have fuelled a rush to the mountains, social media funnelling many visitors to the same honeypots and creating infrastructure pressure points; in Italy some farmers in the Dolomites have resorted to installing turnstiles and charging tourists €5 to pass, incensed at having their meadows trampled.Navigating these challenges is no easy task for Europe’s mountain resorts, which are increasingly encouraging summer tourism as the climate crisis signals a limited lifespan for ski tourism. One of the biggest issues is that many of these new summer visitors are first-timers, unfamiliar with the mores of mountain adventuring: treading gently on the environment, respecting local countryside codes, wearing suitable kit, knowing how to read a map rather than an app (we had no wifi or phone signal for two days of our hike), and packing enough food and water. In France, call-outs to mountain rescue services by inexperienced hikers have risen so sharply thatworkers now trawl social medialooking for potential disaster hotspots in advance.View image in fullscreenThe writer and her sons walking above Lac de Lou.Photograph: Richard HammondIn an attempt to tackle these issues, the Vallée des Belleville tourist office has introduced a range of summer initiatives to support new hikers, from kids’ mountain skills activity days to free wildlife talks and events. Lower-level footpaths and bike trails for children, pushchair-users and visitors with reduced mobility makes it safer for those groups to access the mountains, and easier for local communities to manage the larger numbers that tend to make use of them. And while challenging marked trails through more remote corners of the mountains are fairly easy to follow, visitors are encouraged to hire a guide (something we are glad of at Col du Bonnet du Prêtre, when Roland tracks down the shepherd owner of an aggressive dog and persuades him to move away from the trail).It is at our accommodation each night, in mountain refuges, that we really see support for new hikers in action, though. Several have been designed specifically with families and first-timers in mind, including Refuge Plan Lombardie, where we end our 12-mile (19km) hike from Gittamelon.We are not first-timers, but staying here is a good opportunity to remind ourselves of the rules of refuge culture, and for the boys to hang out with other children. Though we hike in, it’s possible to park about 20 minutes’ away and walk from there, something several guests with preschoolers have done, grateful for the treasure hunt-style sculpture trail the refuge has installed along the route to entice younger visitors uphill.Though we have seen less than a handful of hikers during the day, we find Refuge Plan Lombardie as packed as a marmot’s burrow. Approaching it in the soft glow of the afternoon, earlier arrivals have already nabbed the terrace’s deckchairs with a view. Instead, we collect beers and lemonades and find a free bench to enjoy them before swapping our boots for the refuge’s borrowed Crocs, and finding our allocated bunk beds.The sky is luminous with stars, while the peaks and folds of the land are entirely black beyond the winking of a distant lightRefuges like this are more than just places to sleep. Full of city folk temporarily escaping to higher ground, they’re the human equivalent of a centuries-old rhythm of transhumance, where families bring sheep and cows up to the high pastures for the summer months. At dinner, we share a table with a mother from Chambéry who has brought her four-year-old son for his first visit to a refuge. “My friend gave me a list of the most family-friendly ones and I’ve decided to start a new tradition of visiting one every year with my son. I want him to love them as much as I do,” she told us between bites of a Savoyard blueberry version of Eton mess.The previous evening, in cosy Gittamelon refuge, we’d shared similar tales, and a dorm, with three generations of a Belgian family who were following the same trail as us but in the opposite direction. And the evening before that, we’d followed suit with other families, playing cards at Refuge du Lac du Lou, a modern, child-friendly refuge just 90 minutes’ hike above the resort of Les Menuires.View image in fullscreenWalking from the cosy Gitamelon refuge.Photograph: Richard HammondBetween Lac du Lou and Gittamelon we’d hiked with Estelle Roy-Berthaud from Les Menuires tourist office, following the trail through harebells, cotton grass, neon-coloured lichens and, much to the boys’ delight, thickets of wild blueberries. Stopping for lunch with Mont Blanc spearing the horizon in the distance, I ask her how the valley is managing increasing summer numbers.“Summer tourism is a relatively new concept here, so we are not seeing the overtourism issues experienced by more well-known summer destinations in the Alps,” she says. “We’re also protected by not having too many places to stay. In winter, we have around 27,000 beds, but in summer this reduces to just 8,000, so this naturally restricts the number of people in the valley.”Further along the trail, at Plan Lombardie, I wake in the night and slip out of one of those beds. Outside, the sky is luminous with stars, while the peaks and folds of the land are now entirely black beyond the winking of a distant light – a shepherd’s stove, perhaps, or the torch of a camper. The Belleville valley still feels wonderfully wild tonight.Transport from London to Chambéry was provided byFlixbus; return faresfrom£89pp. Half-board accommodation atRefuge du Lac du Loufrom€39 children/€69 adults,Refuge Gittamelon€46pp, and atRefuge Plan Lombardiefrom€32 children and €52 adults.

Those who arrived in Rwanda would be provided with training, healthcare and accommodation, she added.A Rwandan activist who asked for anonymity given the increasing pressure on civil dissent in the country said the deal came down to money and political influence.“Accepting these deportees also gives Rwanda an advantage in the ongoing peace negotiations regarding the conflict in DRC [the Democratic Republic of the Congo],” they said.DRC is holding peace talks with the Rwanda-backed M23 militia, which launched a sweeping offensive earlier this year and seized swathes of the country’s east.TheTrump administrationhas said third-country deportations are necessary because home nations sometimes refuse to accept the deportees.Rights experts have said the deportations may break international law by sending people to countries where they face the risk of torture, abduction and other abuses.Rwanda, which has a population of 14 million people, claims to be one of the moststablecountries in Africa and has drawn praise for its modern infrastructure.

To save our patients, we had to run up and down and borrow from other facilities to ensure we have something to give to our patients.“We have scaled down on the dose ration given to the patients,” he said.Gama said the district has also run out of the cartridges used for diagnosis of TB samples and that they had been forced to stop all testing.The TB officer for the neighbouring district of Rumphi, Umar Mwamadi, estimated that the district had enough stocks of drugs to last another month.“We are not yet affected by the stock out, but we are also at a greater risk because our drug can only take us up to mid or late September,” he said.USAid cuts could create untreatable TB bug ‘resistant to everything we have’Read moreWongani Nyirenda, a hospital official in Machinga district, said stocks were also low there.“The situation is manageable because we can mobilise drugs from one facility or district which has [stocks] to another, which is in need, to save lives. But the problem may get worse in the next few weeks when all facilities will be [without supplies],” said Nyirenda.A Malawi health rights activist, Maziko Matemba, called on the government to intervene to avoid chaos as more facilities across the country struggled to find supplies.“It is high time African countries should start manufacturing some of these drugs,” he said.Despite the decline in cases, TB remains a public health concern in Malawi and has been hit badly by the drop in international funding, with an estimatedincidence rate of 119 per 100 000 people(compared with eight per 100,000 in the UK) and amortality rate of 38.6 per 100,000. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),47% of TB cases in Malawi are co-infected with HIV.Malawi is one of the world’s poorest countries,with 70% of its 21.66 million peopleliving in extreme poverty, on less than $2.15 a day, and 51% of the population eating less than the minimum daily calorie intake.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The sandy sliver of land measures less than two miles long, but has nonetheless sparked an outsized battle, with a nearby resort town claiming the case sets a foreboding precedent for property rights in the country.Canada’s supreme court said on Thursday that it would not hear a challenge from the town of South Bruce Peninsula, which is contesting a lower court’s ruling that the Saugeen First Nation’s reserve was erroneously smaller than promised.In its application to the country’s highest court, the town warned that a victory for the First Nation would “risk sowing uncertainty and unpredictability at the core of Canada’s system of private landholding”. Lawyers for the First Nation instead said the case was simply about the correct interpretation of a treaty – and the boundaries of the First Nations reserve under that agreement.Central to the fight is a stretch of beach popular in the summer months with tourists, who trek 140 miles from Toronto to enjoy the clear blue waters of Lake Huron.The Saugeen First Nation has claimed for decades that the official map of their reserve wrongly omitted a 1.5 mile stretch of beach promised to them under an 1854 treaty with the crown.View image in fullscreenThe sign for Sauble Beach in 2022.Photograph: Norman Pogson/AlamyIn 2014, a truce looked likely after the First Nation and the municipality agreed that Saugeen would hold title over the land and the beach would be co-managed by Saugeen and the town council. The federal and provincial governments also pledged to make a one-time payment of C$5m (US$3.6m) to the municipality to offset their portion of the beach costs.But during municipal elections that year, mayoral candidates pledged to quash the agreement, pushing the land claims fight to the courts – and subsequently costing the community millions in legal fees.Two years ago, the First Nation emerged victorious and their win was upheld at the Ontario court of appeal. Earlier this year, the large sign welcoming visitors to Sauble Beach was changed to Saugeen Beach – a move seen as an“important and long-overdue act of reclamation”by the First Nation.Lawyers for the municipality and the private landowners have framed the previous court victories for Saugeen as precedent-setting, suggesting they are the first in Canada to be dispossessed of real estate to settle a treaty case.“The importance of these questions cannot be understated,” the town’s submission reads. “They strike at the very heart of Canada’s constitutional order, and will be increasingly brought into focus as Indigenous land claims over private property work their way through the courts over the next decade.”Nuri Frame, a lawyer representing the First Nation, said the case was much narrower in scope.After 150 years, a prized box returns to an Indigenous nation in Canada: ‘I felt like royalty traveling with it’Read more“We’re talking about a very specific, very precise parcel of reserve land that was set aside for the Saugeen. The crown had failed to properly survey and demarcate that in the 19th century. It is very much a case that is about its facts, the language of this particular treaty, the scope of this particular reserve and the relationship between this particular First Nation and the crown,” he said, adding that at trial, the federal government admitted their error and had sided with the First Nation.“There is a large, longstanding body of case law in this country that recognizes an Indigenous people’s interest in its reserve land and that the crown has a fiduciary role in protecting and preserving those specific lands. It’s constitutional law 101. Reserve land … is special, and First Nations are not to be dispossessed of their reserve land in all but the rarest of possible circumstances.”The case comes amid hand-wringing over private property rights in Canada after another court decision in western Canada, dubbed the longest running trial in the country’s history.In early August the British Columbia supreme court said the Cowichan Tribes, from Vancouver Island, had established Aboriginal title to roughly 800 acres of land south of Vancouver, where they once had a village to fish during summer.While the court did not rule against private landowners, it did determine the land titles held by the city and the federal government in the area were “defective and invalid”. Although there was no loss of property to landowners, the ruling nonethelesskicked off a wave of concerns.What makes the case unique and somewhat clearcut, Frame said, is that the First Nation reserve and treaty are historical outliers.“Nearly all of the historic treaties that were entered into between confederation and 1921, they just promised that a reserve will be created and they prescribed a formula to be used to establish a reserve, for example how many acres per person or family and then a surveyor goes out and draws a map,” he said. “There are very, very few treaties in Canada that do what Saugeen’s does, which says the reserve is going to go from here to here to here to here.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

When an aide to Fernández Noroña steps between them, Moreno knocks him to the floor.As Fernández Noroña tries to exit the podium, another lawmaker enters the fray, taking a swing at the senate leader.“[Moreno] started to provoke me, to touch me, to pull at me,” Fernández Noroña said during a press conference after the incident. “He hit me on the arms and said: ‘I’m going to beat the shit out of you, I’m going to kill you.’”Sheinbaum rejects US ‘invasion’ after Trump orders military to target Mexico cartelsRead moreMoreno wrote on social media: “When Noroña crossed the line, he knew exactly what he was doing. I will always respond head-on, with character and without fear, to defendMexicoand give it the direction it deserves.”The scuffle followed a tense debate during which the governing Morena party and its allies accused the opposition Pri and Pan parties of calling forUS militaryintervention in Mexico, a claim that both parties denied.Earlier this week, a senator from the Pan party had gone on Fox News and said that “help from the United States to fight the cartels in Mexico is absolutely welcome”.The issue has become particularly contentious in Mexico afterDonald Trumpreportedly authorizedthe use of military force targeting drug cartels deemed terrorist organizations in Latin American countries.The senate leader said he would call an emergency session on Friday and propose expelling Moreno and three other Pri lawmakers as a result of the scuffle. Fernández Noroña also posted on X that he had filed a criminal complaint against Moreno.In a statement on X, Moreno accused the governing party of changing the order of the day at the last minute in order to silence the opposition.Explore more on these topicsMexicoUS militaryAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Even a simple cold can be deadly to the group because it lacks immunity to common diseases.‘We don’t want contact because you are bad’: loggers close in on uncontacted people in Peruvian AmazonRead moreLoggers who encroached on the tribe’s lands have previously been killed.Enrique Añez, president of the nearby Yine community, another Indigenous group, said in a statement that Mashco Piro members had been seen around the Yine village of Nueva Oceania.“It is very worrying. They are in danger,” Añez said.Añez said heavy machinery near Nueva Oceania was cutting paths through the jungle and across rivers into Mashco Piro territory. The village sits at a key access point to the Mashco Piro’s territory, making it one of the few places where members of the tribe have occasionally been seen.Survival International last year released photos showing dozens of Mashco Piro close to active logging zones. The group warns that contact with outsiders could spread disease or lead to violent conflict – risks that have previously wiped out other isolated groups in the Amazon.Last year,two loggers were killed in bow-and-arrow attacksafter entering Mashco Piro territory.“Exactly one year after the encounters and the deaths, nothing has changed in terms of land protection and the Yine are now reporting to have seen both the Mashco Piro and the loggers exactly in the same space almost at the same time,” said Teresa Mayo, a researcher at Survival International. “The clash could be imminent.”Mayo said the logging company near the Indigenous group has restarted operations as normal.“They still have the license of the government, and that is how they back their activities even if they know they are putting both Mashco Piro and their workers’ lives at risk,” she said.Stop-and-search, fire ants and stinging nettles: doling out justice to illegal miners in Peru’s AmazonRead moreThe Forest Stewardship Council, an international body that certifies sustainable wood products, has suspended its approval of the logging company, Maderera Canales Tahuamanu, until November. However, Survival International said the bridge and heavy machinery footprints are evidence that logging is still taking place.The company’s concessions, or licensed logging areas, border the Madre de Dios territorial reserve and overlap recognized Mashco Piro land proposed by Indigenous organizations for new protections.The Associated Press reached out to Maderera Canales Tahuamanu but did not receive an immediate response.Peru’s culture ministry, which is tasked with promoting cultural identity and overseeing Indigenous rights, told AP it was reviewing Survival International’s report.When questioned on what measures the government is taking to protect groups like the Mashco Piro, it noted it had created eight reserves forIndigenous peoplesin isolation, has five more pending and operates 19 control posts with 59 protection agents. It said more than 440 patrols had been carried out this year and that its budget for protecting isolated communities more than doubled in 2025.The Tahuamanu River is a key transport route in this part of the Amazon. A permanent bridge will allow year-round truck access, which environmentalists say could accelerate logging and deforestation deeper inside the forest.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmazon rainforestIndigenous peoplesLogging and land-clearingAmericasDeforestationnewsShareReuse this content"

Afterwards, scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the libertarian leader.Shortly afterwards, Mileiposted on his social mediaa photo showing a stone flying just above his head, accompanied by the words: “CIVILISATION OR BARBARISM. KIRCHNERISMO NEVER AGAIN,” a reference to the opposition led by former presidentCristina Fernández de Kirchner.The justice minister, Patricia Bullrich,wrote on her social mediathat the attack had been organised by Fernández’s supporters.But others suggested that the stone-throwing was a reaction to the alleged corruption scandal.Minutes after the incident, the Buenos Aires governor, Axel Kicillof, a former economy minister under Kirchner,said at another campaign event: “Milei, the people have already seen through you: fraudster, liar” – though he did not mention the stone-throwing.Shortly before the attack, Milei broke his silence on the corruption allegations, telling reporters: “Everything [Spagnuolo] says is a lie … We are going to bring him to justice and prove he lied,” referring to the man who, according to Argentine media, was once close to Milei and a frequent visitor to the Casa Rosada.Karina Milei has not addressed the allegations. The president’s sister assumed the post of secretary general of the presidency after Milei scrapped a decree barring relatives from public office, and she is widely seen as the “chief architect” behind her brother’s rise to power.Known as El Jefe (the male boss) by insiders including the president himself, Karina Milei is said to decide his agenda, political alliances and which journalists he will or will not speak to.The scandal allegations, which public prosecutors are investigating, represent what could be a major threat for Milei in the run-up to the provincial legislative elections in Buenos Aires – which account for almost 40% of the electorate – on 7 September, and the national elections on 26 October.The vote will be the first big test of his support since the libertarian economist took office in December 2023 on a promise to revive Argentina’s ailing economy.Lara Goyburu, a political scientist and executive director at the consulting firm Management & Fit, said the scandal could affect voter turnout because it appears closer to the “old-fashioned corruption” Milei had promised to fight.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaJavier MileiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The statement said the new works division would “prioritise clearing the security concerns before any further step is taken”.A Unitree robot mounted with Taiwan-built camera systemswas displayed at a Taipei tech trade show last year.China’s ruling Communist partyclaims Taiwan as Chinese territory, and is preparing to annex it, by military force if necessary. In the meantime, it barrages Taiwan with near daily grey-zone harassment, espionage and cyber-attacks. Taiwan has enacted strict laws and regulations about the importation and use of Chinese technology and equipment.Comments under Chien’s social media post were fiercely critical of the city authorities. “I could instantly tell that the model is from Unitree. The Taipei City government has zero awareness on information security,” said one commenter. Another asked: “Are you collecting data and paving a way for the PLA to conduct urban warfare here?”.The Taiwanese military commentator Wang Cheng-ming urged the city government to be more cautious about using Chinese technology, noting there were domestic projects in development that could be used instead. “Crucial” mapping data gathered by the robot, which could not be obtained through satellite or photographs, would be highly sought after by China’s military, he added.Taipei’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an, asked by local media about national security concerns over the robot, said the city and central governments would be discussing the “innovative experiment”.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaRobotsArtificial intelligence (AI)EspionageAsia PacificTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

He could face life in prison if convicted.View image in fullscreenArmed police outside West Kowloon magistrates court in Hong Kong.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAsked about the timing of a verdict, one of the three judges overseeing the case said it would be announced “in good time”. Lai’s trial, similar to other national security cases, is being presided over by designated judges instead of a jury, a departure from the city’s common law system.Closing arguments by the prosecution and the defencebegan last week, after delays caused by bad weather and then concerns over Lai’s health. They concluded on Thursday morning.Lai, dressed in a beige linen blazer and white shirt, smiled, nodded and waved at the public gallery before being escorted away by corrections officers. He also raised his thumb a few times.Prosecutors accused Lai of using his media outlet, Apple Daily, and foreign political connections to lobby for governments to impose sanctions and other punitive measures on Chinese and Hong Kong authorities. They said he showed “unwavering intent”, and that the alleged collaborations were “long-term and consistent”, beyond the introduction of the NSL.His alleged collaborators included theactivist Andy Liand paralegal Chan Tsz-wah, both of whom testified against him at trial, and theInterparliamentary Alliance on China. He was also accused of financing the advocacy group Stand with Hong Kong.View image in fullscreenAndy Li, a computer programmer turned pro-democracy activist who testified against Lai.Photograph: RFAIn court, Lai’s defence team said prosecutors had failed to provide sufficient evidence for the claims of conspiring with Li, Chan, or other alleged co-conspirators to request foreign sanctions after the NSL’s introduction.Marc Corlett KC said that the prosecution’s submission that Lai stayed in contact with former US defence officials “goes in no way to demonstrate” their case because those individuals had not been named as “co-conspirators”.The senior counsel Robert Pang had earlier defended Apple Daily, saying “it is not wrong to support freedom of expression. It is not wrong to support human rights.”Pang told the court the media’s role was to facilitate public discourse, and that the newspaper’s position was one of a wide variety of views taken by Hong Kong’s many outlets. “Apple Daily was not calling for public debate,” he said. “Apple Daily was part of the public debate.”Lai was arrested alongside several others including executives at his company, during a raid on the Apple Daily newsroom and associated locations in August 2020. He was granted bail but then taken into custody in December that year and has remained behind bars ever since, on remand and then serving sentences for other convictions related to pro-democracy protests and fraud charges which his supporters say were trumped up.Apple Daily was forced to closein June 2021.View image in fullscreenA police officer stands guard outside West Kowloon magistrates court.Photograph: Leung Man Hei/EPAForeign governments, legal organisations and rights groups have widely criticised the prosecution of Lai, in particular the ultimately successful efforts of the Hong Kong and Beijing authoritiesto block his chosen lawyer, the UK barrister Tim Owen KC, from defending him. The authorities have rejected criticism, labelling Lai “a voluntary political tool of foreign forces trying to curb China through Hong Kong”.The trial stretched to 156 days, far beyond the 80 days initially set down. The closely watched hearings were often attended by supporters and international observers, including foreign diplomats based in the city, who would line up for hours to secure limited seating.Lai took the stand in November, the first time he had been heard in public since his not guilty plea in January that year. He said he never tried to influence foreign policy or ask foreign officials to take concrete action on Hong Kong.Shortly after his arrest in 2020, while at home on bail,Lai told the Guardianhis case would be a “litmus test” of Hong Kong’s legal system since the NSL. He said the pro-democracy movement’s ultimate goal of gaining complete democracy for Hong Kong was no longer possible, but they had to keep fighting.“We don’t know when we’ll win, but we’re so sure we’re on the right side of history, and time is on our side,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiHong KongChinaAsia PacificPress freedomNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

This shocked many previously successful applicants, who then had to rush to apply for two-year funding instead.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAt the time, some worried that the low success rate for regional public art galleries – below 18% – was a sign the state government was shifting costs on to local government, as many regional galleries already rely on councils to fund infrastructure and core staffing costs.But the chief executive of Regional Arts NSW, Dr Tracey Callinan, said they were “very pleased” with the outcome.“This is a really positive response and one that acknowledges that regional arts has great value, but its own challenges too,” she said.“Not everybody has been funded, but that is the reality of a funding program.”Callinan said Regional Arts NSW would work to support those galleries who missed out on funding and she remained concerned that local councils “will have to pick some of this up to keep their galleries open”.Broken Hill City Art Gallery, the oldest art gallery in regional NSW, applied for $100,000 a year – what it currently receives from Create NSW – but failed in both the four-year and two-year rounds.“This is a very disappointing outcome for the gallery and a sad day for artists and the industry in the far west in general,” the Broken Hill City Art Gallery manager, Kathryn Graham, said.‘Shock to creative ecology’: NSW regional art galleries face funding crisis after state pulls financial supportRead moreThe gallery’s role in supporting artists, students, tourism and First Nations cultural programs gave them a “compelling case” for state funding, she said.“It’s a significant loss of funding for a gallery of our size and we now face the unpleasant task of reviewing our operations and reducing our services in line with the funding shortfall,” Graham said.Regional galleries who will receive funding include Wagga Wagga Art Gallery, which will get $110,000 a year; Tamworth Regional Gallery, which will receive $85,000 a year; and Maitland Regional Art Gallery, which will also receive $85,000 after applying for $110,000 a year.“This will probably impact our forward plan, but we welcome the funding,” Maitland’s director, Gerry Bobsien, said. “We’ve got a really fantastic program scheduled for the next two years and we’ve been sitting here wondering what we need to cut. Now, we’re just keen to get on with it.“For many of us in the sector, we’ve been working with less for ever. Finding savings, being entrepreneurial – it’s just business as usual.”Just under $3m was allocated for 23 arts organisations in Sydney, including the Australian Design Centre in Darlinghurst, which now receives $300,000 a year from Create NSW and will now get $150,000 a year. ADC also recently lost $200,000 a year in federal funding.“ADC is grateful for any funding support from the state government,” the executive director of ADC, Lisa Cahill, said.“However, we applied for $200,000 per annum – $150,000 per annum is short of that. It’s also 50% of what we currently receive and have been in receipt of for the past decade – and obviously that $300,000 has not kept up with costs.”ADC’s recent public appeal raised close to $50,000 in donations, which Cahill said was “wonderful”.“But in real terms, we’re receiving about a third of what we got a decade ago,” she said. “This level of uncertainty and erosion of support is obviously creating a great deal of uncertainty and stress on the organisation, and the people in it.”The chief executive of Museums & Galleries of NSW, Brett Adlington, said the organisation was “delighted” by the outcome of the ACFP after being “nervous about what was coming”.“There’s still some challenges out there for organisations who weren’t funded and perhaps some organisations might need to rethink their plans. But generally we’re very happy and very grateful.”In addition, $3.29m has been allocated for individual projects that will support 1,296 artists and workers, Create NSW said. One of them is western Sydney artist Khaled Sabsabi, who wasreinstated as Australia’s representative at the Venice Biennaleafter controversially being removed from the position.His unnamed “monumental” workwill explore “shared yet distinct experiences of displacement and migration, focusing on the intersections of multicultural and multi-faith communities locally and globally”, Create NSW said.The NSW minister for the arts, John Graham, described the regions as “the big winners” from the revamped ACFP, which has dropped an annual application process in favour of the new biennial option after feedback from arts organisations.“We have heard the message from the sector that they want less paperwork, and less acquittals,” he said. “That is why the move from annual to multi-year funding for so many of these organisations is so welcome.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian artNew South WalesArtArts fundingArts policynewsShareReuse this content"

A wave of strikes could be heard from the city centre after 3am and again, more loudly, shortly after 5.30am. Officials reported impacts at more than 20 locations around Kyiv. A further 38 people were wounded.Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said the strikes threatened the US president’s proposals to end the war. “These egregious attacks threaten the peace that [Trump] is pursuing,” Kellogg said on social media, noting that they hit “innocent civilians” and EU and British missions in the Ukrainian capital.Trump was unhappy but “not surprised” at the attack, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, while urging “both sides” to end the war.The Foreign Office in London summoned Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelin, at 1pm, in direct response to the severe damage inflicted on the building, government sources said.“Putin’s strikes last night killed civilians, destroyed homes and damaged buildings, including the British Council and EU Delegation in Kyiv,” the foreign secretary, David Lammy, posted on X.“We have summoned the Russian ambassador. The killing and destruction must stop.”The prime minister, Keir Starmer, condemned the attacks as “senseless” and accused Russia of “sabotaging hopes of peace”.Photos circulated by the British Council showed the building with its windows and entrance smashed open and surrounded by glass and debris. Separate pictures released by the commission showed wrecked office interiors with collapsed ceiling panels and shattered glass doors and windows.View image in fullscreenDamage to the EU offices in Kyiv.Photograph: EU delegation in Ukraine/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile the British Council’s offices suffered significant damage, they are not believed to have been directly hit by Russian strikes, but struck by shrapnel. A guard who was injured was “shaken but stable”, Scott McDonald, the British Council chief executive, said.0:57Kyiv resident films moments after missile hits residential building – videoThe offices of the EU delegation were “severely damaged by the shock wave” from the blast, Katarína Mathernová, the EU ambassador to Ukraine, said.The Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the onslaught showed that Russia had no intention of negotiating an end to the war. “These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,” the president said on social media. “Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table.”Aerial bombardment of Kyiv had been relatively muted during August, when Trump made a failed attempt to bring about an end to the war by meeting Putin in Alaska.But the overnight attack indicated Russia was ready to return to its deadly campaign of bombing cities, even though Trump has previously complained about such attacks and threatened to impose sanctions on Russian oil if they continued.The attack included 11 ballistic missiles, 20 Kh-101 cruise missiles and 598 Shahed and decoy drones. A large proportion were intercepted or jammed, but three high-speed ballistic missiles, one Kinzhal and two Iskanders, as well as two cruise missiles were not stopped, according to the air force data.A wave of strikes could be heard from the city centre after 3am and again, more loudly, shortly after 5.30am. Officials reported impacts at more than 20 locations around Kyiv. A further 38 people were wounded in the attacks, officials added.Trump has been hoping to set up a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy after he met Putin in Alaska two weeks ago and Zelenskyy days later in Washington.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said that there would “obviously” be no such meeting.The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said it was evident Moscow had no interest in negotiating an end to the war. “The intense attacks on Kyiv last night demonstrate who stands on the side of peace and who has no intention of believing in the negotiating path,” she said.The Kremlin said on Thursday it was “still interested” in diplomacy but would continue to launch strikes on Ukraine.The European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement the strikes “shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorise Ukraine, blindly killing civilians – men, women and children and even targeting the European Union”.Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, said on X: “The overnight attack on Kyiv shows a deliberate choice to escalate and mock the peace efforts.”In a separate post, she added: “No diplomatic mission should ever be a target.”EU officials said two missiles landed within 50 metres of the building within 20 seconds.The British Council’s offices are seen as a representation of Britain’s soft power in Ukraine. For the last 30 years the organisation has worked as a bridge between London and Kyiv, offering academic links, arts programmes and English courses.Starmer said on X: “My thoughts are with all those affected by the senseless Russian strikes on Kyiv which have damaged the British Council building.“Putin is killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace. This bloodshed must end.”A spokesperson for the British Council said: “Following last night’s attack, our British Council office in Kyiv has been severely damaged and will remain closed to the public until further notice.“Thankfully, our colleagues are all safe and our work with our Ukrainian partners in education and culture will continue uninterrupted.”Von der Leyen has said theEuropean Commissionwould soon propose a further package of “hard-biting sanctions” against Russia, the 19th since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.Last week, the Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty unveiled sanctions against eight organisations and individuals to “keep the pressure on” Putin, who he claimed was exploiting “dodgy crypto networks”.Russia in return sanctioned 21 individuals including the former MP Denis MacShane, several journalists and the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyRussiaUkraineEuropeEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

They had been altered to zoom in on body parts or suggest sexual poses. They were featured in the site’s “VIP section”.The scandal, which has revived debate in Italy over persistent misogyny and gender-based violence, comes a week after Meta closed down an Italian Facebook account calledMia Moglie(My Wife) where men exchanged intimate photos of their wives or unknown women.Phica, which is a misspelt play on a slang word for vagina in Italian, was launched in 2005 and appears to have operated unhindered until several politicians from the centre-left Democratic party (PD) announced they had submitted a legal complaint. Police are now investigating.Nearly 4,000 celebrities found to be victims of deepfake pornographyRead moreMeloni, whose sister Arianna was also targeted on the site, did not comment when approached by reporters late on Wednesday,Corriere della Serareported.Other high-profile women whose stolen images were used on the site includePaola Cortellesi, an actor and the director of an Italian box office hit about domestic violence, C’è Ancora Domani (There’s Still Tomorrow), and Chiara Ferragni, an influencer.Valeria Campagna, a PD politician, was among the first to make an official complaint, prompting several others to come forward in what the Italian press is describing as “Italy’s #MeToo”. An online petition calling for the website to be shut down has gathered more than 150,000 signatures.In a post on Facebook on Wednesday, Campagna wrote that she was “disgusted, angry and disappointed” and “couldn’t stay silent” after discovering that her photos had been published on the site without her consent.“Not just photos in a swimsuit but moments from my public and private life,” she wrote. “Beneath them there were sexist, vulgar and violent comments. I can’t stay silent because this story isn’t just about me. It’s about all of us. It’s about our right to be free, respected and to live without fear.”Her fellow PD politicians Alessia Morani, Alessandra Moretti and Lia Quartapelle quickly followed suit.Morani wrote on Instagram that the comments beneath photos of her were “unacceptable and obscene” and “offend my dignity as a woman”. She added: “Unfortunately, I’m not alone. We must report these groups of men who act in gangs and go unpunished despite numerous complaints. These sites must be shut down and banned.

I decided to fight back by filing a complaint. Not only for myself but, above all, for all the other women who have been victims of this violence.”Politicians from the right who were targeted include Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and a member of the far-right League, and Daniela Santanchè, Italy’s tourism minister.Mary Galati, a woman from Palermo who is the promoter of the petition onChange.org, had reportedly twice made official complaints about the site after learning that her photo had been published on it in 2023, but the issue remained under the radar until the politicians spoke out.The petition cites a study conducted in 2019 by the University of Milan which found that 20% of Italian women had experienced some form of non-consensual sharing of intimate photos.In July, the Italian senate approved a bill that for the first time introduced a legal definition of femicide in criminal law, punishing it with life in prison, while increasing sentences for crimes including stalking, sexual violence and “revenge porn”.In response to the Phica scandal, Ignazio La Russa, the president of the senate, condemned the “online sexism involving numerous women”. He said: “This is a very serious matter, one that arouses profound outrage, and for which I hope that the relevant authorities will soon identify those responsible.”Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The officials emphasised there was still room for last-ditch diplomacy before the sanctions “snapback” comes into force in 30 days’ time. The annual high-level UN general assembly in September is likely to involve more intensive diplomacy over the situation withIran.They added that Iran had been in significant non-compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal since 2019, saying Tehran had been given ample opportunity to become compliant but had either been unwilling or unable to act.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Iran after Israel bombed its key nuclear sites, and has been unable to renegotiate a return to assess the state of those sites. Iran has allowed the IAEA inspectors to visit the Bushehr site, where refuelling is due to occur.Return of UN nuclear inspectors to Iran met with protests by MPsRead moreDavid Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, told the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, of the decision by the three European countries in a call on Thursday morning.Lammy said: “Despite repeated warnings, Iran has made no substantive effort to meet the conditions of our extension offer and has consistently failed to provide credible assurances on the nature of its nuclear programme.“Whilst we have been left with no choice but to take this action, the ball remains in Iran’s court and I would welcome their return to the table with a serious offer.”In response Araghchi said Iran was ready to resume “fair” negotiations over its nuclear programme if the west showed goodwill.“Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s readiness to resume fair and balanced diplomatic negotiations, on the condition that the other parties show seriousness and goodwill and avoid actions that harm the chances of success,” he said in a letter sent to the European Union foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.Araghchi had earlier said the European move was “illegal and unjustified” and that the decision needed to be reversed in the coming days.The United Nations on Thursday called on Iran and major powers to seize the momentum to strike a nuclear deal. “In the next 30 days, there is a window of opportunity to avoid any further escalation and find a way forward that serves peace,” said Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for secretary general António Guterres.In a sign of the hostility to the plans to cooperate with the IAEA, an Iranian MP, Amir-Hossein Sabeti, said he had read the draft text of the agreement with the agency word for word, and described it is as a “disaster” adding: “If it is a lie, deny it and we will be happy, but if it is true, then woe betide you.”Restoring sanctions would convert many existing – largely US and European – measures into UN-wide sanctions requiring observance by Russia and China, who finalised a draft UN security council resolution on Thursday to extend the nuclear deal for six months and urge all parties to immediately resume negotiations.Some sanctions on the Iranian arms industry that are not currently in force will be restored. In addition, the US, as a permanent member of the UN security council, will in future have a veto over the lifting of the UN sanctions, a power it currently does not have.The three European powers had to act now before the nuclear deal expired on 15 October and their power to reinstate sanctions ended.Justifying the decision, UK officials said the 2015 nuclear deal allowed Iran to store only 300kg of uranium enriched up to 3.67%. Instead, the stockpile was 45 times larger than this limit, with much of the uranium over the purity levels set by the 2015 agreement. Iran also had a 400kg stockpile of unaccounted highly enriched uranium.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bluntly, we have run out of time. We cannot allow the Iran nuclear file to fall off the agenda or for sanctions to be permanently lifted while Iran’s nuclear programme escalates and IAEA access is denied in clear breach of its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.”They said the snapback step was legal and proportionate, and the UK remained committed to a diplomatic solution. They added the UK had in June suggested a six-month delay in enforcing the sanctions on the condition that Iran allowed the IAEA back in.The officials said Iran had stopped implementing the additional protocol allowing enhanced inspections of its nuclear sites.Return of UN nuclear inspectors to Iran met with protests by MPsRead moreSome experts fear Iran may respond by withdrawing altogether from the non-proliferation treaty at the most extreme, or hardening its opposition to the return of the IAEA.Although the Iran nuclear file is not at the top of the White House agenda, Iranians fear it is likely soon to attract the attention of Donald Trump and Israel, raising the possibility of further attacks.Iran is divided between those who want to accept US demands in return for the lifting of sanctions and those unafraid of further confrontation.The Iranian leadership, caught by surprise by the June attacks, has been reorganising its defence and security leadership, and it is possible it has not had time to reach an internal consensus.The Iranian parliament, dominated by conservatives, has set strict conditions for the return of the IAEA, but these can be overridden by Iran’s national security council.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policyFranceGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The troops were in the process of dismantling the devices when they were killed, state media said.Israeli warplanes and drones prevented Syrian forces from entering the area until late on Wednesday night, after Israeli forces had left the site. A Syrian military source told Al Jazeera that dozens of Israeli troops travelled to the site in four helicopters and spent more than two hours there, though it is unclear what exactly they did.The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, posted on X that forces were “operating in all combat zones day and night for the security of Israel”, but otherwise offered no explanation.The Syrian foreign ministry condemned the strikes, calling them a violation of international law and a breach of the country’s sovereignty.Israel carried out dozens of strikes on weapons depots and military bases after the ousting of Assad in December. It alsopushed into the UN-patrolled buffer zonethat separated the two countries and established military bases there.Israel has warned the new Syrian government,led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former leader of Islamist rebel groups, that it will not allow it to deploy forces to southern Syria.Israeli strikes on Syria had all but stopped after Donald Trump warned Israel to “be reasonable” in Syria, untilsectarian clashesbroke out in Druze-majority areas in southern Syria in June. Israelstruck the defence ministryin Damascus and bombed Syrian troops in what it said was an effort to protect Syria’s Druze population.Wednesday’s bombings came despite high-level security talks taking place between Syrian and Israeli officials. Officials from both countries met in Paris alongside the US special envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, earlier this month.The Paris talks, in addition to meetings in Azerbaijan, are aimed at establishing a security agreement between the two countries that would stop Israeli aggression in Syria and provide security assurances to Israel. Israel has also requested that the rights of the Druze in Syria be respected.On Thursday night, Benjamin Netanyahu said talks about the demilitarisation of southern Syria were in progress, implicitly acknowledging contact with the new Syrian regime for the first time.In a video released by his office, Israel’s prime minister said: “We are focusing on three things: protecting the Druze community in the Sweida governorate, but not only there; creating a demilitarised zone stretching from the Golan Heights, [passing] south of Damascus, down to and including Sweida; and establishing a humanitarian corridor to allow the delivery of aid. These discussions are taking place right now, at this very moment.”Israeli leaders have repeatedly referred to the new government in Damascus as jihadist and have expressed concerns that it could pose a threat to Israelis living close to their shared border. The new government in Syria has not attacked Israel and said it wanted regional peace, including with Israel.Syria and Israel have technically been at war since 1948 and do not have diplomatic relations. In 1974, the two countries signed a UN agreement that created a buffer zone between them.Israel said it considered the 1974 agreement as void once Assad had been toppled, and pushed past the buffer zone. Syrian officials have said they want to use the 1974 agreement as a starting point in negotiations.The US, which is mediating talks between Syria and Israel, has said it hopes the two countries could in time normalise relations and join the Abraham accords. Syrian officials have said this is a possibility but emphasised that current talks are solely focused on security issues.Barrack has cautioned that reaching a security agreement will take time, saying in an interview with the US news website Axios that the two countries “have mutual intent and desire but at the moment there is still more work to do”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why the diversity and equality and inclusion strategies and the focus on it are so important.“Because the lines that are being trotted out around ‘we should treat everybody equally’ – yeah, we should. Everybody should experience the same quality of service from policing or the public sector, but unfortunately they don’t.“And to level up that confidence gap, that difference in service, you have to have some dedicated resources to do that, both inside the organisation, focusing internally on your culture, and externally.“To say that you can … lessen that confidence gap, to say that you can make sure that everybody is experiencing the same quality of service without some dedicated resources to do it is just ludicrous.”Kennedy’s retirement from policing, leaves her free to voice not just her concerns, but also those of other senior figures concerned by intense attacks on policing by rightwing political figures.She said political attacks on diversity and inclusion, and groups targeting asylum hotels, were causing problems on the streets and for her workforce, leaving some people frightened:“Seeing the disorder that’s out on the streets, some of the narrative coming out around immigration status, colour of your skin, it must be really frightening out there, in our communities, but also for our own workforce.“So I do think we’re on a bit of a tipping point at this moment, and I think we need to work really hard not to go backwards.”The toughest challenge in her four years as chief was the July 2024 murder of three schoolgirls, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine,after a man burst into a Southport dance class and stabbed several children.The next day a vigil to commemorate those murdered was soon followed in the Merseyside town byriots that spread across the countryand were the worst in more than a decade.Kennedy said there was a far-right and organised element. “The officers on the ground report that there was carfuls of people turning up and being dropped off … There was an element of organisation for that. So those numbers swelled very quickly … Within 25 minutes of the vigil ending, the first missiles were thrown at the mosque.”Kennedy said claims those taking to the street were typical of white working-class anger were contradicted by the fact that white working-class people turned out in greater numbers to repair the attacked mosque and clear up.In the aftermath of the murders there was a rapid and deliberate spread of false information, designed to whip up trouble, falsely claiming the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. Kennedy and her force took the unusual step on the evening of the atrocity of releasing the information that the suspect was British-born.The chief constable said she doubted that a quicker release of information would have defused tensions that led to the riots.She pointed to this May’s incident where a car went into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC’s Premier League title victory. The incident in Liverpool city centre led to fears of a terrorist attack, which it was not, but also a rapid and determined spread of lies online.Kennedy recalled how her force released ethnicity details of a man it had arrested, but, she said: “Even when we put out that this was a white, British-born local person … because what we’d put out didn’t suit the narrative that they wanted to swell in terms of that negativity, people carried on with that misinformation.”She said she was annoyed by politicians such as Farage, who in the aftermath of the Southport riot said the authoritiesmight be wrongly hiding key details from the public. She said: “I was really frustrated that national politicians were making some of the statements that they were making … because of the impact that it was having in terms of trust and confidence in policing. And it wasn’t in my view based on fact, it was based on what was being said on social media.”Kennedy said claims of two-tier policing were “a ludicrous statement”, and added: “Some of the statements being said by national politicians are having an impact on what is playing out on our streets and what policing, communities and partners are being left to deal with.”She dismissed claims of asylum seekers being more likely to commit crime and said: “I’m not seeing anything out of kilter … It’s just, it’s more newsworthy.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But in past decades autistic people were often forced to navigate middle and old age without the support a diagnosis can unlock.The review into ageing across the autism spectrum found that people in the UK faced widespread difficulties with employment, relationships and milestone events such as menopause and retirement. They consistently suffered from poorer mental and physical health.Why the antagonism over the rise in autism diagnoses? It’s actually good news | Gina RipponRead more“Autistic children grow into autistic adults and we know that they are more likely to have higher rates of most physical and mental health problems,” said Dr Gavin Stewart, co-lead of theRe:Spect Labat King’s College London and lead author of the review. “People often need a diagnosis, or need to recognise it within themselves, to be able to ask for appropriate help and support.”As part of the review, Stewart and Prof Francesca Happé, also at King’s, re-analysed UK healthcare records from 2018. By comparing rates of autism in middle-aged and older people with the 1% national prevalence recognised today, they estimate that in the UK 89% of autistic people aged 40 to 59, and 97% of those aged 60 and over, are undiagnosed.While global autism rates have risen in recent decades – in 2022, one in every 31 Americans under the age of eight were found to have the condition – the trend is largely attributed to abroadening of the definition and improvements in diagnoses, rather than a genuine increase in the percentage of people affected.The researchers went on to examine how autistic and non-autistic people fared throughout life. The former had higher rates of a multitude of conditions ranging from anxiety and depression to cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders, they found.Among the most troubling findings were higher rates of suicidal thoughts and self-harm in older autistic people, and a greater risk of early onset dementia.Average life expectancy differed by six years, with autistic people living to 75 years old, compared with 81 years old for non-autistic people, but these figures could be skewed by the poor diagnosis rates. Details are published in theAnnual Review of Developmental Psychology.“We need to understand how ageing impacts autistic people to better understand what sort of tailored help and support they would actually benefit from,” Stewart said. “These are all things that the [autism] community needs to be consulted on.”Autism varies from person to person, but doctors look for core characteristics when assessing people. These include differences in social communication and rigid and repetitive behaviours.The differences in communication can lead people to become socially isolated. This, alongside the stigmatisation that many autistic people face, can raise the risk of mental and physical health problems. It can also make it harder for autistic people to find people to approach for help and support.According to the review, older autistic people were more likely to face challenges in coping with major life events such as arranging residential care.“If you are going from working nine to five all of your working life to suddenly not, that could have a real impact on you,” Stewart said. “And if you’re going into a care home where you’re suddenly forced into situations that you wouldn’t typically experience in your own home, that has a big impact.”‘Intrinsically connected’: how human neurodiversity could help save natureRead moreHe added: “If an autistic person is having more difficulties throughout their life, when they reach these points they can be real breaking points. That’s where support would be really beneficial.”Tim Nicholls, at the National Autistic Society, said: “This research clearly shows what we already know and hear about every day – there are high numbers of undiagnosed autistic adults and going through life without a diagnosis has a major impact on many aspects of their lives.“Autism assessments can be the first step to understanding people’s needs and a diagnosis can be life changing and, in some cases, lifesaving. Autistic people and their families face a constant fight for support and far too often this starts with long waits for a diagnosis.“The government must provide urgent funding for diagnosis services and make sure autistic people and families get the support they need when they need it.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

But figures for 2024-25 released by the UK Health Security Agency on Thursday show that no childhood vaccine has met this requirement.Only 83.7% of five-year-olds have received both doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, while uptake of the four-in-one preschool booster vaccine – which protects against polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria – stood at 81.4% among five-year-olds in England.The low uptake rates have prompted fears that children will be more vulnerable to infectious diseases as they begin primary school in September. The government has urged parents to make sure their children are up to date with their vaccines.In Julya child died in Liverpool after contractingmeasles, the first such death in the UK in a decade. Only 73% of children in Liverpool have received the necessary two shots to protect against measles.Prof Helen Bedford, from the UCL Institute of ChildHealth, said: “The country is facing a serious wake-up call, because if we continue down this path we’re going to see many more children unwell and we’re going to see more deaths.“Measles, among these other diseases, is incredibly infectious and to keep the disease at bay we really do need much higher levels of uptake than what we’re seeing at the moment.”Graph of regional uptake of MMR vaccine in EnglandShe added: “The other big problem [for vaccine uptake] is that there are vast inequalities in uptake. We know that uptake is also lower among some ethnic minority groups, notably black Caribbean and African populations.”The data reveals stark regional inequalities. While more than 90% of five-year-olds in the north-east of England received both doses of the MMR vaccine, only seven in 10 (69.6%) of eligible Londoners had received the same. Meanwhile, regional uptake of the four-in-one booster ranged from 88.9% in the north-east of the country to 63.8% in London.London’s mobile population is a significant reason for its low uptake, according to Bea Taylor, a senior fellow at the Nuffield Trust. “Parents and carers in the capital are more likely to face barriers including having to move house regularly, which can make it difficult to stay registered with a local GP and receive reminders about vaccinations,” she said.Prof Kate Pickett, an academic co-director at Health Equity North, said it was “clear there are still challenges to overcome to address regional disparities in child vaccination rates”.Graph showing decline of MMR uptakeThe UK is the worst of the G7 nations regarding MMR vaccination uptake, according to the WHO: as of 2024 only89% of children had received their first MMR jab. Globally, millions of children are at risk of lethal diseases owing to vaccine coverage having stalled or reversed, according tothe largest study of its kind.Dr Helen Skirrow, a clinical research fellow at Imperial College London’s School of Public Health, said: “Declining vaccine uptake is very worrying, as without reversing this trend and achieving sufficient herd immunity the increasing measles outbreaks we have seen over recent years could continue. It is a public health imperative that more children get vaccinated with the recommended two doses of MMR vaccine in order to be protected.”On Friday, the government announced a new vaccination programme for chickenpox from January, meaning that GPs will offer eligible children a combined vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella – the clinical term for chickenpox – as part of the routine infant vaccination schedule.Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, said: “Too many children are starting primary school without complete protection against preventable and potentially serious illnesses like measles, whooping cough and mumps.“Vaccines save thousands of lives every year and prevent countless hospital admissions. I urge all parents to check their child’s vaccination record and contact their GP practice if any jabs are missing.”Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationEnglandChildrenWorld Health OrganizationHealthMMRPrimary schoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “We recognise the nature of the criminal charges and the ongoing investigation may be upsetting for colleagues and cause distress.“We would therefore like to remind everyone who works at Holyrood or in constituency offices of the confidential support services that are available.”Smyth was arrested and charged this month in connection with possession of indecent images, prompting his suspension from Scottish Labour.The South Scotland MSP was arrested on Tuesday 5 August and is due to appear in court at a later date.He was first elected as an MSP in 2016 and was returned to Holyrood at the 2021 election. The Scottish parliament website now lists him as an independent.A spokesperson for Police Scotland said: “On Tuesday 5 August 2025, officers executed a warrant at a property on Marchfield Avenue, Dumfries.“A 52-year-old man was arrested and charged in connection with possession of indecent images. He is due to appear at Dumfries sheriff court at a later date.”A spokesperson for Scottish Labour said: “The whip has been removed from Colin Smyth MSP, pending an investigation. We cannot comment further on this matter while the investigation is ongoing.”It is understood the MSP was administratively suspended by Labour after the party became aware of the police investigation.In a statement last week Smyth said: “These events have come as a shock and this is a deeply stressful time. I am obviously co-operating fully with any inquiries and hope the matter can be resolved quickly.“I am not able to comment further at this stage, and in the meantime I would ask for the privacy of my family and friends to be respected.”A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “A standard prosecution report has been received by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service from Police Scotland in relation to a 52-year-old man.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Three senior leaders – Debra Houry, Demetre Daskalakis and Daniel Jernigan – resigned shortly after in protest, citing the alleged spread of misinformation under the Trump administration and political interference in their work. The staffers cheered and applauded them at the event on Thursday.“You are the people that protect America, and America needs to see that you are the people that protect America, and we are going to be your loudest advocates,” said Daskalakis to the throng. Daskalakis, who was accompanied at the rally by Houry and Jernigan, is now the former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and is known for his leadership in HIV prevention and vaccination programs and the Biden administration’s response to the mpox outbreak.1:17CDC staff clap out senior officials who resigned after Monarez firing – videoThe three, plus Jennifer Leyden, who led the office of public health data, resigned together on Thursday to make a statement about the damage the administration had done to public vaccine research, and in protest of the administration’s response to vaccine disinformation, they said.“We agreed to do this together. We’ve been talking about it for months, and the past few days, it was just escalating,” said Houry, the CDC’s former chief medical officer. “If one of us retired, it would have been a blip. When the three of us do it together, it’s more powerful and just shows the state of our agency.” She and the others are asking for Congress to intervene, to put a stop to political interference in the organization’s work.White House reportedly picks Kennedy deputy to replace fired CDC chiefRead moreThe agency is overseen by the US health secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr, who in recent days restricted the use of Covid vaccines for Americans and has removed scientific advisers and cut funding for medical research. Kennedy has reportedly tapped the deputy health secretary, Jim O’Neill, an investor in libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel’s orbit, as the CDC’s interim leader. Monarez was the first CDC director in 50 years to not hold a medical degree. O’Neill would be the second.The staff and supporters of the CDC gathered across the street from the campus inAtlanta, and Houry, Daskalakis and Jernigan were met with applause and handshakes, a marked difference from this morning when they were escorted off campus.“They are essentially trying to undo a lot of the science that has been settled for vaccine policies,” Jernigan said. The dismissal “was a tipping point for us that we had to say we’ve got to do something. We need to get the politics out of public health. We need to make sure that we’re using objective science in the making of vaccine and other treatment decisions. Until we can do that and get back to that, ideology will be just driving the policies rather than the science driving the policies.”View image in fullscreenFrom left, Dan Jernigan, Deb Houry and Demetre Daskalakis smile as employees and supporters of the CDC line up outside its global headquarters in Atlanta.Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Getty ImagesThe turmoil at the CDC comes as the agency is still recovering from the attack of a gunman who fired more than 500 rounds into the Atlanta offices before killing the DeKalb county police officer David Rose. More than two weeks later, the White House had said nothing about the shooting, Houry said. Staffers were “concerned about speaking about vaccines in our science because they’re worried they’ll be targeted”, she said. “That’s unacceptable … This was an act of domestic terrorism. They need to address this.”The shooting has done more than shake up the staff. The community is questioning whether their lives are valued by the federal government, said Dr Jasmine Clark, an Emory University professor of microbiology and state representative in the suburbs north of Atlanta, who is running for Congress. The speed with which the event was organized – not a walkout, more like a long lunch – spoke to the sentiment in the building, she said:“So many people in my community said they feel like no one values their life, and what am I doing when I go to work every day? It’s a privilege that people have no idea what happens in that building, and the fact that they don’t know means they’re doing a good job. But unfortunately we have an administration that does not value that work and in fact actively devalues the work and spreads misinformation that cost the life of Officer David Rose.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationAtlantaUS politicsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Fourteen other children, aged six to 15, were also injured, two of them critically, though officials said they were expected to survive. Three adults, parishioners in their 80s, were also injured. Police said the suspect, Robin Westman, 23, killed themself and was found dead behind the church.As investigators continued to sift through evidence and search for a motive, they found Westman had a “deranged fascination” with mass shooters and wanted to gain notoriety, the Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, told a news conference. He said the shooter had expressed hate toward “almost every group imaginable” in writings they left behind. The acting US attorney for Minnesota, Joe Thompson, added that they were “obsessed” with the idea of killing children.Westman’s mother worked at the church in the south of the city until 2021 and O’Hara confirmed that Westman had attended school and mass there, but said police had not identified a triggering event or a specific grievance against the church.It also emerged on Thursday that the shooter had tried to get inside the church to carry out the attack, but had failed as the doors had been locked when mass began. O’Hara told NBC’s Today show on Thursday morning that, as a result, they had fired through the windows, and the fact that they couldn’t get into the church “likely saved countless lives”.The shooter had visited the church several weeks ago, under the pretext of wanting to reconnect with the Catholic faith, as part of the planning for the attack, CNN reported on Thursday, citing a senior law enforcement official. Investigators believe that from that visit, Westman created the detailed, hand-drawn diagram of the church’s interior that was shown on a video they scheduled to publish on YouTube around the time the attack began.Adding to the likelihood that Westman intended to carry out the shooting from inside the church is a video in which they show wooden boards with smoke canisters attached, which they intended to place through the door handles of the emergency exits so students would be trapped inside. Had Westman been able to enter the church, victims who fled to the emergency exits would have found them blocked and filled with orange smoke, the official told CNN.O’Hara also pointed to Westman’s attempt to barricade doors using two-by-fours, telling CNN on Thursday that it seems to indicate “the shooter did intend to get inside”.Minneapolis Catholic school shooting: two children killed and 17 injuredRead more“This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,”O’Hara said in a news conference on Wednesday. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.The Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, called Westman a “deranged monster” in a statement later on Wednesday.“This level of violence is unthinkable. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere. We mourn with them, we pray for healing, and we will never forget them,” Noemsaid.View image in fullscreenPolice and first responders at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday.Photograph: Tom Baker/AFP/Getty ImagesO’Hara said the incident took place just before 8.30am during a service marking the first week of school. The pews had been packed with teachers, parents and children listening to a psalm. Just before the congregants were to proclaim “Alleluia”, bullets were fired through the windows.“Down! Everybody down!” someone shouted as children ducked for cover behind wooden pews. One student threw himself on top of a friend and was shot in the back. A youth minister called her husband to say goodbye. People used a wooden plank to barricade a door and fled to a gymnasium.The shooting went on for several minutes, according to a man who lives near the church and said he heard as many as 50 shots. Dozens of law enforcement officers soon arrived at the school.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Catholic clergy arriving ata vigilon Wednesday for the victims of the shooting.Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesMany knew each other well in a community that is built around the century-old Catholic school and parish, a suburb better described as a small town.“I’m just asking [God]: ‘Why right now?’ It’s little kids,” said Aubrey Pannhoff, 16, a student at a nearby Catholic school who stood at the edge of the police cordon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That request was granted in January 2020.A rifle, a shotgun and a pistol had been lawfully bought by the shooter recently, O’Hara said, adding it was believed Westman acted alone.He said Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube. The police said it “appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings”. The content had been taken down with the assistance of the FBI, he added. The videos were rambling, often showed writings in Russian, and contained a variety of references to things ranging fromDonald Trumpto antisemitic statements to gun rights.As police continue to search for a potential motive, O’Hara said on Thursday that investigators were trying to obtain electronic search warrants to go through the shooter’s devices. “Everything that we’ve seen so far is really a classic pathway to an active shooter,” he told NBC’s Today show, but nothing specific had emerged yet in terms of motive for targeting this particular church.The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”, but O’Hara declined to be drawn on the motive at news conference on Wednesday, restating only that investigations into a motive were ongoing.At a briefing, Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, said: “Children are dead. There are families that have a deceased child … Don’t just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.”View image in fullscreenThe Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, speaking to the media after the shooting, with the police chief, Brian O’Hara.Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesLater, Frey added: “Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community has lost their sense of common humanity,” he said. “We should not be operating from a place of hate for anyone. We should be operating from a place of love for our kids. This is about them.”One of the documented victims in the shooting is 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who “was shot during the attack and is currently in critical condition in the ICU”, per aGoFundMethat was set up for family to help with “ongoing ICU care, future surgeries, trauma counseling, lost income, travel, and the countless unknowns that lie ahead”.The GoFundMe notes that Forchas’s younger brother was also inside the school during the shooting and her mother, a pediatric critical care nurse, went to work to help during the tragedy, not knowing her daughter was critically injured.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsMinneapolis school shootingMinneapolisGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s how he’s trying to get his wayRead moreBut Cook stood her ground, arguing that Trump had “no authority” to fire her. “I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy,” she said.Cook is a member of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors, who serve in the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which votes to set interest rates. Cook was appointed to her role in 2022 by Joe Biden.The lawsuit, filed on her behalf in Washington DC federal court, asks judges to void Cook’s firing, arguing it was not in Trump’s power to fire her and that it would be “the first of its kind in the board’s history”.An unintentional “clerical error” might lie behind the allegations leveled by the administration, Cook’s lawyers suggest in the filing.The complaint cites the Federal Reserve Act (FRA), noting the 1913 law that created the Fed “explicitly requires a showing of ‘cause’ for a governor’s removal”.“An unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications submitted by Governor Cook prior to her Senate confirmation is not [cause],” court filings said. “President Trump’s letter purporting to fire Governor Cook did not cite appropriate cause for removing her from the board of governors.”Cook’s lawyers also said her removal violated her fifth amendment due process rights to a notice and hearing under the FRA. Instead of receiving official notice, Cook “found out about the attempt to remove her through President Trump’s Truth Social post”.In a statement, a White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, argued that Trump’s removal of Cook was legal under US law and that the president “determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions”.“The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve board’s accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people,” Desai said.The lawsuit includes a section detailing the legal and historical background of the Fed’s independence as the central bank, arguing that the “for cause” removal protections have been a “bulwark of the Federal Reserve’s independence for the past century”.The mortgage allegations are “pretextual”, the lawsuit claims, and part of a broader attempt by Trump to obtain a vacant board seat “to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve’”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Policymakers have stressed the need to wait and see the impact of the administration’s policies, such as tariffs and deportations, before approving a cut.Cook’s exit would allow Trump to tap a replacement, helping him exert more control over Fed policy. He suggested on Tuesday that he would “have a majority” on the Fed’s seven-member board of governors “very shortly”, adding: “We have to get the rates down a little bit.”The Trump administration has pursued several of the president’s political enemies, including the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the California senator Adam Schiff,over claims of mortgage fraud. Both James and Schiff have denied the allegations.Cook is not a politician, but is among a string of senior Fed policymakers who have defied Trump’s persistent calls for rate cuts. She became the first Black woman to sit on the central bank’s board when she was appointed to a term that was not due to end until 2038.A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, Cook served on the council of economic advisers underBarack Obama.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveTrump administrationDonald TrumpEconomicsUS economyLaw (US)US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That compared with 14,769 at the same point last year.New car registrations for BYD across Europe rose to 13,503 last month, compared with 4,151 a year earlier. BYD now has 1.2% market share, the ACEA found. Tesla’s share remains at 0.8%.Chinese car brands, which often have relatively cheaper models, have beenexpanding aggressively in Europe. BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time this spring, according to a report from the market research company JATO Dynamics.In the UK the government said on Thursday that the US car brandFordwould be the first manufacturer to receive the maximum £3,750 subsidy on two models: the Gen-E and the e-Tourneo Courier. A further 26 other models will be eligible for grants of £1,500 under the government’s new electric car grant scheme.The grants apply only to vehicles with a list price of £37,000 or below.

But shares of the chip giant still dropped 2.3% in after hours trading, in a sign that investors’ worries of an AI bubble and the repercussions ofDonald Trump’s trade wars are not quelled.Nvidia’s financial report was the first test of investor appetite since last week’s mass AI-stock selloff, when several tech stocks saw shares tumble last week amid growing questions over whether AI-driven companies are being overvalued.On Wednesday, Nvidia reported an adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on $46.74bn in revenue, surpassing Wall Street’s projection of $1.01 in earnings per share on $46.05bn in revenue, according to Fact Set data.But investors had high expectations for the company. Some of the market reactions may be to the slight misses in other parts of the company’s business, including data center revenue. Nvidia posted $41.1bn in data center revenue, missing the $41.3bn Wall Street was expecting.“Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn’t cut it for Nvidia this time around,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst atInvesting.com. “Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat.”The company also said it had not assumed any shipments of its H20 chips toChinain the outlook.The chip is at the heart of concerns over the repercussions of the trade war between the US and China. Earlier this year, Trump banned AI chip sales in China, a move that resulted in a $4.5bn blow to Nvidia’s finances during its fiscal first quarter. In August, Nvidiaagreedto give the US government a 15% cut of its H20 chips to China in return for export licences. China, in turn, has voiced security concerns over the chips, and is ramping up production of its own domestic alternatives.Nvidia’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said on the earnings call that some companies have expressed interest in purchasing H20 and an initial set of companies have received licenses to purchase the chip. Kress said that the company could ship anywhere between $2bn and $5bn of H20 chips to China if “geopolitical issues reside”.Huang reiterated the importance of being able to operate in the China market, which he said could represent a $50bn market opportunity for the company this year. “We’re talking to the administration about the importance of American companies being able to address the Chinese market,” Huang said. He also said in addition to H20 being approved for sales in China to non-sanctioned companies, there is a potential opportunity for the company to eventually sell a version of Blackwell in the country.Trump hiked tariffs on US imports. Now he’s looking at exports – sparking fears of ‘dangerous precedent’Read more“It is the second largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers – about 50% of the world’s AI researchers are in China,” Huang said. “The vast majority of leading open source models are created in China. It’s fairly important for the American technology companies to be able to address that market.”Monteiro, the Investing.com analyst, said:“The reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation.”The company is projecting $54bn in revenue in the third quarter – which is within the range of Wall Street expectations – and said the board approved $60bn in additional stock buybacks – on top of nearly $24.3bn the company returned to shareholders in the first half of the year in both stock buybacks and cash dividends.Founder and chief executive, Jensen Huang, said production of the company’s latest AI superchip, Blackwell, is “ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.“The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center,” Huang said in a press release.Despite the initial tepid market reaction to the company’s financials, some analysts remain bullish on the so-called AI revolution, especially as major technology companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. “This is further validation for Nvidia and the AI Revolution,” said the Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives.“This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China. There is one chip in the world fueling the AI Revolution and its Nvidia … that narrative is clear from these results and the positive commentary from Jensen,” Ives said.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaQuarterly resultsChinaArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The statement said the new works division would “prioritise clearing the security concerns before any further step is taken”.A Unitree robot mounted with Taiwan-built camera systemswas displayed at a Taipei tech trade show last year.China’s ruling Communist partyclaims Taiwan as Chinese territory, and is preparing to annex it, by military force if necessary. In the meantime, it barrages Taiwan with near daily grey-zone harassment, espionage and cyber-attacks. Taiwan has enacted strict laws and regulations about the importation and use of Chinese technology and equipment.Comments under Chien’s social media post were fiercely critical of the city authorities. “I could instantly tell that the model is from Unitree. The Taipei City government has zero awareness on information security,” said one commenter. Another asked: “Are you collecting data and paving a way for the PLA to conduct urban warfare here?”.The Taiwanese military commentator Wang Cheng-ming urged the city government to be more cautious about using Chinese technology, noting there were domestic projects in development that could be used instead. “Crucial” mapping data gathered by the robot, which could not be obtained through satellite or photographs, would be highly sought after by China’s military, he added.Taipei’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an, asked by local media about national security concerns over the robot, said the city and central governments would be discussing the “innovative experiment”.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaRobotsArtificial intelligence (AI)EspionageAsia PacificTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

ESPNwas firstto report the deal.A person with knowledge of the details told the Associated Press that the Packers and Parsons have agreed a four-year, $188m contract that includes $136m guaranteed. The deal makes the two-time All-Pro edge rusher the highest-paid non-quarterback inNFLhistory.The contract, negotiated by agent David Mulugheta of Athletes First, will pay Parsons $62m in the first new year and $120m fully guaranteed at signing – all records for a defensive player.Parsons confirmed his departure ina statement posted on X. “I never wanted this chapter to end, but not everything was in my control,” he wrote. “My heart has always been here, and still is. Through it all, I never made any demands. I never asked for anything more than fairness. I only asked that the person I trust to negotiate my contract be part of the process.”Cowboys owner Jerry Jones declined to discuss the deal with Mulugheta, insisting publicly that he and Parsons had already agreed to parameters of an extension in the spring. Jones had previously dismissed trade speculation as “pure BS” and argued the team could retain Parsons through his rookie option and successive franchise tags.But Parsons had grown increasingly frustrated, removing Cowboys references from his social media and formally requesting a trade on 1 August. The rift culminated in Tuesday’s agreement, which sees Dallas receive two first-round picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark in return, according to a person with knowledge of the trade.The Packers, who reached the playoffs last season behind quarterback Jordan Love, are adding one of the NFL’s most dominant defensive players at the height of his career. Parsons, 26, recorded 40.5 sacks over his first four seasons in Dallas and was named an All-Pro in three of them.His arrival recalls the 2018 deal that sent Khalil Mack from the Raiders to the Bears for a package of draft picks, though Parsons’ contract far surpasses Mack’s six-year, $141m extension. For Green Bay, the price is steep but the payoff could be transformative: a generational pass rusher anchoring a defense with Super Bowl ambitions.Explore more on these topicsNFLGreen Bay PackersDallas CowboysUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Oh no, you have one of the best attackers in the world. Oh no, you got him for a bargain price. Oh no, he won you the Club World Cup last month. Still, no side ever wants to be completely reliant on one player. Chelsea aim to depend more on the collective than the individual. They have struggled without Palmer in the past but thrived in his absenceagainst West Hamlast week. Palmer withdrew with a groin injury during the warm-up and is a doubt to face Fulham in the Saturday lunchtime kick-off. However Enzo Maresca has options. Estêvão Willian came in for Palmer against West Ham and was exceptional on the right wing. João Pedro and Pedro Neto were excellent. Chelsea have enough talent at their disposal to beat Fulham without Palmer.Jacob SteinbergChelsea v Fulham, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)2Will stubborn Amorim get ruthless?Ruben Amorim has to end Saturday afternoon with only one thing achieved: a first victory of the season that will quieten the noise around him andManchester United. Burnley will arrive at Old Trafford with the opposite aim and should closely study how Grimsby took Amorim’s insipid men apart in Wednesday’s 12-11 penalty shootout knockout in the Carabao Cup. So: now is the time for the head coach to ruthless and select an XI that has Bruno Fernandes as one of his 10s, Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield, Benjamin Sesko at centre-forward for a first Premier League start and, dare this correspondent suggest it, a tweak of formation to 4-3-3 as his beloved 3-4-3 just is not working. Will the stubborn Amorim do any of this? The latter – almost certainly not.Manchester United vBurnley, Saturday 3pm3Frank will work his Spurs players hardA niche statistic, this, but hugely important for the nine individuals destined for a day of extended heel-kicking on the Tottenham bench. Last weekend, in the Premier League’s second matchday of the season, the average time of the first substitution made by top-flight teams was the 54th minute; ignoring those forced by early injuries bumps that up to the 63rd. Tottenham made their first substitution in the 78th minute, and in this young season they andNottingham Forestare already the only teams yet to have made a change before the 70th minute of a Premier League game. The average Spurs substitute this season spends just 11 minutes on the pitch, joint lowest in the league (level with Forest and also Bournemouth, whose number is skewed by the two 89th-minute changes they made in response to falling behind late in their opening game at Anfield). Last season the team whose substitutes spent the least time on the field was Thomas Frank’s Brentford. This might be surprising, given the intensity Frank demands of his players and that particularly characterised Spurs’s win at Manchester City last week, but his members of his starting XI need to get used to hard work and long shifts, and the rest of his squad to splinters.Tottenham vBournemouth, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenThomas Frank is relentless and he expects the same of his players.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images4Wissa to miss out on friends reunionAlthough Yoane Wissa yearns to move to north-east England the Brentford forward seems unlikely to feature against old friends atSunderland. The problem is that Wissa wants to join Newcastle but his club are determined to keep him and the resultant upset has prompted his absence from Keith Andrews’s teamsheets this season. That may please Régis Le Bris. Sunderland’s manager knows Wissa very well after spending countless hours honing the DR Congo forward’s game during his time as a coach at Lorient. Wissa – who also played alongside Sunderland’s Enzo Le Fée at the Breton club – moved on to Brentford before Le Bris’s promotion to Lorient’s head coach and shortly after a horrendous, life changing event. For a while an unprovoked attack involving acid being thrown in the striker’s face placed that move to west London in jeopardy. Initial fears that Wissa, who still needs daily eye drops, could be blinded, explains why the 28-year-old’s subsequent success has so delighted Le Bris, Le Fée and his old pals from Brittany.Louise TaylorSunderland vBrentford, Saturday 3pm5Moyes to unleash Dibling in attack?The pieces are slowly falling into place for David Moyes. Everton’s manager, whose priority has shifted towards beefing up his defensive options, made it clear he needed reinforcements after starting pre-season with 15 senior players and in Tyler Dibling he landed a key target. The 19-year-old right winger, who at £42m the club’s second-most expensive buy, is a raw but talented performer who has been tracked by Europe’s elite and even if his early promise faded at Southampton, his arrival atEvertonshould be seen as a coup. Dibling entered off the bench in Everton’s Carabao Cup victory over Mansfield in midweek and is building fitness after a disrupted pre-season. A trip to Molineux gives Moyes a first real opportunity to blend his new-look attack after the arrivals of Dibling, Jack Grealish, Thierno Barry and Carlos Alcaraz, the Argentinian who spent the second half of last season on loan at the club.Ben FisherWolves v Everton, Saturday 3pm6Longstaff to prove point against old club?The knee injuries sustained by Ao Tanaka and Ethan Ampadu are bad news for Leeds. But they do open a door for Sean Longstaff to start in midfield for Daniel Farke’s side when his old team visit Elland Road. Earlier this summer Rafael Benítez, Longstaff’s former manager at Newcastle, congratulated his former protege on deciding to make a new start in West Yorkshire after losing his first-team place at the club he has loved since boyhood. Now Longstaff has a chance to show Eddie Howe what he is missing and, with injuries to Sandro Tonali and Joelinton weakening Newcastle’s midfield, opportunity beckons for the £12m Tynesider. If Farke will be relieved at Alexander Isak’s continued non-involvement, Leeds need to banish the memory of last Saturday’schastening 5-0 defeatat Arsenal. Without the still on strike Isak, Newcastle have taken one point from two games but were unlucky tolose 3-2at home to Liverpool on Monday. Even with Anthony Gordon starting a three-match suspension, they cannot be underestimated.LTskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kostoulas, an 18-year-old striker who cost an initial £30m from Olympiakos, was also handed his debut by Fabian Hürzeler for the last 12 minutes at the Kassam Stadium as his experimental side set up a trip to Barnsley in the next round. Brighton are keen to shift some of their fringe players before next week’s transfer deadline, meaning there should be more opportunities for both to establish themselves in the coming weeks. But Hürzeler is clearly in no rush and would not confirm if Tzimas, who cost £20m from Nürnberg in February, could faceManchester Cityon Sunday. “For sure he’s closer but I’m not sure if he might be an option for the weekend, we have to see how he reacts,” said the Brighton head coach. “We have to be very patient with him and let’s see what will be the next step.”Ed AaronsBrighton v Manchester City, Sunday 2pm8Freakish West Ham numbers mean only way is upThere was a period at the end of last season when it felt that perhaps West Ham were close to getting somewhere – they may have won only four of their last 16 games but of their seven defeats in that period not one was by more than a single goal and they would have banked several more points had they not conceded result-changing goals in the 89th minute or later against Everton,Liverpool, Southampton and Brighton. But if they were unlucky then, it was nothing compared with their start to this season. Sure, they have played poorly, but they have also converted 24 shots into one goal, no points and last place while Forest, for example, have turned 20 shots into four goals, four points and fifth. Meanwhile at the other end of the pitch 55% of all shots taken against them have been on target, and two-thirds of those – 36.4% of the total number of shots they have conceded – have gone in. These are unsustainably freakish numbers: in none of the last five completed seasons has any team seen as many as 16% of the shots their opponents have taken go in. Things can only get better – can’t they?Nottingham Forest v West Ham, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenWest Ham’s Jarrod Bowen has been in the news this week.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA9An Anfield baptism for excited EzeEberechi Eze’s reaction to being handed the No 10 shirt by Arsenal demonstrated what a return to the Emirates Stadium meant to the boyhood Gunners fan. It was a combination of astonishment and childlike joy, the response of a genuine fan rather than a hardened professional, and prompted Eze to pledge to “give everything I have” to pay back the honour of following in the footsteps of Dennis Bergkamp and other Arsenal favourites. There could be no better place to start repaying a £67.5m investment than at Anfield, a ground where Arsenal have not won since 2012 and their title pretensions have withered on several subsequent visits. With Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard injury doubts, and Kai Havertza confirmed absentee, Eze is likely to make his Arsenal debut against the Premier League champions. He may well start as a 10, or in his anticipated role on the left, depending on the options available to Mikel Arteta. Either way, Eze will relish wearing that shirt in competitive action for the first time.Andy HunterLiverpool vArsenal, Sunday 4.30pm10Malen could pep up flat VillaAston Villa host Crystal Palace with the clubs in contrasting moods. Palace will arrive at Villa Park fresh from qualifying for the Conference League league phase afterprogressing against Fredrikstadin Norway, while Villa are stuck in the mud. Villa’s season may only be two games old but an uninspiring stalemate against Newcastle and defeat at Brentford have doused optimism. Unai Emery’s side have dropped their intensity and the Villa manager has to find a formula to hurt a stubborn Palace defence. Emery must be tempted to turn to Donyell Malen, who has been almost exclusively used as a substitute since signing in a £20m deal from Borussia Dortmund in January, having made just two league starts for Villa. Malen would be a more natural winger than John McGinn, even if the captain is capable of operating off the flanks. Evann Guessand, who provided a spark off the bench on his debut, is another obvious option. Another flat performance is unthinkable, even at this early stage.BFAston Villa vCrystal Palace, Sunday 7pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2662Tottenham Hotspur2563Liverpool2364Chelsea2445Nottm Forest2246Man City2237Sunderland2138Everton2139AFC Bournemouth2-1310Brentford2-1311Burnley2-1312Leeds2-4313Fulham20214Crystal Palace20215Newcastle2-1116Man Utd2-1117Aston Villa2-1118Brighton2-2119Wolverhampton2-5020West Ham2-70Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendArsenalTottenham HotspurLiverpoolChelseaNottingham ForestManchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The reverse means the side are without a victory this season, having also lost to Arsenal and drawn with Fulham in the league, putting pressure on them before their home game with Burnley on Saturday. United are understood to have no plans to sack Amorim but there is a sense at the club that if results do not turn his stubbornness may prompt him to walk away – possibly as early as next week during the international break – rather than change his methods.Ruben Amorim says ‘something has to change’ at United. What should that be?Read moreAfter last season’s record low Premier League finish of 15th, the poor run is sparking questions of Amorim from within the squad, the Guardian understands. The head coach’s insistence on a 3-4-3 formation is causing particular scrutiny after earning 27 points in 29 league matches.There is also bemusement regarding his man-management approach, which is viewed by many players as well-meaning but sometimes counter-productive.After the Grimsby loss Amorim said “something has to change” but he is viewed at United as being wedded to his formation, so there is no expectation that was a reference to altering the shape he also used consistently – and successfully – at Sporting in his previous job.Jason Wilcox, the director of football, is thought to be aware of the problems regarding Amorim’s tactics and handling of his players and may move to address these.Amorim also said after the Grimsby match: “Let’s focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through.”Quick GuideBesiktas sack Solskjær after eliminationShowBesiktas have sacked the former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær after they were knocked out of the Conference League play-offs by Lausanne.Besiktas were beaten 1-0 at home by the INEOS-owned Lausanne on Thursday night, with the former Arsenal striker Nathan Butler-Oyedeji scoring the only goal in first-half stoppage-time before Besiktas had Felix Uduokhai sent off early in the second half, giving Lausanne a 2-1 aggregate win.A Besiktas statement said: \"Our contract with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær has been terminated following a decision made at the board meeting. Following the meeting, our chairman, Serdal Adali, thanked Solskjær for his services to date.\"The Norwegian took charge of the Super Lig club in January - his first coaching role since leaving United in November 2021 - and guided them to fourth by the end of last season.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.United’s match with Burnley is their last before the international break. The message from within Old Trafford on Thursday was that it remained business as usual. United resume after the break with the derby at Manchester City on 14 September.One player who will not feature again for United is Alejandro Garnacho. The winger – one of the players Amorim was keen to move on – appears likely to move to Chelsea. The two clubs have finally agreed a £40m deal with a 10% sell-on fee.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

Tennis’s loudest major is rubbing up against New York’s shifting culture around marijuanaBryan Armen Grahamat Flushing MeadowsThu 28 Aug 2025 11.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 13.03 EDTShareThe US Open has always been the unruliest of tennis’s four grand slam tournaments, a place where the soundtrack is as much screeching trains, the roar of air traffic overhead and well-lubricated crowds as it is the thwack of racket on ball. Frances Tiafoe likes to call it “organized chaos”, the sort of life-affirming atmosphere that he says teases out his best performances. For some, it’s no stage at all but a blur of bass-heavy changeovers, revolving-door celebrity cameos and the ceaseless rattle of the nearby No 7 subway.In recent years, though, one distraction has cut through even the normalized bedlam that gives the tournament its character. Alongside the honey deuce cocktails and free-flowing Heineken, a different vice has threaded itself into the fortnight: the pungent and unmistakable odor of marijuana. It drifts across the Billie Jean King NationalTennisCenter with enough frequency that players have begun treating it as not a bug but a feature of the event itself.Casper Ruud, the 2022 US Open runner-up from Norway, was the latest to complain during last week’s mixed doubles tournament while paired with Iga Świątek. “For me, this is the worst thing aboutNew York,” he said. “The smell of cannabis. It’s everywhere, even here where the tournament is being played. But we have to accept it. I think it’s annoying to be on the court while someone smokes a joint. It’s no fun for us players to be tired and have to inhale the smell of hashish at the same time. We can’t do anything about it unless the law changes, but I doubt that will happen.”Ostapenko and Townsend confront each other after US Open match: ‘She said I had no education’Read moreThe complaints have been loud enough that Danish media have even dubbed Court 17hash-banen– the “hash court” – cheeky shorthand for the bullring-like show court where the aroma of weed has become nearly as much a part of the atmosphere as the noise of the crowd.🌿👃      😡Casper Ruud najwidoczniej w młodości nie był fanem Boba Marleya 😬#USOpenpic.twitter.com/p0XZcIlUmn— Eurosport Polska (@Eurosport_PL)August 25, 2025The USTA has maintained a strict no-smoking policy since at least 2011, when New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg’s smoking ban was expanded to public parks, beaches and pedestrian plazas. Yet since New York legalized recreational cannabis in 2021, Flushing Meadows has become a microcosm of the state’s shifting culture.Within the grounds, security enforces the rules (if not aggressively). But take a few steps just outside into Corona Park, which abuts the south end of the grounds, and anyone over 21 can legally toke up: under the 2021 law, adults may possess up to 85 grams of cannabis and smoke it anywhere tobacco use is permitted. On Sunday afternoon as the first day of the tournament unfolded, smokers fired up prerolls within clear view of the gaggles of police outside the South Gate. The shift has been embraced by city leaders. Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, even encouraged New Yorkers to “enjoy yourself, light up, but most importantly – spend some money.” That permissive stance, coupled with a patchy licensing rollout that has allowed hundreds of unregulated storefronts to flourish, has made cannabis feel inescapable across the five boroughs – and this particular expanse of Queens is no exception.The smell of weed at the US Open, however, predates legalization. In 2014, Martina Hingisremarked on itduring a doubles match on the old Grandstand court. Since then, a parade of players – Nick Kyrgios, Maria Sakkari, Alexander Zverev – have all voiced frustration. Sakkari’s 2023 first-round loss to Rebeka Masarova became one of the more notorious episodes. Midway through the match she pleaded with the chair umpire about the distraction, later telling reporters: “Sometimes it smells food, sometimes it smells cigarettes, sometimes it smells weed. It’s something that we cannot control because we’re in an open space. There’s a park behind. People can do whatever they want.”Kyrgios, combustible at the best of times, was incensed during his second-round win over Benjamin Bonzi in 2022. He urged the umpire to remind spectators not to smoke, complaining the odor was particularly harsh on his breathing as an asthmatic. “It was fucking marijuana. Obviously, I’m not going to complain about food smells,” he’d later say. “But probably not something I want to be breathing in between points.” Afterward he admitted the distractions of New York – heckling fans, roaring trains, and now marijuana smoke – made it harder to stay locked in point to point.View image in fullscreenMarijuana is now a common smell on the streets of New York City.Photograph: Carlo Allegri/ReutersZverev was blunter. After a match on Court 17 two years ago, the German likened the atmosphere to “Snoop Dogg’s living room”. The intimate, 2,800-seat stadium with no reserved seating, which has become a fan favorite since the demise of the old Grandstand, has also earned a reputation as the epicenter of the smell. Zverev’s assessment has since taken on a life of its own. A story this week previewing Thursday’s court assignments quipped that Holger Runehad been sent tohash-banenfor his second-round match, creating an aura that has proven stickier than your highest-grade kine bud.Tournament officials have resisted the suggestion that Flushing Meadows has become a stoner’s playground.“While we can’t control what takes place off the grounds of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, we continue to be vigilant as we maintain this facility as a smoke free environment,” a USTA spokesperson told the Guardian this week. “This includes enforcement by our security and guest services teams when they are made aware of any individual that may be smoking, making them aware that although it may be legal in [New York], that smoking is not permitted on parks property including the tennis center. We constantly work with the NYPD and Parks Department, and we believe this has helped to decrease any smoking near our fenceline.”After Sakkari’s comments in 2023 made headlines, the USTA reviewed video footage and interviewed staff. “No evidence” was found of fans lighting up inside Court 17, a tournament spokesperson said. Instead, officials suggested, the smoke likely drifted from Corona Park. Players themselves have acknowledged as much. Marketa Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, said after her match that same year: “I smelled it actually today also. You smell it a lot. I think it’s just Court 17. That court is so far away, it’s almost in the park. I think it’s coming from the park.”From the organizers’ perspective, nothing has changed. It’s not like the posters of past tournaments which line the bowels of Arthur Ashe Stadium have been swapped out forBob Marley photomosaicsand thePink Floyd Back Catalogue. The USTA still sells itself as the buzziest of the four slams, but emphatically not that kind of buzz. But it’s not only spectators who are leaning in to the relaxed attitudes toward cannabis. One camera operator, who requested anonymity to protect his job, said he now relies on edibles to get through marathon shifts that sometimes stretch past 16 hours.Security staffers stationed by the outer courts have noted the same. “We can’t police what happens outside in the park,” one said. “You catch a whiff on every corner. Around here, it’s just normal.” For all the gripes, the rules are clear: within the gates, smoking of any kind, including weed pens, is banned. Beyond them, the USTA has no jurisdiction.Fans, too, seem largely unfazed. Steven Lewis, waiting in line for a Court 17 match on Monday afternoon, waved off the complaints. “You can smell it walking down the street in Midtown, sometimes at eight in the morning on a weekday, and it was the same even before it was legalized,” he said. “It’s just a part of New York. I don’t see why the Open would be any different.”Indeed, part of the intrigue here is cultural. The Open has always leaned into its identity as tennis’s loudest, least buttoned-up major. For players more accustomed to the hushed lawns of Wimbledon or at Roland Garros – where there is a total ban on alcohol in the stands to ensure a respectful atmosphere during play – it can feel like sensory overload. For locals, it’s just the city in microcosm.Legal marijuana is now embedded in New York life. That reality sits uneasily against the prim image tennis still projects, but the contradictions are unavoidable at a tournament staged in the heart of Queens. As Ruud lamented, even before Wednesday’s second-round loss on the hash court, there may be little recourse beyond plugging one’s nose and focusing on the next point. Some players thrive in it and others recoil. Either way, the Open keeps rolling.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS Open tennisUS sportsNew YorkCannabisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If she plays in her homeland it doesn’t mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.”She added: “In the beginning of the match all players are supposed to start warm up on the baseline. The opponent came out and straight away started the warm up [at the net] which is very disrespectful and against the rules of a tennis match.”For her part, Townsend said Ostapenko had insulted her at the post-match handshake. “She told me I have no class, no education, and to see what happens when we get outside the US,” Townsend said. “I’m looking forward to it. I beat her in Canada outside the US. So let’s see what else she has to say.”Townsend, a world No 1 in doubles but currently ranked outside the top 100 in singles, suggested the No 25 seed Ostapenko was angry at the upset. “I mean, it’s competition,” Townsend said. “People get upset when they lose.”In her post-match press conference Townsend, who is Black, would not be drawn on whether there was a racial component to Ostapenko’s comments.“That’s something you’re going to have to ask her,” said Townsend. “I didn’t take it in that way but also that has been a stigma in [the Black] community of being not educated ... when it’s the furthest thing from the truth. So whether it had racial undertones or not, that’s something she can speak on. The only thing that I’m worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament.”Ostapenko later denied any allegations of racism. “I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world. For me it doesn’t matter where you come from,” she said in a social media post. She also wrote about “how many messages I received that I am a racist.”Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open champion, has riled opponents in the past. At Wimbledon in 2021, Ajla Tomljanovicaccused the Latvianof pretending to be injured when she requested a medical timeout. Ostapenko went on to call the Australian “the worst player on tour”.Townsend will play No 5 seed Mirra Andreeva in the third-round.Explore more on these topicsUS Open tennisUS sportsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The fee includes £5m of add-ons.Germany’s ‘Big Nick’ Woltemade brings nicknames and goals to main stageRead moreHis arrival would end Eddie Howe’s long search for a striker. After being rejected by, among others, Liam Delap, Hugo Ekitiké, João Pedro and Benjamin Sesko during a close season blemished by Isak’s decision to go on strike as the forwardattempts to force a move to Anfield, this breakthrough will come as a huge relief to Newcastle’s manager.It should also almost certainly preface a fresh bid from Liverpool for Isak. Newcastle haverebuffed one £110m offerfrom the Premier League champions but, given the Swede’s refusal to return to training or playing, it is thought a sum nearer £130m may be sufficient.With Callum Wilson having joined West Ham and deep uncertainty surrounding Isak, Howe remains in the market for two strikers. This week Newcastle had a second, £55m bid rejected for Wolves’ Jørgen Strand Larsen and it appears unlikely the Norway international will be allowed to leave.Negotiations for Brentford’s DR Congo striker Yoane Wissa remain ongoing but have proved complicated with Newcastle having at least two bids turned down for a player who appears to be intent on a transfer to St James’ Park.Although an element of doubt surrounds the precise figure Newcastle are paying for Woltemade, it will be a club record fee, eclipsing the £63m invested in recruiting Isak from Real Sociedad three years ago.Howe will be particularly delighted with another figure. Having wanted to add real height to his already physically powerful team, he has now acquired a deceptively skilful 6ft 6in centre-forward dubbed a “Two metre Messi-Musiala” by Stuttgart fans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di María have left United for a higher price. Due to the ­winger’s wish to leave, United view the deal as a positive step. Garnacho scored 26 goals in 144 appearances for United after joining the academy setup from Atlético Madrid in 2020 for around £400,000.While Garnacho is heading to Stamford Bridge, Christopher Nkunku is moving away, withMilanpoised to sign the forward for a package worth €42m (£36.2m). The deal contains a sell-on clause for the France international, who has agreed personal terms with the Serie A club.Chelsea are also interested in ­Barcelona’s Fermín López and RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons. Tottenham, however, have held talks with Leipzig over Simons, who flew to London on Wednesday, and are primed to make a bid. Spurs are determined to sign a No 10 after failing with moves for Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze – and with James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski out with long-term injuries. They hope to close a deal for Simons, who Leipzig are keen to sell as they restructure their squad.Leipzig value Simons at €70m (£60.5m), although they may accept a little less because time is tight before Monday’s deadline and they want to push ahead with a bid for Liverpool’s Harvey ­Elliott. He remains close to Jürgen Klopp, the former Liverpool manager, who is the head of football at Red Bull.Quick GuideArsenal's Havertz has minor surgery on kneeShowHavertz has minor surgeryKai Havertz has had minor surgery to fix a wear-and-tear-related issue in his knee. The Arsenal forward played in his club’s opening game at Manchester United and reported pain after it, at which point it was decided he had to rest or have surgery. The latter course of action has  been chosen.The initial signs were that the problem was not  serious, rather a natural consequence of playing so many minutes at the highest level for almost a decade. The 26-year-old broke through at Bayern Leverkusen in 2016-17.Havertz sustained his first major injury setback last February when he damaged a hamstring and was out for three months. His absence this time is not expected to be long term. An Arsenal statement read: “Today, Kai underwent a successful minor surgical procedure. He will shortly begin his recovery and rehabilitation programme, with everyone fully focused on supporting Kai to ensure he is back to full fitness as soon as possible.”David HytnerWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Spurs had a conversation about Simons earlier in the summer but at the time his representatives indicated that if he left Leipzig he would only want to join Chelsea, who had made inquiries. It is understood Chelsea wanted to include one of their players in any move for Simons but this did not appeal to Leipzig, with most of them too expensive in terms of wages.Leipzig have sought to cap the basic annual salaries of their new signings at €5m, albeit they can earn more via performance-related add-ons. Simons is the club’s top earner on a basic €11m a year.View image in fullscreenChristopher Nkunku is moving on to Milan from Chelsea for £36.2m.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APLeipzig were one of the teams pushing for Nkunku, who left the Bundesliga side for £52m in 2023. The 27-year-old has struggled for form and fitness at Chelsea. He picked up a knee injury during his first pre-season ­and was unable to build momentum.

After being denied entry into the Europa League by Uefa, a gritty defensive performance that equalled a club record of 13 matches unbeaten in all competitions while playing in the top flight ensured that they will take their place in Friday’s draw for theConference League.Champions League draw: Alexander-Arnold primed for swift Liverpool reunionRead moreMore than 1,700 made the journey from south London to Fredrikstad on an occasion many Palace supporters had never thought would become a reality. There were times when they would have feared that the club’s first away match in a major European competition may also end in disappointment as Andreas Hagen’s side piled on the pressureafter their narrow defeat in the first leg.But it was Oliver Glasner, who said that he is expecting more clarity on captain Marc Guéhi’s future after he put in another outstanding performance on what could be his final appearance for the club, who was able to mark his 51st birthday by giving the Palace fans at least another three trips to look forward to. “It’s a huge achievement to get to the group stage,” said Glasner. “With all the noise of being demoted to the Conference League and against opposition who were not easy to play – there were so many long balls but the players did really well. It’s big forCrystal Palace.”Ever meticulous in his preparations, the Palace manager had made sure his squad were given an opportunity to train on Fredrikstad’s artificial pitch 24 hours before kickoff, with Adam Wharton saying it was a difficult surface to play on. So it proved as the Norwegian Cup winners came close to forcing the game into extra-time when substitute Henrik Skogvold volleyed over in injury time after piling on the pressure with a series of set pieces.Glasner, who arrived in Norway with only 14 fit outfield players available after Will Hughes and Odsonne Édouard were ruled out, had suggested last week he might be forced to bring his boots for the second leg if his captain was sold to Liverpool. Asked before kick-off whether there had ever been any doubt that the 25-year-old England defender would play, the manager appeared to suggest developments on Guéhi’s future are anticipated once this fixture was out of the way.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta, who scored the winner in the first leg, had a late chance to confirm Palace’s victory.Photograph: Sebastian Frej/Getty Images“It’s very important,” he said. “I’m speaking to Marc almost every day and it was clear he would play this game in Norway and then let’s see what will come. But I know that I can rely on Marc and we can count on him.”Palace are understood to be working hard on bringing in a replacement for Guéhi before Monday’s transfer deadline but, even if he stays to see out the final year of his contract, they will need to add much more depth to the squad if they are to go all the way to May’s final in Leipzig.Quick GuideBesiktas sack Solskjær after eliminationShowBesiktas have sacked the former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær after they were knocked out of the Conference League play-offs by Lausanne.Besiktas were beaten 1-0 at home by the INEOS-owned Lausanne on Thursday night, with the former Arsenal striker Nathan Butler-Oyedeji scoring the only goal in first-half stoppage-time before Besiktas had Felix Uduokhai sent off early in the second half, giving Lausanne a 2-1 aggregate win.A Besiktas statement said: \"Our contract with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær has been terminated following a decision made at the board meeting. Following the meeting, our chairman, Serdal Adali, thanked Solskjær for his services to date.\"The Norwegian took charge of the Super Lig club in January - his first coaching role since leaving United in November 2021 - and guided them to fourth by the end of last season.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Fredrikstad were given the weekend off to prepare for the second leg after their spirited performance at Selhurst Park last week and looked much more intent on attacking in front of their home supporters. They have endured a disappointing second campaign in the top flight having won the Norwegian Cup last season and knew any chance of salvaging something from their season relied on them producing an upset.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Palace were not to be denied.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

It marks a sharp contrast from the mood 12 months ago and a troubled first half of the last campaign, when their threadbare squad was stretched, their serious injury list was mounting and the wider club was waiting agonisingly for news of a takeover.Everton transfer ownership of Goodison Park to their women’s teamRead moreAmid that uncertainty and what was – at the time – a low budget, some were tipping Everton for relegation and the team had to wait until 17 November for their first league victory. But once they had won that Merseyside derby their confidence soared and the morale-boosting acquisition of the club by The Friedkin Group not only gave the players a lift but ensured there were funds to spend in January, and they enjoyed a much-improved second half of the season to finish a comfortable 14 points clear of the relegation zone in a respectable eighth place.Everton have strengthened their squad markedly this summer with some eye-catching signings, not least the arrival of three Japan internationals – the forward Yuka Momiki, full-back Hikaru Kitagawa and centre-back Rion Ishikawa – and their fans will be looking forward to welcoming back some longer-term knee-injury absentees from last season, such as the Spain forward Inma Gabarro, who has been in impressive form during pre-season after missing almost all of last term with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.Nobody should be getting too carried away – Everton have not suddenly become a team who will challenge for the league – but equally there is no reason for the club to fear the drop. A top-half finish is a realistic aim and they will certainly want to improve on last season.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerBrian Sørensen, the second-longest-serving manager in the division behind Manchester United’s Marc Skinner, has been in charge since the summer of 2022 and is entering his fourth season. In April he signed a new deal until 2027. The Dane spent large parts of last season looking thoroughly dejected about Everton’s injury problems but he has a healthier squad and will surely have enjoyed the team’s pre-season trip to his homeland. Sørensen is a relatively quiet, family man with a good reputation for his style of football and it will be interesting to see what he can achieve with better resources.Off-field pictureThe Friedkin Group has reinvigorated the mood around the women’s team and there has been a significant uplift in the number of off-field staff. The biggest change, however, came with the historic move to make Goodison Park the women’s team’s new home. That not only ensured the 133-year-old ground was saved but dramatically improves the women’s team’s matchday facilities compared with their former base at Walton Hall Park, which had the league’s smallest capacity at just over 2,000.Last season’s resultsStar signingThere is a lot of excitement concerning the Spain youth international winger Ornella Vignola, who has arrived from Granada. The former Barcelona youngster caught Everton’s eye because she likes to take defenders on and her direct running should offer the club’s attack a new dimension. She has plenty of experience for a 20-year-old, including playing in the Champions League, and was part of the Spain squad that won the Under-20 World Cup alongside Gabarro in 2022. Everton’s loan acquisition of Katie Robinson from Aston Villa will give them another skilful option in wide areas.Stepping upNearly 18 months ago Issy Hobson grabbed the headlines by becoming the WSL’s youngest goalscorer at the age of 16 with alast-gasp equaliser against Arsenal. The defender, now 17, gained valuable experience in the second tier during a loan with Sheffield United last term and it will be intriguing to see how much the England youth international can push on this season and how much more first-team exposure she can gain. There are also high hopes for Everton’s young player of last season, Martina Fernández, who made her switch from Barcelona permanent this summer after a loan.View image in fullscreenIssy Hobson celebrates the goal that made her the youngest ever goalscorer in the WSL.Photograph: Emma Simpson/EFC/Getty ImagesIt was a good summer for …The Everton winger Toni Payne was part of the Nigeria side that triumphed in Morocco by winning the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations title, extending their record as the continent’s most successful team withtheir 10th title, and their first in seven years. Payne received a rapturous reception from her club-mates when she returned for pre-season after her country’s 3-2 victory over the hosts in the final. The 30-year-old appeared in all 22 of Everton’s league fixtures last term and will be a key player againwith her pace and strong ball control.Main initiative to attract more fansView image in fullscreenGoodison Park, which is now the home of Everton’s women’s team.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAAs well as making Goodison Park their main home ground, Everton’s women are playing a fixture at the club’s new Hill Dickinson Stadium on the banks of the River Mersey. They will host Manchester United at the 52,000-capacity venue on 12 October, hoping to attract more fans to support the women’s side. They are also attempting to boost the region’s grassroots prospects by letting out their former home, Walton Hall Park, to the third-tier club Liverpool Feds.Explore more on these topicsWSL season previews 2025-26Everton WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is no problem for Tuchel, who is a massive music fan. But what theEnglandmanager will be acutely aware of is the need to get his own show on the road.‘We get nothing’: residents fight back as Mexico builds big for 2026 World CupRead moreWhere are we with Tuchel’s England gig? The top line from the previous get-together in June was provided by the soundtrack of boos. They came from the travelling fans at half-time and full-time in the lacklustre1-0 win over Andorrain Barcelona and there were more when the final whistle went on the3-1 friendly defeat against Senegalat the City Ground.Tuchel’s team did show some zip and personality in the final 25 minutes against Senegal before Cheikh Sabaly’s clinching goal in the 93rd minute. Tuchel had Eberechi Eze playing off Morgan Rogers up front, Noni Madueke on the right, Morgan Gibbs-White on the left andJude Bellinghamin a deeper-than-normal midfield role.It was probably the most exciting spell of football under Tuchel, partly because there had not been much to quicken the pulse in his first camp in March which contained the Wembley wins over Albania and Latvia – solid and controlled performances, if unspectacular. That said, England were distinctly second-best against Senegal until the 65th minute when they trailed 2-1 and Tuchel was exasperated and bemused after it all. Where was the joy of wearing the shirt?There is an argument that the autumn programme will be more beneficial to Tuchel. England face Wales in a Wembley friendly and travel to Latvia in October; they have Serbia (home) and Albania (away) in November. With the matches coming thicker and faster, he will have greater opportunity to build the rhythms he craves, even if it does re-raise an awkward question. Could the FA not have brought in Tuchel this time last year instead of relying on the interim manager, Lee Carsley, for the first half of the season?View image in fullscreenEngland’s friendly defeat by Senegal in June lingers in the memory.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersTuchel has worked hard to stay in touch with the players and has been around the grounds this season. On the Premier League’s opening weekend, he attended Aston Villa v Newcastle and Wolves v Manchester City on the Saturday before going to Manchester United v Arsenal on the Sunday. On game-week two, he took in West Ham v Chelsea on the Friday, Brentford v Villa on the Saturday and Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest on the Sunday.After United v Arsenal, Tuchel was seen chatting to Luke Shaw and Mason Mount in the Old Trafford tunnel. Could either return to the squad? Both have looked sharp, despite United’s poor start. Shaw’s case carries extra significance given the well-documented issues at left-back. Myles Lewis-Skelly has lost his starting place at Arsenal to Riccardo Calafiori. Newcastle’s Tino Livramento is in contention. The wider point is that talking is one thing; there is no substitute for getting out on the grass to work.Tuchel will surely have a view on a statistic from the first game-week. Only 77 of those to feature were eligible for England – a record opening weekend low, down from 93 the year before. Of the 77, 54 were starters, representing less than a quarter of the 220 players.Tuchel is unlikely to experiment with first-time call-ups, rather to concentrate on fine-tuning what he has already seen. There are only four camps to go before the World Cup next summer. Furthermore, because these ties come so early in the season, he has little evidence to make the case for recalls. Jack Grealish played well on his full debut for Everton against Brighton last Sunday, setting up both the goals ina 2-0 win. Is it enough?The spotlight will also pick outMarcus Rashford, who missed the June internationals because of injury and is making his way at Barcelona. On the face of it, the forward has not done much in his two La Liga appearances and was substituted at half-time against Levante last Saturday with his team 2-0 down. They came back to win 3-2. But that was more because Hansi Flick tried a new attacking formation that did not work. He went back to normal for the second half. It was not Rashford’s fault. Tuchel selected Rashford in March. He believes in him.View image in fullscreenWill Barcelona’s Marcus Rashford earn a recall?Photograph: Alberto Saiz/APTuchel must make do without the usual clutch of injured players. Levi Colwill, Bukayo Saka and Bellingham are out; Cole Palmer is a major doubt and so is Ben White, who has been touted for a long-awaited comeback. Phil Foden returned as a late substitute for City against Tottenham only last Saturday after an ankle knock in pre-season. How Tuchel uses him remains a fascination.At the back, Tuchel will be able to select John Stones for the first time after the City centre-half missed the closing months of last season through injury and Marc Guéhi is available after sitting out the June fixtures with an eye problem. Harry Maguire’s ship seems to have sailed and what about Kyle Walker, now at Burnley, who endured such a torrid game against Senegal?England have not played in Serbia at senior level since 1987 when Sir Bobby Robson’s team beat Yugoslavia 4-1 to secure their place at the European Championship finals. The goals from Peter Beardsley, John Barnes, Bryan Robson and Tony Adams came inside the opening 25 minutes and the Rajko Mitic Stadium, then known as the Stadion Crvena Zvezda and still commonly as Marakana, was stunned. It will pulse to its usual intimidating beat when England return for what is plainly their most difficult assignment of qualification. The real business is afoot.Explore more on these topicsEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersThomas TuchelMarcus RashfordJude BellinghamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a place in flux, a mixture of building sites contrasted against perfect pitches and other areas that have benefited from the first waves of investment by the club’s billionaire owner, Michele Kang.Keeping up with the team’s incomings and outgoings is as hard as tracking the movement of rubble on site: the arrival of Alanna Kennedy and Katie Zelem from Angel City on Wednesday added to the other 12 new players who have already filed through the doors this summer. London City mean business on their arrival in the Women’s Super League.Saki Kumagai, the five-times Champions League winner, is one of the few to remain, having been a critical part of phase one of the project, which was to win the WSL2 and promotion. The 34-year-old joined London City from Roma in January and, despite having played in Italy, Germany and France across her 14-years in Europe, the Japan international says winning the WSL2 was perhaps the hardest title to win.“Yes it was the Championship, the second tier, but it’s actually the league I’ve felt has been the most difficult to win,” she says. “Only one team can be promoted and the nature of the league and the teams in it means you’re not going to necessarily dominate every game. It’s quite transitional football and there are lots of incidents in the games, it’s very stop-start, so it’s not easy to control games.“At that level you just need to win, it doesn’t have to be the perfect game or most beautiful. The key for us was winning the Championship and winning promotion to the WSL. That was our objective. So we worked game by game and point by point.”It went down to the wire in May, with London City surviving a late rally against Birmingham, a point enough in a 2-2 draw to earn promotion ahead of their opponents. “The last game of the season was huge, for both us and Birmingham and it was an amazing atmosphere, but we just focused on the game and the job we needed to do,” says Kumagai. “I told my teammates before the game: ‘Whatever happens happens, we just have to do our jobs and then we’ll see where we are afterwards.’ You need a strong mentality to compete in the Championship.”View image in fullscreenSaki Kumagai in action for Japan. Making the transition to playing in Europe was not easy, the 34-year-old says.Photograph: Maria Lysaker/Getty ImagesKumagai, who won league titles with Lyon, Bayern Munich and Roma, had initially resisted joining the Kang empire. “The club approached me last year but I didn’t think about it, or the possibility of moving during the winter break,” she says.“I was at Roma and so I initially said no, but then they approached me again and I had six months left on my contract and it was a new challenge, a big challenge. I’d not played in England, or the Championship, and I already knew the Italian league by that point. I liked the club’s ambitions, it was interesting, so I decided to come. The last six months were not easy, but fortunately we could win the Championship and promotion to the WSL, so maybe my decision was correct.”Comparing the leagues is difficult for the Sapporo-born player. “Each country, of course, is different. I have played in Europe for 14 years and every country has grown in that time, in terms of women’s football,” she says. “Obviously in England it’s changed a lot too, helped by them winning the Euros twice. So, it’s hard for me to compare when they are all changing all the time. The gap from when I first came to Europe to now is very big.”There are a growing number of Japanese players in the WSL. “It means they get to play with and against non-Japanese players, that helps prepare us for facing players we will meet with the national team,” says Kumagai. “Of course everything is different in England and English football and Japanese football are different. When we come to play in England or Europe we have to work out how to play, how to manage ourselves, how to be on the ball and improve as individuals. In the beginning that isn’t easy.”As the most-decorated Japanese player to have played in Europe, Kumagai is a trailblazer. Of the legacy she wants to leave, though, she is unsure. “I don’t know,” she says. “A lot of Japanese players and Japanese girls want to play in Europe or in England, and if I’m able to show them that that is possible at the top level and they want to be like me, then that makes me so happy.”Now London City have reached the WSL, what’s the next goal? “When I came here, I knew the first six months would be all about winning promotion to the WSL, so I would also think beyond that about next season and what it takes to play in the WSL,” she says.“The objective changes now, of course, but for us it’s not about staying in the WSL, though of course we want to, but it’s about pushing towards that top three or four so the following season we can start pushing for Champions League qualification. We have potential to do that, we have to keep improving but we have the quality.”Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.comThis is an extract from our free email, Moving the Goalposts.

The test has also been approved by World Boxing when it introduced mandatory sex testing for all boxers.Coe acknowledged that some competitors had struggled to get tested, with CBC in Canada quoting an unnamed athlete saying they had to drive five hours to get a test. But he said that such cases were unusual, and those who hadn’t yet been tested would have the cheek-swab test when they arrived in Japan.“By and large the process has gone pretty smoothly, but it’s not been without its challenges,” he said. “France has its own national laws around it, so many of their athletes have been tested outside of the country. And those that haven’t been yet will be tested in their holding camps in Japan. But the vast majority have been pretty straightforward.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsSebastian CoenewsShareReuse this content"

With 40km left, the relaxed peloton trailed by more than six minutes, and while they later began to eat into the gap, it was too late to haul in the riders out in front.View image in fullscreenNorway’s Torstein Traeen attacked near the end of stage six and his second place earned him the overall lead in the Vuelta.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesVine was again first when they topped La Comella, and the Australian pushed ahead on the descent, pulling further away on the final climb to the finish and never looked like getting caught.“I know these roads pretty well. I’m from just down the hill, and La Comella is my favourite climb in all of Andorra,” Vine said. “I decided to go at the top and with the wet descent, I know the descent really well and I thought, ‘OK, this is my chance to get away and then there’s no funny business’.”With riders such as Armirail, Fortunato and Louis Vervaeke threatening Traeen’s red jersey bid, the 30-year-old Norwegian, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer three years ago, launched his own attack.The race continues in the mountains for Friday’s stage seven, taking the riders 188km from Andorra la Vella to another category one climb to the finish at Cerler.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

So I think just remembering that we love what we do. We’re all in this together and yeah, we’re trying to have some fun.”The seven-time champion’s car has been off the pace and the process of adapting to Ferrari after 12 years with Mercedes has proved no little task, which had appeared to reach something of a nadir at the last round in Hungary. However after a summer break during which Hamilton said he had unplugged and had a chance to “reset”, he has been able to put the intensity and attendant scrutiny of his start at Ferrari behind him.“The reason I got into this sport, it was fun for me,” he said. “For anyone in whatever career you’re in, if you’re not enjoying what you’re doing, then why are you doing it? There can often be so much noise you can lose sight of what’s really, really important. I just really want to focus on getting back to that enjoyment.“I joined the team that I’ve always dreamed of driving for and there’s been so much noise around that it’s kind of clouded us from from getting to enjoy it.”Hamilton is currently sixth in the drivers championship and has gone 16 meetings without a podium, the longest streak off the top steps of his career. He qualified in 12th in Budapest, a result he decried as“absolutely useless”and stated that perhaps Ferrari should find another driver. After the race he alluded to “a lot going on in the background that is not great”.However in Zandvoort he was insistent that he had always faced challenges in his career and was confident he and Ferrari would overcome their current travails.“I never just got in and just won, there were always difficult times,” he said. “I’m the type of person that doesn’t like to get complacent and be comfortable and that’s really kind of where I was for the long-term relationship I had before.”“Taking this step into a team that I truly believe in and I still believe in the potential here and what we can achieve together and everyone in the team does so. But no one succeeds without going through those tough patches so I do welcome it.”Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFerrariFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this month, she won six matches en route to her first WTA 1000 final since giving birth to her daughter, Shai, and thenreturning from maternity leavein January 2024.Raducanu’s upbeat year offers another chance to test herself against the bestRead moreWhat should have been a significant, long-awaited breakthrough for Osaka turned into a painful evening aftershe fell apart in the final against Victoria Mbokoand then was widely criticised for failing to congratulate the 18-year-old in her runner-up speech. Osaka said she contacted Mboko afterwards, who told her she did not notice Osaka’s omission.Instead of positively reflecting on her excellent performances, Osaka said she spent the days after Montreal processing her guilt. “I just felt really bad and, like, shame,” she said. “I think I felt worse for my team, because we couldn’t really celebrate properly. They were with me this entire time, so they knew how big of a deal the final was.”While many thought those difficulties could have halted Osaka’s momentum on the court, she has performed well in her two matches this week, striking the ball cleanly while showcasing her improved movement. She has now won eight of her last nine matches since hiring Tomasz Wiktorowski, the former coach of Iga Swiatek. She will face either Daria Kasatkina, the 15th seed, or Kamilla Rakhimova as she attempts to reach the fourth round of a grand slam tournament for the first time since winning the Australian Open title in 2021.After her match, Osaka also waded into the debate overJelena Ostapenko’s comments towards Taylor Townsendafter the contentious end to their match on Wednesday. Townsend did not apologise after a fortunate net cord, prompting Ostapenko to accuse her of having “no education” and “no class”.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner eased into the third round with a comfortable straight-sets win over Australian Alexei Popyrin.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesOsaka said: “It’s really difficult to say, I think obviously it’s one of the worst things you can say to a black tennis player in a majority white sport. And granted, I know Taylor and I know how hard she’s worked and I know how smart she is, so she’s the furthest thing from uneducated or anything like that.“But if you’re genuinely asking me about the history of Ostapenko, I don’t think that’s the craziest thing she’s said. I’m going to be honest. I think it’s ill timing and the worst person you could have ever said it to. And I don’t know if she knows the history of it in America.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Cowboys have held firm that Parsons is under contract and should be on the field now and during the 2025 regular season if he wants to address a long-term deal.Nate Landman on life as an African NFL player: ‘People don’t believe me at first’Read moreParsons played the first four years of his career with the Cowboys. This season, he’s on the fifth-year option in his rookie contract worth $21.3m in 2025. He reportedly filed a grievance earlier this year, arguing he should be viewed as a linebacker – not a defensive end. The option salary for a linebacker is $24m.Jones, who made clear he prefers to talk contracts directly with his players and not their agents, stated publicly that he and Parsons agreed to the parameters of a deal in the spring. ESPN pegged the terms of the five-year extension at an average of $40.5m per season.The highest-paid defensive player in terms of average annual value is Steelers pass rusher T.J. Watt ($41m). Browns defensive end Myles Garrett signed a new deal earlier this year to increase his annual average pay to $40m.A premium on proven pass rushers guarantees the asking price for the 26-year-old Parsons will be astronomical. The closest scenario in recent years brought outside linebacker Khalil Mack to the Chicago Bears in a 2018 trade that fetched the Raiders a treasure trove of draft picks: a pair of first-rounders, a third-round pick and a sixth-rounder. The Bears received Mack, then 27, a second-round pick and a conditional draft pick before signing him to a six-year contract worth $141m.Beyond the team-exercised and fully guaranteed contract option for 2025, the Collective Bargaining Agreement allows Jones and the Cowboys to use the franchise tag in successive years (2026, 2027), which is the fine print behind Jones’ math that Parsons is under team control for the next three years.Parsons appears to have soured on the idea of playing in Dallas during a tumultuous month with his only pro football employer to date. On 1 August, Parsons posted a statement to social media that he “stayed quiet but again after repeated shots at myself and all the narratives I have made a tough decision I no longer want to play for theDallas Cowboys.”More recently, he eliminated references and images containing the Cowboys and their logo from his social media accounts.Parsons’ profiles in his Twitter and Instagram pages both tout his Penn State background with a “TBD” now in place of the Cowboys as his employer. And on TikTok, he posted a video that contained a photo gallery of Parsons, in his Cowboys uniform, that contained game photos that could have been taken as the All-Pro both waving goodbye and blowing kisses.In the background played the audio of words once spoken by retired NBA great Allen Iverson as he discussed trade rumors:“Imma win wherever I go,” Iverson is heard saying. “Wherever I go, imma win. I don’t care where I go. I don’t give a damn what team I go to, imma win. Imma win regardless, it don’t matter.”Explore more on these topicsDallas CowboysNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not only was she trying to take steps forward after a life-changing summer, her off-season had been ravaged by contracting Covid-19, which forced her off the court for weeks in December. In her first match of the season, she found herself up against Elena Rybakina in Sydney. She left the court with just one game to her name, losing 6-0, 6-1.That first encounter between Raducanu and Rybakina was a good representation of the difficulties Raducanu has had to navigate over the past few years: the pressure from her sudden rise, her underpowered game against the best players in the world and the fact that there was always another physical issue around the corner.Raducanu thrashes Ena Shibahara for first US Open victory since 2021 titleRead moreAs she faces the Kazakh again on Friday, the British No 1’s form underscores the consistent progress she has finally made in recent months. Raducanu has lost only six games in her first two matches at the US Open against Ena Shibahara and Janice Tjen and is playing quality tennis, serving confidently and pressuring her opponents by taking the ball early and forcing herself inside the baseline.However, her two opponents were qualifiers who have never broken the top 100. Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, represents an enormous step up in quality and class. The 26-year-old is the best server in the women’s game, leading the tour in service games won, service points won and aces. She backs up that with some of the cleanest groundstrokes in the sport, generating easy pace off both wings. As she showed with her demolition of Aryna Sabalenka two weeks ago in Cincinnati, nobody is safe from being hit off the court when Rybakina is in full flow.Raducanu’s decision to hire Francisco Roig as her new coach was rooted in trying to improve her game in order to be better equipped to counter the elite players and biggest ball strikers, having lost to Sabalenka in Cincinnati and Wimbledon. Now she will have another chance to measure her progress.“I do want to see how my game suits and fits against the top,” said Raducanu. “I still think I have a long way to go, but I think I have been making steps towards getting closer and narrowing that gap. I think I have to take confidence from my matches against Aryna in Cincy and Wimby.”View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie will play Novak Djokovic in a grand slam for the second time this year.Photograph: Ella Ling/ShutterstockAs Raducanu tackles one of the toughest opponents in this year’s women’s draw, Cameron Norrie finds himself up against the greatest player in any men’s draw. Just a few months after their meeting in the fourth round of the French Open, Norrie faces Novak Djokovic for a seventh time.This has been an eventful summer for Norrie, who returned to his favourite surface during the North American hard-court swing hopeful that his excellent quarter-final run at Wimbledon would propel him to greater heights, but he instead struggled with his physical condition in the heat. While his durability has long been one of his biggest assets, for once it was a problem.Norrie addressed those issues with a tough pre-US Open training block in the brutal heat at Texas Christian University, his alma mater, and he has performed well in New York. At the end of a tense, attritional four-hour match against Francisco Comesaña on Wednesday, he managed his nerves well and found a way to close out the match to reach the third round.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Norrie should head into this match believing that this is his best opportunity to push him to the limit.“I will say the chances are getting better as the years get on, but I would not say by much,” said Norrie. “But the level he brings, the competitiveness he brings is crazy. Every time I’ve played him, he’s changing his tactics and making it really difficult for me to play. So I’m just ready for anything. Him to play unreal. Him to play not great. Him to be stopping the match for something and then playing really good. I think he’s so, so good at competing and tactics. He’s amazing. So I’m going to have to be ready for anything and I want to just beat him with tennis and physicality.”Djokovic has not competed since Wimbledon after opting to prioritise his time with his family and his suboptimal preparation has clearly played a part in his two unimpressive wins over Learner Tien and Zachary Svajda.Djokovic struggled physically in his first-round match against Tien, who repeatedly dragged him into long, attritional exchanges, and emerged from them in far better condition. While Norrie will attempt to exploit the 38-year-old’s waning physicality even more effectively than those before him, it remains to be seen if Djokovic will allow him to get close.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisEmma RaducanuTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "TechnologyHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA companyAntonio Gracias is part of the growing movement among Silicon Valley’s right wing enamored with the therapeutic and commercial potential of drugs like MDMANick Robins-EarlyThu 28 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 15.26 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Angelica Alzona/Guardian Design; Images via Getty Images/AlamyMonths before Antonio Gracias took a leading role in the dismantling of the federal government by the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), he was at Burning Man.In the dusty Nevada desert, Gracias, a billionaire private equity investor and one ofElon Musk’s closest friends, attended Nova Heaven, a sunrise rave tribute to victims of the Hamas-led 7 October terrorist attack, and found himself dancing next to Rick Doblin – the US’s most prominent advocate for psychedelic drugs.As hundreds of burners shuffled their sandy feet to psytrance music, Gracias started up a conversation. He had a piece of business advice.Doblin, 71 with an avuncular smile and tranquil, confident demeanor, is the founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps), and has spent decades trying to legalize drugs such as MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, for use in the treatment of trauma.Once mostly viewed as a party drug, medical researchers and advocates have seenpromising resultswhen using MDMA as a therapy aid. Gracias is a believer. Hegave Maps $1min 2020 and poured another $16m into funding psychedelics research at Harvard in 2023. Although his usual billionaire-casual attire would look more at home on Shark Tank than at a rave, he is part of a growing movement among Silicon Valley’s right wing that has become enamored with the potential – both therapeutic and commercial – of consciousness-altering drugs.Earlier that year, the pharmaceutical arm of Maps, a for-profit public benefit corporation called Lykos Therapeutics, had raised $100m as it awaited a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision on whether to allow MDMA for psychotherapy treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Approval could turn Lykos into a multibillion-dollar pharma enterprise with exclusive US rights to sell the drug for therapeutic use for a period of six years.View image in fullscreenRick Doblin, the founder and president of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies.Photograph: Kylie Cooper/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesA few weeks before Burning Man, however,the FDA rejected the applicationover concerns about inadequate trial data. Doblin announced that he was exiting Lykos’s board, and the company laid off 75% of its staff. The business was in turmoil.On the playa – according to Doblin’s recounting of events – Gracias told him that the FDA’s rejection wasn’t his fault and blamed the company’s other leaders for the failure. Let Lykos go bust and start again with a clean slate, Gracias advised, before the two men parted ways in the desert.Weeks after their dancefloor meeting, Doblin reached out to Gracias with a proposition. The investors and board of Lykos were not going to let the company go bankrupt. Would Gracias consider launching a takeover bid and seizing operational control?As they corresponded about a potential plan, Doblin put Gracias in contact with the British hedge fund billionaire Christopher Hohn. By January, just before Gracias joined Doge, Gracias and Hohnwere working ona takeover of Lykos.At the end of May, Lykos confirmed in a brief statement on its website that foundations owned by Gracias and Hohn had led a $50m Series B funding round that recapitalized the business. The sparse post included few details of the deal, and years of previous news releases from Lykos no longer appeared on the company’s website. In the following weeks, Lykos appointed a new CEO and chief medical officer and remade the board of directors. Gracias and Hohn are now in control of the most prominent MDMA therapy company in the US. Gracias, Doblin said, is taking a hands-on role in its operations.“It was the magic of Burning Man,” Doblin said. “I was sort of looking for a white knight that would come in and would be more focused on healing and on public benefit.”Gracias’s new leadership of Lykos comes at a pivotal moment for psychedelics treatment in the US. Top Trump administration health officials, such as the secretary for health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, have said they are open to accelerating the use of psychedelic therapy while wealthy tech backers have moved to solidify control over the industry.But the takeover also highlights the ethical questions posed by Doge, even as its prominent leader, Musk, has left the government. Doge staffers like Gracias have received unprecedented access to US agencies, including their processes and staff. There have been few guardrails on their work, or the ways they leverage that access in their non-governmental lives. Just a few months ago, it was hard to imagine that an active government employee at an agency embedded across the government would assume control over a pharmaceutical company seeking FDA approval.“Maps and Gracias are going to try to seize the moment that we’re in,” said Ifetayo Harvey, a former Maps employee and executive director of the People of Color Psychedelic Collective. “I think the aim is to get MDMA-assisted psychotherapy approved by the FDA by any means necessary.”The Guardian reached out to Gracias via Lykos and his private equity firm with an interview request, a request for comment and a detailed list of questions. Neither Lykos nor the firm responded.Of drugs and DogeIn late July, a group of workers from the Service Employees International Union, the largest healthcare union in the US, marched down West Washington Boulevard in Chicago. They gathered outside the Valor Equity Partners investment firm, where Gracias is founder and CEO, to protest about his work with Doge, and what they see as its attacks on social security. At the front of the march, two demonstrators carried a banner with a message painted in bold white letters: “Antonio Gracias we will not forget your cruelty.”While Gracias was gaining control of Lykos, he had also been engaged in another power play, as a member of Doge, which shortly after Donald Trump’s inauguration hadbegun gutting federal agenciesand seizing control over government databases.Gracias arrived at Doge as a longtime friend and business associate of Musk, with a relationship going back more than two decades. He was an early investor in Tesla through Valor Equity Partners, and was on the board of the automaker from 2007 until 2021. He still serves on the board of SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company, and is an investor in Neuralink, Musk’s brain chip venture. Valor has reportedlybeen in talks with lenders to raise $12bnfor Musk’s xAI artificial intelligence firm. During Musk’s takeover and gutting of Twitter in 2022, Gracias acted as a mix of enforcer and proxy who tersely communicated Musk’s dictates to staff, according to the book Character Limit. Last year, he alsocontributed $1mto Musk’s America Pac effort to re-elect Trump.View image in fullscreenElon Musk speaks in Wisconsin with Antonio Gracias at his side on 30 March 2025.Photograph: Jamie Kelter Davis/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesGracias and Musk’s ties go beyond business. The two men have gone on multiple personal and family vacations together, including a trip to the magician David Copperfield’s Bahamas island,according to a depositionGracias gave in a 2023 court case. They have spent Christmas and other holidays together, and Gracias was a groomsman at the wedding of Musk’s brother Kimbal.Gracias and Musk have also taken illegal drugs together, witnessestold the Wall Street Journal. Multiplenews outletshavereported that Musk has himself used MDMA and psilocybin mushrooms, as well as recreationally used ketamine. Musk has stated that he has used prescription ketamine to treat depression, and has vehemently denied reports of drug use impairing his abilities.As one of Musk’s most prominent staffers at Doge, Gracias began working at the Social Security Administration (SSA) andled a taskforcethat involved accessing immigration data at the Department of Homeland Security. He appeared on stage alongside Musk in March to presentmisleading claims about immigrantsand public benefits, and then in April on the All-In podcastpromoted the conspiracytheory that Democrats were attempting to “import voters”, a favorite theory of Musk’s.Gracias claimed during his media appearances to be rooting out corruption at the SSA and specifically touted his efforts to uncover proof of immigrants illegally voting en masse. Yet the cases Gracias cited were hardly indicative of widespread malicious voter fraud,experts told NPR, such as a recently immigrated Ukrainian mother and daughter who told investigators they simply didn’t know they couldn’t vote.Gracias remained with Doge even after Musk’s very public breakup with Trump, withPolitico reportingthat he regularly visited the White House to meet with top officials such as the deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.Double-dipping with DogeGracias’s time in government ended in July, after his presence at Doge caught the attention of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest federation of unions. An AFL-CIOreport in Juneraised questions about Gracias’s fiduciary responsibilities as CEO of Valor as the private equity firm manages retirement plans for public employees such as teachers and municipal workers.“We noted Antonio Gracias appeared to be moonlighting for Doge when he’s supposed to be running Valor for the benefit of those pension plans,” said Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets for the AFL-CIO.The report cited flight records, which the Guardian has viewed, that showed Valor’s private jet made 23 trips from the Washington DC region between January and April – suggesting Gracias was spending a large amount of time at Doge. In late July, the American Federation of Teacherssent a letter to nine public pension fundsasking them to review the union’s investments with Valor, worth about $1.8bn.One week later, Gracias announced in a lengthy statement on X that he had already resigned from Doge on 4 July and denied claims he had abandoned his responsibilities.“I hope this is a moment where our compassion can be stronger than our anger,” he wrote.Valor Equity Partners did not respond to requests for comment on this article and a detailed set of questions.The pension fund controversy highlighted the ethical gray areas that Doge created, as some of its top staffers chose to pull double duty between public and private work. While Doge claimed to function with transparency, it has made public only a partial explanation of how its staffers accessed and used government data, as well as how their work may have informed their own future business endeavors. Doge’s broad mandate to reshape federal agencies allowed it to operate akin to a parallel government with little oversight or disclosure about its activities, ethics watchdogs and labor groups allege, and created larger concerns about what might constitute conflicts of interest for its staffers.“With the lack of transparency, it leaves us really grasping at what it even means to be Doge,” said Faith Williams, a policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, a non-profit watchdog group. “We have seen so many, if not outright conflicts of interest then potential for conflicts of interest, and if not outright corruption, potential for corruption.”That hazy dynamic raises questions about Gracias’s new leadership of Lykos, according to ethics experts, and what it might mean for a former Doge member to now be seeking regulatory approval. Although Gracias worked primarily with the SSA, Doge’s staffers havealso been embedded in the FDAand fired employees reviewing clinical trials for Musk’s Neuralink.Government ethics rules generally prohibit federal employees from representing private enterprises to agencies while working in government. There are also rules limiting how former employees can represent private interests even after they have left the government, in an effort to prevent workers from trying to seek favor for a future regulatory decision.“You can’t be greasing the wheels and then say, ‘OK, now I’m going to quit and go pursue that approval,’” said Cynthia Brown, senior ethics counsel at the non-profit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.Doblin denied that Gracias’s role at Doge posed any conflict of interest, saying that the billionaire did not work with the FDA. Lykos did not respond to questions related to Gracias’s work at Doge.Ecstatic expectations – dashedBefore the FDA rejected Lykos’s application, the psychedelics world had been riding high, anticipating that MDMA would soon be approved and behind it a slew of other treatments. Venture capitalists, politicians and wellness-minded celebrities had descended on the industry with a fervor, attending events such as Maps’ annual psychedelics conference in Denver, Colorado, in droves. Recent years featured speakers including future NFL hall of fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers, former Texas governor Rick Perry and former senator Kyrsten Sinema.View image in fullscreenAaron Rodgers speaks at a psychedelics conference in Denver in June 2023.Photograph: Helen H Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post/Getty ImagesThe 2024 application was the zenith of Doblin’s four-decade campaign to legalize MDMA for therapy purposes,part of his goalto reach “net zero trauma by 2070”. He founded Maps in 1986 on the premise that psychedelic drugs, which the US has long designated as illegal schedule 1 substances with a high potential for abuse, could have beneficial therapeutic uses and had been unfairly vilified, much like cannabis. The idea has gained significant scientific support, withpreliminary evidence from studiesshowing that MDMA therapy can reduce PTSD symptoms.Doblin has also suggested more grandiose and outre uses for MDMA therapy, such as conflict resolution between Israelis and Palestinians. Maps has meanwhile trained therapists in a wide range of countries, including conflict zones such as Ukraine, on how to conduct therapy with the drug.As Doblin sought out funding and support for Maps and Lykos over the past decade, former employees say he began looking tobroader circles of investors. They included advocates for military veterans interested in treating PTSD, big names in corporate finance and, controversially, theRepublican donor Rebekah Mercer.One method was to court investors with invitations to parties where drugs were being used, according to Harvey, the former Maps employee.“Definitely part of their fundraising strategy is ‘Meet rich people at Burning Man, do psychedelics with them and get Maps money,’” Harvey, who was Doblin’s executive assistant in 2015, said.Maps denied that it used drugs to as a means of drumming up investment.“MAPS conducts all fundraising activities with the highest integrity and maintains strict ethical boundaries in all donor relationships and fundraising activities. MAPS does not supply controlled substances at any events or gatherings, nor do we use substances as a fundraising tool or strategy,” Maps said in a statement.Doblin alsotold Business Insider last yearthat giving drugs to donors was “not common”.Psilocybin ValleyGracias’s takeover of Lykos adds to a constellation of venture capitalists and tech world elites who have invested heavily in psychedelics. Another major player alongside Lykos is Atai Life Sciences, which is testing a synthetic version of adrug secreted by a species of toad, andis backedby Peter Thiel’s VC firm.While the juxtaposition of investors known for companies such as Palantir or initiatives like Doge may seem incongruous with the wellness world’s pronouncements about psychedelics, it is actually a culmination of a symbiotic relationship that stretches back to at least the 1970s.“There’s been decades and decades of overlap between Silicon Valley and psychedelics,” said Brad Burge, founder of psychedelics PR firm Integration Communications and a former Maps marketing director. “It’s just new in this epoch to be seeing this level of funding from highly public people.”Gracias is not even the only member of Doge with ties to the psychedelics industry. Before joining the agency, Alexandra Beynon worked as head of engineering for her husband’s at-home ketamine therapy company Mindbloom. Dylan Beynon, who founded the company,posted on X that he had previously metwith Gracias to talk about an investment with Mindbloom, although no partnership materialized.Nor is Gracias the only member of Musk’s orbit to have donated to Maps. The former Tesla and SpaceX board member Steve Jurvetson, whothe Wall Street Journal reportedattended parties and consumed drugs with Musk, has also donated $2.6m to Maps through a non-profit he founded with his wife. In 2012, the non-profit organization that Musk founded with his brother Kimbal also directly donated $10,000 to Maps. The money went to funding the Temple of Whollyness at Burning Man, a complex wooden art sculpture that tech money helped build before it was ceremoniously burned down.A bump from TrumpGracias’s takeover of Lykos comes at a fortuitous time for the psychedelics industry, with the Trump administration andRepublican lawmakers embracing alternativedrugs as part of the “Make America healthy again” movement. Although the Biden administration was also open to the use of psychedelics therapy, experts say, some top Trump health officials have gone further, calling for accelerating and re-evaluating the FDA review process.“This line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting, and we are working very hard to make sure that that happens within 12 months,” Kennedy said during a House committee meeting in late June, adding that the FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, agreed that psychedelics were a promising treatment.Trump’s pick for surgeon general, Casey Means, haspraised using psilocybin mushroomsfor therapy as one of the most meaningful experiences of her life, much likeSteve Jobs. Her brother Calley Means, one of Kennedy’s top advisers, meanwhiletold Politico in Junethat the Republican party had become the “party of psychedelics research”.The new administration’s outlook is potentially good news for Lykos, which is still recovering after the FDA ruled that the clinical trials it published in 2021 and 2023 suffered from bias issues and did not meet standards. One concern from those reviewing the studies was the difficulty of a double-blind test, since it was obvious to participants who got MDMA and who did not.The FDA’s ruling required Lykos to conduct another phase 3 clinical trial, probably a years-long endeavor that could cost millions. The company sought to contest the findings, while some advocates, including Doblin,blamed the anti-corporate psychedelics groupPsymposia, accusing it of influencing the FDA against approval. Psymposia denied it was the sole reason for the FDA rejection.“The FDA rejected Lykos for flawed science, not because of Psymposia, and the public still deserves better than pseudoscientific therapy,” Psymposia said in a statement. “Gracias’ willingness to back a company rejected for safety failures while pushing disinformation at Doge suggests a consistent disregard for facts in pursuit of profit.”Other researchers took a middle ground, believing that while MDMA therapy showed promise, it wasn’t ready for prime time.“It’s very possible that MDMA is a safe and effective treatment under the right conditions,” said Mason Marks, lead of the Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation at Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center. “But I don’t think that was demonstrated adequately by the data, and there were a lot of question marks.”While Trump health officials project optimism, there is also wariness within the psychedelics industry that the new administration’s support for psychedelics therapy could risk politicizing the drugs or lead to a loosened scientific review of their safety and efficacy. Such a result could end up setting back the industry in the long run, some advocates argue.“If it’s politicized in that way, then what happens in the future when we have a differently politicized administration?” said Burge. “Are they going to be able to roll that back and cite that there wasn’t sufficient evidence, and that psychedelic therapies were only approved because this particular administration felt like doing so?”There’s little that would prevent the FDA under Kennedy and its new commissioner Makary from reversing the agency’s ruling against Lykos, Marks said. The FDA is not bound by its previous decision and has the power to request a less stringent follow-up trial, throw out its decision altogether or authorize a substance for emergency use. In June, the FDA also announced aCommissioner’s National Priority Voucher programthat would allow qualifying drug developers to shorten the agency’s review time from 10 to 12 months to one to two months.“I can’t really speak on the negotiations with the FDA,” Doblin said. “I hope that instead of a phase 3 study that the FDA may determine, I believe, that the data we gathered was valid.”Any rollback of the ruling, even a partial one, could carry extraordinary benefits for Lykos and Gracias."

That compared with 14,769 at the same point last year.New car registrations for BYD across Europe rose to 13,503 last month, compared with 4,151 a year earlier. BYD now has 1.2% market share, the ACEA found. Tesla’s share remains at 0.8%.Chinese car brands, which often have relatively cheaper models, have beenexpanding aggressively in Europe. BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time this spring, according to a report from the market research company JATO Dynamics.In the UK the government said on Thursday that the US car brandFordwould be the first manufacturer to receive the maximum £3,750 subsidy on two models: the Gen-E and the e-Tourneo Courier. A further 26 other models will be eligible for grants of £1,500 under the government’s new electric car grant scheme.The grants apply only to vehicles with a list price of £37,000 or below. The discount is applied automatically at the point of sale.Heidi Alexander, transport secretary, said: “We’re putting money back in people’s pockets and making it easier and cheaper for families to make the switch to electric, by delivering discounts of up to £3,750 on EVs.“Our measures are driving competition in the UK EV market, boosting economic growth and supporting jobs and skills as part of our plan for change.”Separately, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said UK car production rose for a second month in a row in July, by 5.6%.However, the SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said it was a turbulent time in the market, with “consumer confidence weak, trade flows volatile and massive investment in new technologies under way both here and abroad”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Honor’s latest foldable phone-tablet attempts to usurp Samsung as the leader of the pack with a super-thin body, massive battery and a ginormous camera lump on the back.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Magic V5 is an impressively thin piece of engineering, slimmed down to about 8.9mm thick when shut, with each half about the same thickness as a USB-C port. It feels very similar to a standard slab phone in the hand, but one you can open up like a book for a mini-tablet on the go.The foldable costs £1,699.99 (€1,999.99), undercutting the competition fromSamsungand Google by up to £100, but still very much at the eye-wateringly expensive end of the smartphone market.The Magic V5 comes in various colours with different materials on the back that make the phone varying thicknesses and weights. At 222g or under it is slightly heavier than Samsung’s latest Fold 7, but far lighter than the rest of the folding phone competition, and about the same weight asa large slab phone.View image in fullscreenWhen closed the Magic V5 is about the same weight, thickness and width as a large regular phone.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe outside 6.43in OLED screen is great and acts just like a regular phone while the inside 7.95in folding screen is one of the best, with an impressive brightness. It still has a crease down the middle but you don’t notice it in use. The inside screen is necessarily softer than traditional phone screens to allow it to bend, so you have to treat it with care; and it is a fingerprint magnet.The Honor is one of the first folding phones to be water- and dust-resistant to similar standards as a regular phone. That means fine particles shouldn’t be able to get behind the moving, flexible screen and metal hinge, which has been a durability concern for all foldables.SpecificationsMain screen:7.95in (403ppi) 120Hz OLED flexible displayCover screen:6.43in (405ppi) 120Hz OLEDProcessor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 EliteRAM:16GBStorage:512GBOperating system:MagicOS 9.0.1 (Android 15)Camera:50MP + 50MP ultrawide + 64MP 3x tele; 2x 20MP selfieConnectivity:5G, dual sim + esim, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, GNSSWater resistance:IP58 and IP59(immersion and high pressure jets)Dimensions folded:156.8 x 74.3 x 8.88-9mmDimensions unfolded:156.8 x 145.9 x 4.1-4.2mmWeight:217-222gTop Snapdragon chip and a high-capacity batteryView image in fullscreenA full charge takes 55 minutes using a standard 100W USB-C power adaptor (not included), hitting 70% in under half an hour.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Magic V5 has Qualcomm’s current top Android chip, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, matching rivals andflagship phones. It feels responsive in day-to-day activities, plays games very well and doesn’t get too hot when pushed hard.But that power is best used when multitasking, as you can run up to four apps on screen at once – half as many asSamsung’s Fold 7but more than enough to actually be able to use.More impressive is the high-capacity battery Honor has managed to squeeze into the svelte frame, which is larger than most big slab phones, let alone folders. That means the battery life is great, but as with other folding phones it varies a lot depending on which screen you use most. Used primarily as a tablet for browsing and watching video with four hours of 5G usage, the Magic V5 lasts a good 37 hours between charges. With more balanced usage across the two screens it lasts into a third day before running out of juice.MagicOS software still needs workView image in fullscreenMultitasking on the large internal display is great, with up to three apps in split-screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Magic V5 runs Honor’s MagicOS 9, which is based on last year’sAndroid15 rather than the latest Android 16. But Honor will provide seven years of Android version and security updates for devices sold within Europe, which is a dramatic improvement over previous efforts, and similar in length to its main rivals.The software has some good ideas, butas with previous versionsit still has some rough areas and irritating behaviours. The outside screen works mostly like any other Android phone with Gemini and various other AI tools. But it is on the inside screen where the software shines and irritates. You can place three apps in a splitscreen at once, with one of them pushed partially off the side of the screen to provide more space for the other two without quitting it. Tapping it brings it back on to the screen to use it. It’s a smart idea first seen onthe OnePlus Open. A button on the taskbar makes arranging your multiple windows easy.View image in fullscreenMini floating windows allow desktop-like multitasking.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBut tap on an app notification on the inside screen and the system insists on opening the app in a mini-window, even if you wanted it to be full screen. That might be fine for smaller messaging apps such as WhatsApp, but I never want to open Gmail or larger-format apps in tiny windows that then need to be tapped a couple more times to fill the full screen.The software also doesn’t make good use of the partially folded modes that the inside screen can adopt, lacking an equivalent toSamsung’s good Flex mode, which seems like a wasted opportunity. Another bug in the typeface on the Honor makes it very difficult to see which emails are unread in bold in Gmail, which is extremely irritating.Much of these little annoyances would be acceptable on cheaper smartphones, but not on a £1,700, ultra-premium device. Honor still has work to do.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app has multiple modes to shoot closed, half open, fully open or using the main cameras for selfies.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Magic V5 has a decent set of cameras housed in an enormous round camera lump that protrudes from the rear of the phone. The main 50-megapixel camera shoots good-looking images across a range of lighting conditions, though it can become a bit soft with weaker indoor lighting.The 50MP ultra-wide camera is solid, but displays a bit of warping around the edges of the scene and lacks a bit of fine detail. The 64MP 3x optical telephoto camera is the best of the bunch, with good detail and colour, even in indoor lighting. It can manage a 6x in-sensor zoom, which is a bit softer on detail when viewed at full size but works well in bright light, plus digital zoom up to 100x that remains fairly decent up to about 20x magnification.The two 20MP selfie cameras are good enough, but you get much better results using the main camera and the outside screen for a viewfinder.The camera has many different modes to play around with including a smart motion capture system that handles action photography and solid video capture. It also has a lot of AI and enhancement features that are common to Chinese smartphones modifying the appearance of faces and the alike should you wish.Overall the camera is one of the better ones on a foldable, though it can’t match the best cameraphones on the market.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe capacitive fingerprint scanner in the power button works well in the thin frame.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery has an expected lifespan of atleast 1,200 full-charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity. The Magic V5 is generally repairable by Honor, with internal screens costing about £700 or external screens about £200 to replace out of warranty. Honor offers a free screen repair for 12 months if bought within the first month of release.The device contains some recycled plastic. Honor publisheslimited environmental reportsand offerstrade-inandrefurbished products.PriceThe Honor Magic V5 costs £1,699.99 (€1,999.99).For comparison, theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7costs from£1,799, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs£1,749, theGalaxy S25 Ultracosts£1,249and the Honor Magic 7 Pro costs£1,099.VerdictYet again Honor has produced some exquisite folding phone hardware that is let down by its software. MagicOS has improved overthe last few years, but it lacks much of the customisation and capabilities possible on rivals.The biggest problem is that it lacks polish, with rough patches or irritating behaviours across the system. None of them is a deal-breaker, but they build up and can’t be overlooked on a £1,700 phone.It’s a shame as the phone is fast, the battery life is great, the camera is highly capable and it looks fabulous. It’s good to see Samsung and Google get some meaningful competition in book-style foldables. But at about the same price as the market leader, Samsung, there’s little reason to pick the Magic V5 over it.Pros:super-slim phone and tablet in one, light, just like a normal phone when closed, great performance, very long battery life, good internal screen, decent camera, good fingerprint scanner, water and dust resistance rating.Cons:very expensive, software not as refined as needed with irritating behaviours, more fragile than a regular device, costly to repair, limited folding modes.View image in fullscreenThe Magic V5 is an attractive and well-made device.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesTablet computersMobile phonesAndroidreviewsShareReuse this content"

But shares of the chip giant still dropped 2.3% in after hours trading, in a sign that investors’ worries of an AI bubble and the repercussions ofDonald Trump’s trade wars are not quelled.Nvidia’s financial report was the first test of investor appetite since last week’s mass AI-stock selloff, when several tech stocks saw shares tumble last week amid growing questions over whether AI-driven companies are being overvalued.On Wednesday, Nvidia reported an adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on $46.74bn in revenue, surpassing Wall Street’s projection of $1.01 in earnings per share on $46.05bn in revenue, according to Fact Set data.But investors had high expectations for the company. Some of the market reactions may be to the slight misses in other parts of the company’s business, including data center revenue. Nvidia posted $41.1bn in data center revenue, missing the $41.3bn Wall Street was expecting.“Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn’t cut it for Nvidia this time around,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst atInvesting.com. “Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat.”The company also said it had not assumed any shipments of its H20 chips toChinain the outlook.The chip is at the heart of concerns over the repercussions of the trade war between the US and China. Earlier this year, Trump banned AI chip sales in China, a move that resulted in a $4.5bn blow to Nvidia’s finances during its fiscal first quarter. In August, Nvidiaagreedto give the US government a 15% cut of its H20 chips to China in return for export licences. China, in turn, has voiced security concerns over the chips, and is ramping up production of its own domestic alternatives.Nvidia’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said on the earnings call that some companies have expressed interest in purchasing H20 and an initial set of companies have received licenses to purchase the chip. Kress said that the company could ship anywhere between $2bn and $5bn of H20 chips to China if “geopolitical issues reside”.Huang reiterated the importance of being able to operate in the China market, which he said could represent a $50bn market opportunity for the company this year. “We’re talking to the administration about the importance of American companies being able to address the Chinese market,” Huang said. He also said in addition to H20 being approved for sales in China to non-sanctioned companies, there is a potential opportunity for the company to eventually sell a version of Blackwell in the country.Trump hiked tariffs on US imports. Now he’s looking at exports – sparking fears of ‘dangerous precedent’Read more“It is the second largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers – about 50% of the world’s AI researchers are in China,” Huang said. “The vast majority of leading open source models are created in China. It’s fairly important for the American technology companies to be able to address that market.”Monteiro, the Investing.com analyst, said:“The reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation.”The company is projecting $54bn in revenue in the third quarter – which is within the range of Wall Street expectations – and said the board approved $60bn in additional stock buybacks – on top of nearly $24.3bn the company returned to shareholders in the first half of the year in both stock buybacks and cash dividends.Founder and chief executive, Jensen Huang, said production of the company’s latest AI superchip, Blackwell, is “ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.“The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center,” Huang said in a press release.Despite the initial tepid market reaction to the company’s financials, some analysts remain bullish on the so-called AI revolution, especially as major technology companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. “This is further validation for Nvidia and the AI Revolution,” said the Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives.“This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China. There is one chip in the world fueling the AI Revolution and its Nvidia … that narrative is clear from these results and the positive commentary from Jensen,” Ives said.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaQuarterly resultsChinaArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

This is often where the best stories are and where Esoteric Ebb takes its inspiration.Part tabletop game, part RPG, you play as a cleric who has been sent to investigate the destruction of a tea shop in the city Norvik, which is about to hold its first ever election in five days. You’ll talk (and occasionally fight) with the local residents to uncover the truth and affect the outcome of the election. Or perhaps you’ll just fight some seagulls. You can choose your own path, but, much like in D&D, your success comes down to dice rolls and having to live with the consequences if you fail them.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to do something entirely different’ … Esoteric Ebb.Photograph: Christoffer Bodegård“Every single choice available in the game is something that I anticipated,” says writer and developer Christoffer Bodegård. It’s particularly impressive because every interaction in even a tiny area of the game feels so open-ended. All of the dialogue choices and touching of random objects have been thoughtfully considered by Bodegård to give the feeling of freedom in a confined space. The experience of playing D&D and your players doing unexpected things has come together in the game.As a cleric you may be taking on the role of a detective, but you can cast spells to read people’s minds to gain an advantage or even speak to the dead to uncover other lines of inquiry. Your cleric is entirely your own as you can customise their accessories – and their personality, with classic D&D stats such as charisma and strength. You could make yourself strong but with low intelligence so you might win a fight but not be smart enough to get a truthful answer out of anyone because your dice rolls can never get high enough.“At some point I was like, well, I play so much D&D, why not just make my own homebrew?” Bodegård says. “I wanted to do something entirely different, and that’s what inspired the basis of the world of Esoteric Ebb, which is just taking D&D and looking at it from a weird, esoteric, realistic angle. Like, what if these spells actually did exist? How would governments form? How would various powers exist in relation to these actual D&D mechanics? If we can create food and water from a spell, how does that affect the economy? And just looking at it from that perspective.”Norvik may look like a small, medieval-style city on the surface, but because so much consideration has been put into how the place works with its various political parties and citizens, it feels like a real place. Just one with monsters working at shops, and magic. Bodegård’s focus on the depth of the setting and the sheer scope of all the dialogue choices makes for an enticing prospect. “As long as I’m entertained by the thing I’m writing, I can keep writing, and the second I’m bored, I stop.”Esoteric Ebb is in development for PC; due for release in 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCIndie gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will the US heed it?Thu 28 Aug 2025 13.40 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 18.01 EDTShareWednesday night brought a grim return to Russia’s form: one of the heaviest air raids on Kyiv since the full-scale invasion began. Moscow eased off its strikes on major cities in the run-up to the Alaska summit, and it held off its attack on the Ukrainian capital until Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy, had finished his visit there. But within hours of his departure, at least 18 people,including several children, were dead in an attack on a residential block, and the European Union mission had been severely damaged.Donald Trump periodically suggests that he is drawing a line forVladimir Putin. Yet each time he appears to set a limit, the Russian president breezes through it. The Kyiv attack shows that it is Mr Putin who is testing the US president. Mr Trump threatened “severe consequences” if Moscow did not immediately agree to a ceasefire – but in Anchorage was quickly persuaded by Mr Putin that there was no need for one prior to a peace deal.“I think in many ways he’s there,” Mr Trumptold reporterson Tuesday. But Russia’sdiplomatic stalling, allowing it to continue to grind away on the battlefield, is transparent. The lethal strike on civilians in Kyiv shows exactly what it thinks of peace talks. As Mr Trump alsoremarked: “Every conversation I have with [Mr Putin] is a good conversation. And then unfortunately, a bomb is loaded up into Kyiv or someplace, and then I get very angry about it.”The US president appears unable to draw the obvious conclusion, and his anger has yet to convert into action. He continues to cast blame on Volodymyr Zelenskyy (“not exactly innocent either”) for Russia’s unprovoked invasion. Mr Trump floated the idea of sanctions again, but only when pressed. His one concrete move –doubling the tariff on most Indian goods to 50%– was billed as punishment for New Delhi’s Russian oil imports.In fact, those imports had been quietlyencouragedby Washington to steady world markets, and European countries have bought oil from India once it has been refined. The real trigger was India’srefusalto scrap farm protections, an issue for Mr Trump’s base. This was domestic politics rebadged as Russia policy, and a headache for New Delhi, not for Moscow.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, accused Moscow of targeting the EU in its Wednesday night strike. That’s unlikely to worry the White House. European leaders know that their ability to shape its worldview is restricted and intermittent. The result may last only until Mr Trump’s next conversation, or next glimpse of a talking head on Fox News.They continue to make maximal efforts and compromises for limited returns. The US has reportedlystopped sharing informationon any potential Ukraine-Russia deal even with the members of the anglophone Five Eyes intelligence-sharing community.Given that, European governments are unlikely to get carried away by thereported willingnessof the US to contribute intelligence and air support to a postwar force in Ukraine. Whether the posited reassurance force will actually materialise, and if so in what form, remains to be seen. But in the absence of the ceasefire that would have to precede it, Europe must make clear that it will not waver in its support for Kyiv. In probing Mr Trump’s intentions, Mr Putin is also probing Europe’s resolve. It cannot afford to fail this test.Explore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionEuropeRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpTrump tariffsIndiaeditorialsShareReuse this content"

It’s an outrage – and we must resist itThierry Breton is the former EU commissioner for digital affairsThu 28 Aug 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 20.35 EDTShareFreshthreats of sanctionshave just emerged from across the Atlantic, targeting Europe and any official who dares to enforce the Digital Services Act (DSA), the EU’s flagship law regulating tech platforms and digital operations. These sanctions come with new trade barriers and unprecedented export restrictions.How long are we, citizens of the EU, going to tolerate these threats? Submit to those who want to impose their rules, their laws, their deadlines on us? Surrender to those who now presume to dictate our fundamental democratic and moral principles, our rules for how we live together and even how we protect our own children online? Why and in whose name would we agree to cast aside our twin digital regulations, theDSA and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which were voted into law with clarity, courage and convictionby a landslidein the European parliament? (It is worth recalling thatMEPs votedfor the DMA by 588 votes to 11, with 31 abstentions, and for the DSA by 539 votes to 54, with 30 abstentions.)An ever-widening gulf of misunderstanding is opening up betweenEuropeand the United States on digital regulation. A gulf that the major tech platforms – American, in this case – are exploiting to the hilt. And that is deeply regrettable. Because regulating the information space is not optional: it is asine qua nonfor turning the narrow mercantile logic of a few into a genuine contribution towards human progress and the common good.Throughout history, humanity has managed to regulate its territorial, maritime and airspace. This is the prerogative of sovereign states. It is the essence of sovereignty itself. To renounce, today, the task of regulating the fourth domain – the digital space – by leaving it to a handful of private actors would be a historic abdication of the public sphere, of political will, of the democratic promise.The DMA and the DSA are, in truth, nothing more than the extension of our social and democratic norms from the physical world into the digital one. In other words: the rule of law. Europe is the first and only continent to have taken this step. It has every reason to be proud.Let us be absolutely clear: regulating the digital space has never been, and will never be, an assault on freedom of expression. On the contrary, this freedom has always been a legitimate concern and a core demand of the European parliament.Europe is free to define its own laws and policies, and remains an open market. But that openness comes with one condition: our laws must be respected. Our democratic sovereignty must be upheld. That is non-negotiable. Not for sale. Platforms, wherever they come from, must now comply with our democratic framework if they wish to access our markets. Otherwise they will face heavy sanctions, which the European Commission is duty-bound to apply firmly and swiftly.There are no tariffs. There is no attempt to shut anyone out. There is no desire for prohibition in our European digital space. This is quite the opposite of what the US has imposed on the physical world of trade. A punitive unilateral US tariff regime is already weighing heavily on the EU. And that should make us reflect.Let us be blunt: analternative EU negotiating pathwas possible; one that did not involve our submission.Pre-emptive capitulationwas not the only option: there should have been an assumed balance of power between partners of equal weight.Why is Europe – the US’s largest trading partner – not treated on the same terms as Mexico or Canada, which have trade volumes with the US that are comparable to the EU’s? After months of tough negotiations with the Trump administration, they maintained full exemptions from tariffs on more than 90% of their exports, and tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on the rest. Their overall average tariff ratenow stands below 5%. This was the result of four months of hard, head-to-head negotiation between Mexico, Canada and the US. It was not a foregone conclusion, but the fight was worth it.The commission rightly entered into negotiations on the same basis – zero for zero – across a very broad scope of products. Why then did Europe end up lowering its guard andaccepting a 15% tariffon European exports to the US, whileconceding zero tariffson US imports, including most agricultural products?Worse still, in order to benefit from this supposed “special discount”, Europe is now forced to commit to buying $750bn worth of US energy, and to invest an additional $200bn every year in the US economy, on top of the current investment flow of $300bn. Is this truly the best deal Europe could have hoped for?We were told thatcapitulation was preferableto uncertainty and the risk of a trade war. Wars, it is true, often end in surrender. But after conceding so much to secure hypothetical tariff stability – an understandable demand from our businesses – what real guarantees have we obtained?What if Europe is “punished” again, this time for not buying enough US gas? Or if its businesses choose instead to invest those hundreds of billions into the European economy and jobs?We were told humiliation was the price we had to pay for stability. But if we don’t push back now, we will get humiliation and instability.Will this latest assault on our digital laws finally be enough to wake us up?The time has come to rise up. Europeans must stand together and proclaim loud and clear: “Enough is enough,es reicht,ça suffit,adesso basta,dość tego,ya basta…” Europe, stand up!Thierry Breton was the European commissioner for the internal market and digital affairs until September 2024 and is a former minister for the economy and finance in FranceExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionTariffsEuropean UnionEuropeTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But my mother and I are finding genuine connectionThu 28 Aug 2025 12.10 EDTShareSince my father’s funeral six months ago, I still call my mother almost every day. We live worlds apart, geographically and ideologically, but despite me being in Europe and she in the US, and despite our religious and political differences, we still manage to keep talking. After all, she’s my mom.This year has not been easy, having lost my job, my father and what continues to feel like my country. I worked forUSAIDand believed in America’s capacity to help solve global problems while helping others in need, but the current administration ended such work, calling it wasteful. Two days after that, my father passed away, and as our family gathered to mourn, we received news that my mother’s cancer had returned and spread to her bones. Such news was devastating, but doctors offered hope. Though there was no cure, there was a pill available to stem the spread, sometimes even for many years.Trump’s Unesco withdrawal is part of a broader assault on democracy |  Liesl Gerntholtz and Julie TrebaultRead moreEven grief couldn’t bridge our differences, though. At our family gathering, my mother confronted me about USAID, claiming that the agency funded terrorists and performed sex changes on children. Such disinformation about our actual health and development programs had taken root and was spreading.I know I am not alone in a country of families divided by politics. In our case, my mother and most of my extended family have embraced a form ofChristianitythat intertwines closely with conservative politics. Some carry Patriot Bible editions with an American flag on the cover while others send their kids to school in T-shirts emblazoned with silhouettes of rifles.Our information environment accelerates these divisions. Last month, my mother forwarded an article arguing that people who criticize Israel don’t do so out of concern, say, for casualties, but from discomfort with accepting that God is always on Israel’s side. I tried to get her to see the humanity with the same principles she taught me – to love one another, to care about suffering – but she dismissed the suffering as “God keeping his promises”. I was irate and one sister had to break it up, and both sisters stayed silent about the point.Such clashes about principles are what test our relationship the most. We’ve learned boundaries, so when I talk to my mom, it’s generally about her treatment, the weather, plans for the day, family memories and family history. Like her medical treatment, our relationship requires attention to potential flare-ups.If I struggle to find common ground with my mom, how can I expect others to bridge similar divides?Obviously I am still coming to terms with our differences, but she is my mom and I love her. I keep calling and she keeps answering. And our relationship is improving. The calls were initially to keep her company, but they are turning out to be good for me, too, as I am learning better about what comprises our love. The conversations also feel symbolic of something larger.If I struggle to find common ground with my mom, how can I expect others to bridge similar divides? The essential functions of our body politic are under threat, and I suspect that, like my mother’s condition, there’s no single cure except the daily discipline of care and listening with mindful hearts.It is comforting to stay in our like-minded communities where our views face no challenge, where we don’t speak or, better, listen to others. It’s easy to dismiss those who disagree as uninformed rather than seeking the seed of peace, common ground. My mother raised me to be curious about the world, to care about people beyond our family, and to seek truth even when it’s uncomfortable, lessons that came from the same tradition of faith that now seems to divide us.Why Trump’s attack on the Smithsonian matters | Kimberlé Crenshaw and Jason StanleyRead moreI don’t pretend our calls are always easy or successful, but I am learning patience. I’m learning that to maintain the relationship requires me to show up consistently, avoid stepping on landmines but hold my ground on key principles (like love and peace), and to listen even when I am itching to challenge. And through our consistency, we are finding moments of genuine connection.Like any living thing, democracy too can fall ill. Dire symptoms are everywhere: polarization of people and information sources, and the hardening of hearts against complexity. Of course, we need appropriate treatment to escape the present gilded age (get money out of politics, tax the rich, support independent media, etc) but getting there will require the same kind of commitment that my mother’s doctors ask of her. Regular attention. Long-term thinking. And the stubborn belief that what we’re trying to preserve is worth the effort.My mom’s medication is helping to slow her cancer, giving us more time together. I don’t know how much time we have, with her illness or with our country, but I know this: both require us to show up every day, to resist the urge to give up and to seek success through small consistencies.Our conversations continue, one phone call at a time. In a world pulling itself apart, maybe that persistence is its own form of hope.Christian Smith is a former USAID officerExplore more on these topicsFamilyOpinionUSAIDTrump administrationRepublicansChristianityReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

Two can play at that gameMargaret SullivanGavin Newsom’s counterpunching against Trump serves as a master class in flipping the script – and boosting his own profileThu 28 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 06.32 EDTShareJust when you thoughtDonald Trumpwas parody-proof,Gavin Newsomcomes along to prove you wrong.Unhinged all-caps tweets with nonsensical punctuation? Insulting nicknames for political enemies? Self-promotional merchandise for sale?This will all sound familiar unless you have been living in a bubble for the past decade. But if the description conjures an orange-tonedRepublicanin a golf cart – a wannabe dictator in a red tie down to his hefty thighs – your system needs an update.Because it turns out that Trump is not the only one who can play that game.TheCaliforniagovernor has spent the last few weeks mercilessly trolling Trump and his Maga followers by flipping the script. His press office is blasting out long, illogical social media posts, depicting Newsom as a muscular Adonis ready to save the world and suggesting his image should be carved in stone on Mount Rushmore or grace the cover of Time magazine wearing a crown and a grin.It’s been a master class in flipping the script – and maybe in political gamesmanship, too. With his social media profile soaring and political coffers filling up, these moves could even help Newsom gain access to the very White House that Trump has tackily transformed into a miniature Mar-a-Lago.Newsom’s counterpunching has earned the approval of everyone from the former president Barack Obama to Steve Bannon, the disreputable architect of some of Trump’s worst moves.“He’s no Trump but … he’s at least getting up there,” Bannon told Politico. “He looks like the only person in the Democratic party who is organizing a fight that they feel they can win.”Obama endorsedthe more serious side of what Newsom is up to – praising as “smart, measured, responsible” the governor’s plan to counter the recent Republican gerrymandering of Texas congressional districts with a redistricting measure in California to benefit Democrats.But Newsom’s newfound prominence isn’t pleasing everyone. The pro-Trump commenters on Fox News are disapproving, as if they haven’t spent a decade cheering the same techniques. Sean Hannity, the network’s chief Trump whisperer, trashed the trolling as a “performative confrontational style” that only works with “the loony radical base”.If that sounds familiar, so did the all-caps response from Newsom’s press office: “FOX HATES THAT I AM AMERICA’S FAVORITE GOVERNOR (‘RATINGS KING’) SAVING AMERICA – WHILE TRUMP CAN’T EVEN CONQUER THE ‘BIG’ STAIRS ON AIR FORCE ONE ANY MORE!!! … FOX IS LOSING IT BECAUSE WHEN I TYPE, AMERICA NOW WINS!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.”And Trump himself is clearly triggered. Weeks ago, he suggested Newsomshould be arrested. More recently he dusted off an old nickname: “Newscum”.But here, too, Newsom’s team punched back, posting a simple diss – three snowflake emojis.The script-switching is clever, and often downright funny; the humor is effective partly because Newsom’s real-life persona stands in stark contrast to Trump’s.Newsom is the California pretty boy – he looks like he eats only kale and quinoa, with an occasional helping of asparagus. His politics are progressive, if not sharply defined, and he is married to a woman of career accomplishment, Jennifer Siebel Newsom. She’s a documentary film-maker and actor, who (cover your ears, woke-fearing Magaworld!) has updated the role of first lady with a more gender neutral title: “First Partner.”The Democrats’ old aspiration, expressed by Michelle Obama, was “when they go low, we go high”. Too often that has translated into passivity and ineptitude. But since the low-high approach has failed – theDemocratsare powerless on the national level – Newsom’s moves are energizing.It’s too bad, of course, that insults and absurd memes have become the American way. But at least Newsom, and his social media team, are awfully good at it.As for where it all leads, maybe the answer is nowhere. Newsom’s counterpunch may be just another distraction as the nation falls into authoritarianism right before our eyes.Gavin Newsom is taking the fight to Trump – but for whom is he fighting? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe historian and author Garrett Graff wrote this week in hisDoomsday Scenario newsletterthat we’re already there: “The United States, just months before its 250th birthday as the world’s leading democracy, has tipped over the edge into authoritarianism and fascism … faster than I imagined possible.”Can strong leadership and a decisive, blue-wave vote in 2026’s midterms and 2028’s presidential election yank America back up?If so, radical change is necessary. Newsom’s approach – if combined with a strong, clear message of economic populism – could be a part of that.It could end up being not just funny but crucially important.Given where things stand, it’s worth a try.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsGavin NewsomOpinionSocial mediaDemocratsUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Something to offer even a brief (privileged) reprieve from the horrors, the headlines, the general sense of doom. My anxiety’s high, my brain’s short-circuiting and I’ve had to find new coping mechanisms to help soothe the agitated static inside my head. It needs to be something that gives my brain a short break, engaging enough that it distracts me but doesn’t get me spiralling or thinking (yuck).Over the past few months, I’ve found something that works perfectly. I’ve fallen into the arms of procedural dramas. I am a known TV lover, so it’s not that surprising, but I have never really gotten deep into these kinds of shows. You know the ones, a crime or legal case or something occurs at the beginning of the episode and within 45 minutes it has been investigated and resolved.Renting has robbed me of precious cat years. So I’ve turned to pet-sitting to fill the void | Rebecca ShawRead moreThere comes a time in every mentally unwell woman’s life when she must abandon all highbrow television ambitions, when she can’t concentrate on high concepts and doesn’t want to delve into deep emotions. That’s when she turns to crime. Procedurals. If you’re thinking that these shows are a bit same-y and a bit silly, you’re correct. And that’s the point. I am not one of those people who finds rewatching things comforting – my brain begins to disengage if it already knows what’s next, leaving it to wander into the dangerous territory of real life. With procedurals, each episode is different, yet sort of the same. The joy of them lies in their gentle, soothing predictability. There is a pleasant repetitiveness, which means that having watched many seasons I can now tell immediately when someone is the killer simply by the way they enter an episode, or from the fact he randomly mentioned he is allergic to horses for some reason.While the structure of all these shows is beautifully familiar, the vibes of one in particular set it above the rest, in my opinion: Elementary. This show has the immediate head start in two ways. One, Sherlock isn’t police. And two, it stars Lucy Liu, a woman so beautiful that I could watch 500 episodes of her sitting completely still in a room. Sherlock is charmingly weird and emotionally complex, with a random heroin addiction that the show deals with in an oddly grounded way, even when the other plots go absolutely bonkers. But the main thing I love about Elementary is that there is no will they/won’t they. The other procedurals, such as Castle and Bones, both immediately introduce that dynamic between the two leads and then you have to watch a lot of heterosexual nonsense going on until they finally hook up. I don’t need that in my show, it doesn’t bring me comfort and I don’t find it particularly thrilling. Joan and Sherlock have excellent chemistry but it’s not about sex at all, it’s about mutual admiration and figuring each other out as companions and crime solvers. Revolutionary!People love to say ‘sexuality doesn’t matter’ and shouldn’t come up in AFL – so why do players hurl homophobic slurs? | Rebecca ShawRead moreThe episodes are interesting enough to engage but repetitive enough that it’s like my brain has been put in a bird cage with a blanket over it. It’s an adult lullaby. These shows also don’t take themselves too seriously, which is an important factor. There’s a lot of moments where you have to suspend your disbelief, forget how legal procedure works and get on board with someone solving a crime by noticing a brand of soy milk in a fridge that blows the case wide open. Bones features a character who makes holograms of how victims might have looked in life based on their bones. The dated technology in these shows is charming and soothing as well. Flip phones and Sherlock being sceptical that this new “AI” would ever become a thing fill me with a sweet nostalgia for the days of yore. My body longs for this era and is calmed by it.Obviously these aren’t perfect shows, they are largely from the 2000s where every sexy woman is a white stick-thin model, even though we all know in reality this Sherlock would [enthusiastically?] hook up with the full range of humanity for research purposes. But they are like an anxiety blanket for my sore raw little brain. I can put it on and my brain goes into a mode where I am engaged the perfect amount. It’s a small and necessary break, and if this is something you need I highly recommend it. It’s Elementary, my dear readers.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsTelevisionOpinionJonny Lee MillercommentShareReuse this content"

Not likely for an artist who’s made billions from songs about redefining women’s limitsThu 28 Aug 2025 10.13 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 10.59 EDTShareTaylor Swift isoff the market. She’s engaged to marry the NFL player Travis Kelce in what will be the US’s first proper royal wedding, and yes of course I know you’re far too high-minded to care about any of that, but what’s striking is how many people seem convinced that this is the end of any kind of interesting life for her. As if a woman had no drama, no edge, no stories to tell, and – let’s be frank, here – no commercial value to speak of once she is no longer at least theoretically sexually available. The fairytale ends when the princess marries the prince: who cares, really, what happens to her after that?Music critics are already gloomily debating whether marriage will kill her creativity, or whether she’ll be left for dust by one of the younger rivals already nipping at her heels if she does take time out from music to have the children she’s always said she wanted. Poor Taylor, mummy-tracked before she’s even pregnant, like an old friend of mine whose engagement in her 20s prompted her male boss to tell everyone in the pub afterwards that that was her out for the count. He meant that she’d presumably have babies now and lose her professional edge – right on the first count, very wrong on the second – but also perhaps that she had somehow put herself in a different category: no longer young and promising, but practically matronly overnight. Even the Today programme devoted breakfast airtime to pondering where Swift will get her material, once she’s a smug married with no toxic exes to write about – though of course she was never just about breakup songs, and women have been known to have interesting interior lives even over the age of 35.More gallingly, in the USthe Maga right is crowing about what they see as Swift’s surrender to the forces of conservatism, as if the patron saint ofchildless cat ladies(and arch-defender of reproductive rights) had just sold out in return for a rose-bedecked engagement photoshoot and the coy note of small-town romance struck byher linethat “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married”.You belong with me! Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce – a love story in 11 picturesRead moreSo when people ask what on earth she has to write about now, the obvious answer for someone who has made billions from pop songs about redefining women’s limits and subverting expectations is … all of the above. All the lazy assumptions about what it means to be a wife and (maybe, eventually) mother, including the astonishingly persistent old chestnut that feminism isn’t compatible with loving a man. All the questions and internal contradictions that plenty of her original fanbase – who, like her, are now in their mid-30s and faintly mortified to find themselves getting into bread-making – must be secretly wrestling with too. There is an incredibly rich lyrical seam just waiting to be mined about being a millennial woman and wanting perfectly ordinary things – love, security, a family – without feeling as if you’re compromising your independence, losing the career you’ve worked so hard for, or subconsciously shrinking yourself to fit some narrowly pre-ordained mould.This week, England and Wales reported that fertility rates hadfallen to their lowest levelsince comparable data was first recorded in 1938, when Britain was on the eve of a war. In Scotland, they have plummeted even further, to the lowest point seensince records began in 1855. The causes of this modern collapse are complex, ranging from the astronomical cost of childcare and the struggle to afford a family-size home to the hellscape that is dating apps, and much more besides. But lurking somewhere in the mix is the fact that what’s on offer just doesn’t seem all that compelling to many younger women.Tradwifedom, the meekly old-fashioned vision of domesticity served up on Instagram by a bunch of submissive influencers in aprons, is a gingham-lined trap visible from space (and even for those whodobuy into the retro housewife fantasy, it’s out of reach for all but the tiny minority of couples who can afford to live on only one salary). Burning out in an attempt to do everything at once, like some of their mothers did, is not much more appealing, however. Meanwhile, some are already falling into the yawning gap between the solution they’d hoped for – men prepared to share the domestic load like equals – and the often jarring reality of early motherhood. Now imagine all those conflicting emotions, boiled down into a few unforgettable one-liners by the woman who also wrote the soundtrack to your single years.Taylor Swift’s romantic travails were the soundtrack to mine. What does her engagement mean for fans’ love lives? | Hollie RichardsonRead moreIt’s true that in literary terms, the transition between questing singleton and married woman is a tricky plot point. Bridget Jones’s creator Helen Fielding didn’t seem to know what to do with her once she’d married her Mr Darcy, and ended upkilling him offto make Bridget interesting again. The writers ofAnd Just Like Thatencountered the same problem when Carrie Bradshaw eventually married Big, andsolved it equally murderously.But both Carrie and Bridget are fictional characters. No matter how heavily curated her public persona, somewhere deep inside theTaylor Swiftindustrial complex is a real human being, and assuming that she can’t spin gold out of this says more about narrow views of what women can be as they get older than it does about an endlessly inventive myth-maker. The old Taylor may not, in her words, be able to come to the phone right now. But I suspect there will be a new one along any minute.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Until they started digging 17m-long tunnelsRenate van der ZeeReintroduced for environmental reasons, beavers are now in danger of causing serious flooding. Should there be more culls?Thu 28 Aug 2025 05.34 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 08.07 EDTShareThe beaver has made an amazing comeback in the Netherlands. Extinct in the early 19th century, it was reintroduced in 1988, and now there are an estimated 7,000 beavers roaming around. Compared with England, where the beaver population isestimated at 500, that’s quite a feat.But there’s a significant downside to the booming Dutch beaver population. Beavers are increasingly digging burrows and tunnels under roads, railways and – even more worryingly –in dykes. For a country where a quarter of the land sits below sea level, this is not a minor problem – especially as beavers are not exactly holding back when digging.“We’ve found tunnels stretching up to 17 metres into a dyke. Wide enough for a grown man to fit in. That’s alarming,” says Jelmer Krom of the Rivierenland water board. Rivierenland is a region in the middle of theNetherlands, crisscrossed by big rivers, where dykes are crucial for keeping high water at bay. If a major dyke gives way, it would cause a serious flood affecting thousands of people.When it comes to the Dutch dykes, beavers tend to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Just when the water is high, they start digging in the dykes. When water levels rise and flood their burrow, they start digging higher up into the dyke. That’s how you end up with those long tunnels which put the dykes at risk.“When the water is really high, I’m lying in bed at night with my fingers crossed, praying the beavers aren’t wreaking havoc somewhere,” confesses Cindy de Jonge-Stegink, a beaver consultant in the north of the Netherlands. Up there, where the flood defences are often very narrow – sometimes just 15 metres wide – De Jonge-Stegink says they have come across beaver tunnels 10 metres long.It is quite a challenge to locate beaver burrows because their entrances are under water, and as yet there are no effective techniques for mapping them. During high water, special patrols go out at night with thermal-imaging cameras to spot where beavers are active, but this method doesn’t always yield the desired results.Also, when a beaver that’s causing problems is found, it can only be killedin exceptional circumstances, because beavers are a protected species in the Netherlands. Moving it doesn’t do much good either, as the beaver tends simply to return. So the Dutch have to turn to other methods to keep their beavers somewhat under control: making riverbanks less attractive to beavers by removing willow thickets, reinforcing dykes with mesh to make them beaver proof, or digging out and sealing burrows. It’s a lot of work, and it needs to be done more and more often.“Five years ago, we had to dig out a beaver burrow about 15 times a year in our region. That’s gone up to 40 or 50 times a year. And it’s costing us a pretty penny,” says Krom.In the hilly province of Limburg, a landscape more comparable to England, the problems are of a different nature. Beavers build dams in brook valleys, causing flooding issues for industry, farmers and locals. This is not as serious as a dyke breach in a polder landscape, below the water line, but it is still keenly felt.And as the beaver population grows rapidly, the animals increasingly venture into agricultural areas, where farmers find their tractors sinking into beaver burrows, or even into residential areas. “I know mothers who take their children to say goodnight to the beavers before bedtime. That makes my green heart leap,” says De Jonge-Stegink. “Until those beavers start digging up their gardens, of course.”Beaver damage is already costing the Dutchmillions of euros, and in the future the costs will only rise. Is it all worthwhile? The Dutch government, conservation managers and nature lovers think so. Because beavers, with their astonishing activities, enrich nature and promote biodiversity. By building dams, they create beaver ponds where all sorts of new plant and animal species emerge. With these dams they retain water, which is important as summers become increasingly dry. During rainy periods, their system of dams and canals helps with water drainage. And these are just a few examples of what beavers are capable of.Scheme to release beavers into wild in England has stalled, say nature expertsRead moreThat’s why these animals can evoke strong emotions in Dutch nature lovers. Some even think that human structures like transportation routes should work around the presence of beavers. Still, the northern Netherlands has recently introduced controls in the form of zoning – designating red zones where beavers are not welcome and culling is allowed.The state recognises the problem and has now rolled out a national beaver protocol. Previously each of the 12 Dutch provinces had its own beaver regulations, but now there’s one set of rules for everyone. This is a step forward, but in the future the Dutch might need to introduce zoning nationwide. It’s simply not realistic to allow beavers in vulnerable, low-lying polder areas – the risks are just too high.The Dutch beaver experiment comes with a sharp edge in spite of, or maybe because of, its success. Beavers are astounding, industrious environmental engineers – but you need to be quite sure about what you are doing when you invite them in.Renate van der Zee is a Dutch writer and journalistExplore more on these topicsWildlifeOpinionConservationBiodiversityRiversMammalsFarmingNetherlandscommentShareReuse this content"

Next week, in Falmouth in Cornwall, anglers willcompete to fish for bluefin tunain a three-day tournament. Sponsored by companies including Suzuki and Shimano, it’s a festival of cruelty and destruction, waging war on a magnificent giant which, in a rare instance of ecological hope, has begun returning to our shores.Where’s the sport in this “sportfishing”? While some forms of angling require knowledge and skill, in this case the paying customer (the angler) sits in a boat while the professional skipper motors up and down, trailing a set of lures. When a tuna is hooked, the angler, strapped into a harness, either stands or sits in what is called the “fighting chair” and “plays” the fish to exhaustion: a one-sided fight of 30 minutes or more. It’s a risk-free means of pitting yourself against nature, a truly pathetic form of macho gratification. You can imagine my surprise on discovering thatNigel Farage is a big fan.Among the plastic warriors looking for an IRL game they can play from a chair, recreational tuna fishing is booming. While in 2024,93 licences were granted to charter boats and private boatscatering for the market, this year the government hasissued as many as 180. Obviously, the decision is backed by the best possible science, informed by knowledge of populations and of what happens to the fish after they are released …Sorry – went off on one there. Obviously not. The government tells me “there are no estimates of the number of bluefin tuna in UK waters”. There is also a dearth of studies on what happens to tuna once they have been caught and released, and none assessing the impacts of real-world tuna angling in the UK. The best we have is anAustralian studyof real angling conditions, which reports a bluefin survival rate of 83%: in other words, 17% die. The marine ecologist Dr Richard Kirby says mortality in real conditions “is likely to be higher than that seen when bluefin tuna are caught under scientific conditions where the post-release survival of the animal is crucial to the research”.Alongside a study conducted in circumstances far removed from the macho feeding frenzy we see in the videos posted by anglers and charter companies, the UK governmentrelies on skippersreporting fish that die beside the boat. There’s an obvious incentive to undercount. But rest assured: apaper for the governmenttells us “charter vessel interviewees reported no issues with their own reporting”.The great majority of deaths are likely to occur after release. Bluefin tuna arepartially warm-bloodedfish that overheat when forced into sustained flight. After a certain time on the hook, oxygen loss kills their muscle cells. They need to cool down as rapidly as possible once released, by diving deep, where the water is colder.Grey seals, minke whales and bluefin tuna: is the North Sea bouncing back to its glory days?Read moreThis is why the partnership set up by the government,Thunnus UK, states that “care should be taken not to release tuna in water shallower than 50m”. But thecode of conductagreed between the government and the recreational fishing lobby, the Angling Trust, specifies just 40 metres. Could this be because few of the inshore locations where tuna are caught in the UK are 50 metres deep? Even 50 might be too shallow: astudy off Irelandfound tuna immediately diving up to 80 metres after release.Skippers routinely break even this feeble code. I have watched recreational tuna boats fishing in the midst of great shoals of tuna within 100 metres of the shore, where the water is just 15 metres deep.The Falmouth tournament organisers claim that “the welfare of the fish is of paramount importance”. If so, that will be a radical break from common tuna-angling practice. On Facebook and Instagram, you can watch videos of men going mad on testosterone once they hook a fish, while the code of conduct walks the plank.Charter companies boastof two or even three anglers playing fish at once, though the code says “multiple hook-ups have been shown to risk an increase in mortality … Upon hook-up immediately remove other tackle from the water.” As one boat owner remarks, while bragging about a triple hook-up, “the carnage continues”. I have seen videos in whichtwo-hooked luresare used: the code says they should not be deployed “under any circumstances”. Anglers should “keep fight time to a minimum”, as an hour or more “may compromise” survival rates. Yet we see them crowing aboutplaying fish for 90 minutes. The code says “conventional gaffs [long hooks used to pierce the fish and hold it alongside the boat] should not be used”, but this is also ignored.On a podcast a few months ago, a charter boat skipper states: “I’ve seen loads of release shots on social media this year with fish going back.” His reaction? “They’re fucked.” Fishing News reports that for the first time last year, trawlers started pulling up “dead bluefin, some in an advanced state of decomposition … It is highly likely that this is linked to the expansion of the charter angling fishery in 2024.”Until recently, I thought the recreational fishery might become alobby for the tuna’s protectionagainst commercial fishing. What we see instead is a Klondike rush to profit from the male-inadequacy market. The renowned Cornish fisherAndrew Pascoe, who supports recreational angling in principle, says he has noticed some charter boats have started competing over who can catch the most in a day. “That for me was the beginning of the end … you can’t possibly revive the fish properly and catch 18 fish in a day.” Private boats (ie, those not for hire), he says, are the biggest problem. Some have no idea how to handle the fish, which break free, trailing lures, lines and spreader bars: a death sentence.A different industry could be developed, employing local people and generating income: tunawatching. It could be a massive attraction for tourists, photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. I have stood many times at a point on the coast where these vast fish leap from the water, catching garfish, sometimes in mid-air. It’s one of the greatest and most reliable natural spectacles on Earth. Who would not wish to be taken out on a boat to watch this marvel at close hand?I believe that all megafauna, bluefin tuna included, should be treated like whales and dolphins: as animals we no longer hunt or kill. Given that tuna fishing here is still in its infancy, which means the political costs of stopping it remain small, we could create a sanctuary in UK waters for a marvellous species pursued everywhere else. Could we, just for once, get something right?George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistThe Guardian’s climate assembly with George Monbiot and special guestsOn 16 September, join George Monbiot, Mikaela Loach and Emma Pinchbeck as they discuss the forces driving the big climate pushback, with an address by Feargal SharkeyExplore more on these topicsFishOpinionFishingAnimalsMarine lifeWildlifeCornwallcommentShareReuse this content"

It made the wrong oneMartin KettleThe Russian soprano says she has condemned the war and has no affinity with this Kremlin. But hosting her still seems unwiseThu 28 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 12.14 EDTSharePuccini’s Tosca is high on the list of operas I don’t much care if I never see again. So the fact that the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko, unquestionably one of our era’s exceptional opera singers, is due to sing Tosca in a new production at Covent Garden next month does not present me with a dilemma. I won’t be there anyway.It might be more difficult, I admit, if Netrebko was singing Verdi, where she is so outstanding. But this column is not about my taste in opera. It is about something of wider moral importance. Netrebko’s London performances pose complex questions but require straightforward answers. First, is it right for a prestigious British institution, theRoyal Opera House, to be hiring Netrebko while the Ukraine war continues? The answer could in theory be yes, were she to repeat her opposition to the war, but on the current evidence it is no.Second, whether the hiring is right or wrong, what should now happen in the run-up to her premiere here on 11 September? Here, compromise is the least bad outcome for all involved. And, third, how far, if at all, should the arts become a proxy for politics, particularly at critical and brutal moments like the current Russian offensive in the Donbas region? In theory, they should not. In practice, quite simply, they are.As ever, there are many sides to each problem. Thecase against Netrebkois that she is a highly prominent Russian who has praised Vladimir Putin in the past, accepted honours from the Russian state, and who, after Russia’s first war with Ukraine in 2014, was photographed with a pro-Kremlin separatist flag. In 2022, opera houses around the world quickly dispensed with Netrebko’s services when Putin’s armies invaded Ukraine. The war was an existential threat not just to Ukraine, but to Europe and its values – and it still is.Some of these points were set out in a trenchantletter to the Guardianon 14 August, signed by more than 50 Ukrainian writers and artists, a cross-party group of UK MPs, and the former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark. The letter did not mince words. It accused Netrebko of being a “longtime symbol of cultural propaganda for a regime that is responsible for serious war crimes”. It said that nothing significant has changed to justify her hiring, and that the Royal Opera House must choose between its profits and its values.Netrebko’s defence disputes all these points, but adds several others. As a prominent Russian, she argues, she has indeed met Putin, but she is not an ally. As a Russian, she is entitled to accept Russian honours. She did not know the significance of the flag in the 2014 photograph. However, Netrebko also now lives and pays her taxes in Austria. Just after the 2022 invasion she said on social media: “I am opposed to this senseless war of aggression and I am calling on Russia to end this war right now, to save all of us!” She has not been to Russia since 2022, and was attacked for her stance by the head of the Russian Duma. She also argues that, as an artist, she should not be required to take a public stand against her homeland in order to pursue her career.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin congratulates Anna Netrebko after awarding her the People’s Artist of Russia honour, 27 February 2008.Photograph: Dmitry Lovetsky/APNetrebko’s case is clearly different in several important ways – though the extent remains a source of dispute – from that of the Russian conductorValery Gergiev, a regime lickspittle. Gergiev, long a familiar figure in the London musical scene, has repeatedly taken an outright pro-Putin stance, not just on Ukraine. He also led so-called victory concerts for Putin in Syria and in the disputed Russian territory of South Ossetia. Gergiev would probably jump at the chance of leading a similar gig in Ukraine. Netrebko, you suspect, would keep well away.Nevertheless, Covent Garden’s own case is a muddle. The opera house says it has “always been clear” that Russian nationality does not equate with support for Putin, and that Netrebko has “made clear statements” attacking his war. But it also says that things have now changed to allow Netrebko’s return. “Our support forUkrainewas aligned with the global consensus at the time,” the chief executive, Alex Beard, announced. “As the world’s geopolitics have become more complex, our stance has changed to ensure that our actions reflect our purpose and values.”These are weasel words. The suspicion has to be that Covent Garden was always keen to get Netrebko back as soon as it could. She was rumoured to be returning to the RoyalOperain June 2023 but never did. Yet while London hesitated, other big opera houses in Paris, Vienna, Berlinand Milan have brought her in while the war still raged, as early as September 2022 in Vienna’s case. Covent Garden’s reopened door comes only a few months before Netrebko performs at the Paris Opera for the third time since the war began.Soon, the only standout among the world’s glamour opera houses may be the New York Met. The Met boss, Peter Gelb, said this month: “I believe that cultural leaders must stand by their decisions in support of a free and democratic world.” Netrebko is suing the Met. But Covent Garden, like others inEurope, has bent with the wind. Surely, if a Russian star was unacceptable in 2022, they should still be unacceptable in 2025.The Royal Ballet and Opera must reconsider its invitation to Anna Netrebko | LetterRead moreIs there a way through this jungle of conflicting passions and principles? One solution would be for Covent Garden to bow to the critics and pull the Tosca run, or at least Netrebko’s part in it. The chances of that seem nil. Apart from anything else, Covent Garden would face a huge legal bill. Another is that Netrebko could herself pull out and be replaced by Aleksandra Kurzak, who is scheduled to take over the role of Tosca on 24 September. This outcome seems unlikely too. It does not seem in Netrebko’s proud character.It would certainly help if, before 11 September, Netrebko was to say something unambiguous for the British audience in opposition to Putin’s continuing war, and acknowledging the justice of the feelings of the objectors. Covent Garden’s management would be crazy not to press for this to happen in some way.This has been a slow car crash event. It would not have happened if Covent Garden had been smarter about the reputational dangers, and how they are multiplied in the social media age. But, like Donald Trump with Putin in Alaska, Covent Garden imagined it could have the best of both worlds, by flying the Ukrainian flag and hiring Netrebko. It has been proved wrong. Unless something changes, the story in two weeks’ time will not be Netrebko’s singing but the pro-Ukraine protests – outside and perhaps even inside the opera house. It would be an outcome that Britain’s figurehead arts institution has brought entirely upon itself.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 28 August 2025. An earlier version suggested that Anna Netrebko is soon returning to the Paris Opera for the first time since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In fact she appeared there in December 2022 and January 2024. Also a reference to big opera houses in Europe bringing her back incorrectly included Munich.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Australia has managed to maintain diplomatic relations with Iran despite tensions and differences, even acting as an important conduit for other allies.The rapid deterioration of diplomatic relations between Australia and Iran this week was as dramatic as theevidence of Iran’s foreign interference on Australian soil. The Iranian-backed antisemitic attacks are not the first time Iran has meddled in Australian affairs. Iran’s foreign interference in Australia has been building over the years. But the violent attacks against Jewish targets are a marked escalation.Australia accused of not acting on 2023 warnings Iran was harassing and surveilling diasporaRead moreWe might reasonably ask why Australia, and why now? But the more realistic question is, why not Australia? Australia often still thinks of itself as insulated from broader forces but, given Iran’s global history of sponsorship of political violence over the decades, the steady uptick of interference in Australia and its current strategic position, it should not be surprising.For one, foreign interference is one of the remaining means of Iran’s ability to project power. Iran’s conventional military power and diplomatic influence has diminished through years of sanctions and targeted strikes against it. As a result Iran employed an asymmetric strategy, relying on proxy actors to do its bidding while remaining insulated from direct retaliation. Now that these capabilities and proxy actors (Hamas, Hezbollah) are also severely weakened due to Israeli and US operations, malign foreign interference is now one of the few tools left at Iran’s disposal. Whenever Iran has had its back against the wall, the risk of asymmetric attacks, state sponsorship of terrorism and other grey zone tactics increased. As its capacity to project power regionally has been diminished, we can expect to see an increase in global grey zone and foreign interference operations. The foreign interference against Australia is part of this larger dynamic.Second, theIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps(IRGC)-orchestrated attacks against a kosher delicatessen in Sydney and theAdass Israel synagogue in Melbourneare part of Iran’s broader effort to destabilise and undermine democratic nations and target Jewish interests and communities around the world.Iran has a demonstrated track record of attempting to exploit social division and tension through various means and sowing distrust of democratic institutions. It has conducted election interference campaigns, most recently in the US, online influence operations in the UK and various other democratic countries, andattacked Jewish communitiesand places globally. It merely saw another opportunity to do so in Australia and took it.Third, Iran is preoccupied with regime survival and has done whatever it can within its power to not only ward off domestic challenges to its authority but any international interventions to destabilise the regime. The 2022death of 22-year-old Mahsa Aminiat the hands of Iranian “morality police” triggered a global protest movement. Since then Iran has stepped up its foreign interference efforts to ward off momentum.This can include actions to distract and preoccupy but it can also include alleged attempts at assassinations of elected leaders in other countries and the targeting of Iranian dissidents in the diaspora community.There has been longstanding intimidation and harassment of Iranian diaspora communities within Australia critical of the regime. In 2023 the then home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, took the extraordinary step of naming Iran in a speech about Australia’s efforts to combat foreign interference. An Australian Senate select committee inquiry on foreign interference also received several submissions detailing Iran’s intimidation of diaspora communities.What is Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps?Read moreThe Australian government had no choice but to respond decisively to Iran’s latest provocations. Expelling the Iranian ambassador, shutting down Australian operations in Tehran and listing the IRGC as a terrorist entity will have an impact. Removing Iran’s access to an embassy and diplomatic staff in a western democracy will diminish its operational capacity to conduct foreign interference. Listing the IRGC as a terrorist organisation will give additional levers to government.The government has been criticised for being slow to act on listing the IRGC as a terrorist entity, as advocates had been recommending this step for years. But it is a significant and uncharted step to designate an entity like the IRGC that is an arm of a recognised nation state, no matter how problematic its actions are. This is why, despite knowing that the IRGC is a state agent of terrorism, political violence and foreign interference, few states have listed it as such.These actions don’t come without cost. Iran has vowed “reciprocal action” against Australia and it’s a threat that has to be taken seriously. Iran often engages in hostage diplomacy and these measures could trigger retaliatory attacks against Australian interests abroad, another tactic Iran has been known to employ. The measures have essentially cut Australia off from diplomatic engagement with Iran. Given the severity of the level of foreign interference, it is a price that the Australian government is willing to pay for our domestic safety.Lydia Khalil is director of the transnational challenges program at the Lowy Institute and a senior research fellow at the Alfred Deakin InstituteExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionIranAustralian security and counter-terrorismAntisemitismAustralian politicsMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s what we need to do betterNicki HutleyThis is a lucky country for many, with enviable living standards. But our wealth is not shared equallyWed 27 Aug 2025 21.05 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 21.07 EDTShareThe concept of a “fair go” is quintessentially Australian. Yet it appears that our ideas about equality in this country may be increasingly ill-founded, with far-reaching implications.Anew reportlooking at the gap between beliefs and reality concerning wage inequality in a number of countries found that Australians significantly underestimate the number of people with lower-than-average earnings and overestimate how many earn in the top 30%. Their beliefs about what is occurring tend to mirror what they think should be the case rather than what is.The report also showed that we grossly underestimate just how much the big end of town out-earns the rest of us, with survey respondents thinking CEOs (of publicly listed companies) typically earned 7.1 times an average full-time salary. In fact the figure is a staggering 103 times! This is not purely an Australian phenomenon and we should spare a thought for the British and the Americans, where chief executives typically earn a mind-boggling 214 and 269 times the average person, respectively.And it’s not just the blokes (four out of fiveCEOs are men) in the big corner offices contributing to income inequality. The sexily named Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey for 2025 – Hilda – showed economic inequality is now at the highest level since the survey began in 2001. Highest incomesare now growing fasterthan middle incomes, which in turn are growing faster than the lowest incomes, raising the barriers to improve one’s lot in life.Then, of course, there are those who are livingbelow the poverty lineon jobseeker and similar payments. That successive governments from both sides of the aisle can think that this situation is OK is, to me, abhorrent. The antiquated idea of the “dole bludger” is in no way consistent with reality.2:45Gender pay gap: Australian women earn nearly $30,000 less than men a year – videoHowever, income is just one dimension of inequality. Gender is another area where this plays out in multiple dimensions. TheFinancy Women’s Indextells us that, even if we maintain progress in narrowing the gender pay gap, we are still almost two decades away from equal pay. More concerningly, perhaps, there is a four-decade wait to close the gap on the imbalance between men and women when it comes to unpaid work. Women have less representation in offices and boardrooms, higher rates of unemployment and underemployment, and lower super balances when they retire. Until we can address issues including tertiary subject selection, unpaid work, workplace flexibility, universal childcare and so on, gender inequality will persist.Australia is a lucky country for many, with enviable living standards. But our wealth is not shared equally and inequality expresses itself across so many dimensions of our economy and society.It’s time Australia ditched the ‘winners and losers’ mentality and built an economy that’s good for us all | Nicki HutleyRead moreLast weekI wrote of the disadvantagesnow facing Australians in their 30s in terms of earnings, housing affordability, budget burden and climate impacts. Those dimensions of disadvantage also disproportionately affect First Nations Australians, LGBTQI people, those with a disability, those from culturally and linguistically different backgrounds, as well as those who live in our regions. The list is sadly a long one.TheGlobal Social Progress Indexis another a measure of just how far behind some cohorts are. In 2024 Australia ranked an impressive 12 out of 170 countries overall, suggesting we are addressing disadvantage well (although we slipped from eighth place the previous year). Yet, on a number of individual measures, we rank poorly considering the overall wealth of our nation. For example, we rank 90th on a diet low in fruit and vegetables, 50th for access to basic education and 40th for access to quality healthcare. Perhaps less surprising, we rank a miserable 133rd on satisfaction with housing affordability. We know this disadvantage appears unequally across Australia.Despite our understanding of the critical importance of these economic, health, education and other social outcomes, governments of all stripes at state and federal levels continue to underinvest.If you’re still reading, by now you may be feeling that Australia seems a pretty poor excuse for a country. That is not my point. In fact, Australia does incredibly well on so many fronts. The Social Progress Index has us ranked first on quite a number of measures, well ahead of our GDP per-capita ranking of 16, including on access to electricity, household air pollution, gender parity in secondary education attainment and basic sanitation services. Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaideall rankin the world’s top 10 most livable cities.And, despite much public discourse about intergenerational inequality, theProductivity Commission estimatesthat our parents’ income is far less of a determinant of our own potential earnings than in most other countries, including in Scandinavia.The point, rather, is that Australia is a very wealthy country with relatively low levels of government debt and well-developed institutions. This makes it harder to tolerate the evidence of inequality and disadvantage.Last week at the economic roundtable there was a lot of talk about growing the economic pie. We now need to take the substantial resources at our disposal and use them to better effect, to ensure we distribute that pie in better ways and do not let rising inequality become the norm.Nicki Hutley is an independent economist and councillor at the Climate CouncilExplore more on these topicsInequalityOpinionAustralian economyCost-of-living crisisGender pay gapExecutive paycommentShareReuse this content"

I mean, we are the fucking plague, 7.5 billion people, we can’t handle the planet. As you get older, you do wonder: is it going to be a guy with a long beard and long, flowing white robes, or is it just going to be a void? I don’t dwell on it. It’s weird. I feel like I’m still 21. It’s odd and strange.Did you score a lifetime’s supply of bread for directing the Hovis adverts back in the 70s?TeeDubyaBeeNo. But I ate enough Hovis as a kid in Stockton-on-Tees, with cherry jam and butter, toasted – holy shit. I did five Hovis commercials. They were all classics. The most famous is the boy walking up the hill. The first one I shot up near Halifax, in a mining town. Oddly enough, I might go back up there to do my next movie, which is a war movie [Battle of Britain], so I’m well versed in the area.View image in fullscreenScott’s 1973 advert for Hovis.Photograph: PAIt’s incredible that you are still at the top of your game at 87.

I finished my latest film in 34 days. It would normally be 60. Gladiator was 48; normally, 100. I’ve learned to formulate and predetermine, plan on paper and storyboard in my head. That’s why it’s so efficient.My game was tennis. I’ve just had my final knee replacement. I did one in 2012 and the other last week. So that’s the end of tennis. But like any game, the more you practise, the better you get. Forty years of tennis, I became quite good. If I hadn’t played tennis, I’d be a 300lb [136kg] couch potato.Every time I drive back up to Redcar in Yorkshire to visit relatives, I can’t help but notice how Roseberry Topping Hill resembles the dome-like structure on LV-223 in Prometheus. Do you add touches like this for your own amusement?magbearsonRoseberry Topping Hill was our favourite walk. It tickles me that it’s called Roseberry Topping. I used to have a country house in the Cotswolds. It was beautiful, but it was always fucking raining. It was probably built in the 1600s. We’d live by candlelight and I loved all that.

Someone said: “Ask what Arnie gets.” I thought: “I’ll try it out.” I said: “I want what Arnie gets.” When they said yes, I thought: “Fuck me.” But I couldn’t do it. It’s not my thing. It’s like doing a Bond movie. The essence of a Bond movie is fun and camp. Terminator is pure comic strip. I would try to make it real. That’s why they’ve never asked me to do a Bond movie, because I could fuck it up.View image in fullscreenHarrison Ford administers the Voight-Kampff test in Blade Runner, 1982.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyHave you taken the Voight-Kampff [diagnostic empathy] test from Blade Runner yourself?Sagarmatha1953Isn’t that machine great?

Glitter in Their Eyes (2000)Not all the politicking on Gung Ho landed right – Stange Messengers is unbearably clumsy – but Glitter in Their Eyes’ plea for a younger generation not to get hooked on materialism is impressively punchy and potent, abetted by the presence on guitar of her old sparring partner, Television’s Tom Verlaine.19. Don’t Say Nothing (1997)Like its predecessor, Gone Again, Peace and Noise was an album awash with loss and mourning. Don’t Say Nothing sounds like a note to self, a concerted effort to shake free from the torpor of grief and start over: “Gonna straighten up, gonna get well, I’m gonna do something, gonna face the fact.”18. Space Monkey (1978)A streetwise rock’n’roll strut, married to a lyric in which an alien invasion, or possibly the revenge of simians used in space exploration, gets mixed up with the French actor Pierre Clémenti. If Easter was Smith’s most commercial album thus far, you never forgot you were in the presence of a one-off figure.View image in fullscreenSmith in the 70s.Photograph: Dick Barnatt/Redferns17. Paths That Cross (1988)Written for Robert Mapplethorpe after the death of his partner, Sam Wagstaff, the beautiful Paths That Cross offers a warm, optimistic view of eternity as “a glow we all will know”. Given that Mapplethorpe was also sick – he died within a year of the song’s release – you suspect Smith was equally engaged in preparing herself for his loss.16. Frederick (1979)Wave received a mixed response – its poppy smoothness taken as evidence that Smith’s heart was no longer in it – but has grown in stature over the years. Frederick, the opener, is just fantastic, an unabashed proclamation of love that sounds almost giddy with excitement.15. Privilege (Set Me Free) (1978)In the same way that Horses’ opening track transformed Van Morrison’s Gloria, so Privilege took the title song from the 1967 film about a pop star turned fake messiah and interpolated it with Psalm 23. What emerged was a song that seemed to speak loudly about Smith’s increasingly complex and troubled attitude to fame.14. Redondo Beach (1975)On release, Rolling Stone called Horses “as original an original as they come”. Certainly, I struggle to think of another song like Redondo Beach, the grim story of a girl’s suicide on a beach patronised by gay men and women, set to an incongruously jaunty reggae-infused backing.View image in fullscreenBackstage in New York, 1975.Photograph: Charles Steiner/Getty Images13. Dream of Life (1988)For an album with a decidedly varied reputation amongPatti Smithfans – not everyone loves its straightforward, distinctly 80s-hued rock approach – Dream of Life has a remarkable number of great songs on it. The title track is a case in point: think of it as an older, wiser relation of Because the Night.12. Mother Rose (2004)A reflection on the death of Smith’s mother, written from the perspective of a daughter who is now a mother herself, this is the highlight of Trampin’. “It’s not a grieving song … hopefully a really pretty song,”she clarifiedafter its release. It is, indeed, utterly lovely: tender and atmospheric.11. This Is the Girl (2012)Right from the start, Smith was big on writing about her dead heroes. The passing of Amy Winehouse added her to the pantheon of lost inspirations. This Is the Girl has a hint of Winehouse’s retro soul sound– or perhaps Smith’s beloved doo-wop – about it; the lyric is affecting, tender and maternal.10. Gone Again (1996)This was the last song Smith wrote with her husband, Fred “Sonic” Smith, before his death, an event that transformed it from a paean to indigenous American culture to a eulogy for its co-author and a meditation on the transience of life: “The ashes’s rain / Death’s own bed / Man’s own kin / Into the wind.”View image in fullscreenSmith in 1974.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images9. Free Money (1975)As close as Horses got to punk rock as the world would come to understand it – check out Penetration’s 1978 cover to hear how easily its three-chord riff adapted to the subsequent sonic template – with remarkably prosaic lyrics about winning the lottery. Its gradual build in pace is thrilling.8. Piss Factory (1974)The deconstructed cover of Hey Joe on the A-side of Smith’s debut single was great, but the B-side is something else: autobiographical provincial ennui set to guitar and piano, its climactic burst of manifesting – “I’m gonna go on that train and go to New York City / I’m gonna be somebody!” – exhilarating and stirring.7. Land: Horses/Land of a Thousand Dances/La Mer(de) (1975)Nine and a half incredible minutes that meld together the saga of a locker-room rape, a garage-band cover of the old R&B standard – best known in Wilson Pickett’s 1966 version – references to cocaine, Smith’s favourite poet (“go Rimbaud!”) and “the sea of possibilities”. It sounds like nothing else, yet still rocks in time-honoured style.6. People Have the Power (1988)Watch the video.Smith’s great latter-day anthem has had a long afterlife: it has turned up as U2’s live intro music and the theme for the 2004Vote for Change campaignin the US. It’s obvious why: its rabble-rousing is optimistic and effective, its message – “the people have the power to redeem the work of fools” – perennially consoling.5. Beneath the Southern Cross (1996)An extraordinary waltz-time dispatch from the depths of grief, Smith’s voice somewhere between incantation and a wail, that gradually builds from abjection to a kind of catharsis – “crossover boy!” – backed by ghostly guitar noise and an ethereal backing vocal (the last thing Jeff Buckley recorded).Patti Smith review – utterly transformed by the power of musicRead more4. Pissing in a River (1976)After the gamechanging explosion of Horses, its disjointed follow-up, Radio Ethiopia, divided opinion. Amid its confused stylistic lurches, the one thing everything seemed to agree on was that Pissing in a River’s brooding, glowering, increasingly desperate depiction of love gone sour was a slow-burning masterpiece.3. Dancing Barefoot (1979)Smith has claimed that, growing up, she thought the coolest thing was “to be an artist’s mistress”. The finest song on Wave – subsequently covered by U2, Pearl Jam, Shakespears Sister and the Mission – was inspired byJeanne Hébuterne, Modigliani’s muse and mistress, who died by suicide two days after the artist’s death.2. Because the Night (1978)An unfinished Bruce Springsteen song, completed by Smith, Because the Night was parachuted on to Easter by the producer Jimmy Iovine in the quest for a big hit. It duly became one, partly because it was the most straightforward rock anthem Smith recorded, but mostly because it’s an incredible, irresistible song.1 Gloria: In Excelsis Deo (1975)Listen to Gloria.Smith’s debut album began with one of the most celebrated opening lyrics in pop history. But “Jesus died for somebody’s sins but not mine” was far from the most radical thing about Smith’s reimagining of Them’s garage-rock standard. It turns it inside out, transforming it from a song about male sexual desire to one about sexual desire from which men are excluded, sung in a voice unlike anything anyone had heard before: supremely cool and tough, but distinctly female. It was as if Smith was creating a new space – an “atmosphere where anything’s allowed”, as another lyric put it – before your ears.The 50th anniversary edition of Horses is released on 10 October on Legacy Recordings.

Its director and co-stars take us behind the scenesThu 28 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 05.10 EDTShareAtoo-pure young man, training to be a doctor, scion of the wealthiest imaginable family, meets a smoking hot young woman, but is she who she seems? His mother thinks not. The quickest way to describe The Girlfriend is to say that it’s sort of perfect. The perspectives shift between that of Cherry, the girlfriend (Olivia Cooke), and that of Laura, the mother (Robin Wright, who also directs). Whoever’s take you are watching, that’s who you believe. Baroque events, blood and guts, flagrant lies – it all unfurls in exquisite interiors and idealised London street scenes.It is compulsive. I bit my nails to shreds. It’s not clear who’s the psychopath, but someone is – and the crisscrossing erotic tension gives it the inevitability of Greek tragedy. People this irresistible to one another never end up at peace.“This is a triangular love story,” Wright begins, speaking to me from “the countryside”; she is still based in the UK since shooting The Girlfriend last year. “In a different world, Laura and Cherry would have been best friends, because they’re so alike. Their love for this one young man is from two different fields. A mother that’s possessive and overprotective – is she just being paranoid about this girlfriend, or is the girlfriend not to be trusted?”So far, so universal. “That’s just intrinsic to being a mother,” says Wright. “OK, who’s going to be good enough for my child? And it’s going to be slim pickings.”View image in fullscreen‘My mum has never liked my boyfriends at all’ …Olivia Cooke in The Girlfriend.Photograph: Christopher Raphael/PrimeIt’s not even just a mother-son thing, Cooke says, down the line from Mallorca where she is on holiday. “My mum, with boyfriends that me and my sister have had, has not liked them at all. Once a mum sniffs a malignancy in the person her son or daughter is with, it’s hard for her to brush that aside. And I can read people pretty well – I’ve never been out with anyone overtly hideous.”But this story isn’tthatuniversal – the super-rich parents, Laura and Howard (Waleed Zuaiter), are in an open marriage, where Howard has a long-term lover but yearns for Laura’s attention. Their son Daniel (Laurie Davidson), meanwhile, either has an earth-shattering connection with his girlfriend Cherry, or she’s playing him. And there is a quasi-incestuous flavour to Laura and Daniel right at the centre.“We’re in so much competition now with content,” says Wright. “How racy everything is, how much shock value it has. We had to up the ante and have the mother kiss the son, which is so fucked up, so weird. And yet, it happens.”So much hangs on the physicality of Laura and Cherry, their contrasting magnetism: Wright polished and elegant, always wearing camel; Cherry pneumatic and spellbinding, like a siren. “Her sensuality, and the way she looks, was a whole monster itself,” says Cooke. “Especially for me – I feel much more comfortable when the focus isn’t on how I look. But maybe getting older [she is 31] has made me a bit more comfortable in my body; for a long time I was playing younger than I actually was, so there was more androgyny.”Cooke’s breakthrough role, 10 years ago, was inMe and Earl and the Dying Girl, and the contrast between that frailty and this vitality is heady. “She’s a bull, you know – she’s an ox,” Wright says, about Cooke. “She’s an animal. She’s great.”All I can think is: the intimacy coordinator on this must have really had their hands full. “That is the new world,” Wright says, wearing her director’s hat. “The intimacy coordinator talks to the actor first, then they come to you and say, ‘This is what they’re willing to do, this is what they’re not willing to do,’ and you morph around that. OK, let’s find a way to display what the original thought was, with those restrictions. And it worked out OK, because what we got in the show is enough.”If Cherry is hiding who she is, says Cooke, who can blame her? “I reckoned with it and thought, ‘Well, the billionaire class, they lie and steal and behave abhorrently all the time. Cherry saying a few half-truths – is it really that bad?’” If Laura, in her late 50s – Wright is 59 – is still rushing headlong at her sexual destiny, that’s “a quality I think the business needs, and I think they’re realising that: get these women that are in their last chapter, don’t curtail it. Just let it live for what it is. Because it is life. Why stop at 40 years of age? Like, get the women at 60, at 70.”“Robin invented event television, didn’t she?” says Cooke – talking about House of Cards, of course, the US remake of the British political thriller. Wright remembers David Fincher approaching her about it, in 2011, while they were making The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. He said: “It will be a platform there has never been before, called streaming. Anyone and everyone can watch it, whenever they want it, as much as they want it. You won’t know until the end of each season if you get picked up again for the next season. Do you want to be a part of it?” It was a gamble for Wright, who had been celebrated on the big screen since The Princess Bride in 1987; the long-form possibilities of the box set were only just beginning to be realised. “You weren’t expecting art, from TV,” she remembers.Having watched Wright on The Girlfriend, Cooke would love to direct, herself: “But I wouldn’t want to be in it as well. Robin did it with such grace and effortlessness, but it just looks like so much work.”Wright’s next project is a film called Bingo, “about a young boy who falls in love with a 70-year-old woman. And they’re soulmates. They both want to kill themselves for different reasons, and they meet in the hospital, and they fall in love. It’s a beautiful story, and no one wants to accept it because of the age difference. But you know what? It doesn’t matter. Love is love. Connection is connection. Go with it.”The Girlfriend is on Prime Video on 10 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTelevisionAutumn arts preview 2025Robin WrightDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a love letter to our elders, says its writerJN BenjaminThu 28 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 06.30 EDTShare“Black Power. The words can send shivers down the spine of the nervous white man,” begins the 2021 BBC documentary Black Power: A British Story of Resistance, which takes a closer look at the movement from the 1960s to the present day. The quote, delivered by a male voice in a plummy accent evocative of a different era, is clipped from a news report aired by the same broadcaster in the 1970. Although at the time those words were perhaps just as likely to send shivers down the spine of the knowing Black man.By then, the Metropolitan police had set up a covert surveillance operation designed to decapitate Black activism in the UK by targeting the movement’s leaders. The special branch unit was established in 1967 by the Labour home secretary Roy Jenkins, and named the Black Power Desk. Its scope was profoundly intrusive. The Black Power Desk remained active into the 1990s, incorporated into the Met’s Special Demonstration Squad; in 2018, the Undercover Policing Inquiry confirmed that a number of officers unlawfully entered into intimate relationships with members of the movement as part of the operation.View image in fullscreenRochelle Rose in rehearsals for Black Power Desk.Photograph: Ali PainterThis fascinating and relatively unknown period of British history is the inspiration behind a new musical about to open in London. Originally conceived as part of an artist development programme at south London’s Old Vic, Black Power Desk will premiere at the Brixton House theatre. It is the perfect home: since the venue’s opening three years ago, it has been working to establish itself as the place to showcase stories made for, by and about Black communities. The area itself is also steeped in rich Black British history relevant to the musical’s themes. Back in the day, some factions of the Black Power movement organised on the venue’s neighbouring streets.The location for the production’s premiere was incredibly important to playwright Urielle Klein-Mekongo: “I didn’t want to make a show that couldn’t be shown to the culture first, blessed by the culture first, consecrated by the culture first.” When she started developing the musical seven years ago, the Mangrove Nine – a group of two women and seven men of West Indian heritage known for being part of the British Black Power movement – were little known outside west London. Named after the Mangrove, a Notting Hill restaurant run by civil rights activist Frank Crichlow that became a lively community hub, the group worked to advance the rights of Black people in the UK.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t want to make a show that couldn’t be shown to the culture first’ … Playwright Urielle Klein-Mekongo.Photograph: Ali PainterFast forward to 2020, and the group’s story had gone mainstream, thanks in large part to director Steve McQueen’s anthology series Small Axe. The series opens with a 90-minute film that chronicles their story, including their landmark 1971 trial at the Old Bailey, in which they were accused of inciting a riot at a protest march. All members of the group were acquitted of the most serious charges against them, and it marked the first time that institutional racism within the Met Police was officially recognised – a monumental victory for UK civil rights.Was it annoying that Small Axe was released first? “I was annoyed for sure!” Klein-Mekongo laughs. “I thought: You could have hired me! I could have been in it!” Jokes aside, she found the arrival of a prominent adaptation very useful, and paid close attention in particular to how it was received by those from and close to the movement, many of whom are still alive. “He got his research right, but I know there’s a bunch of elders who didn’t necessarily approve of how certain things were put; some of them were quite vocal about that.” Gaining their approval has been a guiding motivation for her: “This is a love letter to them.”McQueen’s Small Axe wasn’t the first time a television series had shone a light on the British Black Power movement. It was watching John Ridley’s Guerilla, a six-part series that aired on Sky Atlantic in 2017, that planted in Klein-Mekongo the seeds of inspiration for Black Power Desk. At the time, the series washeavily criticisedby veterans of the movement for the “unforgivable” erasure of Black women within the British Black Panthers. That omission piqued Klein-Mekongo’s curiosity.UK Black history has only been slightly interjected in the curriculum here and there“They had a south Asian woman [Freida Pinto] playing the head of the rebellion and I just thought: This isn’t making sense to me. How did they get here?” At this point, she also realised she knew very little about Black British history: “In mainstream schools, UK Black history has only been slightly interjected in the curriculum here and there … Why do I know more about Rosa Parks? Why do I know more about Martin Luther King? The Mangrove Nine should be on the UK curriculum.” From there, she began her own independent research.Black Power Desk is set in the year after the Mangrove Nine trial, with real figures and events from the Black British civil rights movement providing the backdrop for the action on stage. Rochelle Rose and Veronica Carabai take the lead as sisters Celia and Dina, who are trying their best to support each other in the aftermath of their mother’s death, while racial tensions between the state and Black communities bubble up all around them. But they are also in conflict with each other. A “central theme” of the play, Klein-Mekongo says, is the dichotomy between “your activism versus your humanity”. The tension is embodied in the difference between the two sisters: Dina is willing to fight for her community, while Celia doesn’t necessarily want to be defined by her activism.View image in fullscreenHistory repeating … A demonstration in Brixton, south London, by the Black Workers’ Movement in 1973.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesKlein-Mekongo worked alongside dramaturg Gail Babb to develop the script. Originally it was a musicalised verbatim account of the Mangrove Nine trial. Then with each draft, the team considered the potential ramifications of their approach. There was the question of ownership: who has the right to tell this story?The two are aware that making art about living people has ethical implications. Black Britons, Babb says, “all have a claim and part ownership of the stories that happened in this country, of stories that happened to communities we’re a part of, to ancestors we’ve come from”. However, “having a stake in a story doesn’t mean you get to tell it however you want, for whatever purpose you want”. This led them to take a change in direction – and fictionalise the plot instead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When thinking about why something like this has not been done before, it’s easy to be cynical; that the industry often conflates work about Black lives with increased risk is no secret. In Klein-Mekongo’s experience, “new work is struggling to raise money and pull things together to even get a moment on stage. They love us when they want a nice gospelly, sassy Dreamgirls moment, but do they ever want to hear the Black British voice?”View image in fullscreenMusical notes … (from left) composer Renell Shaw; actor and lyricist Gerel Falconer; director Gbolahan Obisesan; and writer Urielle Klein-MekongoPhotograph: Ali PainterBlack talent is more often used in service of existing narratives outside their direct experience, as can be seen in the 2023 production of Sylvia at the Old Vic, which saw the acclaimed singer-songwriter and actor Beverley Knight play noted socialist campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst. “The story doesn’t belong to us, but they’re gonna use our spice to season their sauce,” says Klein-Mekongo.A more generous reading considers the time that has passed since the events in question. Fifty years may seem like a long time, but the 70s was only one generation ago. This is the first time that telling this story this way – examining it as a significant moment in history – has been possible.“It’s hard to know how significant the small, everyday things in your life are; it’s hard to tell when you’re living through history,” Babb says, before recounting a decades-old anecdote about stopping to chat to the poet and prominent Black Power activist Linton Kwesi Johnson in a random encounter on the streets of south London’s Lewisham – he and her father were friends – and thinking nothing of it at the time. “I think we forget how special our lives are.”As it opens, Black Power Desk is a powerful reminder that the history of our existence in this country is not only worth knowing, but it’s also worthy of celebration.Black Power Deskis at Brixton House from1to 28 September then touring to Warwick Arts Centre, Lowry and Birmingham Hippodrome.Explore more on these topicsStageBlack British cultureRaceMusicalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first track, Look at You, starts out with softly sung vocals over a cushion of equally soft synthesiser chords, before stopping dead, then re-emerging as almost an entirely different song: harmonies over guitar chords strummed so slowly you can hear the plectrum hitting each individual string. The second, Thinking Clean, offers a piano over pattering hi-hats: there’s something anticipatory about it, like an intro that’s about to burst into life, but when it does – complete with dancefloor rhythm – the song swiftly falls apart. The piano becomes increasingly abstract, before everything gives way to scrabbling, apparently improvised cello.View image in fullscreenBlood Orange: Essex Honey.Photograph: RCA/PAIt’s a lot to cram into six minutes, but anyone familiar with Blood Orange’sback cataloguemight reasonably ask: what did you expect? Since he adopted the name, Hynes’s career has occasionally intersected with the mainstream, although never in a straightforward way. His biggest track,Champagne Coast, was belatedly hoisted to platinum status by a burst of TikTok virality, 14 years after release. As a producer and songwriter, his name has appeared in the credits of albums by major pop artists including Mariah Carey and Kylie Minogue, but never as a dependable hit-maker, more a signal that said artist is craving a hint of left-field cool. His albums exist in their own world, filled with unexpected musical jump-cuts, their variety indicated by the featured artists: Skepta and Debbie Harry, Nelly Furtado next to Yves Tumour, A$AP Rocky alongside Arca.The results, while admirably eclectic, could often be too scattered for their own good. But Essex Honey feels like a noticeably different animal to its predecessors. The eclecticism is present and correct. This is an album on which a song called The Train (King’s Cross), which closely resembles old-fashioned Sarah Records indie pop, exists alongside one called Life, which with its snail’s pace funk, wah-wah guitar, falsetto vocals and bursts of sickly woodwind sounds not unlike something Prince might have made in the wee small hours. So, too, are those musical jump-cuts. Cæcilie Trier’s cello appears regularly, usually as tracks end, playing stuff that doesn’t sound interstitial so much as disruptive. There are moments when sounds suddenly emerge then vanish just as quickly, oddly disconnected to anything around them: a burst of keyboards beforeSomewhere in Betweengets under way, a piano line in betweenMind Loadedand Vivid Light that sounds as if it’s fallen off the breakdown of an old hardcore rave tune.Blood Orange: The Field – videoAnd yet, in marked contrast to previous Blood Orange albums, all the constituent elements are held together by tone and a sense of place. Its primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy: there’s a hazy, sunlit quality to a lot of the sounds here – soft but warm synthesisers, electric piano and harmony vocals – and a chilly morning crispness about the undistorted electric guitar. The melodies are frequently gorgeous, but inescapably sad. Inspired by the death of Hynes’s mother, the lyrics evoke both Greater London’s urban sprawl – “Ilford is the place that I hold dear,” he sings on The Last of England – and its more pastoral surroundings, the latter a relief from “the broken light” of the city on Countryside.It’s also an album on which memories provide a brief respite from looming tragedy. “Regressing back to times you know / Playing songs you forgot you owned,” Hynes sings on Westerberg, a song that duly borrows its chorus from the Replacements’ 1987 single Alex Chilton. Elsewhere, there are interpolations of tracks by Yo La Tengo and Everything But the Girl’s Ben Watt: an extraordinarily lovely sample from 1998’s Sing to Me earns the Durutti Column a credit onThe Field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

There’s a heartbreaking moment when Lorde’s voice soars out during Mind Loaded, singing the phrase “everything means nothing to me” – an interpolation of the Elliott Smith song of the same name – and an impressively witty one during Vivid Light, when a line about writer’s block is delivered by novelist Zadie Smith. But for the most part, the guests stay in the background, out of the spotlight. They’re there in service to the songs and an atmosphere that continues to haunt you long after Essex Honey ends: grief marshalling a unique talent into music that’s desperately sad, but beautiful, a particularly resonant broadcast from Blood Orange’s irregular world.This week Alexis listened toDeftones – I Think About You All the TimeAn early standout from Private Music: the Deftones’ shoegaze-y side turned up to 10, a heaving, emotive chorus.Explore more on these topicsDev HynesAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockExperimental musicR&BreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is often where the best stories are and where Esoteric Ebb takes its inspiration.Part tabletop game, part RPG, you play as a cleric who has been sent to investigate the destruction of a tea shop in the city Norvik, which is about to hold its first ever election in five days. You’ll talk (and occasionally fight) with the local residents to uncover the truth and affect the outcome of the election. Or perhaps you’ll just fight some seagulls. You can choose your own path, but, much like in D&D, your success comes down to dice rolls and having to live with the consequences if you fail them.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to do something entirely different’ … Esoteric Ebb.Photograph: Christoffer Bodegård“Every single choice available in the game is something that I anticipated,” says writer and developer Christoffer Bodegård. It’s particularly impressive because every interaction in even a tiny area of the game feels so open-ended. All of the dialogue choices and touching of random objects have been thoughtfully considered by Bodegård to give the feeling of freedom in a confined space. The experience of playing D&D and your players doing unexpected things has come together in the game.As a cleric you may be taking on the role of a detective, but you can cast spells to read people’s minds to gain an advantage or even speak to the dead to uncover other lines of inquiry. Your cleric is entirely your own as you can customise their accessories – and their personality, with classic D&D stats such as charisma and strength. You could make yourself strong but with low intelligence so you might win a fight but not be smart enough to get a truthful answer out of anyone because your dice rolls can never get high enough.“At some point I was like, well, I play so much D&D, why not just make my own homebrew?” Bodegård says. “I wanted to do something entirely different, and that’s what inspired the basis of the world of Esoteric Ebb, which is just taking D&D and looking at it from a weird, esoteric, realistic angle. Like, what if these spells actually did exist? How would governments form? How would various powers exist in relation to these actual D&D mechanics? If we can create food and water from a spell, how does that affect the economy? And just looking at it from that perspective.”Norvik may look like a small, medieval-style city on the surface, but because so much consideration has been put into how the place works with its various political parties and citizens, it feels like a real place. Just one with monsters working at shops, and magic. Bodegård’s focus on the depth of the setting and the sheer scope of all the dialogue choices makes for an enticing prospect. “As long as I’m entertained by the thing I’m writing, I can keep writing, and the second I’m bored, I stop.”Esoteric Ebb is in development for PC; due for release in 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCIndie gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she’s happy, I look forward to hearing yet more poundingly relatable lyrics – based on real, lasting loveTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce announce engagement on social mediaThu 28 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 28 Aug 2025 04.02 EDTShareTaylor Swift wrote today’s headlines when she was only 17 with her country hit Love Story: “Baby, just say yes!” Now, at 35, she has announced her engagement to Travis Kelce, her American football player partner of two years, who got down on one knee and popped the question. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” she captioned the subsequently staged engagement photos of them in a rose garden. It’s gaudy, it’s cringe, it’s gleefully too much – some even say it makes theBezos weddinglook classy. But it’s perfect and it made me cry.When the pop star who has soundtracked your entire adult love life gets engaged, it’s discombobulating. Especially when they are similar in age. Over two decades, Swift has gifted a song for every crush, relationship, situationship, and heartbreak. (I even once plagiarised All Too Well lyrics in a very embarrassing email to an ex-boyfriend; he never did reply to my calling him “so casually cruel in the name of being honest”.)But marriage is new territory. Similarly to when a mate tells me they’re getting married, my delight over the news has been chased by bittersweet pangs of change and reflection: what role does Swift’s music play in our romantic lives now?Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

On the one hand, you could slot yourself into the lyrics of the story she’s telling: “Please don’t be in love with someone else,” she hoped in Enchanted. But then, you could go and find out exactly who she is writing about: “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?” she asked in Dear John, presumed by many to be about her musician ex John Mayer, which Swift never confirmed or denied. This triggered a global obsession with her relationships, but it has never stopped her writing about them, thank God. Weirdly, she makes dating famous people juicyandrelatable.When we reached our 20s, ready to bite back at bad boys,the Red albumwas the ultimate bible of breakup bangers. Who didn’t fall to the floor screaming “OH!” when I Knew You Were Trouble came on? But she was at her most vulnerable, too, in All Too Well – a power ballad that even now pierces me with the pain of life after short-lived loves. The next album, 1989, was more upbeat but just as scathing: I’m not ashamed to say that, during the peak of Blank Space, I clinked my drained wine glass at a dinner, stood up and announced: “Boys only want love if it’s torture”.Then Swift fell in love. Her 2017 album Reputation might have been vengeful, but the industry was the target, because her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn was actually nice! A classically handsome actor (“What can I say? You’re gorgeous”) who scratched her English thesp itch and was happy to shelter with her away from the bullshit (“He built a fire just to keep me warm”). Only someone totally lost in a cloud of sparkly love could then seriously release saccharine odes Me! and London Boy.Taylor Swift: All Too Well (10-minute version) – videoThey stayed together for six years and during that time she turned to writing more fictional songs, sometimes with Alwyn, on lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore. Look, I was happy for Swift and enjoyed ditties about the heiress Rebekah Harkness, former owner of Swift’s mansion, having a marvellous time ruining everything … but when she and Alwyn called it quits and she quickly started dating the 1975’s Matty Healy, I was ready for the real-life dramas she essayed between her and Healy in last year’s The Tortured Poets Department.This time, though, the breakup with Alwyn hit differently: Swift was talking about the end of a long-term relationship in her 30s. “I’m pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free,” she sings in So Long, London (the couple lived near Hampstead Heath). It’s a haunting line: not even a superstar such as Swift is immune from the pressures of the biological clock and milestones put on women.Perhaps that realisation is why her relationship with Kelce feels properly joyful. Kelce declared that he fancied her on his podcast. They met up, fell in love and are now engaged. They don’t try to hide how besotted they are. “No one’s ever had me, not like you,” she swoons in So High School, a song about Kelce on TTPD sister album The Anthology. Marrying the jock feels like a full circle moment for the self-styled outsider teenager who sang: “She wears high heels, I wear sneakers / She’s cheer captain and I’m on the bleachers.” Where does she go from here?No need to calm down: how Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement broke the internetRead moreSwift has promised that her forthcoming 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, will be a set of poppy bangers about her life on the Eras tour – which, a few months in, Kelce became part of. Beyond that, perhaps Swift will connect with maturing fans by writing about thereallove story: meeting at a time when they, like the rest of us, don’t have time to waste on red flags and maybes. She would be writing on new ground: secure and settled. And those songs would be welcome.In the closing song of her 1989 album, You Are in Love, she sings: “I understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars / And why I’ve spent my whole life trying to put it into words.” She has done this for millions of women and always will – even if she ends up starting a family and opening a Christmas tree farm, going back to her childhood roots.And, for those who might need it in the next decade, there’s always the possibility of a killer divorce album.Hollie Richardson is the Guardian’s assistant TV editorExplore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftTravis KelcePop and rockWeddingsRelationshipsYoung peopleWomencommentShareReuse this content"

So, yes, I’m coming out and saying it: I believe in aliens.”The black comedy directed by Stone’s frequent collaborator Yorgos Lanthimos premieres in competition on the Lido on Thursday night.It is Lanthimos’s third film in three years, all of which starred Stone. The Greek director won the Golden Lion at Venice two years ago for his gothic comedy Poor Things. It went on to win four Oscars, including best actress for Stone.Bugonia also stars Jesse Plemons (who featured in Lanthimos’s Kinds of Kindness last year) as a conspiracist beekeeper, and Aidan Delbis as his partner in crime. The script was written by The Menu co-writer Will Tracy and is an English-language remake of Jang Joon-hwan’s 2003 South Korean film Save the Green Planet!Stone said she loved working with Lanthimos. “I love the material that he’s drawn to and the worlds he wants to explore, and the characters that he’s been generous enough to let me try my hand at.”She described Bugonia as particularly “reflective of this point in time in our world” and a “really fascinating and moving, funny and fucked up, and alive” project.Lanthimos said he was “immediately blown away” by the script.“I wouldn’t necessarily call it a dystopic film,” the director said. “If anything, this film says this is happening now. Humanity is facing a reckoning very soon, people need to choose the right path in many ways otherwise I don’t know how much time we have – with technology, with AI, with wars, and [with] the denial of all these things, how desensitised we’ve become to them.”There was disappointment when George Clooney did not appear at a press conference for his film, Jay Kelly, which is directed by Noah Baumbach and also premieres on Thursday.The actor was reportedly recovering from a sinus infection. “Even movie stars get sick,” Baumbach said.Clooney stars as a famous actor facing a late-career reckoning while crisscrossing Europe with his loyal manager and best friend, played by Adam Sandler. The cast includes Laura Dern and Billy Crudup.Baumbach said he and co-writer Emily Mortimer created the role for Clooney. “It was really important that the audience watching the movie have a relationship with the actor. We all, watching it, have a history with George, just the way the people in the movie have a history with Jay,” he said.“I’m not one to get emotional on set, generally, watching things, but I really did on this movie.”Explore more on these topicsEmma StoneVenice film festivalFestivalsAlien lifenewsShareReuse this content"

She said Ellis, a security guard for the building, followed her to her fifth-floor appointment. Cardi said she heard Ellis say her name into a phone and appeared to be filming her. Cardi feared Ellis would out the fact that she was pregnant.“I told her: ‘Why are you recording?’” Cardi testified. “And she said: ‘Oh, my bad.’ She practically apologized.’”But the argument grew increasingly heated, she said. “As we were arguing she’s backing me, she’s walking into me,” Cardi said.Both women are 32 years old and about the same height, but Cardi said Ellis was bigger than her.“She is like, security-heavy,” Cardi said. “She just looks a little, like she could protect the building.”Under friendlier questioning from one of her own attorneys, Cardi explained why she was keeping her pregnancy secret at the time, seven months after the release of her first major label single and major hit, Bodak Yellow, when she was still in her“freshman year” of stardom.View image in fullscreenEmani Ellis.Photograph: MEGA/GC Images“I was getting used to things,” she said. “I was just so worried about what everybody was saying and thinking. I thought I was letting a lot of people down.”But she said, beyond that, she treasures her privacy on all medical matters, “especially something so sacred as a pregnancy. It’s yours.”A significant chunk of the testimony was spent on the acrylic nails with rhinestones Cardi had that week, and whether they could do the damage that’s alleged. “It wasn’t a shape that was harming, it was coffin-shaped,” she said. “They weren’t sharp.”Ellis testified earlier in the trial that the incident left her humiliated and traumatized, and the scar on her face required cosmetic surgery. Ellis, who lost her job over the incident, is seeking damages that include medical expenses, compensation for emotional and physical suffering, and lost wages, along with punitive damages. She does not specify a total amount in the lawsuit but Cardi said from the stand that she is “suing me for $24m”.Tierra Malcolm, the receptionist from the doctor’s office who got between the two women and broke up the argument, gave testimony on Wednesday that mostly supported Cardi’s account.She said she came into the hallway after hearing a ruckus outside but saw no physical fighting. She later noticed a scratch on her own face that she assumed came from Ellis, because she had been facing her with her back to Cardi.Asked to characterize the argument, Malcolm said she wasn’t sure if she could swear in court. “We’ve heard just about everything so far, so it’s OK,” Judge Ian C Fusselman said to laughs from much of the courtroom.The testimony came at a small courthouse outsideLos Angelesin Alhambra, where trials involving celebrities are very rare. The trial is taking the rest of the week off and is expected to resume, and conclude, next week.Explore more on these topicsCardi BLaw (US)Los AngelesRapnewsShareReuse this content"

The caption accompanied a video graphic that reads: “The summer we started acting normal online.”The show isn’t real but the people playing the characters arepic.twitter.com/csqsKEB2v9— The Summer I Turned Pretty (@thesummeritp)August 26, 2025On X the show’s account also reshared an earlier “PSA for the Summer community” posted before the season three premiere in July, which instructed fans that there was a “zero tolerance policy for bullying and hate speech”.Now on its eighth of 11 episodes in its third and final season, The Summer I Turned Pretty has become a runaway hit for Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service – as well as attracting a vocal fanbase.‘Fear of missing out’ keeping girls and young women online despite sexismRead moreBased on the novels of the same name by Jenny Han, the series follows Belly Conklin (Lola Tung) as she finds herself in a love triangle with two brothers competing for her attention: Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno).Online the fanbase is split into two warring camps – team Conrad v team Jeremiah. Many posts poke fun at the actions of each love interest as well as Belly’s wavering – though, as the show has moved towards its climactic finale, its stars and creators have spoken out about the sometimes vitriolic nature of the posts.“When people have an attachment to the characters, they want to see it come together at the end,” Tung toldTeen Voguein July. “But people get a little scary about it. Please don’t threaten to kill someone if something doesn’t go your way – I promise you, it’s not that serious.”ANew York TimesQ&A last week asked Casalegno about playing “one of the internet’s most hated boyfriends” – to which he responded that he no longer checked Instagram.“Amazon did a good job of stepping in and being like, ‘Hey, no bullying,’” he said. “Though, not really going so well.”Variety reported that Casalegno had received public death threats for his role as Jeremiah as well as previous backlash over his social media activity, including for liking conservative political posts.Sources close to the production told Variety that Amazon had issued the warning as producers have seen “more opportunity for toxic behaviour online” – namely “anonymous, overly harsh criticisms”.Amazon’s statement comes one day after Han shared her own thoughts. “I know fans of the show are passionate and no one has bad intent,” the author wrote in an Instagram story on Tuesday. “But even in jest, posting images of a woman being slapped or choked is not funny.”The final season of The Summer I Turned Pretty ends on 17 September.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionCyberbullyingOnline abuseInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the drug smuggling across the Sahara racket. Alas, these are wise words that young cartel driver Max (Alfie Allen, bringing exactly the reckless high energy the character and venture require) has failed to heed. We first meet him speeding across the Algerian portion of the north African desert with a companion called Carlos (Nezar Thalal) on their way to Beirut to exchange a great deal of cocaine for some antique statues, when bish, bash, wallop, what’s happening?! An ambush by a militant group armed with machine guns who kill Carlos and are about to kill Max? But then one of the group turns on the others and kills all of them stone dead instead, before flinging Max and the coke in the car and hightailing it out of there? Thatiswhat’s happening! Goodness me and welcome to the first 37 seconds of Atomic, a five-part miniseries you shouldn’t expect to let up any time soon.Max’s rescuer is averse to providing his real name so Max calls him JJ – short for “Jihadi John”. If this offends anyone’s delicate sensibilities I think you should have left 37 seconds ago. JJ reroutes them to Benghazi for unspecified reasons. Max can hope to return to his original plans thereafter.View image in fullscreenAn unusually well-armed physics professor … Samira Wiley in Atomic.Photograph: Sifeddine Elamine/Sky/Pulse FilmsMeanwhile, we trot over to other parts of the globe, including the Caucasus mountains in Russia, where an oligarch’s fearsome daughter Oksana Shirokova (Avital Lvova) is sending a brace of boxes via some reluctant mule herders to Beirut. She adds that they and the unspecified contents (“To you they’re statues”) being smuggled out of the nuclear state must be kept two metres apart at all times. The mule herders look even more reluctant. The astute viewer notes anew the title of the series and nods sagely.For the first episode or two you worry that it’s all going to be too much. To the multiple locations and destinations, potential heroes and villains are added a cartel riad in Marrakech, flashbacks to JJ in Syria, an American university in Beirut where Samira Wiley is Dr Cassie Elliott, an unusually well-armed lecturer in physics, a set of corrupt gendarmes, a gang of military types led by a very angry Scotsman, Rab Makintosh (Stuart Martin), the father of one of the murdered militants, a lost young boy (Keni Emmanuelle, heartbreaking in a wordless part), the CIA, and Max’s beloved girlfriend Laetitia (Charlie Murphy) and Brian Gleeson as Dr Elliott’s boss, Mark, and a few more.View image in fullscreen‘The violence is frequent’ … Shazad Latif as JJ.Photograph: Sifeddine Elamine/Sky/Pulse FilmsFortunately, just as you are starting to feel that if there is one more piece of information thrown at you it is going to push the entire mass out of your head, the flood of new things stops and the plot starts to tighten and deepen.JJ’s mysterious backstory is filled in and his motives are complicated at every turn. Banter with Max gradually gives way to bonding as the pair realise they are caught up in no ordinary cartel deal with no ordinary cargo at its heart. The suspense never lets up as they are pursued across numerous territories in a variety of vehicles and with a variety of weapons trained on them, sometimes by those with personal grudges against them, sometimes by those who merely want to murder them for their increasingly grubby rucksacks and the volatile things inside them (uranium, OK? It’s uranium. I don’t know why I’m trying so hard to keep it a secret), but the increasing emotional stakes are raised as we go.The violence is frequent but – especially for all those who are still in the process of recovering from the harrowing, seemingly endless scenes inThe Narrow Road to the Deep North– mercifully cartoonish. The questions that it asks about what it means to live a good life, how people pervert religions, seek redemption or justify taking revenge come increasingly to the fore and add an unexpected heft to the whole, though it can still be enjoyed as a breakneck, Guy-Ritchie-esque drug-caper-cum-buddy-movie, if you want.But Atomic brings with it that ineffable pleasure caused by watching something that someone took just one or two extra passes over, to give its audience an experience just a bit better than you were expecting, just that bit better than it needed to be.Atomic aired on Sky Max and is on Now in the UK and on Binge in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Comically gifted and with a very modern mastery of makeup – there was nothing remotely slapdash about Viv’s transformative glam – she won the first UK edition ofRuPaul’s Drag Race in 2019, before parlaying her victory into appearances on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Hunted and Emmerdale. By 2024, she was living the dream, wowing as the Wicked Witch of the West in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s The Wizard of Oz.But James Lee Williams never got the chance to turn his status as a fledgling household name into proper cultural ubiquity: in January of this year,he died from cardio-respiratory arrest, a result of ketamine consumption. He was 32.This tribute to Williams – who was mostly called Viv by friends and James by family, using female and male pronouns respectively – arrives a mere eight months later. God knows how hard it must have been for his parents to discuss his death in public so soon afterwards. “Did I say how proud I was?” his mum panically asks Williams’ sister off camera at one point. To conclude this documentary, those who were close to the artist – including his young niece – are asked to write him an imaginary letter. It is an utterly heart-wrenching device, and one that seems slightly exploitative in the context of such raw grief.Before then, however, Dear Viv concerns itself with providing a lively, insightful and incredibly interesting account of Williams as a man and an entertainer. His reality background means there is copious footage of him discussing his life, interspersed here with testimony from family, friends and fellow queens alongside clips from early vlogs. We hear how he felt comfortable enough to come out as gay aged 14 at his north Wales private school, where he was an inveterate mischief-maker; his father, who worked there, recalls his attention-seeking antics with weary amusement. The same year, a Cher-induced internet wormhole led him to drag and, at 16, he moved to Liverpool by himself, finding his feet in the city’s club scene and acquiring the Vivienne Westwood fixation that produced his moniker. Later, a stint in Gran Canaria helped him finesse his raucous, accessible and very British act – “that old school rough and ready drag but with the polished look” as his friend and colleagueMichael Marouliputs it.Not long afterwards, his Drag Race audition tape – featuring impressions of Donald Trump, Cilla Black, Cher, Ab Fab’s Patsy Stone,Jennifer CoolidgeandKim Woodburn– won him a place on the lineup; his comic chops won him the series and many friends besides, especiallyBaga Chipz, who describes the pair as “a couple of fat bastards” (fellowqueen Cheryl Holeaffectionately likens them toStatler and Waldorffrom the Muppets). Later Williams appeared onDrag Race All Stars– a queen of queens competition involving the franchise’s best contestants. Then, with some effort – Williams’ manager Simon Jones mourns the post-Savage evisceration of drag from the mainstream – he made inroads into primetime fare: he hoped his participation on Dancing on Ice would prove drag queens were “nothing to be feared”.Off stage and screen, things weren’t quite so rosy. Williams arrived in Liverpool with an anti-drug attitude, but his new social circle soon normalised extreme partying. Post-performance comedowns cemented his dependence; he spent four years as a functioning ketamine addict – able to continue with life while under the influence and to hide it from his family. He went to Spain to break the cycle and byDragRace his narrative was one of hard-won sobriety.That wasn’t all. In an archive interview, Williams alludes to the intense loneliness he experienced before meeting his husband David, who “gave him something to live for” (they split up in 2023, for reasons not covered in the documentary ). His profession was a salve and a stress of its own – he was racked with insecurity on All Stars, feeling like “the runt of the litter” amid the US queens. Fascinatingly, we hear how being a drag queen bifurcated his very selfhood: he neglected James, spending all his money on clothes for The Vivienne and often wanting to lose himself in his imperious, invulnerable creation. It’s rare to hear this kind of candid deconstruction of drag, earnestness being anathema to camp. “As queer people we often hide from emotions,” says Hole, who explains how persecution can lead to emotional repression. We also witness Chipz explaining how his drag alter ego helps him to escape himself.We don’t get similar insight into Williams’ relapse. Jones knew the performer was taking ketamine again (his family didn’t) and had arranged for counselling and therapy. Dear Viv is not presumptuous – or reductive – enough to impose a simple narrative on his death. Instead, it offers a warm and nuanced portrait of an artist as the giver of great joy – and of a man whose calling both allayed and intensified his vulnerabilities.Dear Viv aired on BBC Three and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDragDrugsreviewsShareReuse this content"

With no support for their self-determination, Hungarians in 1956 were orphaned by the times.However the orphan of the title is not in fact an orphan; his mother is still alive. Andor (Bojtorján Barábas) is an angry, lonely teenage boy who idolises the memory of his father, Hirsch, who went missing during the second world war but who might still be alive somewhere. Andor still conducts imaginary conversations with him, and his mum (Andrea Waskovics) works in a grocery store. But Andor’s life is turned upside down by the appearance of a brutal, boorish butcher (played by French actor Grégory Gadebois) who smugly – and odiously – seems to be claiming some sort of right over Andor’s mother.The awful truth about who his father actually is dawns on him and Andor is convulsed with resentment and rage, especially as he uncovers evidence that just a few years previously this butcher was cruel to his “other” family. But as his mother says to him: “The more you hate him, the more you like him.” The whole situation is complicated by the fact that this man, however maladroit and often obnoxious, has moments of affection with Andor and is sincere enough – in his way – about building a life with his new family.However, there is something stolid and at times monotonous about the way this is presented to the audience – as ever with Nemes, the force of gravity is increased, making everything 20% heavier and denser. And Barábas’s performance is frankly actorly rather than real in his incessant frown of righteous resentment. It’s a minor movie from this always interesting film-maker.Orphan screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsLászló NemesHungaryEuropeVenice film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

There is more of this to come in photographer Alys Tomlinson and film-maker Cécile Embleton’s beautiful black and white documentary. It is film of stillness, long, long takes and careful framing – and would look at home playing on the walls of an art gallery. But Mother Vera, with its intense, luminous portrait of a woman, is not an austere art film.Her name is Vera, a nun in a remote Orthodox monastery in Belarus; you could cast her as Joan of Arc, with her beautiful fierce face. The setting itself might be medieval, but then out steps Vera into a bitingly cold wintry day, wearing a floor-length Puffa. She runs the convent stables, and seems to be most herself with the horses. On the voiceover Vera explains that before becoming a nun she was married, and a heroin addict. She came to the convent for a year while her husband went to prison. “I didn’t want to be a nun.” To say any more would give too much away.The convent itself is fascinating, home to at least a hundred men who seem to all be ex-prisoners and addicts. At points it feels like you’re watching drama. There’s an uncomfortably tense scene when a meeting is called to discuss expelling a man for having “downcast” status – he’s an untouchable because he was raped in prison. The priest chairing the meeting (channelling a bit of Jesus-overturning-tables-in-the-temple rage) answers roughly that we are equal in God’s eyes.Mostly though, we are with Vera. For long stretches the film is wordless and requires a commitment of attention. But Vera herself is an intense, powerful character, speaking with ruthless honesty on the voiceover; rather than being passively observed by the film-makers, she invites us in to her inner world. It’s riveting.Mother Vera is in UK and Irish cinemas from 29 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBelarusChristianityEuropeReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

My husband, two sons and I are midway through a four-day stretch of the Grand Tour de Tarentaise hiking trail in the French Alps, and we’ve stopped near the top of Varlossière, a roadless side valley among a great arc of mountains that runs to the west of the ski resorts of Val Thorens, Les Menuires and Saint-Martin-de-Belleville. Hiking up here from Gittamelon, a rustic, summer-only mountain refuge in the neighbouring Vallée des Encombres, we’ve paused to exhale breath, and to inhale the primeval views.Map for Rhiannon piece in FranceHigh peaks loom either side of us, their shocking green flanks underscored by an elegantly designed bothy and its shepherd-dwelling twin, and we can hear the rush of water far below. It’s midmorning but the moon is low and large in a cloudless sky, adding to the otherworldly scene. Climbing higher, an eagle flies past almost at eye level, no more than six metres away. Though we meet three other hikers on the other side of the Col du Bonnet du Prêtre, the 2,461-metre (8,074ft) pass that leads from Varlossière to the Nant Brun valley – and detect from sheep bells that at least two shepherds must be somewhere among the great folds of these hills – it feels as though the landscape is ours alone.Many of the new summer visitors are first-timers, unfamiliar with the mores of mountain adventuringThat may not be the case for long. Soaring temperatures across Europe this summer have fuelled a rush to the mountains, social media funnelling many visitors to the same honeypots and creating infrastructure pressure points; in Italy some farmers in the Dolomites have resorted to installing turnstiles and charging tourists €5 to pass, incensed at having their meadows trampled.Navigating these challenges is no easy task for Europe’s mountain resorts, which are increasingly encouraging summer tourism as the climate crisis signals a limited lifespan for ski tourism. One of the biggest issues is that many of these new summer visitors are first-timers, unfamiliar with the mores of mountain adventuring: treading gently on the environment, respecting local countryside codes, wearing suitable kit, knowing how to read a map rather than an app (we had no wifi or phone signal for two days of our hike), and packing enough food and water. In France, call-outs to mountain rescue services by inexperienced hikers have risen so sharply thatworkers now trawl social medialooking for potential disaster hotspots in advance.View image in fullscreenThe writer and her sons walking above Lac de Lou.Photograph: Richard HammondIn an attempt to tackle these issues, the Vallée des Belleville tourist office has introduced a range of summer initiatives to support new hikers, from kids’ mountain skills activity days to free wildlife talks and events. Lower-level footpaths and bike trails for children, pushchair-users and visitors with reduced mobility makes it safer for those groups to access the mountains, and easier for local communities to manage the larger numbers that tend to make use of them. And while challenging marked trails through more remote corners of the mountains are fairly easy to follow, visitors are encouraged to hire a guide (something we are glad of at Col du Bonnet du Prêtre, when Roland tracks down the shepherd owner of an aggressive dog and persuades him to move away from the trail).It is at our accommodation each night, in mountain refuges, that we really see support for new hikers in action, though. Several have been designed specifically with families and first-timers in mind, including Refuge Plan Lombardie, where we end our 12-mile (19km) hike from Gittamelon.We are not first-timers, but staying here is a good opportunity to remind ourselves of the rules of refuge culture, and for the boys to hang out with other children. Though we hike in, it’s possible to park about 20 minutes’ away and walk from there, something several guests with preschoolers have done, grateful for the treasure hunt-style sculpture trail the refuge has installed along the route to entice younger visitors uphill.Though we have seen less than a handful of hikers during the day, we find Refuge Plan Lombardie as packed as a marmot’s burrow. Approaching it in the soft glow of the afternoon, earlier arrivals have already nabbed the terrace’s deckchairs with a view. Instead, we collect beers and lemonades and find a free bench to enjoy them before swapping our boots for the refuge’s borrowed Crocs, and finding our allocated bunk beds.The sky is luminous with stars, while the peaks and folds of the land are entirely black beyond the winking of a distant lightRefuges like this are more than just places to sleep. Full of city folk temporarily escaping to higher ground, they’re the human equivalent of a centuries-old rhythm of transhumance, where families bring sheep and cows up to the high pastures for the summer months. At dinner, we share a table with a mother from Chambéry who has brought her four-year-old son for his first visit to a refuge. “My friend gave me a list of the most family-friendly ones and I’ve decided to start a new tradition of visiting one every year with my son. I want him to love them as much as I do,” she told us between bites of a Savoyard blueberry version of Eton mess.The previous evening, in cosy Gittamelon refuge, we’d shared similar tales, and a dorm, with three generations of a Belgian family who were following the same trail as us but in the opposite direction. And the evening before that, we’d followed suit with other families, playing cards at Refuge du Lac du Lou, a modern, child-friendly refuge just 90 minutes’ hike above the resort of Les Menuires.View image in fullscreenWalking from the cosy Gitamelon refuge.Photograph: Richard HammondBetween Lac du Lou and Gittamelon we’d hiked with Estelle Roy-Berthaud from Les Menuires tourist office, following the trail through harebells, cotton grass, neon-coloured lichens and, much to the boys’ delight, thickets of wild blueberries. Stopping for lunch with Mont Blanc spearing the horizon in the distance, I ask her how the valley is managing increasing summer numbers.“Summer tourism is a relatively new concept here, so we are not seeing the overtourism issues experienced by more well-known summer destinations in the Alps,” she says. “We’re also protected by not having too many places to stay. In winter, we have around 27,000 beds, but in summer this reduces to just 8,000, so this naturally restricts the number of people in the valley.”Further along the trail, at Plan Lombardie, I wake in the night and slip out of one of those beds. Outside, the sky is luminous with stars, while the peaks and folds of the land are now entirely black beyond the winking of a distant light – a shepherd’s stove, perhaps, or the torch of a camper. The Belleville valley still feels wonderfully wild tonight.Transport from London to Chambéry was provided byFlixbus; return faresfrom£89pp. Half-board accommodation atRefuge du Lac du Loufrom€39 children/€69 adults,Refuge Gittamelon€46pp, and atRefuge Plan Lombardiefrom€32 children and €52 adults.

So, as you read this, you can be sure that I am probably quite drunk on sparkling wine. There’s scarcely a better excuse than a birthday, but I think we can agree that what you’re likely to be drinking at any such event will vary greatly, depending on whether or not the birthday in question is your own.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s always good to start off with something sparkling, which is why, for the past few years, I’ve treated myself to a bottle ofBillecart-Salmonin bed, but I think I might try something a bit different this year. My mind turns toSip Champagnes, an independent, online retailer that connects consumers with thegrower champagnesof the region. It even hasa sub-£45 section, which, considering that many of the grandes marques are now pushing or exceeding £50 (eek!), provides a chance to taste something new for the same price or even less than usual.Or, for even less, there’s crémant, which is basically for when you’re having people over and buying en masse. Crémant is sparkling wine made in the sameméthode traditonelle(traditional method) as champagne, during which the wine undergoes two fermentations to make it sparkling. An initial base wine is made and fermented into a dry wine, then, in a process known astirage, yeast and sugar are added to kickstart a secondary fermentation, after which the wine is sealed with a crown cap.This secondary fermentation creates CO₂(for the bubbles) and lees (spent yeast cells), which collect in the neck and give the wine its trademark biscuity flavour. These are then frozen and lifted off the top, at which point the bottle is sealed with the cork and cage we associate with sparkling wines. It’s the same method as champagne, but crémant costs far, far less.Or how about something completely different? As I explored ina column earlier this year, fine sparkling cider is fast becoming my “why the hell not?” item for moments that demand marking with a coupe of something wonderful. “Like winemaking, correct terroir and climate are essential ingredients for fine cider-making,” says Nick Showering ofShowerings Cider. “You can blend vintages in a similar way to champagne to achieve a house style, and that’s something even the sommeliers at the likes ofL’Enclumeare now pouring.”And while cider certainly still has some catching up to do with champagne, I don’t see why it can’t be enjoyed in similar contexts. Swig it from the bottle in bed while opening your presents, or pour it into an oyster.

The fearless fig tree is a descendant of the prehistoric wild caprifig, which spread from Caria (hence the species namecarica) in ancient Anatolia, across the Mediterranean. Cultivation is thought to have started in Egypt and the Levant, probably between 4000 and 2700BC; particular evidence of this is the common fig (Ficuscarica) on the stone walls within ancient Egyptian tombs calledmastaba, painted so their occupants could enjoy the fruit in the afterlife.Dozens of examples are described in a research paper by the professor of Egyptology Noha Hany Gerges Salama, including paintings within a fifth-dynasty mastaba of Iymery, in Giza. One painting in particular depicts two fig trees, both of which have a boy standing in their branches and picking fruit, while men under the trees collect fallen figs in baskets. Another exquisite painting shows two men seated opposite each other, one of whom is holding a plate holding three enormous figs. Salama notes what a common food source fresh and dried figs were in ancient Egypt, and used often to enhance flavour and sweeten, but also how figs, their leaves and the sap from the branches provided a natural rennet for cheese-making and yeast for wine-making.The many varieties of figs fall into two broad groups: those that reproduce without pollination, and those that rely on little gnat-sized fig wasps to do it for them. Either way, figs are botanically not a single fruit, but a cluster of more than a thousand tiny flowers, which are thought of as seeds. Figs are also one of the few fruits to taste best when over-ripe, when those thousand tiny fruits have matured into an ambrosial cross between honey and jam, and as a result perfect for attracting both wasps and this week’s recipe.It’s a variation on the wonderfulcrostata di ricotta e visciole(sour cherry and ricotta tart) from the Jewish-Roman tradition, using figs and orange instead, and I have also varied the pastry by adding some (optional) orange zest and ground almonds. Always work quickly with pastry, and with cold hands, and don’t skip the chilling or the preheating of the baking tray, which prevents a soggy bottom. And if you can’t find figs, fig jam works beautifully, too.You can serve this tart hot out of the oven, but it is better, I think, when it has cooled a bit, so both the ricotta and fig layers have had the chance to firm up, which makes it easier to cut. Like its cherry cousin, the tart is also wonderful at room temperature and fridge-cold, especially for breakfast.Fig, ricotta and orange tartServes8–10150g cold butter, diced250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting50g ground almonds1 pinch of salt60g icing sugar2 medium eggs, lightly beaten, plus extra for brushing1 unwaxed orange, 2 strips of zest pared off, the rest of the zest finely grated, plus 2 tbsp juice400g fresh figs, chopped, or 300g fig jam175gcaster sugar500g ricotta1 eggRub the butter into the flour and ground almonds until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, icing sugar, grated orange zest and eggs, then mix to make a soft pastry. Wrap in greaseproof paper and chill in the fridge for at least an hour.Put the figs in a pan with the two strips of orange zest, orange juice and 100g of the sugar. Bring to a boil, turn down to a lively simmer and cook for five to seven minutes,until the figs are tender and collapsing, but not mushy.On a lightly floured surface, roll out two-thirds of the pastry into a disc a little larger than a 24cm tart tin. Drape the pastry over a rolling pin, unfurl it into the tin and push it into the corners. Trim off the excess pastry with a knife.Spoon the cooked figs into the shell. Combine the ricotta, egg and remaining 75g sugar, beat until creamy and smooth, then carefully spoon on top of the figs. Roll the remaining pastry into a circle, then cut this into strips to make a lattice, which you can lay on top of the ricotta as simply or as cleverly as you like. Brush with beaten egg, then bake the tart on a preheated tray in the middle of a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for 45 minutes, until the lattice is golden and the ricotta topping slightly puffed.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkDessertSnacksBakingFruitCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"
