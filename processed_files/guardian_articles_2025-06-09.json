That went well, didn’t it? One of the first thingsLabourdid after winning the election was to cut the winter fuel allowance (WFA) for most pensioners. To show that they were strong. A signal to the bond markets that they would take the tough decisions to balance the Treasury books.And it was just one of those things if a handful of old people decided to die of hypothermia. They were dying in a good cause.Pour encourager les autres. Let no one take being warm for granted again. Time for some proper pensioner gratitude.After that, things started to unravel. MPs on all sides of the house – not least the Labour benches – began to ask whether this was the sort of policy a Labour government, any government come to think of it, ought to be introducing.Hell, the Tories had tried starving them with a cost of living crisis and now this?Rachel Reevesunconvincingly said the real aim was to make sure all those eligible for pension credit had claimed it but there would be no U-turns.Then came the U-turn. Two and a half weeks ago at prime minister’s questions,Keir Starmer announced the reverse ferret. Something that everyone other than Kemi Badenoch heard clearly. Kemi isn’t the quickest on the uptake.Now, on Monday morning – a couple of days before the spending review – came the details from the Treasury. Any pensioner with an income of under £35,000 would now be entitled to the WFA, starting this winter.Genius. It would be hard to create a bigger cock-up if you tried. Not just the denials of the U-turn followed by the inevitable U-turn. But the logistics. With the extra 100,000 people claiming pensioner credit, Labour has ended up with a bigger spending bill than if it had left the WFA as it was.Plus it has managed to dent its own economic credibility by not being able to explain how the £1.3bn extra cost will be paid for. Wait until the budget, we are told. Only just a few weeks ago, Reeves said she would live or die by balancing the books.The chancellor was out and about in north London trying to smooth things over on Monday lunchtime. When is a U-turn not a U-turn? When it’s a Rachel U-turn. It was like this. She had originally made the spending cut to partially fill the black hole in the country’s finances. Just one of those things.But then she had miraculously found that the economy was doing far better than expected so she was able to reverse her decision. She couldn’t say how the country was doing better – she has yet to find anyone to back up this suggestion – but we should take her word for it.Any connection to the withdrawal of the WFA being unpopular was a coincidence. She was sorry but not sorry. Yeahbutnobutyeahbutno. Everywhere she went, lay the telltale sounds of burnt rubber.You could tell that Rachel wasn’t having one of her best days. She looked confused. Embarrassed even. As if she couldn’t quite believe some of the nonsense coming out of her mouth. A feeling confirmed by the fact she was nowhere to be seen when it was time for her to make a statement to the Commons. She had just checked her diary and had found there was a flurry of subsequent engagements.Nor was anyone else senior in the Treasury to be found to take her place. They too had found themselves unavoidably detained elsewhere. Appointments at the doctor. Unexpected open heart surgery. Anything. Any excuse will do. “I’ve got a very important lunch. I can’t cancel.” “But the statement isn’t until 4.15.” “Ah, but it’s a very long lunch. And then I have a coffee.”What goes around, comes around. In his time as head of the Resolution Foundation, Torsten Bell would have had a thing or two to say about the cuts to the WFA. None of them good. There was a Torsten once who didn’t think killing pensioners was a good idea. But that Torsten was very much last year’s Torsten. He has moved on since then. Wised up.But when he became a fresh-faced MP last year – Torsten looks about 12 – he was immediately promoted to the most junior role in the Treasury. One step up from the receptionist. So there was an air of inevitability when he was forced to take Rachel’s place.Luckily, Torsten is hopelessly naive. Thinks there is an air of nobility in being made to look a halfwit. It’s as if he was yet another ego straight out of Oxford who believes that he was born to rule. That the union was just a stepping stone to a life that will probably end up in the House of Lords. Monday was just a staging post.It’s a brilliance that was almost entirely self-imagined. He managed to turn what was always going to be an embarrassment into a humiliation. All ersatz macho posture as he tried to pretend the U-turn was a clever piece of government time management.Hell, he even managed to make the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, Helen Whately, look good. Something that never happens. She was prone to her own delusions – namely that it was the Tories that had forced the U-turn – but her main point was unarguable. Why no apology? Just say sorry. You’ve fucked things up, you’re trying to fix it, let’s move on. The story might then go away. But Torsten didn’t apologise. Choosing instead to bluster for more than an hour. The kindest thing to do was to look away.Down in Port Talbot, Nigel Farage was also trying to take the credit for the U-turn. Though he was also trying to make it sound completely normal for someone to walk out of their job one day andwalk back in the next. Zia Yusuf must be thrilled to be talked of as a temperamental teenager who had got cross with Daddy. Nige also observed that Yusuf had suffered loads of racist abuse. He forgot to mention that almost all of it had come from Reform UK supporters.Mostly, though, Farage was keen to reopen the steelworks that can’t be opened to make a type of steel we don’t use and to reopen the coalmines so that all those former miners who swore blind they wanted their kids to never go down the pits could tell their kids to do just that. The regeneration of Wales starts in the 1950s. Vote Reform.

What will the actor bring to the great Russian character who leaves her husband and son?Mon 9 Jun 2025 10.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 12.40 EDTShareIt was back in 2019 that the role of Anna Karenina was first mentioned to Natalie Dormer. Six years, many screen roles, one pandemic and two children later, Dormer is finally set to take on the titular role of Leo Tolstoy’s epic as Phillip Breen’s adaptation comes toChichester Festival theatre. The delay has ended up working out well, says Dormer, since Tolstoy’s characters are at the “cutting edge of technology”. The new railways were transforming Russia, and that wasn’t all. “Electric light!” exclaims Dormer. “We talk about it in the play, how that’s going to revolutionise their lifestyles. That trepidation about new technology is so adaptable to today: the terror of the AI train that’s coming our way. That generation of adults in the story – they’re on the precipice of a futuristic world. I think we can identify with that.”It’s only a few days before the first preview of the play, after five weeks of rehearsals, and Dormer is speaking from her dressing room over Zoom, a rail of costumes behind her. She had two children during those years she waited to play Anna. “It was a gift to become a mother before playing this role,” she says, pointing out that Breen’s adaptation has “really zeroed in on her guilt and grief, realising that she replaced her maternal love with amorous love – and that, ultimately, was her undoing”.Of course Dormer, who is 43, could have played Anna – the respected society woman who leaves her husband and son for her lover – without being a mother. “I’m sure other actresses are more than capable of getting themselves there,” she says. “But for me, being a mother has fleshed out this performance. We change and grow, with life experience, travel, relationships, loss, grief. As you get older, your opinion on life, on yourself, changes. Good drama at its core is about analysing the pivotal moments in life where the corner got turned. If I played Anne Boleyn now, I would play her differently to when I was 26, because I’m a completely different person. That’s the interesting thing.”View image in fullscreenHigh profile … with Jack Gleeson in Game of Thrones.Photograph: © HBO EnterprisesDormer’s screen roles have been high profile – Anne Boleyn in The Tudors, Margaery Tyrell in Game of Thrones, Cressida inThe Hunger Games– but she loves being back in the theatre. It was her first passion, lit by childhood trips with her grandmother. “To come back to the stage after seven or eight years, to be involved in a piece that has ambition for big, pivotal, defining emotion – I feel invigorated by the process.”She loves the camaraderie, particularly of this production, which features a large ensemble cast (including her partner David Oakes), musicians, and children from a local youth theatre and their chaperones. What’s it like working with Oakes? He plays the wealthy landowner Levin, she points out, and their stories are separate. “We have the perfect setup. He walks into rehearsal, I walk out. He walks on stage, I walk off. So it’s the best world of working together, but not working together.” At home, she says with a laugh, they practise their lines, because there are just so many of them. “It’s good to have a scene-running partner. ‘Just before you turn off the light, darling, could you just run these two scenes with me?’”Her Anna is, she says, a “proto-feminist” although she knows it can be contentious to inflict modern sensibilities on period pieces. The historian Hallie Rubenhold recently criticised the BBC for The Scandalous Lady W, its adaptation, starring Dormer, of her book about Lady Worsley, the 18th-century aristocrat who caused a scandal with her affair and elopement. Speaking at the Hay festival last month, Rubenhold said that, much as she enjoyed the experience, she was “slightly uncomfortable” that Dormer’s character was portrayed as feminist.“I really feel for academics,” says Dormer, with a smile (she nearly studied history at university, but went to drama school instead). Ultimately, her job, she explains, is to flesh out the character, “make them as three-dimensional and human as I can” – while choices about historical accuracy are made by others. “You can try and steer it,” she says. “I fought for Anne Boleyn to be more overtly evangelical, and educated in the reforming revolution that was happening in northern Europe at the time. She was a true reformer, so I fought to get one speech in that nodded to that.”View image in fullscreen‘Guilt and grief’ … in rehearsals with Phillip Breen.Photograph: CFT Marketing/Marc Brenner/Chichester Festival TheatreDormer, who grew up in Reading, was an only child until she was around seven, and she remembers playing alone a lot, pulling out clothes from her dressing-up box and talking to herself as different characters. As an adult, she says, “there’s always, for me, been a catharsis in storytelling. You’re trying to work out life. You’re trying to work out pain and anger and extreme joy. It’s a way of navigating feelings that are put so neatly into structured stories for us by wonderful writers, that makes them safe to explore.” In Anna Karenina, those feelings amount to: “Holy fuck, the world is crazy. It’s scary, and what world are we giving to our children? That’s one of those themes that makes it universal and timeless.”For a long time, Dormer has supported the children’s charities Childline and NSPCC, and in recent years has been involved with their campaigns on online safety. Dormer rattles off numbers, such as the more than 80% rise in online grooming of young people since 2017, the one in 14 children who have shared naked or semi-naked photos online. She doesn’t do social media, despite being advised early in her career that she should. In the frenzy followingGame of Thrones, and the huge boost to her profile, she could have picked up millions of followers but decided not to.“There’s a fork in the road when you’re in something of that level,” she says, “and I just kept my head down.” Privacy has always been something Dormer has guarded, but she did think about doing social media recently, then stopped herself. “I can’t quite bring myself to – until tech platforms take responsibility for their irresponsibility towards young people.”If there is a through-line in Dormer’s work, it’s that many of the women she plays have been constrained by their times, and the expectations placed on them, but have strategically made it work for them (Anne Boleyn, Margaery Tyrell) or broken free entirely (Anna Karenina, Lady Worsley) – even if many ultimately met an unpleasant end.In a new film, Audrey’s Children, due to be released in the UK this year, Dormer plays Dr Audrey Evans, a paediatric oncologist, who defies sexism and outdated thinking in the late 1960s to pioneer cancer treatment for children and the care of their families. Then, in the upcoming drama The Lady, about the royal aide Jane Andrews who was convicted of murdering her partner in 2001, Dormer plays Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, another woman navigating the clash between society’s expectations and her own excitable personality and reckless choices.View image in fullscreen‘If I played Anne Boleyn now, I would play her differently’ … with Jonathan Rhys Meyers in The Tudors.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyHas the choice of roles been deliberate? It was always about the quality of the part, says Dormer, and whether she wanted to work with a particular writer or director. But she adds: “If there are reccurring themes, then yes, they must be deeply embedded within me.”Dormer also points out how scripts for women have become much more interesting. “When I started 20 years ago, that devil/whore v angel character was still prevalent.” Female characters are allowed to be antiheroines these days, she points out, with unsavoury personalities and questionable actions. “That’s a revolution in itself.”I wonder what it was like to work with Madonna, who directed her in her 2011 film W.E. She laughs: “I can’t tell you – the NDA was that thick.” She holds her thumb and forefinger wide apart. But she does acknowledge that it was something she couldn’t have even dreamed about as a child growing up in the 80s, with her dressing-up box. “One of those moments when you catch yourself and you go, ‘How did this happen?’”It’s the same feeling, she says, when she stands on stage at the Chichester Festival theatre, her face on the posters outside. “So whatever you’re beating yourself up with today, maybe just enjoy it for a moment.” Is she hard on herself? “I increasingly try not to be. I think when I was younger, yes. Now, not so much. I’ve learned compassion for myself, and [had] a lot of good therapists. Understanding how you treat yourself is a mirror to what your children will emulate.”There’s nothing like being immersed in Russian literature, I suppose, to make you question life and its meaning. “Life is transient, as Tolstoy would tell us,” says Dormer with a smile, “so just enjoy this moment.”Anna Karenina is atChichester Festival theatreuntil 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreTelevisionGame of ThronesThe Hunger GamesChichester Festival theatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

And what does it say about the rest of us?Mon 9 Jun 2025 12.21 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 12.51 EDTShareWhen the unauthorised, warts-and-all biography of the Beckhams,The House of Beckham, came out last year, it was in the distinctive style of its author, Tom Bower, which is to say, incredibly mean. But it was quite short of warts, to be honest: of course, there were youthful indiscretions – David Beckham’s Madrid years featured an alleged affair and an insufficient tip in a restaurant, and Posh once made a TV show that people didn’t like. But the Beckhams of today were guilty of nothing greater than that they wanted a knighthood, and had done for a really long time.That was why, according to Bower, David volunteered to help in the Philippines after the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, and why Victoriagave all her castoffs to the Chelsea Red Crosswhich raised some eyebrows at the time, just because the last imaginable thing you would need after being hit by a typhoon would be 78 pairs of cerise stilettos. That was why David had reportedly “unleashed his foul-mouthed tirade” (to use the proper tabloid phrase) by email once his honour was rejected, calling the honours committee a “bunch of cunts” and lambasting Katherine Jenkins because she got an OBE “for what? Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F—ing joke.”Becks had a point. In the 2010s – if the highest honour is reserved for those who are nationally significant, inspirational, and have demonstrated commitment at the highest level - it was hard to think of anyone who did more football, in a more committed fashion and noticeable way, than he. If there’s a tacit clause about charitable works, he had definitely done some of that, and if he hadn’t done enough, they should have just produced some time sheets and minimum spend numbers, and he could have done more. If the real block on the honour was that Posh and Becks had thrones made of gold at their wedding in 1999, which apparently annoyed Prince Philip so much that he declined to sit on a throne at the subsequent Jubilee, well, it was surely time that everyone with a throne of any kind just got over themselves.David Beckham at 50: his gorgeous, outrageous life in 50 picturesRead moreAs is almost always the case with anything connected to the British aristocracy, it was impossible to pick a side. The honours committee has a conception of seemly public behaviour, and generally speaking, they go the opposite way to any normal member of the British public, who don’t mind “foul-mouthed tirades” but do mind sycophancy and incompetence, and consequently would much prefer to see Danny Dyer knighted than almost any name on the honours list of the past five departing prime ministers.Yet at the same time, it is tragic to want an honour in the first place, given that it pretends access to the nobility yet is completely ersatz; a fake VIP room where the champagne is fizzy apple juice and the really important people are in a different building. The culture of class deference is sustained on ideas that cannot be said out loud or even directly beheld, because they are too stupid: such as, “Some people are born better than others, because they have a lineage going back to William the Conqueror”; such as, “Great wealth connotes some endogenous personal merit, but only if you came by it the right way, several centuries ago and with violence”. By definition, you can’t enter that system late, and in the very act of trying, you reveal how little you understand it. Which is fine, because to understand it and still want it would make you ridiculous, yet to want it uncomprehendingly still looks pretty foolish.As theBeckhams finally get what they’ve always wanted, apparently, what does it say about the institutions that put so much energy into blocking them? Have they finally run out of the energy it takes to make their minute distinctions? Or have they decided that it somehow works for the preservation of the system, to dignify a person only after they have waited an undignified amount of time? This might be the final, unique power of the British class system – the ability to make everyone who goes anywhere near it, in any capacity, look absurd, and at the same time, everyone who objects to it, at whatever volume, sound wholemeal and worthy. It’s the last act of national unification, in which we all look as bad as one another.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If these requests cause you political difficulty, dear secretary of state, consider how much worse it could be if you end up controlling this failing company yourself. Do you really wish to be responsible for every burst water main in London and every drop of effluent in Didcot?That seems to be the pitch from the 100-plus group of lenders to Thames Water who are now the only game in town in terms of a “market-led” recapitalisation, the alternative to special administration, AKA temporary nationalisation.It is expressed in the bland language of “regulatory support”, but the meaning isn’t hard to translate. A “rebased” performance target is a lower one. A “pragmatic approach to historic and future legal and regulatory compliance” means letting Thames off substantial financial penalties – maybe a billion or two over the next five to 10 years – that would otherwise come its way.If the proposal sounds outrageous (it does), in one sense you can’t blame the creditors for giving it a go. Sir Jon Cunliffe’s Independent Water Commission,in its interim report last week, nodded to the general idea that failing water companies will need a helping hand from regulators to haul themselves off the floor. “The commission is of the view that a more formal framework for supporting companies to turnaround performance may be needed, to avoid a future ‘doom loop’,” the report said.The use of the loaded “doom loop” phrase will have delighted the creditors. It is exactly how they describe Thames’s predicament of fines out to the horizon. If you want to improve the assets, goes their argument, something has to give – and would have to give even under a nationalised setup.There are, though, at least two enormous difficulties to the creditors’ plan. Most obviously, how could Steve Reed, the environment secretary, possibly sanctionlegal immunity for serious environmental crimesfor private sector owners of Thames? Remember Reed’s refrain every timehe bashes a bonus: “With this government, the era of profiting from pollution is over.” It is hard to walk back that statement.Second, even if the Cunliffe commission’s thinking provides philosophical support for regulatory “flexibility”, the final report is still a couple of months away, and parliamentary scrutiny will be needed before the regulatory system for the water industry could be changed fundamentally. The timeframe is beyond the would-be new owners’ plan for recapitalising Thames.Thus, if the creditor group has any prospect of getting its proposal to fly, a few of its big numbers will have to look very different from the ones presented in the self-serving outline version. In short, the senior lenders are being far too greedy in imagining they can escape with writedowns on their debt of just 20%, the ratio implied by the proposed £3.2bn hit to total A class debt of £16bn.Come on. The haircut for lenders cannot be that light. The market value of the debt is already implying 30% writedowns. Some of the opportunistic vulture funds are thought to have got in at as low as 60p in the pound; Reed and Ofwat, the water regulator for England and Wales, would look like fools if they approved, in effect, hefty day-one paper profits for them.But it is – just about – possible to imagine a deal in which Thames pays its fines upfront, as it were, in the interest of allowing managers to concentrate on the day job of running the business rather than hiring lawyers to fight Ofwat and the Environment Agency. Add £1.6bn as a settlement of outstanding bad behaviour and in effect you’d get a haircut for senior lenders of 30%. Or maybe the figure would have to be closer to 40% to allow Reed to save face.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would be a reasonable point of view: if you really want to clear the decks, special administration is the surest route. The next step – deal or no deal – looks to be genuinely in the balance; don’t underestimate the government’s desire to avoid nationalisation.Haircuts of only 20%, however, just don’t work. If the bondholders wish their inflammatory proposal to be taken seriously, they should be told to come back with a proper number, or have one imposed on them.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterNils Pratley on financeWater industryUtilitiescommentShareReuse this content"

I’d done a concert for CND [the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament], so we started talking about doing some sort of festival to raise the money. My younger brother Bill suggested it had to be pop. An agency in London gave Ronnie a list of acts including the Pretty Things, the Move, Fairport Convention, Tyrannosaurus Rex and an American act, Jefferson Airplane. We only had a £750 investment from theIsle of WightIndoor Swimming Pool Association, but after a friend lent us his £1,000 army pay-off, we managed to book all those bands, sell 10,000 tickets and break even. In the interim, the pool association pulled out because it didn’t like the publicity about hippies, drugs and sex, but they allowed us to use their investment and we were able to pay them back.That first event in 1968 was pretty shabby – the stage was a couple of flatbed trucks and the caterer ripped us off. We decided to do it again the following year, but properly. Ronnie had got Bob Dylan’s John Wesley Harding album for Christmas and argued that someone like Dylan would draw people to the island. He got Dylan’s manager Albert Grossman’s number from an underground magazine and called him. Dylan hadn’t performed since his motorbike crash in 1966 so we didn’t get far, but we kept calling. Grossman wanted Dylan to make a big comeback at the Woodstock festival, but the two had fallen out and weren’t speaking. Meanwhile, I’d been getting on well with Grossman’s partner, Bert Block, and one Wednesday night he sent a telegram saying Dylan had agreed to play the Isle of Wight. It felt like winning the lottery. But he wanted me to fly to New York to sign contracts, and said: “Don’t forget the dollars.”We didn’t have any money, so we approached various monied people. The head of Screen Gems Europe understood how big Dylan was and agreed to invest in us.View image in fullscreenGrowing … 120,000 at the festival in 1970.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamySuddenly we had a massive event that pulled in 150,000 people. George Harrison and Patti Boyd came to stay.John Lennon and Ringo arrived on the day. I’ll never forget watching Dylan playing tennis with three Beatles.By 1970, us three kids were big-time promoters who could book a raft of stars, and that year’s event attracted over half a million people. The Who were phenomenal, Joni Mitchell triumphant. The Doors’ Jim Morrison was out on bail and they played a moody, oddly moving set in near-darkness. Murray Lerner’s [1996] film about the 1970 event created a false narrative that it was a disaster. Yes, Kris Kristofferson was booed and there were flare-ups with radicals who wanted it to be a free festival like Woodstock, but most people loved it. It’s a myth that Jimi Hendrix played with the stage on fire – it was a firework. That was his last UK performance – 18 days later he was dead.People poured pints of Newcastle Brown over my head to put my burning helmet outWe had always battled councillors and the like moaning about “kids fucking in the bushes”, drugs and such, and after 1970 new restrictions made it impossible for us to put the festival on again. Still, we’d created a blueprint for the modern festival with camping. In 2002, John Giddings – who had attended in 1970 as a teenager – brought the event back. Today’sIsle of Wight festivalis a well-organised entertainment spectacular. In the 60s it was a pilgrimage to see countercultural artists who were singing about making the world a better place.Arthur Brown, singer, the Crazy World of Arthur BrownView image in fullscreen‘Crowds loved it if performers were doing extreme things’ … Arthur Brown.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyIn 1968 we’d just been at No 1 withFirewhen we were booked to headline a new festival. But then Jefferson Airplane said they would bring a phenomenal PA system from the US if they could top the bill, so we were bumped to headlining the “Great British groups”.In those days, crowds loved it if performers were drunk or doing extreme things. I would arrive on stage wearing a helmet with a pie dish on top filled with petrol and our lighting man would throw lit things at it until – whoosh – it went up in flames. At the Windsor jazz and blues festival the summer before, I’d been lowered on to the stage by crane but caught fire from my burning helmet. People poured pints of Newcastle Brown over my head to put me out, so I arrived on stage more like a drowned raccoon than “the God of hell fire”.From the archive: Dylan finally happens at Isle of WightRead moreAt the Isle of Wight, I’d planned to fly in by hot air balloon from Portsmouth, but on the day strong winds in the opposite direction scuppered that. I went on wearing face paint and a crazy costume, which was unusual then – and still is! In the rain I just couldn’t get the helmet to light, so I ended up swearing over the microphone. I was a God of hell fire without any flames, but people loved us.This year’sIsle of Wight festival is on 19-22 June. Ray Foulk’s books Stealing Dylan from Woodstock and The Last Great Event are published by Medina.

That is the central driving ambition of the government’s clean energy superpower mission. We know that we’re going to have to see electricity demand at least double, by 2050.“All of the expert advice says nuclear has a really important role to play in the energy system. In any sensible reckoning, this is essential to get to our clean power and net zero ambitions.”View image in fullscreenThe Sizewell B nuclear plant on the Suffolk coast.Photograph: Jason Bye/AlamyThe announcement comes as part of the £113bn of new capital investment Reeves will announce in the spending review that the Treasury hopes will be the key theme – and enough to stave off further disquiet over expected cuts to day-to-day spending.On Monday, it emerged that all departments had settled with the Treasury after a deal was done with the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, who was deeply dissatisfied with funding for policing.The Home Office could still be forced to cut the overall number of police officers in the aftermath of its lengthy spending review negotiations with the Treasury.Whitehall sources said the department had been asked to look at all options including reducing officer recruitment, which would mean an overall cut in the headcount.On Monday morning, Cooper was the last minister still to reach a deal, with reports suggesting greater police spending would mean a squeeze on other areas of her department’s budget. On Monday afternoon, a source said that cuts to police numbers remained “a possibility”.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has also privately complained to the Treasury about Met police funding and a failure to finance any of the capital’s key transport infrastructure requests.On Monday evening it emerged there were concerns that some English regions, including London, would lose money to support local economic growth and tackle poverty through schemes such as the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, Growth Hub funding and the Levelling Up Fund.A source close to the London mayor said: “If the Treasury go ahead with this cut it would be incredibly shortsighted. They say they want economic growth but their actions in failing to invest in new infrastructure in the capital and cutting local growth funds will actually damage our economy, not improve it.“They say they want regional mayors to be the drivers of growth but then remove their levers to achieve growth.”Earlier on Monday, Reeves formally announcedplans to restore the winter fuel payment to all pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less, after a furious backlash to the government’s most unpopular policy to date.While the reversal was welcomed by Labour MPs worried about pensioner poverty and the political toxicity of the issue, there were concerns the £1.25bn price tag would mean more tax rises or spending cuts this autumn.The green light for the development at Sizewell C marks the end of a long 15-year journey to secure investment for the plant since the site was first earmarked for new nuclear development in 2010. Campaigners argued the development of the site would be hugely expensive compared with investment in other energy sources and would create only short-term job opportunities.The government is also expected to announce the winners of a long-running competition on Tuesday for a bid to build one of Europe’s first small modular reactor (SMR) programmes – a model that some in government hope could eventually attract private investment, especially from tech companies, which might build SMRs to power datacentres. FTSE 100 manufacturer Rolls-Royce is the favourite to be chosen to build the first British SMRs.Reeves will confirm the nuclear investment in her address at the GMB congress on Tuesday, including £6bn of investment to the nuclear submarine industrial base to deliver on recommendations in the strategic defence reviewThe investment also includes £2.5bn over five years for research and development of fusion energy. Combined, the Treasury said they would be vital to the UK’s energy security, replacing the UK’s dependency on fossil fuel markets with homegrown power.“We need new nuclear to deliver a golden age of clean energy abundance, because that is the only way to protect family finances, take back control of our energy, and tackle the climate crisis,” Miliband said.He said projects such as these were also essential for making the economic case to voters that the transition to net zero would not come at a cost to their families. “There aren’t enough industries in this country that provide good jobs at decent wages with strong trade unions. Nuclear is one of them. This is absolutely about delivering the kind of economic change right across the country,” he said.He said investment in fusion in Nottinghamshire would be directly on the site of the old West Burton coal-fired power station. “That is the transition in action – from an old coal-fired power station to a new fusion prototype plant,” he said. So for climate, for energy security, for jobs, I genuinely think this is the right choice.”Miliband has argued for nuclear power to be a part of tackling the climate crisis since 2009. As energy secretary in the last Labour government, he said he was brought up in a family that opposed it, but he now saw it as vital.“I didn’t expect to have to become the energy secretary again to make it happen,” Miliband said. “We’ve been too slow, definitely. This is also about accepting the role of government because this is going to be majority state-owned and state invested.“Hinckley was done under a different model. That is a way of lowering the cost of capital, getting a return for the taxpayer. So I think there have been real missed opportunities in the last 14 years.”Sizewell C was one of eight sites identified in 2009 by Miliband as a potential site for new nuclear. The project was not fully funded in the 14 years that followed under subsequent governments. The Treasury said that combined with the ambition to build SMRs, it would deliver more new nuclear to the grid than over the previous half century by the 2030s.Campaigners opposed to Sizewell C said they believed the development would end up as “HS2 mark 2” with years of overspending and delay. Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C said: “Ministers have still not come clean about Sizewell C’s cost and, given negotiations with private investors are incomplete, they have signed away all leverage and will be forced to offer generous deals that undermine value for money.”Explore more on these topicsSizewell CEd MilibandNuclear powerEnergy industryEnergyTax and spendingEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

It is expected to more than double to $376.6bn (£278.3bn) by 2030.“In 2025, for the first time, more than half of content-driven advertising revenue will come from user-generated platforms and content rather than professionally produced content,” the analysis states.In reality, the distinction between user-generated content and professional production is blurred. Many content creators use high quality production and WPP Media acknowledged they can often cooperate and overlap with traditional media platforms.However, the findings bring home the rapid change that global media is experiencing as users turn to digital platforms, via smartphones. The report said the shift was “profoundly impacting” the media world.“Although individual creators often rely on professional media channels as source material, the idiosyncratic takes and views mean that any individual’s media diet is likely increasingly personalised, and potentially focused around a particular topic or point of view,” the report states.“Those audiences may come to view their purchase decisions as extensions of those belief systems and views as well, more so than in previous eras where brand messages more often appeared in professionally produced content that may have been regulated for objectiveness and fact-based commentary.”Senior industry figures from across television, podcasting and media have told the Guardian that YouTube in particular has become the central plumbing of the media world, taking a share of ad revenue for the content it hosts. Traditional media has felt increasingly under pressure toupload its content to the platform.The profound shifts have also ensured that media traditionally reliant on advertising has been battling to hold on to that income, as well as cutting costs elsewhere. The UK has recently seenITV initiate a major shake upof its daytime television programming, with hundreds of jobs at risk.Channel 4 has announced controversial plans to create an in-house studio to find new sources of income. The broadcaster has also bet big on having its content on TikTok andYouTubeas it attempts to gain more younger viewers.Douglas McCabe, chief executive of Enders Analysis, said the changes in media consumption towards online platforms represented “a huge cultural shift in a short period of time”.“Advertising revenue has followed that pattern,” he said. “With [online search] referral traffic declining, the journalism sector has a huge battle on its hands,” he said. “Media will have to communicate the benefits of their methods and missions with a forceful clarity.”In another sign of the sea change taking place, just five companies accounted for 54% of all revenues last year – Google, Meta, theTikTokowner ByteDance, Amazon and Chinese e-commerce outlet Alibaba.Explore more on these topicsAdvertisingSocial mediaInstagramTikTokYouTubeTelevisionTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Since April 2024, applicants have had to earn at least £29,000 to apply for a visa for their partner.The panel has suggested scrapping a Tory plan to raise the minimum income threshold for family visas to £38,700, saying it would conflict with human rights laws.The committee gave some options, including that a threshold of £24,000 to £28,000 could give more priority to economic wellbeing, such as by reducing the burden to taxpayers, than to family life.It also suggested a threshold of £23,000 to £25,000 could ensure that families could support themselves without necessarily requiring them to earn a salary above the minimum wage.The committee said lowering the amount to £24,000, for example, could mean an increase of about 1-3% of projected future net migration.The Conservative government of the former prime minister Rishi Sunak planned to introduce the higher threshold for family visa applicants to be equivalent to the skilled worker level.But the committee’s report said: “Given the family route that we are reviewing has a completely different objective and purpose to the work route, we do not understand the rationale for the threshold being set using this method.“We do not recommend the approach based on the skilled worker salary threshold as it is unrelated to the family route and is the most likely to conflict with international law and obligations (eg article 8).”Article 8 of the European convention on human rights is the right to private and family life that can be applied to migration cases in the UK.The UK’s current £29,000 threshold is high compared with other high-income countries reviewed by the committee.The committee’s chair, Prof Brian Bell, said: “While the decision on where to set the threshold is ultimately a political one, we have provided evidence on the impacts of financial requirements on families and economic wellbeing, and highlight the key considerations the government should take into account in reaching its decision.”The committee advised against raising the threshold for families with children as, despite them facing higher living costs, the impacts on family life appear “particularly significant” for children.It also recommended keeping the income amount required the same across all regions of the UK.The committee also said their review was “greatly hindered” by insufficient data and urged for better data collection by the Home Office on characteristics of each applicant to be linked to outcomes to inform further policy decisions.Campaigners welcomed some recommendations but are disappointed that the committee has not suggested scrapping the minimum income threshold, which they say keeps families in separate countries.Caroline Coombs, the co-founder of Reunite Families UK, said there should be no minimum income requirement (MIR), given its impact.“Any threshold even at minimum wage would still separate many groups of people who just want to be a family here in the UK.“We were struck by the MAC’s acknowledgment that any decision on the MIR is a political decision. For this reason, we are calling on the home secretary to have the political courage to change a system … destroying the lives of British and settled residents and their children for over a decade,” she said.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary commissioned the independent migration advisory committee to undertake a review.“We are now considering its findings and will respond in due course. More broadly, the government has already committed to legislate to clarify the application of article 8 of the ECHR for applicants, caseworkers and the courts.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationShareReuse this content"

In total, lenders would write off about £6.7bn of their loans to Thames and its parent company in an effort to reduce the huge load and in preparation for an eventual stock market listing.Creditors admitted their plan hinges on a considerable leniency from Ofwat, the government’s water regulator for England and Wales, over future fines for environmental failings.The creditors have requested that Ofwat set Thames Water lower environmental standards – and even for it to let the water company off without fines for past breaches of its licences and permits.The creditors will argue to Ofwat that the much-criticised leniency is necessary to avoid a “doom loop” of fines preventing recovery. The Guardian previously revealed that creditors are hoping forimmunity for directors from prosecution for environmental crimes.Thames Water has been on the verge of financial collapse for several years, afterdecades of underinvestment and dividend extractionleft it with leaking pipes and treatment works falling apart, even as its debt mountain grew.The company has desperately been seeking a way out of the turmoil without the government being forced to take control under a special administration regime (SAR), essentially temporary nationalisation.The government is also opposed to stepping in unless there is a direct threat to water and sewerage services for 16 million customers in London and south-east England.The creditors were forced to step forward with a rescue plan after the preferred bidder,the US private equity firm KKR, pulled out last week in a shock announcement. KKR is thought to havebalked at the complexity of taking on Thames Water amid intense political scrutiny.KKR’s withdrawal will mean long-term control of Thames Water will sit with the group of about 100 creditors, ranging from big institutional investors such as Aberdeen, BlackRock, Invesco and M&G, to US hedge funds – such as Elliott Investment Management and Silver Point Capital.It is widely acknowledged that creditors will have to write off a significant portion of existing debts to allow Thames to recover.It is understood that the controlling senior creditors will write off £3.2bn from about £16bn of debt, with other lenders forced to write off about £3.5bn.Senior sources at Ofwat told the Guardian there was concern over some of the terms of the creditor proposal, including whether it was possible for Thames Water to return to an investment-grade credit rating without controlling creditors writing off 30% to 40% of their debt – versus about 20% in their initial proposal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 1971 albumThere’s a Riot Goin’ On, a moody reflection on civil rights and the corrupted idealism of the postwar era created predominantly by Stone apart from the rest of his band, is widely regarded as one of the greatest of the 20th century.Born Sylvester Stewart to a Pentecostal religious family in Texas in 1943, Stone grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. His first music came in a gospel quartet with three siblings, the Stewart Four, who put out a locally released single in 1952.As a young man he became well known in the fertile musical scene of countercultural San Francisco: a multi-instrumentalist and radio DJ who had a series of local bands and worked as a producer for garage rock and psychedelia groups such as the Beau Brummels.In 1966, he fused his band Sly and the Stoners with his brother Freddie’s group Freddie and the Stone Souls, to form Sly and the Family Stone. Their breakthrough came the following year with Dance to the Music, and success was fully established by their fourth album in two years,Stand! (1969), which eventually sold more than three million copies. The band’s stylistic and racial diversity attracted a broad audience, and they played both of the defining music festivals of 1969, Woodstock and the Harlem cultural festival.Hits continued more fitfully during the early 1970s, and the group – notorious for no-shows at concerts – slowly fractured amid increasing drug use. Stone would record There’s a Riot Goin’ On predominantly on his own, applying one of the earliest uses of a drum machine; albums such as Fresh!, with its Richard Avedon portrait of Stone on the cover, were also primarily his work. The band split entirely in 1975, though Stone continued to use the band name for solo releases.View image in fullscreenSly Stone in 2015Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesDespite having laid the rhythmic groundwork for disco, Stone couldn’t sustain his career in the late 1970s, and his addiction to cocaine worsened. He continued to perform with peers such as Funkadelic and Bobby Womack, but album releases dried up after 1982’s Ain’t But the One Way.Sly and the Family Stone – 10 of the bestRead moreHe was arrested in 1983 for cocaine possession, and for driving under the influence of cocaine in 1987, prompting him to flee California for Connecticut. He was apprehended two years later, and sentenced to 55 days in prison, five years’ probation and a fine. His difficulties meant that he was little seen during the 1990s, and it wasn’t until 2006 that he performed in public again, at a tribute to Sly and the Family Stone at the Grammy awards.He performed with the Family Stone on a tour the following year, but often erratically, and made a lacklustre appearance at 2010’s Coachella festival. His final album, I’m Back! Family & Friends, featuring re-recordings of old songs alongside three new tracks, was released in 2011.Sly Stone: ‘Albino musicians could neutralise all the racial problems’Read moreIn 2015he was awarded $5min a lawsuit against his former manager and attorney, successfully arguing that royalty payments had been diverted from him, though he ultimately wasn’t awarded the money due to the terms of a 1989 royalties agreement with a production company. Difficulties with royalties meant that Stone spent many of his latter years in poverty; in 2011 he was living in a campervan in a residential area of Los Angeles – voluntarily, he claimed – and relying on a retired couple for food.“Sly was a monumental figure, a groundbreaking innovator, and a true pioneer who redefined the landscape of pop, funk, and rock music,” the family statement added. “His iconic songs have left an indelible mark on the world, and his influence remains undeniable. In a testament to his enduring creative spirit, Sly recently completed the screenplay for his life story, a project we are eager to share with the world in due course, which follows a memoir published in 2024.”That memoir, Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), was praised in a Guardian review: “The charm, playfulness, humour and personality of Stone’s songs come through in his on-page voice”.Ina 2023 interview with the Guardianaccompanying its publication, he said: “I was always happy if someone took the things I was doing and they liked them enough to want to do them on their own. I’m proud that the music I made inspired people.”Among those paying tribute to Stone was musician and actor Queen Latifah, who heralded an “innovator [and] funk aficionado”, and hip-hop icon DJ Premier who wrote: “I thank you for bringing us diversity, funk, soul, rock and a unique band which is why I’m cut from the integrity cloth. I will remain great because of you.” Waterboys frontman Mike Scott wrote: “Thank you for all the inspiration, for breaking ground so others could follow and for being the sassiest, funkiest being on planet earth”.Stone was married from 1974 to 1976 to Kathy Silva, with whom he had a son, Sylvester Jr. He later had two further children: Sylvyette withCynthia Robinson, and Novena Carmel.Explore more on these topicsSly StonePop and rockSoulnewsShareReuse this content"

Over more than a decade, Google and the Facebook owner, Meta, successfully built tech tools for publishers and ad buyers that helped them to dominate online. Big tech hoovered up almost two-thirds of the £45bn spent by advertisers in the UK this year. Now, Mark Zuckerbergwants to take over making the ads, too.The WPP firm VML used AI to create the ‘One Bic, One Book, Two Classics’ campaign for Bic in Brazil.Photograph: WPPTheMetaboss is gearing up to unleash AI tools to allow advertisers to fully create and target campaigns on his social media sites, prompting fears of the “death of creativity” – and widespread job cuts at agencies.Last week it emerged that these tools are to berolled out by the end of next year, with Zuckerberg describing the capability in a recent interview as a “redefinition of the category of advertising. You don’t need any creative, you don’t need any targeting, you don’t need any measurement, except to be able to read the results that we spit out,” he said last month, in comments that appear to render much of the advertising industry obsolete.Rahul Dravid in Cadbury’s Bournvita campaign, which used AI.Agencies of all sizes – and particularly the deep-pocketed international groups such as WPP, Publicis and Omnicom – are pouring investment into developing their own AI tools and working with tech companies such as Meta andGoogle. But the plan is meant to be to keep clients, not lose them.“I think there is no doubt AI will disintermediate a large number of jobs,” says the chief executive of one big ad agency. “Having said that, there are many agencies with big corporate clients that really could do with being slimmed down a lot. I can see staffing in areas like strategy, consumer insight and some conceptual roles being safe, but what will be really hit is those involved in production and the realisation of ideas.”Big tech executives espoused the benefits of AI at the annual Enders Deloitte conference on the media and telecoms industry last week.Stephan Pretorius, who described himself as “WPP’s AI guy” as he co-led a session with Meta, said: “Creativity, in its purest form, remains a human skill.”WPP’s Stephan Pretorius on AI and advertising.He argued that AI does not equate to job cuts but admitted that agencies need to restructure and advertising client relationships are changing.“AI replaces tasks, it eliminates tasks, it doesn’t eliminate jobs,” he said. “A lot of what we used to get paid for is now getting automated and therefore our commercial models have to change, our team structures have to change. The way we are incentivised by our clients is changing. But that is the transition.”Last month WPP said there would be an undisclosed number of redundancies globally across WPP Media, formerly known as GroupM, which plans and buys billions of pounds of ad space for clients across digital and traditional media.“You have a situation where the big holding companies are in a dilemma,” another ad agency chief executive says. “Clients expect us to invest millions developing AI so they can cut their budgets because things can be done quicker and cheaper. Lots of clients are asking for fee reductions.”So far the AI revolution does not appear to be having a big impact on the UK industry.View image in fullscreenThe Facebook and Instagram owner, Meta, has said it will release AI tools to allow advertisers to fully create and target campaigns on social media sites.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThere were a record 26,787 people employed in media, creative and digital agencies last year, according to the Institute of Practitioners inAdvertising(IPA), the trade body for agencies that represent 85% of ad spend by clients in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You hear creatives saying that AI is never going to come up with something as brilliant as, say,a gorilla playing drums for Cadbury, but I am not so sure. AI will eventually become fine-tuned enough to react to the quite left-field conceptual prompting.”View image in fullscreenThe Cadbury’s Dairy Milk TV advert featuring a gorilla playing the drums – created by the ad agency Fallon – became a viral hit.Photograph: Rex FeaturesSince making the comments that the industry took to mean that Meta is seeking to supplant the role of agencies, Zuckerberg has tried to clarify that the AI tools are primarily expected to be used by small and medium-sized businesses.“In the future, if you were working with a creative agency to make creative, you’ll probably keep doing that,” he said at the Stripe conference, clarifying his position a week after making his initial comments about the scope of Meta’s AI advertising plans. “If you aren’t and you’re just hacking something together and throwing it into Meta’s ad system, well now we’re going to be able to come up with 4,000 different versions of your creative and just test them and figure out which one works best.”Meta and Google have always considered that they have “democratised” advertising by enabling the long tail of millions of small businesses that do not have the financial wherewithal to run TV ad campaigns, or employ an ad agency to run campaigns.“That is the smokescreen they always use,” the ad agency boss says. “When they first emerged as new ad channels decades ago it was all about small businesses, and now they take nearly two-thirds of all UK ad spend.”In the noughties, as big tech grew increasingly powerful, Sir Martin Sorrell, who built WPP into the world’s biggest ad group and is now the chief executive of S4 Capital,labelled Meta and Google “frenemies”– meaning they can be seen as a partner and as a competitive threat to agencies.Two decades on, the rise of AI in advertising is the latest technological development forcing the industry to once again adapt to survive.“Meta’s new promise to ‘auto-generate your ad in seconds’ is the clearest sign yet that the production sausage factory is about to be fully mechanised,” says Patrick Garvey, the co-founder of the independent agency We Are Pi. “It’s not the death of agencies. It’s the death of outdated agency models.”He is supportive of small businesses benefiting from the changes but says Meta’s approach to AI is akin to the “fast food of advertising”. For traditional companies in adland, it could be a difficult meal to stomach.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)MetaTechnology sectorAdvertisingWPP (Media)WPP (Business)GooglefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We don’t know anything.”Jacob and Romero were among dozens of people arrested in immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles this weekend, raids that sparked a roaring backlash and eventually led to the deployment of the national guard in the city. They were “kidnapped” by agents, Contreras said. “I demand due process for my father and the dozens of other workers.”The raids in the fashion district were followed by enforcement actions in the nearby city of Paramount, where federal agents cuffed and detained laborers at a Home Depot. Agents were also spotted outside a donut shop in nearby Compton, and around schools.1:18‘A very traumatising experience’: families of LA detainees demand their release – videoSome of the families of those detained gathered outside Ambiance on Monday, demanding the release of their loved ones. Some, like Jacob, were the sole breadwinners in their families. Others, like José Ortiz, had worked in LA’s garment district for years – Ortiz had been with Ambiance for 18 years. “He was always here. He was a loyal worker,” his daughter Saraí Ortiz said. “He is someone who gave his life to this community and to his work.”Carlos Gonzalez said his older brother José Paulino was taken away not only from his siblings and mother, but also from “one of the friendliest and most loving dogs I have ever met”.At least 14 of those detained were members of the Episcopalian Diocese of Los Angeles. “Fourteen members of one of our Episcopal churches couldn’t be in church this morning on the Day of Pentecost. Their government ripped them from the arms of their families at home and the body of Christ at church,” said Los Angeles bishop John Harvey Taylor.Loved ones and lawyers are still scrambling to find where all of them were taken.“As police shot flash bangs overhead, I begged officers to let me meet with those who were detained,” said Elaina Jung Hee Vermeulen, a legal fellow at theCaliforniaCollaborative for Immigrant Justice. “Instead of upholding the constitutional rights of those detained, they prepared to repress those rising up against these atrocities.”The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that 118 immigrants were arrested this week, and released the names of some of those in its custody, alleging criminal violations. But the administration’s border czar, Tom Homan, also admitted that the agency was arresting people without criminal records.The raids at workplaces – pushed by Homan and by White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller – come amid a broader push to speed up arrests and deportations. Homan said the LA area is likely to see more enforcement this week, even as thousands of national guard deployed to the city prepared to quell protests against the raids.Lawyers from the Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), found that immigrants apprehended in LA were initially detained in the basement of a federal immigration building. “As attorneys, we are disgusted by DHS’s blatant betrayal of basic human dignity as we witness hundreds of people held in deplorable conditions without food, water, or beds for 12-plus hours,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, president of ImmDef. “This is an urgent moment for our country to wake up to the terror Ice is inflicting on communities and take action.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The injunction applied to a wide swath of California, and came after CBP conducted similar raids in California’s agricultural Kern county in January.“You can’t just racially and ethnically profile people and arrest them and ask questions later,” said Reyes Savalza, noting that many of those arrested had no criminal history and could apply for various forms of immigration relief if they were allowed to contact attorneys.“If the federal government can come and kidnap people without disclosing any information as to the reason for those arrests, every person in this country should be appalled and terrified,” he added.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsTrump administrationUS immigrationLos AngelesCaliforniaUS politicsWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On one stage, Nigel Farage was in a Welsh former steel towntalking aboutreopening coalmines. On another, Keir Starmer enjoyeda cosy chatwith a tech multi-billionaire wearing a £7,000 leather jacket.Does this therefore show that the Reform UK leader has been successful in, to use his words,parking his tankson Labour’s lawn and becoming the voice of working people? As ever in politics, it’s all a bit more complicated.For one thing, Starmer is not exactly a stranger to the factory floor. Little more than a week ago, he used a glass plant in St Helens, Merseyside, as the backdrop fora speechcondemning Reform’s fiscal plans. Recent months have seen him pop up at car production lines, armaments companies and rail infrastructure depots.As a prime minister you need to take every industry seriously, and it made sense for Starmer to open London tech week alongside Jensen Huang, even if the head of US semiconductor firm Nvidia is a man whose trademark look is a Tom Ford leather jacket.The complications work both ways. For all that Farage used his speech in Port Talbot to deliver a Donald Trump-like message of fossil fuel-led reindustrialisation, his natural milieu involves a bit less dirt under the fingernails.To take one example, on Monday Farage briefly mentioned beingin Las Vegastwo weeks ago “launching our crypto and digital assets bill”, when he was in fact a guest speaker at the lavish bitcoin 2025 conference.It is not known if Farage was being paid for the appearance, but he is no stranger to corporate gigs. Since becoming an MP hehas trousered£40,000 for a speech to an offshore taxation conference, and £280,000 promoting gold bullion, not to mention a TV job that pays about £2,500 per hour.And yet, in a poll released last week,it emerged thatslightly more British voters think Farage – a public school-educated former City trader – is more working class than Starmer, who is, as we heard many times during the general election, the son of a toolmaker. What is going on?One bit of context is that actually not that many people believed it about either – 19% for Farage, and 17% with Starmer. Why so few for the prime minister? In part, it’s likely to be his long pre-politics career as a lawyer and then director of public prosecutions – and particularly the knighthood that resulted.More generally, it’s fair to say that voters’ impressions of politicians are often a bit hazy. A long-runningYouGov trackerof the most popular British politicians has Brexit-backing Conservative peer David Frost top, and the shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, third – unlikely results widely assumed to be because people have mistaken them for the more fondly recalledlate TV hostandOlympic cyclistrespectively.More pertinent is that when it comes to actual voter support, Reform is the top choice among working-class voters. Onepoll last monthsaid that just 17% supported Labour, against 39% for Reform.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage in Port Talbot on Monday.Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty ImagesFarage is very aware of this current advantage, and makes a point of regular speeches at working men’s clubs, channelling Trump’s paradoxical political status as a wealthy man who largely spends time with other wealthy men but nonetheless attracts support in deprived areas.All that said, Starmer is determined to shift those Reform tanks by pointing out another similarity with Trump – the fact that Farage’s policies seem more generally aimed at the managerial class than those on the factory floor.Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary,argued recentlythat Farage was “cosplaying” as a voice of the working classes, and that his opposition to the government’s employment rights bill and lack of a coherent economic plan showed his lack of authenticity.Even as Farage talks up the return of heavy industry and calls for the water industry to be nationalised, expect more of the same from Downing Street, plus Starmer’s insistence that a “Liz Truss 2.0” policy of mass tax cuts would hurt ordinary families the most.And if you run a factory, brace yourself for more political visits.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsNigel FarageKeir StarmerLabourReform UKOpinion pollsnewsShareReuse this content"

This striking and dismaying documentary sees him tackle the government to do better for kids today. The scene with Bridget Phillipson is really somethingLucy ManganMon 9 Jun 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareAbout 15 years ago I was at a do for a children’s literacy charity and the guest speaker wasJamie Oliver. He got up and spoke easily, wittily and movingly – without notes – about his experiences as a child at school with undiagnosed dyslexia that meant he only read a book for the first time at the age of 33. Now he is channelling those experiences, with what he has learned over the last two decades as a campaigner (most famously about school dinners, when he brought to public attention the pennies’ worth of cheap slop we were pushing down our children’s gullets five times a week), into the cause of educational reform.Jamie’sDyslexiaRevolution marks the culmination of six months’ work by Oliver and his team, including his right-hand woman for activism, Alison Corfield, and the beginning of a media blitz designed to force the government’s hand.There are a number of striking moments in the documentary and it opens with one of them: we watch Oliver recording the audio version of one of his cookbooks, which he has to do a few words at a time before the jumbled print he sees forces him into error and he has to stop, breathe and start again. It’s the perfect, succinct demonstration of both how his mind works and of the immense frustration at not being able to process the written word in the same way most can.How much greater the frustration and the demoralisation must be when you are an undiagnosed child with dyslexia (“I wrote myself off,” says Oliver) or – as the programme goes on to make clear – a diagnosed child without sufficient support – is brought equally vividly to life. We hear descriptions from children now and from adults recollecting their painful years in an education system not cognisant of their needs. “I hated being me, I hated school, I hated life.” “I remember that feeling in the pit of my stomach, how scared I was.” “When [other children] try their best you can see it. But when I try my best it looks like I’m not doing anything at all.”Another helpful aid for those without the condition to get a sense of what it might be like is the various captions that accompany points made in the film, which are written as a dyslexic reader might experience them. “Dyslexia han sothisg [nothing] to bo with intelligesce.” It is “a learning bifference that affects the adility to reab, sqell, write, qrocess and remember information”. About 10% of children in an average class are thought to have the condition – another 15% are likely to be wrestling with other neurodiverse issues.View image in fullscreenWill it force the government’s hand? … Jamie's Dyslexia Revolution.Photograph: Jamie Oliver ProductionsOliver’s main focus is on the need for teachers to be better trained in the special needs that a quarter of each of their classes can have, and for mandatory early screening of all children for those needs to be introduced. Backed up, of course, by funding that doesn’t hack yet more money out of disappearing school budgets – for the training, screening and ongoing support of children. Specialists and scientists point out that teaching in ways and with materials that help children with dyslexia can help the entire class – no detriment is suffered by the majority by incorporating services for them as well. If anything, the introduction of multi-sensory learning and so on lifts all boats.Statistics suggest early intervention is worth it to society on practical as well as moral grounds. Students with dyslexia are now 3.5 times more likely to be expelled than those without. Expelled students are 200% more likely to get involved in violent crime. An estimated 50% of prisoners have a learning disability often only identified once they are residing at his majesty’s pleasure.Oliver and his team put together the facts and figures, the testimonies, their aims and ideal strategies, and hold a well-attended parliamentary event that they hope will lead – and indeed it does – to a meeting with the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson. Oliver sits with her, explaining his and parents’ and experts’ concerns, and at one deeply satisfying yet dismaying point pulling her up on her fudging or misapprehension of the current practice of screening. “It’s not statutory,” he points out. “And it’s not done for every child.”This raises bigger questions of course, beyond the remit of the programme, about the integrity of politicians, the knowledge of their subjects and why we live in a world where it takes celebrities to pressurise them into making change. Or at least, as Phillipson guardedly promises, to “take that away” and think about it.Oliver has less bounce to him than he did during his school dinners campaign. He looks weary, though still determined. He is doing, on both fronts, still better than the rest of us.Jamie’s Dyslexia Revolution is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJamie OliverDyslexiaSchoolsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Suddenly, as I came to, the whole place appeared alive and more and more good stuff leapt out from the 1,600 works on view. What’s that upsidedown stag? It’s by the 87-year-old German master Georg Baselitz. As for those convex mirrors above your head, reflecting you and the floor in radical foreshortening, that’s an installation by Cornelia Parker. In the same room hang eviscerated animal carcasses hooked up on chains, made of textiles by Tamara Kostianovsky.But it’s Jesus who lifts this exhibition out of the ordinary. He moves towards you like a shark in the illusion created by Tracey Emin’s painting The Crucifixion. And like a shark, he is frightening. I thought art had lost its capacity to shock. But what can be more shocking than a celebrated 21st-century artist sincerely painting the passion? Emin shows another work before this startling, upsetting show-stopper – an outsized, melancholy portrait print. It makes you wonder and worry: is the artist OK? And even, is the artist any good? This female face is so broadly sketched it’s a bit clumsy, and yet you can’t forget it.Don't we all share Christ's fate, Emin is sayingEmin’s talent is still raw after all these years and she has painted her masterpiece in the crucifixion. If you doubt her, see this. If you love her, see this. It’s a big painting of the three crosses on the hill of Golgotha. Christ is flanked by two other crucified figures, one of whom is a woman – the only departure from iconographic tradition. Emin is a fan of north European art, including Munch. Here she echoes the intense, macabre Three Crosses of German renaissance painter Lucas Cranach. Then again, she may also be echoing The Life of Brian, for there’s something cinematic about the way the two side crosses are set back, thrusting Christ’s suffering body forward for us to see, to pity. He’s got a crown, a beard, a broken harrowed face, painted blue in a yellow desert. His knees are knobbly, legs thin, chest skinny.View image in fullscreenGreat balls … inside the Summer Exhibition.Photograph: David Parry/Royal Academy of ArtsThe curving dark line enclosing the white semi-circle of the hill of Golgotha strongly resembles the way Francis Bacon enclosed his figures in abstract rooms. Like a Bacon bedroom, this barren hilltop represents the prison of existence we all share. The two other victims – two thieves, according to the Bible – share Christ’s fate, nailed to massive crosses. Don’t we all, says Emin.This is the greatest new painting that’s been seen since Lucian Freud died. But was he ever as universal? Emin shows why religious art, whatever your beliefs or lack of them, has a power to portray our common human fragility. People are always being crucified.This modern masterpiece doesn’t overwhelm the show but opens your eyes to other strong works. Go and look at George Shaw’s painting Survivors 1, which sucks you into its peculiarly British sadness. On a scrap of parkland in front of an estate of featureless houses with blank windows, a leafless tree claws at the drab sky. More trees “survive” beyond it. If you need cheering up after this blast of depressive Gainsborough, head for Frank Bowling’s Red, Yellow and Blue – a tall, slender abstract painting with bits of plastic and medication packaging embedded in it, a fizzing cocktail of gold fire and night blue that seems a homage to Whistler’s Nocturnes, but on a grand abstract expressionist scale.View image in fullscreenSubtlety and fun … another gallery.Photograph: David Parry/Royal Academy of ArtsThe Royal Academy summer show’s days of defining the new are usually thought to be long gone. Yet this is a peculiar moment in art, when what is avant garde and what is conservative are messed up. Perhaps this exhibition has a serious, even urgent job to do, with its unique mix of the famous, unknown, impressive and terrible. Who did that huge grotesque portrait of a woman who looks like a Dada montage? A wild amateur? No, Cindy Sherman.It’s a shame more of the memorable pieces aren’t by unknowns but by and large the art elite justify their prices and honours: Dexter Dalwood, Rose Wylie, Stephen Farthing, Sean Scully, the late Timothy Hyman. At 87, Allen Jones is still perving with panache. There’s a strikingly weird painting of two women on the tube by Paulina Olowska.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anderson lingers on the lush green forest all around. You can see it as an allegory of climate crisis, humanity’s hard fall coming. Other effective political artworks include Jock McFadyen’s Somewhere in Ukraine, a view of a battered apartment block with battle smoke on the horizon, and Marcus Harvey’s Nelson at Trafalgar, which turns the British hero into a mummified corpse.It all kicks off in the courtyard with big black inflatable balls by Ryan Gander, printed with questions: “How much is a lot?” “Does abstraction have rules?” Daft but fun, these pseudo-intellectual japes put you in a good mood for an exhibition full of surprises and subtleties. All that, plus the greatest artwork Emin has yet given us.

On 20 June 1975, cinemagoers in the US were the first to experience the visceral thrills and oceanic spills ofJaws.It’s the original blockbuster, it inspired an entire genre of “sharksploitation” entertainment, and it transformed what millions thought about sharks, for better and for worse.In many ways, Steven Spielberg’s marine masterpiece was an accident. In 1973, the novelist Peter Benchley came up with the title Jawsjust 20 minutes before his final deadline. “What does it mean?” asked his editor. “I haven’t the faintest idea,” replied Benchley, “but at least it’s short.”Nicknamed Bruce (after Spielberg’s lawyer), the mechanical shark used in the film malfunctioned so much that it appeared in the final edit for a mere four minutes, and not fully until nearly an hour in. Instead Spielberg focused on fear and threat, and the rest is history.Yet perhaps he did his job too well. Ross Williams, editor of The Daily Jaws website, says the film “cast a long shadow over sharks. It turned fear into frenzy, and that fear translated into decades of persecution.”After 1975, shark killing and trophy hunts soared globally. All this despite statistics showing that in the US ahuman is more likely to be bittenby a New Yorker than a shark.View image in fullscreenSteven Spielberg directing Jaws. He would later express remorse for the ‘decimation of the shark population … I really truly regret that’.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyResearch suggests that between 1986 and 2000, in the north-west Atlantic Ocean, there was a population decline of 89% in hammerhead sharks, 79% in great white sharks and 65% in tiger sharks, many of which were caught in fishing nets.Figures published in Sciencehave estimated shark deaths from fishing at 80m a year, 25m of which are threatened species.The zoology writer Jules Howard says that “in the case of great whites it’s a hit job … it’s depressing, since sharks like these are not monsters. They’re complex, communicative beings that happen to be very well adapted for killing things. You’d think we’d see the similarities, somehow.”Spielbergexpressed his remorseon the BBC’s Desert Island Discs, saying: “The decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film … I really truly regret that.”And yet Jawshas had positive effects too. Benchley became involved in marine conservation, as did the film’s underwater photographers Ron and Valerie Taylor and Rodney Fox.Speaking to the Guardian from Australia, Fox says the fascination with sharks sparked by Jaws“culminated in not just the conservation of sharks, but to a care and understanding of the important role they play in the wider marine environment”.Howard is just one of many who bear this out: “I remember that feeling,” he says. “Seeing the film. Buying the shark books. Understanding sharks in a deeper way. Wanting to shout loud to see them respected, conserved, saved.”Williams adds: “It’s not about fearing sharks any more. It’s about fearing a world without them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many have played it for cheap thrills and, increasingly, laughs, such as Roboshark, Ghost Shark, Sharkenstein, 5-Headed Shark Attackand of courseSharknado.But others, like last year’s Something in the Water,have tried to replicate the fear of Jawswhile showing sensitivity to the animals. Its British director, Hayley Easton Street, says: “I wanted the sharks to just be animals that need to find food, not vicious killers hunting humans.”Today the ocean’s apex predator is part of our lexicon, in phrases such as “jumping the shark”, and they have even swum into populist politics.Boris Johnsoninvoked the mayor from Jawsduring the pandemic for keeping the beaches open; while Donald Trump has speculated on the relative merits of being electrocuted orattacked by a shark.Perhaps most notoriously of all, Korean company Pinkfong’s version of the children’s song Baby Sharkis the most watched YouTube video of all time, racking up 15bn views and counting. No great white has ever caused that much trauma.Would Jawsget made now? In a 1995 essay for Smithsonian magazine, Benchley reflected: “If I were to write the book today, the shark would have to be the victim.”These astonishing animals are still fighting to escape the shadow of the film, but thanks to the next generation of scientists, advocates and reformed storytellers, the tide may finally be turning.Jon Harvey’sIntothe Sharkiverseis on BBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsJawsSteven SpielbergFilm industrySharksMarine lifeWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The cookware craze redefining ‘ceramic’ and ‘nontoxic’Designer brands such as Always Pan and Caraway are booming – but safety experts are raising questionsSign up for the Detox Your Kitchen newsletterTom PerkinsMon 9 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 18.46 EDTShareThe cookware industry has entered a golden age, largely driven by the wild success of a new generation of “nontoxic” and “nonstick” designer ceramic pans backed by stars includingSelena Gomez,Stanley TucciandOprah Winfrey.But the pans are likely not “nontoxic” someindependent testingandresearch suggests. Nor are they even “ceramic” – at least not in the way the public broadly thinks of ceramics. Now, regulators are investigating some of the pan sellers’ claims.OnInstagram, TikTok and theirmarketing materials, the social media-savvy cookware brands promise “enchantment”, and “non-toxic materials and thoughtful design” that “prioritizes the health and safety of you and your family”.In fact, no legal definition for “nontoxic” or “ceramic” exists, and the marketing has drawn greenwashing accusations exacerbated by the companies concealing their pans’ ingredients.And the blockbuster sellers like Our Place’s Always Pan, Caraway and GreenPan are typically made with a material that thinly coats an aluminum substrate and is characterized in one study as “quasi-ceramic”. Meanwhile, independent testing and research suggests quasi-ceramics may contain toxins like titanium dioxide, siloxanes, lead and mercury.The claims are eliciting regulatory scrutiny. The state of Washington recently ordered quasi-ceramic producers to submit their nonstick ingredients to the state’s ecology department as it attempts to learn which chemicals cookware companies are using to replace Teflon or other toxic Pfas, or “forever chemicals”. The order is about “transparency”, said Marissa Smith, a senior toxicologist with the Washington department of ecology.“It’s challenging for regulators to know when we’re moving to safe alternatives, but it’s also hard for families who want to buy safer products,” Smith said. “There’s this fundamental challenge of figuring out what’s in our products and having the data to make those decisions.”The nonstick, quasi-ceramics have in part quickly blown up because, their producers claim, they cracked the “nontoxic/nonstick” code. Prior to 2019, nonstick pans largely used Pfas, a class of chemicals that contain among the most toxic man-made substances, and linked to cancer and a range of other serious health problems. The quasi-ceramic, design-forward pans with color palettes like “spice” and a millennial aesthetic burst onto a market ripe for an alternative.Their launches coincided with the rise of wellness culture and the pandemic’s outset. With people forced to cook at home and on social media, the cookware became Instagramsensations– Caraway’s monthly ecommerce salesjumped390% between January and May 2020.Celebrity involvement also fueled the quick ascents: Selena Gomez, Tan France, Gwyneth Paltrow, Stanley Tucci and Drew Barrymore now have their own quasi-ceramic pan lines.Gigi HadidandKate Hudsonpromoted their Caraways in the media. Always Pan’s orderbacklog hit 30,000early on. GreenPan made Oprah’s 2024Favorite Things list, and Caraway’s profits grew over 500% between 2020 and 2023.Throughout, the companies have relentlessly touted their products as “nontoxic”.What is ‘ceramic’?Ceramic cookware dates back at least 15,000 years. The concept evolved across cultures – the medieval British pipkin, the ancient Roman testum and the Wampanoag Native American decorated pots. Throughout the ages, the basic formula remained the same: some mix of clay, silica and minerals fired at a high heat to create a solid piece.The new quasi-ceramics are something else. The producers use some variation of a process called “sol-gel” developed in the 1970s to create a material that is a mix of silica, metals and chemicals. The material is sprayed onto an aluminum substrate – the pan is not quasi-ceramic all the way through.The companies won’t tell the public what else is in the pans, and their formulas are shielded by confidential business information laws, making it very difficult to verify their claims. The uncertainty alone raises suspicions among some public health advocates, but sleuthing of peer-reviewed research, legal documents, patents and regulatory documents around the pans raises more questions than answers, and points toward the use of toxic chemicals.Still, Carawaystates: “We believe in full transparency with regard to our products, so we’re happy to share testing reports with anyone via email to prove just how safe our products are.”In an email to the Guardian, it declined to share the formula: “The formulation of Caraway’s ceramic cooking surfaces is proprietary.”Responding in 2022 to I Read Labels For You, a consumer protection site that questioned the pan producers’ non-toxicity claims, Always Pan maker Our Placeconceded the products are not ceramic, but a “ceramic precursor” with a different formula.“We are heating it at a lower temperature, it never gets to that ceramic state,” Always Pan wrote. “Ceramic is totally inorganic whereas our sol-gel has organic and inorganic substances. The inorganic material is glass/silica. The organic material is an organic polymer.”In an email to the Guardian, Our Place said its pans’ materials are “similar in feel to traditional ceramics”, and are made with “a sand-based material, which is why it’s commonly referred to as ‘ceramic’”. It did not immediately respond to a question about why it’s marketed as ceramic if it’s admittedly not ceramic.The distinction is in part important because the surfaces can potentially melt at heat above 260C (500F), increasing the risk of chemicals leaching into food. The pans have also beenreportedtowear downandlosetheir nonstick coating sometimes within months of purchase. True ceramic can withstand much higher heat and is far more durable.Other quasi-ceramic producers use a similar material, all of which include polymers. Polymers may mean any of tens of thousands of chemicals, including Pfas, which the sol-gel patent even details. Applying nonstick organic polymers may also create toxic monomer byproducts, Smith noted, but it’s impossible to know without having the pan makers’ ingredients. Nonstick can liningscan createtoxic bisphenol-A, for example.A 2019 lawsuitallegedGreenPan’s “0% toxins” claim represented false advertising. Citing GreenPan’s patent, the suit alleged the pans contained silane, aluminum oxide, tetraethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, and potassium titanate. Regulatorsclassify some of theseas hazardous, but the suit was dismissed, though the settlement’s terms are unclear. GreenPan has denied using aluminum oxide. It did not respond to a request for comment.Smith said the state of Washington is concerned companies may be using siloxane, a chemical family often used to replace Pfas in consumer goods, but which sometimes pose similar risks. One industrystudycompared the performance of nonstick properties of siloxanes to Pfas in quasi-ceramic pans, finding Pfas worked better.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDetox Your KitchenFree weekly newsletterA seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A 2016studyalso identified titanium dioxide in quasi-ceramic pans, and showed how it can migrate into food. The toxic substance is banned in the European Union for use in food, but not cookware. It’s a potential carcinogen that accumulates in organs and islinked toneurotoxicity, intestinal inflammation and other health impacts.Caraway in 2024 acknowledged using nanoparticles, though they didn’t say which. But, it claimed without supporting evidence, that the levels it uses doesn’t cause health risks.All told, there’s evidence that the pans could contain such ingredients as titanium dioxide, lead, mercury, cadmium, siloxanes, potentially toxic monomer byproducts and other unknown substances. Even if the levels of individual toxins are low, there’s no research into the health effects of all the toxins combined migrating into food, which raises a whole new set of questions.Caraway in a statement to the Guardian said the company could not “speak to the conduct or quality of any testing that is not its own”.“Caraway is proud of the products we have developed and the progress made towards a cleaner home for our customers, there is still much to be done,” the statement added.Public health advocates say the uncertainty is a red flag, and forcing consumers to “go through tests and patents” to know what they’re buying is “absolutely ridiculous,” said Laurie Valeriano, executive director of the Toxic Free Future non-profit, which has raised concerns about quasi-ceramics.“It shouldn’t be up to consumers to sleuth and try to figure out the ingredients in pans so they can protect the health of themselves and their families,” Valeriano added.Maryland-based Xtrema is one of very few companies producing ceramic pans as they have been traditionally made. Production takes up to 25 days, said owner Rich Bergstrom and produces a solid ceramic piece that can withstand high levels of heat. Companies passing off a softer sol-gel coating as true ceramic “irks me – it drives me crazy”, Bergstrom said. He called it a “false term”, and said it’s being “manipulated from a marketing standpoint to give you the impression that it’s ceramic”.Lead and regulationsSome of the pans also contain lead, testing Lead Safe Mama’s Tamara Rubin found. The lids and cooking surfaces of theAlways PanandCarawayshowed some of the toxin, which she said suggests aluminum substrates and pieces are to blame.Rubin also found mercury in theCarawayand antimony throughoutGreenPan. Caraway still advertises “metals free”, and GreenPanstatesits products “lack harmful chemicals and toxins”.Rubin is a polarizing figure for her generally absolutist positions on lead – if a product contains the substance, she recommends against it. This is the most protective approach, but companies and regulators point out that lead is naturally occurring and widespread in the environment, often found at low levels in ceramics’ clay, as well as foods. They claim “trace” levels of lead are OK, especially if it’s not in a food contact surface. But there’s no definition for “trace”.No federal limits for lead in ceramic cookware exist. If lead in a ceramic piece isn’t leaching at the time a consumer buys it, then there isn’t a problem, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) told the Guardian in 2022. However, there’s no testing or oversight program, or assurance it doesn’t leach once it’s scratched, chipped or worn.The FDA has done little to scrutinize cookware materials throughout the decades because it’s chronically underfunded and understaffed, said Tom Neltner, director of the Unleaded Kids no-nprofit, who has legally pressured the FDA to act on leaded food materials: “With all the things coming into the agency, they have not looked at all these lead issues, and there’s no public scrutiny of their priorities.”However, the state of Washington is implementing the nation’s first limits directly addressing cookware – 90 parts per million (ppm) next year, and 10ppm by 2028. Rubin found levels as high as 70ppm in the Always Pan.Rubin in 2018 also found lead, cadmium and other metals like cobalt in Xtrema pieces, and advises against them for that reason. Bergstrom said he eliminated the highest sources of lead, like the logo on the pan’s bottom. He also noted Rubin’s testing looks for the presence of lead, but not whether it leaches into food.True ceramic pans are less of a leach risk because the material is more solid than quasi-ceramic, Bergstrom claims. His pans have passed California’s Proposition 65 leach tests of new products, and he also pointed to testing that showed no lead leaching from an Xtrema pan thathad been used for several years.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingConsumer spendingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do keep up.The only way a British person will eat their dinner at 10.30pm is if a) they have been drinking and b) that dinner takes the form of a kebab in a polystyrene tray.I hate to burst your bubble but, according to the Times, a number of upmarket London restaurants have started to embrace late-night dining.But that’s so late.Don’t be a wimp. Mountain in Soho now has a latest reservation slot of 10.30pm. At weekends, Speedboat Bar (also in Soho) is open until 1am. And Noodle and Beer in Chinatown stays open until 4am from Thursday to Saturday.OK, but why?Well, there are a couple of possible explanations. One is that this is a sign of our continuing Covid bounce back; a hint that we might tentatively be returning to our dining habits of old.I neverate at 10.30pm in the first place.Then how’s this? London’s nightlife has all but died. Pubs close early and there are fewer and fewer places to go out dancing. If people want to stay out late, eating is all they have left to do.That isn’t much of an incentive.Well then, how’s this? Jeremy King, who operates Arlington and The Park, has offered diners a 25% discount if they eat after 9.15pm at The Park and 9.45pm at Arlington.A late-bird special! Now you’re talking my language.Exactly! Get on board. Spain’s entire dining culture happens late at night, and they love it.That depends on who you ask.Last yearSpain’s labour minister saidthat eating late was a result of the country’s gruelling work hours, and that those hours directly contributed to poor mental health. But still!Are there any other health issues to consider?Oh yes, three years ago Harvard Medical Schoolran a studyabout eating late. It found that those who ate late at night experienced drops in the hormone leptin, which signals satiety, and they burned off calories more slowly.In simple terms, please?Eat late, put on weight.So this is silly.No, it’s great! Nobody is saying eat at 10.30 every night. But live a little! Go out into the world and enjoy all it has to offer!Can I be back in time for the end of Newsnight, though?Sure, but you might need to skip pudding.Do say:“Dining is the new big night out.”Don’t say:“Mate, last night I got absolutely off my face on gazpacho.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Australian reporter Lauren Tomasi was the second journalist after the British photographer Nick Stern to beshot with non-lethal roundswhile covering protests in Los Angeles sparked by immigration raids. But she was the first to be caught on camera and beamed around the world. There’s no excuse for not knowing what the US is becoming, now that anyone can watch that clip online. Not when you can hear her scream and see the cameraman quickly swing away to film a panicking crowd.It was the scenario everyone feared when Donald Trump took office. Deportation hit squads descending on the kind of Democrat-voting communities who would feel morally bound to resist them, triggering the kind of violent confrontation that creates an excuse to send in national guard troops – and ultimately a showdown between federal and state power that could take US democracy to the brink. Now something like this may be unfolding in California, wherethe state governor, Gavin Newsom, has accused the president of trying to “manufacture a crisis” for his own ends and warned that any protester responding with violence is only playing into his hands. Suddenly, the idea that this presidency could ultimately end in civil conflict no longer seems quite so wildly overblown as it once did.Or to put it another way, Trump has got what he wanted, which is for everyone to switch channels: to stop gawping at his embarrassing fallout with Elon Musk over unfunded tax cuts, and flick over to the rival spectacle he has hastily created. After a brief interruption to scheduled programming, the great showman is back in control. But in the meantime, the world has learned something useful about who wins in a standoff between two giant egos, one of whom has all the money and the other of whom has all the executive power. In US oligarchies just as in Russian ones, it turns out, it’s presidents who still get to set the agenda.You can’t ride the tiger. That’s the lesson here: once populism has grasped the levers of power, even the richest man in the world cannot be sure of exploiting it for his own ends, or imposing his own agenda on the chaos. Not when a vengeful White House still has the power to destroy even the most powerful business empire, anyway. At the weekend, Muskmeekly deleted explosive tweetsabout the president’s alleged relationship with the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, and by Monday he was loyally sharing Trumpian messages about the LA protests. His father, meanwhile, tactfully blamed the outburst onMusk Junior being “tired”after five months working round the clock for the White House.That ought to ring some bells on this side of the Atlantic. For oddly enough, it’s the same excuse offered up by Zia Yusuf, the millionaire businessman brought in to professionalise Reform UK’s perennially chaotic operation, who last week quit as chair in exasperation. Trying to get the party into power was no longer a “good use of his time”, he tweeted, after publicly clashing with its newest MP, Sarah Pochin, over her decision to ask a question in parliament about banning burqas (which isn’t officially Reform policy, or at least not yet). Yusuf, a British Muslim, has long been seen as Farage’s trusted bulwark against those inside Reform desperate to pick up where the jailed thug Stephen Yaxley-Lennon left off, and to become a full-blown, far-right anti-Islam movement.But this time, it seems, Yusuf may have bitten off more than the boss was ready to chew. A whole two days after storming out, Yusuf ended upstorming awkwardly back in, telling the BBC that actually, having thought about it, he probablywouldban burqas and other face coverings. He had just been exhausted, he suggested, after barely having a day off in 11 months. (If nothing else, it seems Reform really means what it says about fighting back against modern HR practices.)To be fair to him, even Farage seems to find the process of trying to control his parties exhausting at times, judging by the regularity with which he has taken breaks from them over the years. While Yusuf won’t return as chair, he will nowjoin Reform’s so-called British Doge, supposedly taking aMusk-style chainsawto council spending – which sounds like a breeze compared with managing Reform MPs. Until, that is, you reflect on how exactly Doge has turned out across the Atlantic.The reason parts of Silicon Valley were quietly enthusiastic about their fellow tech tycoon’s slash and burn approach to US bureaucracy was that they saw profitable method in the madness: a plan to hack the state back to the bare minimum, opening up new markets for digital services and unleashing (or so they hoped) a new wave of economic growth by slashing national debt.Five months on, however, it’s clear that any Doge savings will be utterly dwarfed by Trump’s forecast to send national debt soaring touncharted and potentially unsustainable highs. Any tech titan hoping for the US equivalent of Margaret Thatcher on steroids, in other words, has ended up with Liz Truss after one too many espressos instead – plus troops on the streets of California and the slowly dawning realisation that, as the billionaire venture capitalist Michael Moritz put it, they have“no sway” over what they unleashed.There will be plenty of people back in Britain who couldn’t care less about obscure comings and goings in the Reform party, even as itspoll leadmeans it’s starting to make the political weather. Others simply don’t expect it to affect their lives much either way if Reform permanently supplants a Conservative party from which it alreadyseems hard to distinguish, and a few may already be calculating that they can turn its rise to their own advantage.Yet what the last few frightening days in the US have demonstrated is that once populism has its feet firmly enough under the table, chaos wins. There’s no ability to belatedly impose order, no house-training it either. All you can do is deny it a room in the house in the first place. In Britain, at least, it’s not too late for that.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Mum made me the dress for an anti-nuclear rally sometime in the mid-1970s. I don’t remember wearing it that day, or being carried on my dad’s shoulders as we marched with thousands of protesters, but I do recall wearing many of the other clothes Mum made me as a child.There was a lemon floor-length cotton number that she pintucked by hand for my role as the narrator in the school play that would swish around my ankles as I walked across the stage. And a white cropped top that she splattered with neon paint, designed to show up under the fluorescent lights of the Blue Light disco when I was in my Wham! phase and trying to attract a boy I liked from school. But my favourite was the spotted taffeta bubble skirt of my dreams that I wore to the high school formal, inspired byMolly Ringwald in Pretty in Pink.Mum made most of my clothes until I hit high school and begged relentlessly for a pair of shop-bought skinny jeans, because I was desperate to look more like my peers. She did buy me the jeans but she also kept sewing, filling my wardrobe with patchwork skirts, home-knitted vests and a dark-green corduroy coat that I would kill for now.Learning to sew has given me a common thread with women I otherwise would never have met | Nell FrizzellRead moreI was always impatient when she made me try things on. I’d stand on a kitchen chair, and she’d have a mouthful of pins, and I’d squirm and wriggle and complain, and if one of the pins jabbed my skin then I’d leap down off the chair in protest – even though she was usually sewing something that I’d asked for.She learned to sew and knit out of necessity, out of poverty. If she wanted a new dress for the local dance then she had to make one, and often it involved cutting up something else because buying new fabric was expensive. She even made her off-white raw silk wedding dress, complete with a hidden zip down the back. I’ve kept it, even though it is far smaller than I will ever be, because I like imagining her hands working the fabric.From the outside the dress looks polished, as if it has been plucked from the rack of a shop, but if you turn it inside out then you can see that none of the edges are properly finished and the hem is roughly handsewn. Perhaps she knew she’d only be wearing it for a day, so she didn’t bother spending too much time on all the details. And, somehow, this makes the dress even more special.There were many attempts to teach me to sew when I was a teenager but sadly I showed no interest. Instead I took a job at a local deli so I could start saving for branded things, like a pale pink padded Esprit jacket that cost more than a month’s wages. I wore it until the elbows frayed and the zip jammed at the bottom and even Mum’s skills couldn’t save it.As a child, I didn’t understand Mum’s commitment to making our clothes; I always believed it was a hangover from her upbringing. It was only later that I began to realise that it wasn’t only about saving money: it was also her way of crafting her own style, of creating things that were unique, like the multi-striped knitted jumpers my dad wore for more than 40 years that made him look a little like Ernie from Sesame Street.Mum stopped sewing as my brother and I grew. Occasionally I’d visit for a hem to be taken up or a sleeve to be repaired but never for an outfit. Then, when I became pregnant with my first child, Mum pulled out the knitting needles and got to work. She knitted so many jumpers in one winter that arthritis appeared in both her hands, so she’d stop for a while and move on to sewing quilted overalls that would protect my daughter’s knees as she learned to crawl.Cleaning out my parent’s house, I found the bags of clothes that my children had worn when they were small. After Mum died, I’d stored them under a bed in their house because I couldn’t fit them all in my apartment and I wasn’t ready to hand them on.I was surprised to see that almost all of their clothes were made by my mother. There were dozens of woollen jumpers knitted in stripes, fairy dresses in different sizes with layers of pink tulle and velvet sleeves, padded coats with matching bags, and even blankets to wrap my children up when they were cold. All those hours of work.And buried under the piles of clothes she had made them was the patchwork skirt she’d sewn me when I was 10. Liberty print squares she’d picked up somewhere cheap and sewn together in a mishmash of colours and patterns.I held it up to my waist, wondering if there was some way that I could still wear it, and wishing I’d listened when she tried to teach me how to sew.Explore more on these topicsSewingOpinionParents and parentingCraftFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

This lot, however …Mon 9 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 08.15 EDTShareThe cultural juggernaut that is Real Housewivesis coming to London. The capital’s crop of glamorous, monied middle-aged women with short fuses will apparently include the wonderfully named Panthea Parker, someone known as “The Longest Legs in Belgravia” (Amanda Cronin), and a Chelsea baker called Nessie Welschinger.It sounds like appointment viewing, but I feel it incumbent on me to ask: is Real Housewives a Good Thing? Gloria Steinem doesn’t think so. “They present women as rich, pampered, dependent and hateful towards each other,”she said in 2021. Other commentators, however, have pointed to the visibility the franchiseoffers a relatively underexposed demographic; the weighty themes sometimes covered, amid the froth; and the fact that, belying the reductive title, most of the“housewives” are successful, confident, professionalpeople (albeit with a taste for drama).Gloria Steinem hates it – but is The Real Housewives secretly a feminist triumph?Read moreAs an intellectual with a more rarefied cultural diet (early 00s Top Chef, currently), I had never seen Real Housewives before. My mental image of the show was basically that meme of a glamorouswoman pointing and yelling at a cat(I was partly right: the woman, Taylor Armstrong, is a Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum; the cat, Smudge, is not). But in preparation for having an opinion on whether the London edition will advance or injure the cause of midlife womanhood, I watched as much of it as I could cram into a morning.And honestly, it’s captivating: a loud, baffling smorgasbord of frocks, extensions and heaving décolletés; statement jewellery and high-end athleisure. So much contouring, so many mansions, so many elaborately tablescaped “events”. But mostly (and I don’t think even the greatest aficionados would disagree), Real Housewives seems to be boozed-up shouting.In this, I would argue, it presents an entertaining – even more accessible? – alternative vision of being a middle-aged woman to Davina McCall’s rock-hard abs and all those impressive people who start new careers, do charity triathlons or climb mountains. Also, almost every clip I’ve watched smashes the Bechdel test – they’re usually fighting not about men but about which of them has obscurely slighted the other.In conclusion, I declare Real Housewives a net good; bring on the London ladies.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How do we revive these habitats?Mon 9 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 10.35 EDTShareDeserts are spreading across great tracts of Britain, yet few people seem to have noticed, and fewer still appear to care. It is one of those astonishing situations I keep encountering: in which vast, systemic problems – in this case, I believe, covering thousands of square kilometres – hide in plain sight.I realise that many people, on reading that first sentence, will suspect I’ve finally flipped. Where, pray, are those rolling sand dunes or sere stony wastes? But there are many kinds of desert, and not all of them are dry. In fact, those spreading across Britain are clustered in the wettest places. Yet they harbour fewer species than some dry deserts do, and are just as hostile to humans. Another useful term is terrestrial dead zones.What I’m talking about are the places now dominated by a single plant species, calledMolinia caeruleaor purple moor-grass. Over the past 50 years, it has swarmed across vast upland areas: inmuch of Wales, onDartmoor,Exmoor, in the Pennines, Peak District, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales and many parts of Scotland.Moliniawastes aredismal places, grey-brown for much of the year, in which only the wind moves. As I know from bitter experience, you can explore them all day and see scarcely a bird or even an insect.Not that you would wish to walk there. The grass forms high tussocks through which it is almost impossible to push. As it happens, most of the places that have succumbed toMoliniamonoculture are“access land”. Much of the pittance of England and Wales in which we are allowed to walk freely has become inaccessible. In a great victory a fortnight ago, the supreme court ruled that we havea right to wild campon Dartmoor. But on many parts of the moor, you wouldn’t want to exercise it. As soon as the grass takes hold, all opportunities for enjoyment and employment cease.Moliniachallenges the definition of an invasive species. The term is supposed to refer only to non-native organisms. But while it has always been part of our upland flora, it appears to have spread further and faster than any introduced plant in the UK, and with greater ecological consequences. It is uncontrolled by herbivores, disease or natural successional processes (transitions to other plant communities). In fact, it stops these processes in their tracks.Given the scale of the problem, it is remarkably little studied and discussed. I cannot find even a reliable estimate of the area affected:the most recent in England is nearly 10 years old, and I can discover none for Wales or Scotland. But in the southern Cambrian Mountains alone, judging by a combination of my walks and satellite imagery, there appears to be adead zone covering roughly 300 sq km, in which little but this one species grows. Most of central Dartmoor is nowMoliniadesert, and just as disheartening and hard to traverse.View image in fullscreenNew molinia growth in a burnt area of gorse in the Sawdde Fechan valley, Mynydd Du, Wales.Photograph: Camera Lucida Environment/AlamyWhy is this happening? It seems to be a combination of forces. One is “headage payments”: subsidies that were issued in the second half of the 20th century, which paid farmers for the number of animals they kept. They created an incentive to cram the land with as many sheep and cattle as possible. This, in combination withburning moorlandto produce fresh shoots for the livestock to eat, seems in some places to have pushed ecosystems beyond their tipping points. Even, as in parts of the Cambrians, where there have been no sheep grazing for 40 years, as there’s nothing left to eat (sheep will scarcely touchMolinia), there has been no recovery.Another likely factor is nitrogen deposition. Nitrogen compounds rain down on Britain’s habitats at a rate of roughly29kg per hectare per year. They are produced bylivestock farming, traffic and industry. Drainage (largely for farming) alsoappears to accelerate the spread:Moliniathrives as peat dries out.The Dartmoor ecologist and nature campaignerTony Whiteheadtells me that the degradation of peat caused by drainage, excavation, burning and grazing pressure is likely to be the primary accelerant. Burning in particular – carried out by sheep farmers on Dartmoor and Exmoor and by grouse shoots on northern English moors and in Scotland – favours the plant. While other species are destroyed,Moliniais protected by its deep roots and tussocks, which guard its buds.Various solutions are proposed, but few are satisfactory. One approach is toblast the grass with the herbicide glyphosate. It works for a while, but leaves an even grimmer waste, likely to be colonised again byMolinia. Others propose yet more burning, and/orgrazing with cattle or ponies: temporary “solutions” that look like blood-letting to cure anaemia. Whitehead has watched what happens: the animals graze around the edges of theMolinia, eating only small amounts, while continuing to knock back other plant species.After early summer, they won’t touch the stuff, as its nutritional value declines steeply. Anew reportby the government agency Natural England states that livestock grazing is not required to protect the main habitat type – blanket mire – thatMoliniathreatens.Rewetting the land, by blocking drains and building bunds and perhaps, as one team is attempting,planting clumps of sphagnum moss among the grass, in order to restore the peat, seems to be the only means of reviving blanket mire. It also makes the land less prone to fire. In other places, we should be encouragingthe return of trees, through planting and excluding livestock.Most of the areas overtaken byMoliniahave a temperature and moisture range that would favour temperate rainforest: a vanishingly rare, rich and complex habitat. As the trees mature, they should shade out the grass. In somewet areas, I’d like to see the return of water-tolerant species such as alder, downy birch and willow, to restoreupland carr, another rich and scarce habitat.But anyone who wants to rewild upland ecosystemshits a wall of vested interests– mostly sheep farmers and grouse moor owners – who, like the commercial fishing sector, insist on doing the wrong thing until it destroys their own industry. Where is the urgent government programme? Where is there even official acknowledgment that we have a problem? To fix something, first you must see it.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservationOpinionNational parksSoilGreen politicsFarmingcommentShareReuse this content"

The irony is hard to miss. Labour set out to prove that “grown-up” economics means difficult decisions – only to find that once trust is lost, voters won’t accept vague promises without tangible results.It turns out many are sceptical that sacrifices will produce better results for society. That’s why ministers are struggling to justify cuts to disability benefits as a way to “fund” public services – or to convince the public that Britain can’t afford to lift thetwo-child benefit capeven as ministers claim they will reduce child poverty. There may be more conspicuous retreats ahead for the government.Sir Keir Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had wanted a series of symbolic breaks with Labour’s traditional base to prove that only by making tough choices could they deliver£113bnin new public investment. Instead, the last year has become a cautionary tale: ministers elected to repudiate Tory austerity are now seen to be replicating it – and voters have noticed, with Labour’spoll numberssliding as a result. In such a climate, appeals to fiscal rectitude don’t receive gratitude but suspicion. The government’s volte-face over pensioner benefits only reinforces the sense it was driven by a backlash, not conviction.This dynamic isn’t new but it has radically reshaped Labour’s own base – and should be a warning to the party for its future. Working-class voters once formed Labour’s backbone; now many vote for no one at all. This isn’t about lacking education or income. Throughout the postwar decades, working-class turnout matched that of the middle classes. As Geoffrey Evans and James Tilley of Oxford University wrote in their bookThe New Politics of Class, the drop came only when their political representation vanished. As parties converged and Labour abandoned its working-class roots, political choice disappeared. Labour’s traditional base didn’t stop voting because they couldn’t – they stopped because there was nothing left to vote for. Brexit reshaped politics, but not as radically as many claim.Today’s class politics has been built on culture wars and channelled through identity and belonging. The warning by the former Bank of England chief economistAndy Haldanethat Nigel Farage is now seen by many as the closest thing Britain has to a “tribune for the working class” should be taken seriously. Citing Reform UK’s surge in the polls, he pointed to a “moral rupture” between voters and mainstream politicians, accusing Labour of fuelling disillusionment through a weak growth strategy and unpopular decisions on benefits. While not declaring Reform the definitive working-class party, Mr Haldane stressed that what matters is perception – and right now, many working-class voters believe Mr Farage speaks for them more than anyone else.Labour’s spending review this week looks like an attempt to reframe its offer around extra cash for frontline services such as health and education. That is welcome. Less so will be thereal-terms cutsin unprotected departments that Ms Reeves’s fiscal rules demand to account for such commitments. If this reset is notvisibleand felt by voters soon, the door swings open wider to Mr Farage and his hard-right politics.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No wonder, then, that long‑distance running keepsgrowing in popularity. Popular tracks and parks have never been busier, with groups in stretchy Lycra and fitness trackers on their wrists. The internet is awash with exercise videos, while figures earlier this year showed that gym memberships have climbed to arecord 11.5m. The 16.9% of people aged 16 or over in Britain who belong to a gym is one of the highest proportions in Europe.The older teenagers and young adults ofgeneration Zare a key demographic behind this social trend. And recent news from the world’s biggest cancer conference, in Chicago, shows how right they are to take the health benefits of fitness seriously. A landmark trial compared the outcomes of patients in several countries who were placed on a programme of structured exercise – assisted by a personal trainer – with those offered standard health advice.The results showing that exercise could be as effective as drugs, without the side-effects, inpreventing the recurrenceof colon cancer, were described by Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, as “really exciting”. The expectation is that the study will influence treatment guidelines worldwide – including in the increasingly fitness-conscious UK.But there is another narrative about exercise in Britain that is hard to reconcile with the one above. This is that we are a chronically unwell, overweight and sedentary population, whose health problems are only partly linked to the Europe-wide demographic challenge of ageing. These difficulties are widely recognised to be psychological as well as physical, with particular concerns around theworsening mental health of children and young people, which is widely linked to the rise in smartphone use.Which of these accounts of British fitness habits is more accurate depends which segment of the population is being scrutinised.Government figuresshow that the age gap – with 16- to 24-year-olds the most physically active age group – is not the only one. There is also a significant socioeconomic disparity. Students and adults in managerial and professional jobs are much more likely to keep active than manual workers or people who are long-term unemployed. As with other indicators of health, such as weight or smoking, there is a clear correlation with income. Richer people with more education and higher social status are more likely to be well.Could gen Z buck this trend with its more general embrace of fitness, which some point out isfar cheaper than pub-going? It is too soon to be sure. Some young people believe their gym-going habits are as much about economic insecurity and status anxiety as they are about commitment to health.But as ministers finalise their 10-year plan for the NHS, which is expected to place a strong emphasis on prevention, they have an opportunity to build on, and shape, the way that exercise is offered and experienced. That being physically active is good for you is reinforced by the latest cancer study. But a preoccupation with personal appearance can be debilitating. A public health approach to exercise should seek to maximise the gains and minimise the harms associated with fitness culture.Explore more on these topicsFitnessOpinionRunningCancerHealthMental healthYoung peopleeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The fast bowler stands at the summit of world cricket, his grizzled matinee idol charm allied to the grit which has helped him to become such a successful captain. Australia have won almost everything during his tenure of three and a half years and they are expected to retain their Test title.Australia v South Africa: where the World Test Championship final will be won and lostRead moreBut South Africa have been at the heart of the darker moments, from sporting humiliation to moral ignominy, which have dented Australian cricket since Cummins made his international debut. As a teenager he was selected for Australia’s tour of South Africa in 2011. Cummins was 12th man for the first Test at Newlands in Cape Town, which would be the site of the sandpaper scandal thatshredded Australia’s reputation in 2018, and he watched in shock as his teammates were bowled out for 47 and crushed in two and a half days.“That was my first real taste of Test cricket, inside the changing room,” Cummins says ruefully. “I remember being really nervous, even though I wasn’t playing, and fielded for two overs. One ball got hit to me and I fumbled it. I was an 18-year-old thinking: ‘Wow, I’m in the middle of all this.’”Cummins was called up for the second Test in Johannesburg against a great South Africa side including Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis, Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn and Morné Morkel. “It felt like the real deal. I’d played a little T20 for Australia where there was a comfort level. But being around Test cricket, and seeing some greats of the game I’d grown up watching on TV, made me think: ‘Oh, this is real.’ I was playing alongside Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey and feeling confused as to how I ended up in that position.”Cummins took seven wickets, including six in South Africa’s second innings, before scoring an unbeaten 13 as he and Mitchell Johnson steered Australia to a nerve-shredding target of 310 eight wickets down. Named player of the match on his debut, Cummins was flying.Yet he didn’t play another Test for five years and four months as his injury-ravaged body struggled with the demands of professional cricket. Cummins is grateful now for that delay and he tells a couple of self-deprecating stories which reflect his character.View image in fullscreenPat Cummins at full steam against India at the SCG in January this year.Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/EPA-EFE“It had all come quite easy. Before that tour I’d played three first‑class games and in lots of ways I’d no right to be in the team. I was very fortunate but then it all comes crashing down. The next few years there were lots of injuries and questions: ‘Am I good enough? Do I have to find a real job?’ It was tough and you’re trying to enter the world as an adult. But I learnt patience and consistency and, in some ways, I was very lucky to not have it all on a plate.”His parents also grounded him. “One of their biggest worries was me getting too big for my boots and, no doubt, I probably did at certain times. There was one instance where I was doing uni part-time. I met the vice-chancellor, who I later found out was the most important person at university. I’d thought: ‘Oh, it can’t be that serious if he’s vice.’ He welcomed me to university and I tried my luck. I was catching the train to uni and it was a nuisance so I said: ‘Do you have any car park spots you could give me?’ Very politely he said: ‘No, but maybe we can find you a paid parking spot.’ I told Mum and she went ballistic, which was never her style.”The 32-year-old’s smile is tangled. He lost his mother, Maria, to cancer in 2023 but, with affection, he remembers her saying: “‘How dare you ask for that? Who do you think you are?’ She made me email him back to say: ‘I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.’”Eighteen months later he met his wife, Becky, who comes from Harrogate in Yorkshire. They were in a bar in Sydney and Cummins told her he was a student. “I was into my second or third recurrence of a back stress-fracture. I was a part-time uni student doing rehab so I would have felt a fraud if I’d said I was a professional cricketer.” His cover was blown when, soon after they met, Becky turned a corner in Sydney and saw Cummins wearing his whites in a giant KFC poster.There will be no escaping his importance this week and Cummins pauses when I ask if he is surprised to befacing South Africa. “In some ways you expect India to be around. England have been quite strong at home and New Zealand always seem to get to finals. But the same case could be made for South Africa in ICC events. We just don’t see a lot of them in Test cricket but it’s nice and different to an Australia-India final.”He shrugs offMichael Vaughan’s commentsthat, after beating “pretty much nobody”, South Africa “don’t warrant being in the final”. Cummins says: “You can only beat who you come up against. Our route to the final was pretty tough but I don’t blame South Africa for having a different route.”As to how South Africa might perform at Lord’s, Cummins says: “It’s hard to say because there are so many unknowns. We haven’t played them much [with their last Test series ending in an easy Australian victory at home in 2022-23] but you’ve got to be really well balanced to make the final. Their bowling has always stood out and it’s no different now. [Keshav] Maharaj is a really solid spinner and they’ve always got plenty of quick bowlers who pose a challenge.”View image in fullscreenPat Cummins after being hit for four by Hashim Amla during the ‘sandpaper’ Test at Cape Town in 2021.Photograph: Gianluigi Guercia/AFP/Getty ImagesKagiso Rabada, the spearhead of South Africa’s bowling attack,recently served a one-month banafter testing positive for cocaine. There has been speculation in South Africa that Australia will sledge Rabada mercilessly. “It’s not really our style,” Cummins says. “I’d be surprised if that came up.”Australia have made legitimate changes to their abrasive cricket since the 2018 sandpaper saga against South Africa. Cummins, who isan ambassador for New Balance, exemplifies the improved reputation.But the ball-tampering saga remains an awkward topic. He listens quietly while I tell him about my 2021interview with Cameron Bancroftwho, as a callow opening batter trying to find his way in Test cricket, followed instructions to use sandpaper to rough up the ball. His captain, Steve Smith, David Warner and Bancroft were banned and the batter, when pressed on whether any of the bowlers had known of the plan, told me that “it’s probably self-explanatory”.Cummins took seven wickets in that Test, which Australia lost heavily, and I ask if he really had no idea what was being done to the ball. “I don’t want to talk about it,” he says bluntly.He concedes, however, that the fate of his two predecessors, Smith and Tim Paine, who both resigned tearfully, made him apprehensive about assuming the captaincy in 2021. “There was a lot of trepidation. One, because I was uncertain how I was going to go as a captain. I didn’t really have any experience. But also trepidation because it’s a big role and things can turn against you overnight. Part of me thought: ‘Maybe captaincy isn’t for me.’ But there’re enough great parts of the job I really enjoy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You’ve got to keep everyone positive, chat to media, keep the team aligned. But I’ve been very lucky that there haven’t been too many of those moments. When they have cropped up, the playing group bands together and makes us stronger.”This week marks the first Test that Australia have played at Lord’ssince the drama two years agowhen England were chasing a big total with an inspired Ben Stokes and a pugnacious Jonny Bairstow at the crease. The last ball of the 52nd over flew harmlessly into the gloves of the Australian wicketkeeper Alex Carey. Bairstow thought he had made sure he was in his crease before strolling down the pitch. Carey threw the ball and hit the stumps, Australia appealed and the umpire, who hadn’t called for the end of the over, raised his finger.There was outrage in the ground and the Long Room where the florid anger of many MCC members was accompanied by booing and shouts of “shame” as the Australians walked past. Warner and Usman Khawaja were even confronted by heated England supporters.“It was a series with such high emotion,” Cummins says. “Everyone was so wound up but my gut reaction was pretty similar to what I feel now. If you take all the emotion away it’s just a simple out and you don’t need to make it any bigger. It’s out, move on. I’ve seen it happen before.”When Cummins missed the Champions Trophy this year his stand-in, Smith,withdrew a run‑out appealafter Afghanistan’s Noor Ahmad ambled out of his crease in a group game. It suggested some kind of change in Australian attitudes, but Cummins says: “I can’t remember that specifically. Sorry. I think it was slightly different circumstances but, look, we want to play hard and fair and I think over my tenure we’ve got it right just about every time.”Would he do it again? “Yes,” Cummins says firmlyof Bairstow’s stumping. The view in the Australian camp is that England would do the same and they “tried it three times” previously.All this is said calmly, five months before Ashes hostilities resume in Australia. Cummins is vagueabout England’s excitement around Jacob Bethell– he has heard the talk “a little bit,” adding: “When he batted [on his Test debut in New Zealand] was it three? I haven’t seen much.” He also glosses over England’s current uncertainty around their injury‑riddled bowling attack. “I don’t really care. It feels so long away.”View image in fullscreenThe Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey throws the ball at the stumps to dismiss England’s Jonny Bairstow at Lord’s in 2023.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesCummins admits that his all-conquering team are approaching the end of an era. “Yes. No doubt. We’ve got quite a few players who are past their mid-30s and there seems to be a natural attrition rate into the late‑30s. If you’d asked me a year or two ago I would have said: ‘It’s going to be a huge change. There’s a little bit to be worried about.’ But we’ve seen Josh Inglis,Sam Konstas, [Nathan] McSweeney debut throughout [Australia’s] summer. [Beau] Webster’s come in plus a few others have debuted in white-ball cricket. I don’t think the transition will be as jarring as we first thought.”Does he have concerns about the future of Test cricket – the format he loves most? “Yes and no. In Australia, no. Each summer it seems to get stronger and stronger. The ticket sales for the Ashes are just berserk the last week. But that’s not the reality for many Test-playing nations and one of the beauties about Test cricket is playing in totally different conditions with different challenges. I’d hate Test cricket to turn into only a couple of nations.”In 25 years will Australia and England still be playing Tests against Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa? “It’s really hard to say. I hope so. But if we just let things play out, probably not. There needs to be some intervention and finding a way – maybe its dedicated windows for franchise cricket. I really hope so because they are cricket-loving nations as well. They’re always going to have good players and [offer] a tough challenge.”Can Cummins play for another five years? “Yes, I’d hope so. Mitchell Starcand Josh Hazlewood are a couple of years older than me, but they don’t show any signs of slowing up. I’m trying to look after myself and I’d love to play in my mid-30s. I feel great and physically as good as I have in a few years. I love the job and just want to keep doing it – particularly in Test cricket. I want to keep playing for a long time and do it with good people while making it fun and hopefully winning along the way.”Explore more on these topicsCricketAustralia cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamWorld Test ChampionshipEngland cricket teamThe AshesAustralia sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

England’s labours in Barcelona were put into sharper focus by the quality of Portugal and Spainin the Nations League finalthe following night. Tuchel, however, insists England are not inferior to those nations and will improve, beginning with the friendly against Senegal in Nottingham on Tuesday.England’s grind, Nations League drama and Ange Postecoglou out at Spurs – Football WeeklyRead more“The level will increase immediately once we are playing against Portugal or Spain. We will rise to the occasion. This will come,” said Tuchel. “It will bring out the very best in us. We shall not develop a complex because there is no need for it. Spain qualified for the final four with a very lucky win over the Netherlands. Everyone is beatable. They play together in a fluidity and a rhythm which is outstanding and the highest level.“It is one of the most difficult things to do to play Spain in a final. I struggle to say ‘we’ because we were not there [in the final of Euro 2024] but it was 1-1 and Spain scored in the last minute and that gave the title to Spain. We have what it takes to compete. We need to improve, for sure. We have not clicked yet.”The former Chelsea and Bayern Munich coach, like many of his predecessors, is already wrestling with the dilemma of why so many gifted individuals do not bring their club form on to the international stage. “That’s the question that needs to be answered,” said Tuchel. “I think that even Cole [Palmer] struggled lately at Chelsea to have an impact. Phil [Foden], unfortunately, struggled over many months now to have the impact that he can have.“It is a different strategy [with England], it’s different principles of the game and to make everyone play to the same rhythm, to make everyone play to the same principles, takes obviously a little bit more time than we would like. I see the structure in the game, I see the control, I see the amount of passes, but we can do better. We can be more fluid. We can be more exciting which since a longer time I feel has been a bit of a problem. I feel it’s a bit stuck, serious, I see us train with a smile but not play with a smile.”Jude Bellingham missed training on Monday to attend a family funeral but rejoined the squad later in the day. Tuchel indicated he could change goalkeepers against Senegal and would have to be careful with the minutes given to playersheading to the Club World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now it was 4-3, Wales’s extraordinary work to bounce up off the canvas undone but not forgotten, Craig Bellamy’s unbeaten run finally over.In the city of the Delirium Village, a cul-de-sac near the Grand Place with a bar sporting a Guinness world record for the most varieties of beer, theWalessupporters who made the pilgrimage felt deliriousness turn to disappointment. It should not linger too long given the manner of Wales’s response from the moment Jérémy Doku, not for the first time, made those in red shirts look silly before firing a shot into the far corner to make it 3-0.‘It’s about belief’: Craig Bellamy hails Wales’s spirit despite defeat in BelgiumRead moreDoku, who Bellamy coached as a 16-year-old during his two years working across town at Anderlecht, caused havoc. Bellamy had seen this movie before. “Yeah … now I know what every coach felt like when I was coaching him,” the Wales manager said. “You can’t stop him. I actually told him during the game: ‘Please drop deep.’ But this kid is phenomenal … you haven’t got a statue for him yet? Start getting it ready. Today I got a little bit of my own medicine.”At the final whistle techno blared over the speakers and Bellamy made a beeline for the match-winner, saluting De Bruyne, who is expected to join Napoli after leaving Manchester City, before engaging in conversation with Doku and then Romelu Lukaku. Youri Tielemans laid on a midfield masterclass before the Wales penalty, awarded after Matz Sels fouled Chris Mepham at a corner with about 25 seconds of first-half stoppage time to play, shifted the momentum of the game.At that point, though, few envisaged the scenes after Brennan Johnson directed Sorba Thomas’s cushioned header into the bottom corner past Sels with 20 minutes of regular time to play. The Wales bench emptied into the technical area. A few minutes earlier Mark Harris, on as a substitute, nodded another Thomas cross wide with seemingly his first touch. Suddenly the Wales supporters who understandably declined the open invitation to join in the Mexican wave that rippled around this stadium at 3-0 were only too happy to start one of their own.View image in fullscreenBrennan Johnson’s header brings Wales level at 3-3.Photograph: Yves Herman/ReutersBelgium thought they had a winner on 80 minutes when Lukaku fired in but the goal was ruled out after a VAR review deemed the ball had gone out of play on halfway, in front of Bellamy, who was booked for his protests. Wales thought they had survived but then De Bruyne found a winner to cap a ludicrous game. Belgium had gone to pieces but reassembled the jigsaw one last time. Tielemans picked out De Bruyne and Wales finally succumbed to defeat under Bellamy, the first in 10 matches.Belgium were fortunate to be awarded the penalty that set them on their way. The referee, Irfan Peljto, pointed to the spot in the 11th minute but there was a four-minute break to enable a VAR review of the decision to penalise Johnson for handball. The Tottenham forward tried to shift his left arm behind his back as De Bruyne, having feinted his way past Thomas and then David Brooks, blasted at goal. Bellamy was left wagging his finger at the fourth official as the penalty was confirmed and Lukaku rolled the ball past Karl Darlow, who dived to his left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was a significant step en route to qualifying for Euro 2016, Wales reaching their first major tournament for 58 years. On the night Jazz Richards, a fringe full-back at Swansea who finished his career at Haverfordwest County, was promoted to the starting lineup to help stifle Eden Hazard. Belgium, who were held to a draw in North Macedonia on Friday in their opening World Cup qualifier under Rudi Garcia, have not lost any of their 42 European or World Cup qualifiers since.For Wales there is, of course, another storied night against Belgium, Hal Robson-Kanu, a free agent after his release by Reading,starring in a 3-1 win in Lilleto march on to the Euro 2016 semi-finals. Here, however, any thoughts of another historic result against Belgium – or indeed their first win in Belgium at the ninth attempt – seemed far-fetched inside the first half-hour, if not earlier. In the end though, for Wales, it was another duel with Belgium that will live long in the memory.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersBelgiumWalesmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But Boston’s name has also always been high on the list of candidates overlooked.Hull KR end 45-year wait for Challenge Cup glory as late try denies WarringtonRead moreThat, however, will finally change this week. Boston is expected to be named as a knight on Tuesday to end the sport’s wait for such an honour. The 90-year-old is not only one of rugby league’s greatest players but one of the pioneering black figures in British sport history.Boston was born in Cardiff but his opportunities in rugby union were limited. That led to him signing for Wigan in 1953, where he remained until 1968, setting a number of astonishing records along the way in a glittering career. In 488 games he scored 478 tries, establishing himself as the club’s leading try-scorer with a record that will surely never be beaten. He was also a member of Great Britain’s World Cup-winning squad of 1960, playing for his country on 31 occasions.His accomplishments laid the platform for more players from Wales to make the transition to rugby league from union, with a statue in the centre of Wigan immortalising his importance to the town’s history. There is a similar statue in Cardiff of Boston and two more trailblazers from Wales that starred in league, Clive Sullivan and Gus Risman.Boston’s accomplishments will finally be recognised on a national stage. It is a symbolic moment for league as well as Boston, with the sport getting the honour many believe it has undeservedly lacked for decades.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It turned out to be a wise decision. And not just because the queue to see the British pair – or “Boultercanu” as the press had already anointed them – was snaking halfway around Queen’s Club.Andy Murray apologises for his ‘diabolical’ tennis on Queen’s Club court named after himRead moreFor when the action began, Raducanu and Boulter proved to be an instant sensation as they walloped the doubles pair of China’s Jiang Xinyu and Taiwan’s Wu Fang‑hsien 6-4, 6-2. But it was not only the quality of their play in their first match together that stood out. There were also plenty of laughs, high fives and jokes, which continued at the press conference afterwards.Asked whether they might be tempted to also give the doubles a whirl at Wimbledon, Raducanu played it straight. “We’re just going to keep trying to do as best as we can this week and take it from there.” But before she could go on, Boulter interjected: “Scrap what she said,” she said with a laugh. “We’re going for the Wimbledon title.”Raducanu added: “I was actually very nervous before the match. Probably more nervous than the singles, because I just didn’t really necessarily know what to do. But Katie made me feel so comfortable, and I’m just so pleased to get a win on the board.”The only pity was that many fans on the first day of women’s tennis at Queen’s Club since 1973 were unable to watch, as the match was played in front of 1,000 spectators on court one rather than on the Andy Murray Arena, which holds 7,700 seats.View image in fullscreenA packed Court One crowd watches Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu during their doubles match.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I think it is very swear-word annoying,” one spectator, Helen Milliner, said as she waited outside. “I booked tickets for the Andy Murray Arena months ago, and was hoping to see Radders and Katie on there, especially given it is such a historic day. I tried to get on to court one to see them, but the queue was incredibly long. I was told it would take an hour to get on.”A spokesperson explained later that the decision was down to contractual issues obliging the WTA to put predominately singles matches on the main court.Court one was so intimate that when Raducanu filled her water bottle after the first set she was able to have a quick chat with some of the spectators who were less than a metre away from her. Not that she minded. “I love playing on those smaller, outside courts where you really feel the support and the crowd gets into it,” said Raducanu, who showed no signs of a back spasm that had interrupted her preparations. “I was filling my bottle up, and I was literally having a chat in the stands, because that’s how close it is.”Those hoping to see the match on TV were also left disappointed as the BBC showed Sonay Kartal’s match against Daria Kasatkina instead. But Kartal, who has moved into the top 50 in the world, certainly lived up to her billing as she played one of the best matches in her career to defeat the world No 16 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I loved every second. It was super special.”Having a WTA 500 women’s tournament is not the only change at Queen’s Club this year. For the first time, there are also no line judges. It means that when a player hits a ball out, the crowd hears pre-recorded voices collected by the LawnTennisAssociation from its members and partners. Not that it was entirely successful. Several times when the ball clattered into the net, a cry of “Out!” was heard.For the first time, spectators have colour-coded stickers under their seats. A green sticker means they can leave while play is going on. But if they have an orange one, they can move only at the end of a game. Red means they can do so only at a change of ends or a set.The good news for those coming to Queen’s Club on Tuesday is that Boulter and Raducanu will be back in action in the singles – with Boulter kicking things off against Ajla Tomljanovic before Raducanu faces Cristina Bucșa. And, yes, both matches will be on the Andy Murray Arena.Explore more on these topicsTennisEmma RaducanuKatie BoulterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Dane is the club’s No 1 target to replace Ange Postecoglou, who wassacked on Friday, and there is confidence that a deal will be struck in the next 48 hours.Negotiations are due to take place on the cost of recruiting Frank, who has a £10m release clause, and his backroom staff. The 51-year-old Dane wants to join Spurs after almost seven years atBrentford, with terms already in place.Tottenham have moved swiftly after parting company with Postecoglou, who lost his job despitewinning the Europa Leaguelast month and ending the club’s 17-year wait for a major trophy. The Australian’s fate was decided after the chairman, Daniel Levy, looked past the side’s European run and focused on a dreadful Premier League campaign.Spurs finished 17th last season after losing 22 games. That has not made the job less attractive to Frank, who will be taking over a team that earned Champions League qualification thanks to their triumph against Manchester United in Bilbao.Frank has established himself as one of the most respected managers in the top flight since leading Brentford to promotion from the Championship in 2021. They have steered clear of relegation battles and finished 10th last season. Frank has operated with a modest budget and has admitted that Brentford cannot hope to hold on to their best players if bigger clubs try to buy them. Bryan Mbeumo is expected to depart for Old Trafford this summer.It remains to be seen how Brentford respond if everything goes smoothly with Spurs and Frank departs.

However, visa processing times have been slow for several countries,travel bans have been instituted(including forrecently qualified Iran), and raids ostensibly aimed at deporting undocumented immigrants have seen the government arrest and deport visa holders, permanent residentsand even citizens.Los Angeles responds with roaring backlash to Trump’s dramatic escalationRead moreAt a gathering in New York City, Philadelphia host committee CEO Meg Kane spoke for the group when asked by the Guardian what impact the Ice raids have had on the organizations’ ability to welcome fans with open arms – a message disseminated by the host cities themselves and Fifa president Gianni Infantino.“There are certainly things that are happening at the national level, the international level. There are going to be geopolitical issues that we don’t even know right now that are going to affect the tournament next year,” Kane said in part. “We recognize that we’re planning within uncertainty. And one of the things that I think we all recognize is that we have to be really good at operating within that uncertainty. While there are certain situations that we are watching … the [Trump] administration has been extremely supportive of Fifa World Cup. It has recognized both in the second term under President Trump, but also in the first term under President Trump, when the letters of intent were signed, how important the Fifa World Cup is to elevating the nation.”The host city committees are concerned, in part, with communicating potential issues to fans in areas such as transportation, lodging, and safety.All host city heads said they hoped to provide a welcoming environment for all who visit for the World Cup, but demurred when asked how they deal with the contrast of that message alongside heavy-handed immigration crackdowns and travel bans.“I mean, we’re all watching it and monitoring it real time,” said Jason Krutzsch, vice president of the Los Angeles host city committee when asked aboutthe situation in his home city, which is currently experiencing a raft of violence surrounding Ice raids and the deployment of the national guard. “I think our goal is still to deliver the conceptional experience and work with our local administration and public safety officials and making sure that we can deliver a safe and secure event in a year.”Krutzsch, Kane, and other host city chairs said that they are confident that Fifa and the federal government are discussing the topic, but ultimately the decision on who to allow into the US for the World Cup lies with those two bodies.“I think the right people at the federal level, at the Fifa level, are having those conversations,” said Mike Loynd, president of the Boston host city committee. “And I think the intent, even there, is to welcome the world. It’s really not our place in the organization to comment on anything other than that.”Added Kane: “We allow for Fifa to continue having constructive conversations with the administrations around visas, around workforce, around tourism, and that will be prepared for whatever comes our way to make this a great tournament, because that’s what the charge of the host cities are.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026US sportsWorld CupUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Behind these numbers are real people who are needlessly harmed, the impact of which will be life-changing and traumatic.“The scale of the harm and loss of life that has resulted from basic equipment failures and malfunctions shows in stark relief the scale of the tragedy that has resulted from years of underfunding in the NHS.”The Labour party has pledged to double the number of scanners in English hospitals over the course of the parliament, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is expected to announce significant additional capital funding for the NHS in this week’s spending review.The vast majority of incidents, which were logged by doctors and nurses when a device was broken, not fit for use or didn’t perform as expected, caused a low level of harm. That meant patients were unlikely to need further treatment beyond dressing changes or short courses of oral medicine.There were 522 moderate harm incidents, in which a patient’s independence could be limited for up to six months. Meanwhile, on top of the 87 deaths, 68 patients were severely harmed – meaning they could have received permanent damage from the incident, or had a reduced life expectancy.The most up-to-date numbers are likely to be even higher, as thenew safety systemhas only been mandatory for NHS organisations since September 2023, and many incidents on the system currently are missing information on the harm caused.A defibrillator malfunction was the most likely incident to be followed by a death – with 28 recorded. Problems with breathing equipment and tubing failing to perform as expected also led to 12 deaths and 12 patients being severely harmed. Defective beds, mattresses or side rails caused 40 moderate injuries, and at least one fatality when a palliative care patient slipped on to the floor and died.Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: “Modern, up-to-date equipment such as scanners, defibrillators and patient monitors are absolutely essential for hospitals to run safely and more productively. But due to more than a decade of being starved of capital investment, NHS staff have been left with no option but to extend the life of obsolete equipment, which, as this research shows, is putting patients at unnecessary risk and leading to tragic avoidable harm.“While the additional investment the government has pledged has been a welcome start, without sufficient capital funding it will be hard for the NHS to maintain the standards patients rightly expect and to deliver the government’s‘plan for change’promise to cut waiting times.”A separate Guardian analysis of hospital board papers detailed how patients around the country continue to be put at risk by faulty or out-of-date equipment.Ashford and St Peter’s hospitals trust in Surrey recorded an “extreme” risk in April due to failure to maintain the physical environment and update equipment.At Croydon health services NHS trust, board papersfrom Marchdetailed how radiology CT scanning equipment breakdowns were severely affecting cancer diagnosis and treatment. An emergency intercom in the main operating theatres was also broken, with a business case being written for a replacement costing about £60,000.Board papers from Barts health trust in London recorded a risk of cancellation or clinically significant delays to heart, lung, kidney and stem cell transplant due to ageing diagnostic equipment in March.At Royal London and Mile End hospitals (also part of Barts), staff were left unable to use some brain scanning equipment – still running on Windows 7 – because doing so would be a cybersecurity risk. At Whipps Cross in London, staff reported delays in care and possible harm to babies due to the age and state of repair of the fleet of ventilators in the neonatal unit.At least 10,000 diagnostic devices from just one of the NHS’s major suppliers were past their manufacturer recommended lifespan at the end of March 2024, and at least 4,000 were a decade old. This finding – obtained via a freedom of information request from a prototype of an NHS database due to be launched next year and independently verified by the Guardian – relates to just one of hundreds of manufacturers, meaning the true scale of the issue is likely to be larger.Health service guidance has said trusts ought to have been working towards fully eliminating the backlog of diagnostic equipment over 10 years old by April this year.Graph showing rising cost of NHS maintenanceThe figures come after years of underinvestment in NHS infrastructure, with both buildings and equipment in urgent need of repairs. The repair bill faced by the health service to make its estate fit for purpose more than trebled from £4.5bn in 2012-13 to £13.8bn in 2023-24. At least £2.7bn of those repairs are classed as “high-risk” because they pose a danger to people.Last autumn, the new Labour government increased the NHS capital budget by £3.1bn overall, for this year and next. The NHS Confederation has called for the chancellor to commit to at least an extra £3.3bn of capital funding each year at next week’s spending review, as well as greenlighting a new and improved model of private investment into the health service which “learns the lessons” from PFI (the private finance initiative).An NHS spokesperson said it had recently introduced a safety framework and was increasing investment in replacement machines, having invested more than £245m since 2020 in new diagnostic equipment. They said: “NHS staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe, but we know there is more to do to provide the best possible care.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Patient safety is paramount, and we are taking urgent action to repair and rebuild our hospital estate.“The NHS buildings and equipment we inherited were left to crumble following years of damage and neglect, but we are determined to turn this around through our plan for change.“We will increase capital spending by £1.8bn to £13.6bn in the next year, representing the highest real-terms capital budget for the department since before 2010, excluding the pandemic.”Explore more on these topicsNHSEnglandHealth policyHealthPublic services policyTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

Rhianan’s death … was the result of a self-inflicted act but it is not possible to ascertain her intention.“Rhianan was known, to family and professionals, to be vulnerable, to have autistic traits and have a history of self-harm.”The coroner added: “I find she was highly affected by her arrest and was concerned about being sent to prison.”It was not known what Rhianan was told by her legal team when the charges were dropped but this may have had a “psychological impact” on her, the coroner said.When Rhianan was arrested in October 2020, she was so small that no handcuffs would fit on her wrists. Aged 15, she became the youngest girl ever to be charged with terror offences in the UK after being groomed online by an American “neo-Nazi”.Less than 18 months later, she was found dead at the Bluebell House residential home in Nottinghamshire.Once a “bubbly, kind and loving” teenager, who loved animals and liked to bake, Rhianan had gradually become quiet and withdrawn. At first she told her mother that it was the coronavirus lockdown that had led to her change in behaviour, but in reality the teenager was being exploited.Rhianan remained under police investigation for more than two years before the charges were dropped, in light of evidence that she had been groomed and sexually exploited. Five months later, she took her own life in a children’s home.She had remained under investigation by MI5 until the day she died.Rhianan had been speaking online to Chris Cook, an Ohio-based 28-year-old far-right extremist. Cook, who was later convicted of being part of a terrorist plot, had messaged the then 14-year-old on WhatsApp, sending her links to “racially motivated, violent extremist books”.Evidence also showed she had been influenced by Dax Mallaburn, her mother Emily Carter’s former boyfriend, and a member of the Arizona Aryan Brotherhood, a neo-Nazi group.Carter knew her daughter had been radicalised; she had even referred her to the government’s de-radicalisation programme, Prevent, in September 2020, after Rhianan came downstairs and told her she had downloaded a bomb-making manual.“It was really scary. I knew it had to be done, but it doesn’t stop it being scary,” Carter said. “I was hoping that it was just going to take her two or three times a week to work on her mind, unpick her head, and turn her back into Rhianan, not end up with all these police officers turning up arresting her and pulling my house apart. You don’t expect that at all.”At the time of her arrest, Rhianan had a shrine to Adolf Hitler in her bedroom, and described herself as a fascist. She had sent messages on WhatsApp saying she “wants to kill someone in the school or blow up a Jewish place of worship” and she “does not care who she kills and nothing matters any more”.The inquest heard police had initially refrained from arresting the teenager as they thought to do so may “risk some impact on her mental health” and “could possibly lead to further self-harm and suicide attempts”.But in October 2020, a day after she had been treated in hospital after carving an image of a swastika into her forehead, 19 police officers and three detectives turned up at the family home in Bolsover, Derbyshire, to take her into custody.“They were going to put her in handcuffs, but the handcuffs didn’t go small enough. They just fell off her hands,” Carter said. “Even on the smallest ones, they just fell off her hands. So they just held her arms and just walked around. That’s how small she was.”She added: “She was 5ft one, weighed seven stone,” she added. “And she was 15 years old when she said it, she was tiny. I don’t know what people thought she could do, but I don’t believe that she was ever a threat. It was just what people would put in her head. Brainwashed her, basically.”View image in fullscreenEmily Carter (right), Rhianan’s mother, said her daughter ‘was a vulnerable child that was groomed’.Photograph: Family handout/PAWhen she was arrested, Rhianan’s engagement with Prevent stopped.During police interviews, Rhianan described being coerced and groomed, telling officers she had sent sexually explicit images of herself to Cook.However, a referral order was only made to the Home Office’s national referral mechanism (NRM), which identifiespotential victims of human trafficking and modern slavery, in August 2021.“She was a vulnerable child that was groomed,” Carter said. “The NRM should have been done at the very beginning, not 10 months into it, and it should have all been put together properly, before you even sit them down at a table and start questioning them.“She was a child, a vulnerable child, a child with mental health issues. She should have been treated as a victim more than anything.”Durran found there were multiple failures in Rhianan’s investigation and care.She said “the information available constituted a sufficient basis to classify Rhianan as a victim of modern slavery” during her indoctrination into far-right beliefs, and that she should have been referred to the NRM sooner.She added that “it is arguable that Rhianan not being referred until 2021 is evidence of the systems failure to provide adequate care for her”, but said it would be difficult to link these failings to her eventual death and that her arrest was “reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances”.The coroner’s conclusion provided some vindication for Carter, who had always believed her daughter’s death was preventable. “One of the things I’ve said all the way along the line, I’ve admitted it to court, I’m not perfect,” she said.“I’ve made mistakes, and I want the organisations to put their hands up and admit they’ve made mistakes and to rectify their mistakes so it doesn’t happen again.“And then that way everybody can be happy, except me, because I’ve already lost my daughter.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

But, she said a shift occurred in their relationship after Combs introduced his sexual fantasies involving other men and role-playing, and proposed the so-called “hotel nights”.Jane, who has been described by prosecutors as a single mother who first met Combs in 2020, testified that she agreed to her first “hotel night” in May 2021, wanting to please Combs, and described it as opening“a Pandora’s box”.“It set the tone for our relationship going forward,” she said, adding that “it was a door that I was unable to shut”.Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of sex-trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution.On the stand, Jane has said that throughout their relationship she repeatedly told the music mogul that she did not want to have sex with other men, but that he would dismiss and brush off her concerns.Jane said that he began paying her rent in 2023, and testified that after this, she felt “an obligation” to participate in the sexual encounters, fearing she would lose her home where she lived with her son if she refused. (Jane has testified that Combs is still paying her rent as well as her legal fees.)Prosecutors presented a series of text messages between Jane and Combs, including some where Jane told Combs she no longer wanted to participate in the “hotel nights”.“It’s dark, sleazy, and makes me feel disgusted with myself” Jane wrote to Combs in September 2023. “I don’t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.”Jane testified that at times, when she expressed “frustration” about the “hotel nights”, Combs would call her “crazy”, or promise her quality time, or bring up the home she lived in. She also alleged on Monday that once during an argument, Combs threatened to show sex tapes of her from the “hotel nights” to her child’s father.Jane’s account of the “hotel nights” has, thus far, mirrored claims made by Combs’s former girlfriend, singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, whotestified earlier in the trial,anddescribed similar sexual encounters she said Combs called “freak-offs”.Jane told the court on Monday that when she read thecivil lawsuit filed by Ventura against Combs in November 2023, she was shocked, adding that the allegations “resembled” her own experiences.“I almost fainted, in fact, I think I did,” Jane said.A few days after the lawsuit was filed, Jane texted Combs, saying: “I feel like I’m reading my own sexual trauma.”Combs’s lawyers have argued that the women who participated in the “freak-offs” or “hotel nights”did so consensuallyand that the encounters were part of a “swingers lifestyle”.Jane’s testimony is still continuing as of Monday afternoon, and Combs’s lawyers are expected to begin cross-examining Jane this week.Separately, over the weekend, Combs’s legal team filed a second mistrial motion, alleging prosecutorial misconduct and accusing the prosecutors of presenting “materially false” testimony.The motion centers around the testimony of Bryana Bongolan, a longtime friend of Ventura’s,who testified last week that in September 2016 Combs dangled her from a 17th floor apartmentbalcony in Los Angeles, which she said resulted in injuries.During thecross-examination, Combs’s legal team presented hotel records showing that Combs was in New York at the time of the alleged incident.“In this trial the government has presented testimony that it knew or should have known was materially false related to its allegation that Mr Combs dangled Bryana Bongolan from the balcony of Cassie Ventura’s apartment in September 2016” Combs’s lawyers wrote in the mistrial motion filed on Saturday. “Accordingly, to avoid an unfair conviction in this case the Court should grant a mistrial.”Judge Arun Subramanian gave the government until Tuesday to respond.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

One told the Guardian it had been a rolling three-year saga and said some foxes had begun to dig burrows in the perfectly manicured grounds.“There’s a little hole in the garden where one lives,” they said. “We’ve seen her all around the building – one second she’s on the fifth floor, the next she’s on the garden floor. No one has been able to catch her.”Others said they have seen fox poo on the grounds of the Thomas Heatherwick-designed building.View image in fullscreenThe office’s rooftop garden is believed to house 40,000 tonnes of soil and 250 trees.Photograph: Tim Robberts/Getty ImagesMosh Latifi, a co-director of the London-based pest control firm EcoCare, said they could be living off rats.“Foxes thrive quite well on rodents – we don’t live more than three metres away from the nearest rat,” he said, adding that he had also witnessed foxes in building sites scouring for food left behind by workers.Leaky pipes, or even generous handouts from local businesses, could be sustaining the skulk, according to another London pest control expert, who did not wish to be named. “London is a big playground for foxes – they will go absolutely anywhere,” they said.A Google spokesperson said: “Fox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King’s Cross development is no exception. While foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.”According to a search using the firm’s own search engine, the best way to get rid of foxes is to remove food sources, install secure fencing and fill in any gaps.It is not the first time a pricey London building has had such a problem. In 2011, a fox called Romeo wasdiscovered living in the Shard. He survived by living off scraps left by construction workers.Romeo was captured and, after a checkup, released back on to the streets of London.Facebook had to contend with a family of foxes at its Menlo Park headquarters in San Francisco. They were eventually honoured on the social media site – being granted a set of stickers on its Messenger app.Plans for the new Google building were announced in 2013, as its first completely owned and designed company site outside the US. The 11-storey building will accommodate up to 7,000 employees.The 300-metre rooftop garden runs along the length of the building and encompasses the seventh to eleventh floors. It’s believed that 40,000 tonnes of soil has been brought to support 250 trees, with a running track winding through them. The garden was designed to accommodate bees, bats, birds and butterflies. It features a space for dining, deckchairs and a fitness area. It also has an indoor pool.The nearly 1m sq ft building has been under construction since 2018, and is estimated to be completed later this year.In 2022, a topping-off ceremony that featured non-alcoholic Pimm’s and luxury canapés was attended by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and Keir Starmer, whose Holborn and St Pancras constituency includes the office.“This project represents a real vote of confidence in London, in our communities and in our flourishing tech sector,” Khan said at the time.Explore more on these topicsLondonGoogleAlphabetEnglandAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Guterres also stressed the importance of multilateralism and warned, in an apparent swipe at the US, which was not present at the conference: “The deep sea cannot become the wild west.”“We live in an age of turmoil, but the resolve I see here gives me hope,” Guterres told the summit in Nice. “Hope that we can turn the tide. Hope that we can move from plunder to protection.”His words drew applause from the audience, among them 60 world leaders, including the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and his Argentine counterpart,Javier Milei, heads of small island developing states as well as ministers, policymakers, scientists and civil society activists.The conference, which seeks to finally get the high seas treaty in place, comes against a backdrop of increasing competition for ocean resources. In April, Donald Trump moved tofast-track deep-sea mining under US law,sidestepping international efforts to regulate the industry. His actions have lent urgency to the voices of those calling for a moratorium, amid warnings it will cause irreversible damage to vulnerable ecosystems.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, began his address with an urgent call to “revitalise multilateralism behind the UN secretary general” in order to save oceans.“While the Earth is burning, the ocean is boiling,” warned Macron. He said that working together to “mobilise all actors, heads of state and governments speaking here but also scientists” was the only way to tackle the crisis.Macron told leaders it was a “necessity” for nations to impose a suspension on deep-sea mining. “It’s madness to launch predatory economic action that will disrupt the deep seabed, disrupt biodiversity, destroy it … The moratorium on deep seabed exploitation is an international necessity.”So far 37 countries have announced their support for a moratorium or pause, and in July the International Seabed Authority will meet to discuss a global mining code.Macron said the high seas treaty “will be properly implemented” as he expects the crucial threshold of 60 ratifying countries to be reached. He did not specify a timeline.The high seas lie outside national boundaries, where fragmented and loosely enforced rules have so far meant the vast area is essentially lawless.Getting 60 countries to ratify the agreement, which in itself took 20 years to negotiate, was a crucial goal forFranceand Macron at the summit.“In addition to the 50 ratifications already submitted here in the last few hours, 15 countries have formally committed to joining them,” Macron said.The High Seas Alliance NGO confirmed 18 new ratifications on Monday evening, bringing the total to 49. A further 11 would be ready to sign “in a matter of weeks”, they said, making it possible the treaty could come into force this year.The treaty, signed in 2023, will enter into force 120 days after the 60th ratification. The treaty is crucial to meet a globally agreed biodiversity target of protecting 30% of the oceans by 2030,known as “30x30”. But so too, is increased protection of national waters.The French president has been criticised for doing less than others to meet this goal, by failing to ban bottom trawling in “protected” areas. On Sunday, France announced it would “limit” bottom trawling and seek to protect 4% of its metropolitan waters.Nicolas Fournier, campaign director at Oceana, said: “These announcements bring more questions than answers. President Macron built expectations that the French government would finally act against bottom trawling in marine protected areas – yet these announcements are more symbolic than impactful.”The UK said on Sunday it would ban bottom trawling in half of its protected marine areas.Just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive activities, according to the Marine Conservation Institute.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentSeascape: the state of our oceansOceansAntónio GuterresEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropeUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

It damages coral reefs and other ocean habitats and, in extreme cases, can dissolve the shells of marine creatures.Until now, ocean acidification had not been deemed to have crossed its “planetary boundary”. Theplanetary boundariesare the natural limits of key global systems – such as climate, water and wildlife diversity – beyond which their ability to maintain a healthy planet is in danger of failing. Six of the nine had been crossed already,scientists said last year.However,a new studyby the UK’s Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML), the Washington-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Oregon State University’s Co-operative Institute for Marine Resources Studies found that ocean acidification’s “boundary” was also reached about five years ago.“Ocean acidification isn’t just an environmental crisis – it’s a ticking timebomb for marine ecosystems and coastal economies,” said PML’s Prof Steve Widdicombe, who is also co-chair of theGlobal Ocean Acidification Observing Network.The study drew on new and historical physical and chemical measurements from ice cores, combined with advanced computer models and studies of marine life, which gave the scientists an overall assessment of the past 150 years.It found that by 2020 the average ocean condition worldwide was already very close to – and in some regions beyond – the planetary boundary for ocean acidification. This is defined as when the concentration of calcium carbonate in seawater is more than 20% below preindustrial levels.The deeper in the ocean they looked, the worse the findings were, the scientists said. At 200 metres below the surface, 60% of global waters had breached the “safe” limit for acidification.“Most ocean life doesn’t just live at the surface,” said PML’s Prof Helen Findlay. “The waters below are home to many more different types of plants and animals. Since these deeper waters are changing so much, the impacts of ocean acidification could be far worse than we thought.”This had, she added, huge implications for important underwater ecosystems such as tropical and even deep-sea coral reefs that provided essential habitats and nursery grounds for the young of many species.As pH levels drop, calcifying species such as corals, oysters, mussels and tiny molluscs known as sea butterflies struggle to maintain their protective structures, leading to weaker shells, slower growth, reduced reproduction and decreased survival rates.Surge in marine heatwaves costs lives and billions in storm damage – studyRead moreThe authors underlined that decreasing CO2emissions was the only way to deal with acidification globally, but that conservation measures could and should focus on the regions and species that were most vulnerable.Jessie Turner, director of the International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification, who was not involved in the study, said: “This report makes it clear: we are running out of time and what we do – or fail to do – now is already determining our future.“We are coming to terms with an existential threat while grappling with the difficult reality that much suitable habitat for key species has already been lost. It’s clear that governments can no longer afford to overlook acidification in mainstream policy agendas,” she said.Explore more on these topicsOcean acidificationOur acidifying oceansOceansClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsMarine lifeCoastlinesWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s quite often possible to see an abundance of marine vessels, from navy ships and passenger ferries to small fishing boats and yachts. What you might not spot from this distance is a large yellow buoy bobbing up and down in the water about six miles off the coast.This data buoy – L4 – is one of a number belonging to Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML), a research centre in Devon dedicated to marine science. On a pleasantly calm May morning, Prof James Fishwick, PML’s head of marine technology and autonomy, is on top of the buoy checking it for weather and other damage. “This particular buoy is one of the most sophisticated in the world,” he says as he climbs the ladder to the top. “It’s decked out with instruments and sensors able to measure everything from temperature, to salinity, dissolved oxygen, light and acidity levels.”It’s the hourly recordings of this last measurement, the pH of the water, that are adding to a picture locally and globally that is increasingly concerning scientists.The results show that ocean acidification is rising – and it is doing so at an alarming rate. Ocean acidification, often called the“evil twin”of the climate crisis, is caused when carbon dioxide is rapidly absorbed into the ocean, where it then reacts with water molecules leading to a fall in the pH of the seawater.View image in fullscreenRising temperatures and increased acidification can affect the colour of the ocean.Photograph: Emilia Krupa/Getty ImagesA paper out on Monday from scientists at PML, the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and Cimers (Oregon State University), shows ocean acidification is happening more rapidly than previously thought.Part of the problem for scientists in bringing it to the world’s attention is that you can’t see the pH levels in the sea at the beach near you, so how do you know it is happening?It’s difficult to see the biological effects because they’re going to take a long time to happenProf Steve Widdicombe, PML“It’s tough because there is no real smoking gun,” says Prof Steve Widdicombe, director of science at PML and a leading global voice on ocean acidification. “It’s difficult to see the biological effects because they’re going to take a long time to happen and differentiating the impacts of ocean acidification from things like temperature, fishing pressures and pollution makes it really hard to generate impetus and momentum in decision-makers and policymakers to really tackle it hard.”View image in fullscreenProf Steve Widdicombe, director of science at PML and an expert on ocean acidification, on the deck of the ship used by the team.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The GuardianFor anyone who wants an immediate idea of its impact, there is avery effective video from the Noaathat shows a pteropod swimming in water with a normal pH level, alongside one where the pteropod has been subject to elevated CO2 levels for two weeks. In the first video the marine creature has a clear shell and is actively swimming, in the second it shows a partially dissolved and fissured shell and the pterapod having difficulty moving in the water. Images such as this help scientists raise awareness of the issue, but on their own they will never be enough.This lack of visibility and understanding of the impacts of acidification has led scientists to focus on building a body of work that clearly shows the statistical correlations between increasing levels of acidity in the oceans and the changes in biological processes to flora and fauna in the sea in different areas around the world.A good example can be seen in the north-west of the US. In about 2010, the oyster farming industry there – worthmillions of dollars– nearly collapsed after oyster production seemed to drop off a cliff.Prof Helen Findlay from PML explains the science of what was going on: “On the west coast you get an upwelling of deep waters, and that deep water has naturally got more CO2 in it. But on top of that, you have the acidification effect from the atmosphere, and that amplified the upwelling effect. It turned out, after some investigation, that the intake pipes connected to the hatcheries were bringing in this acidified water, which had been amplified over the years.”View image in fullscreenHigh levels of acidity affect how oysters develop, so hatcheries monitor and control the pH of the water as required.Photograph: Cavan Images/Getty Images/Cavan Images RFThe level of acidity in the water had reached a point that meant the oysters were trapped in their larval state and unable to grow the shells they needed to develop. The hatcheries then installed sensors to measure the pH of the water and added chemicals to hatchery tanks to neutralise the water when necessary.Scientists hope that education about initiatives such as in the oyster hatcheries of the north-west US, combined with government funding, will help encourage other countries to take action suited to their particular acidification problem. But large parts of the world do not have access to the information they need to begin planning what to do.There are obligations for countries to tackle ocean acidification enshrined in international agreements including, most recently, theGlobal Biodiversity Framework, that aims to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. However, while decision-makers either lack the resources to tackle the issue, or simply twiddle their thumbs over implementing a plan, commercial operators are stepping in to offer alternative solutions.Video of a pteropod swimming in water with low surface CO2, contrasted with a pteropod swimming in water after two weeks of elevated CO2 conditions.Geoengineering the ocean is becoming big business. Companies are focusing on different human-made ways to remove carbon from the seas, with perhaps the most developed of these beingocean alkalinity enhancement. This is where an alkaline solution is added to seawater to raise the pH level. Done at a controlled, very local level, such as in the tanks in the oyster hatcheries, this can be effective. But many scientists are concerned that the ocean geoengineering industry is growing far too rapidly.At the end of the day, CO2 is going up, pH is going down, and that’s an urgent issue people are not talking aboutJessie Turner, Ocean Acidification Alliance“We shouldn’t proceed further along this road without the evidence,” says Widdicombe. “Can you imagine going to your doctor and they say ‘I’ve got a drug here that will fix you.’ If the doctor then says we haven’t really tested it and we’re not sure about the side effects, would you still be happy to take it?”Jessie Turner, executive director of theOcean Acidification Alliance, worries that geoengineering may also cause people to lose sight of the obvious. “While exploring a research agenda around geoengineering interventions is important, the number one manmade solution to ocean acidification is reducing our CO2 emissions,” she says. “I hope that we’re not losing the urgency for that. Without governments paying more attention to ocean acidification, there is this opportunity for the private sector to steer the course.”View image in fullscreenRows of buoys marking farm-grown oyster cages in Hoopers Island, Maryland.Photograph: VW Pics/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesCarbon released by bottom trawling ‘too big to ignore’, says studyRead moreAside from the primary objective of reducing CO2, there are other things that can be done to tackle ocean acidification, including limiting organic pollution in the water, often relatively easy to do at a local level, and creating more resilient marine habitats around our shores.It is clear, however, that scientists working in this field are getting increasingly frustrated with the lack of urgency around it. Many are hoping thatthis week’s UN ocean conferencein France will provide a vital opportunity to discuss the problem with heads of state and get it more firmly on government agendas.“At the end of the day, we know CO2 is going up, pH is going down, and that’s an urgent issue that people are not talking about,” says Turner. “It’s an overlooked consequence of carbon in our ocean that governments can no longer afford to overlook in mainstream policy agendas, and the time to address it is running out.”Explore more on these topicsOur acidifying oceansEndangered habitatsGreenhouse gas emissionsMarine lifeClimate crisisConservationOceansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If it were a country, the US power sector would be the sixth largest emitter in the world, eclipsing the annual emissions from all sources in Japan, Brazil, the UK and Canada, among other nations.A bar chart showing countries’ cumulative global GHG emissions from 1990 to 2022. The US power sector is segmented out as its own country, and it ranks 6th, between Russia and Japan.“That seems rather significant to me,” said Jason Schwartz, co-author of the report from New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity. “If this administration wants to argue only China has significant emissions they can try to do that, but a court will review that, and under any reasonable interpretation will find that US power plant emissions are significant too.”Fossil fuel-derived electricity is responsible for the second largest source of emissions in the US, behind transportation. No country in historyhas causedmore carbon pollution than the US, and while its power sector’s emissions havedeclined somewhatin recent years, largely through a market-based decline in heavily-polluting coal, it remains a major driver of the climate crisis.The cocktail of toxins emitted by power plants have a range of impacts, the NYU analysis points out. A single year of emissions in 2022 will cause 5,300 deaths in the US from air pollution over many decades, along with climate impacts that will result in global damages of $370bn, including $225bn in global health damages and $75bn in lost labor productivity.“We were surprised when we ran the numbers just how quickly these deaths start tallying up,” said Schwartz. “All of these harms stack up on top of each other. Climate change will be the most important public health issue this century and we can’t just ignore the US power sector’s contribution to that public health crisis.”A circle area chart that shows the global damages from US power sector emissions in 2022. The circles represent the cost by power plant type, with coal at $207bn and Gas at $112bn leading the way.TheTrump administration, though, is looking to dismantle a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The move comes as part of a wider deregulatory blitz upon a wide range of rules aimed at protecting clean air and water; on Thursday, the EPA also confirmed a plan to delay the implementation of Clean Air Act protections against methane and other harmful pollutants from fossil fuel production.Removing these protections will prove not only dangerous, but also costly, said Christopher Frey, who was a science advisor to Joe Biden and led a clean air EPA committee under Barack Obama.“A ‘do nothing’ policy to rollback greenhouse gas emission standards is not really a policy to do nothing,” said Frey, now an associate dean at North Carolina State University’s college of engineering. “It is a policy to force us to have to do more later to compensate for not taking preventive action sooner. It is a policy to knowingly cause more damage for folks in the not so distant future to contend with.”The power plant plan has endured a tortuous history, having been first put forward by the Obama administration, only to be halted by the first Trump administration and also the supreme court. The Biden administration last yearrolled outa more limited version of the plan aimed at satisfying the supreme court’s ruling.This version is now targeted for repeal by the Trump administration, expected in the coming weeks ahead of a public comment period and further expected legal challenges. Despite pointing to declining power plant emissions in its justification, the Trump administration has simultaneously attempted to increase these emissions by demandinga revival of the coal industry, boostingoil and gas drillingand axingincentives for cleaner energy.“President Trump promised to kill the clean power plan in his first term, and we continue to build on that progress now,” said Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA.“In reconsidering the Biden-Harris rule that ran afoul of supreme court case law, we are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy.”Trump haslongclaimedthat the US should not engage in international climate talks because its emissions footprint is negligible, noted Judith Enck, who served as an EPA regional administrator under Obama. Meanwhile, his administration has cracked down onstates’ abilityto regulate emissions, she said.“Apparently there is no level of governance where we can have these regulations,” Enck said. “It’s a completely illogical argument: there’s not a lot of emissions so don’t worry, but yet we have to block every attempt to control them at the state, federal [and] international levels?”Experts have questioned whether pollution needs to be deemed “significant” in order to be subjected to theClean Air Act, which has been used to regulate even proportionally small levels of environmental toxins.“There is absolutely no legal basis for them to propose a pollutant like CO2 has to meet some sort of significance, they are making this up, this is make-believe law,” said Joseph Goffman, who led theEPA’s office of air and radiation during Biden’s term. “This is a sort of cheat code to try to neutralize any tool they fear might be used to reduce greenhouse gases.”The climate crisis is a global problem of the shared commons that experts say requires all countries, particularly the largest emitters, to remedy. Goffman said the Trump administration is attempting to reject this basic tenet. “They are trying to write one of the biggest historical emitters in the world a get-out-of-jail-free card,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS Environmental Protection AgencyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The presence of older trees are vital for wildlife as they provide food and habitat.Government ‘failing to support natural regeneration of trees in England’Read moreAbigail Bunker, the trust’s director of conservation and external affairs, said: “The nation’s once rich, complex woodlands have become simpler and less biodiverse over time. Alarmingly, many British woodlands have very few – if any – ancient and veteran trees left.”The report laid out a 37% fall in the number of woodland birds over the last 50 years, including a sharp 15% fall in the last five. The number of woodland-associated butterflies fell by 47% between 1990 and 2022.An earlier report by the Woodland Trust in 2021 found that only 7% of Britain’s native woodland was in good condition. It found woodlands with low levels of deadwood, few veteran trees and poor diversity in age and species of trees.Between 2010 and 2020, 393 veteran trees were reported to be “lost” in the ancient tree inventory, meaning they had fallen, been felled or destroyed.A new government taskforce was set up in November 2024 to oversee the planting of new trees with the aim of hitting a target of 16.5% cover by 2050. The taskforce will bring together ministers from all four UK nations as well as several arms-length bodies.Last year, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, allocated up to £400m over two years for tree planting and peatland restoration in England.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We’d like to thank all of the thoughtful doctors who have helped us to understand what happened to Martha.”Ince said the panel had concluded that Thompson had “remediated” such that it was “highly unlikely that anything like this will ever happen again and there is no current impairment of Prof Thompson’s fitness to practise on this basis”.However, he added: “The tribunal concluded that the misconduct was such that a finding of impairment was required to uphold public confidence in the profession as well as uphold proper professional standards, and that it would be undermined if no finding of impairment were found.”Martha, who sustained an injury to her pancreas when she fell off her bike on holiday in Wales, was transferred to intensive care at KCH on 30 August 2021 by which time she had septic shock, according to a serious incident report produced for the hospital.Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSHealthDoctorsSepsisLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A history of TBI, in turn, was associated with evidence of adverse mental health outcomes.“These observations offer initial insights into the potential lifelong brain health consequences of intimate partner violence with physical abuse.“Given the global prevalence of intimate partner violence, particularly among women, these findings highlight a pressing need for further research in this field, as well as for targeted interventions to raise awareness among policymakers and medical professionals about the potential impact of intimate partner violence with physical abuse on health outcomes across the lifespan.”The work was funded by the Drake Foundation, the National Institutes ofHealth, the Medical Research Council, NHS Research Scotland, the Alzheimer’s Society, and the Alzheimer’s Association.Prof Willie Stewart said: “Given its prevalence, these findings highlight domestic violence as a public health issue with potential for long-lasting impacts on brain health. Our work also reinforces the need for more research in this previously neglected area.”Dr Graciela Muniz-Terrera, a co-author of the report, said: “This study highlights the importance of including questions about domestic violence in population research to advance our knowledge about its long-term effects.”In the UK, call thenational domestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

Despite claiming he had acted in self-defence, it was clear he was the sole aggressor in the “murderous expedition”, the judge said.Jurors were told how on the night of the attack the defendant cycled through snow to the home that Perks, who was 65 and had retired a month earlier, shared with his wife and son.Perks heard the noise of his colleague breaking into the conservatory and went downstairs, where he could feel his feet were “a bit damp” from the petrol splashed up the stair walls. He felt a blow to his body as he was stabbed, which resulted in “extremely life-threatening” injuries to his liver, intestine and pancreas, and a 95% chance of death.The defendant was found asleep on a garden bench later that morning when he was taken to hospital for injuries to his hand, and was arrested.In a victim impact statement read to the court by the prosecutor, Tracy Ayling KC, Perks described the attack as an “unimaginable catastrophe” and observed that it was “ironic that a burns surgeon should wish to immolate our family”.He said: “This has been a nightmare for my wife and son who must have wondered if I was going to survive. This has been beyond every struggle in our lives so far.”He added: “I have no ill feelings, hatred or bitterness towards my ex-colleague and derive no satisfaction from the guilty conviction. It is just another interesting chapter in life, and I wish his family well. I remain eternally grateful that it was me, not Bev or Henry who were stabbed.”Henry Perks, Graeme Perks’s son, described Brooks as a “highly dangerous and remorseless individual” and “nothing more than a bully”, adding: “He simply has no morals, sees no wrong in his actions and will stop at nothing to hurt those he perceives to have wronged him. I have no doubt his failure to silence my father will consume his mind and make him dangerous in the years after his release.”Ayling said Brooks was “manipulative” and had shown no remorse for what he had done. She said: “He believes himself to be not guilty of the offences. He believes he has been unlawfully tried. He has a history of being manipulative.”Stephen Leslie KC, defending, said Brooks was too unwell due to a hunger strike he had conducted during his trial, and had stated that he would “rather be dead than incarcerated”.Pepperall previously told the court that on “no fewer than eight occasions” since 2021, Brooks, formerly of Southwell, had “used hunger strikes or the threat of some other self-harm to achieve some advantage”. His convictions followed a four-year series of legal hearings, including a mistrial and seven other aborted trial dates.Explore more on these topicsNottinghamshireEnglandCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

But when he eventually sat down with officials, it became clear he had no evidence of a wiretap, and the Pentagon had been duped.The problem was that development was not communicated to the White House – so several Trump advisers who were told of the NSA wiretap claim believed that was part of the “smoking gun” evidence against the three aides fired by Hegseth, until they developed their own doubts.White House stunned as Hegseth inquiry brings up illegal wiretap claimsRead moreThe Guardianrevealed last monththat there were unsubstantiated NSA warrantless wiretap claims underpinning the leak investigation, but its origin story and the involvement of Fulcher in the controversy has not been previously reported.Fulcher has said this account is not correct. In a statement, he said he never suggested there were NSA wiretaps or that he had access to wiretap records. “I never approached Parlatore, Kasper or anyone else offering ‘surveillance evidence’ and did not ask to join an investigation on that or any other basis,” he said.The extraordinary episode adds to the growing portrait of dysfunction inside Hegseth’s front office, which is involved in setting the direction of a department that has a budget of nearly $1tn and oversees more than 2 million troops around the world.The investigation prompted Hegseth to fire his senior adviser Dan Caldwell, the deputy chief, Darin Selnick, and the deputy secretary’s chief of staff, Colin Carroll, creating a leadership vacuum filled by Ricky Buria, the ex-junior military aide to Hegsethconsidered by the White House to be a liability.And with the implosion of the leak investigation adding to the fraught tensions among his aides, Hegseth is expected to face bruising questions about his ability to manage the Pentagon when he appears at a series of so-called defense posture hearings starting this week on Capitol Hill.A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment on the reporting in this story. A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.‘Director of suspicious affairs’Fulcher started at the Pentagon on the first day of theTrump administrationas the lead staffer for Doge (“department of government efficiency”), armed with a top secret/sensitive compartmented information clearance and a mandate fromElon Muskto oversee mass cuts at the defense department, the people said.The Doge team were given offices a few doors down from the defense secretary’s offices, and when Fulcher first introduced himself to Hegseth’s senior staff, he talked about having once worked for the NSA and how he had run various startups, the people said.The senior staff’s relationship with Fulcher was collegial – unlike those of Doge staffers with other agencies, which were adversarial – and no one checked whether he had connections to the NSA. They also did not follow up on aForbes article published in Marchthat concluded he had embellished parts of his résumé.Ironically, that close working relationship was initially the cause of his downfall after he was seen by Musk and the Doge leadership, including Steve Davis and spokesperson Katie Miller, as too close to the defense department and not willing enough to make drastic cuts, the people said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAt the start of April, Musk replaced Fulcher as the Doge lead at the Pentagon. But Hegseth liked Fulcher, who had recently traveled with the secretary on an official trip to Panama, and Fulcher was brought on as a senior adviser.The details of Fulcher’s responsibilities were not clear externally or internally, and he earned the nickname “Disa” standing for “director of suspicious affairs” – apparently a play on the acronym for the Defense Information Systems Agency.Around that time, Hegseth had ordered an investigation into the leaks, with the central focus being on the disclosure to a reporter of an allegedly top secret document that outlined options forDonald Trumpto “reclaim” the Panama canal, including with using US troops on the ground.It was not immediately clear why Fulcher chose to become involved in the investigation, but several days after he was replaced as the Doge lead, he went to Kasper and expressed a willingness to help with the investigation, which Kasper attributed to him wanting to prove his worth, two of the people said.Kasper told Fulcher to go to Parlatore, who had been tasked with supervising and managing the investigation. When Fulcher approached Parlatore, he suggested that he knew of NSA intercepts supposedly showing that Caldwell had leaked using his personal phone, the two people said.Vicious interpersonal conflicts among Hegseth staff cloud leak investigationRead moreLooking back on the chain of events, three people familiar with the conversations described Fulcher’s claims as conveniently dovetailing with prevailing suspicions at the time about Caldwell printing lots of documents and his efforts to have the leak investigation shut down.Still, a cursory check at that stage into the NSA claims would have shown them to be false. Pentagon investigators concluded in the weeks after the firings that there was no authorized or unauthorized wiretap through the NSA, which is a component of the defense department.The claims were relayed to Hegseth and the White House as being accurate. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said at a briefing the three aides had been fired as they “leaked against their boss”, while Hegseth predicted on Fox News they would be prosecuted although there has been no referral to date to the justice department.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPete HegsethUS national securityUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Large reasoning models attempt to solve complex queries by generating detailed thinking processes that break down the problem into smaller steps.AI pioneer announces non-profit to develop ‘honest’ artificial intelligenceRead moreThe study, which tested the models’ ability to solve puzzles, added that as LRMs neared performance collapse they began “reducing their reasoning effort”. TheAppleresearchers said they found this “particularly concerning”.Gary Marcus, a US academic who has become a prominent voice of caution on the capabilities of AI models, described the Apple paper as “pretty devastating”.Writing in his newsletter on Substack,Marcus added that the findings raised questions about the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI),a theoretical stage of AIat which a system is able to match a human at carrying out any intellectual task.Referring to the large language models [LLMs] that underpin tools such as ChatGPT, Marcus wrote: “Anybody who thinks LLMs are a direct route to the sort [of] AGI that could fundamentally transform society for the good is kidding themselves.”The paper also found that reasoning models wasted computing power by finding the right solution for simpler problems early in their “thinking”. However, as problems became slightly more complex, models first explored incorrect solutions and arrived at the correct ones later.For higher-complexity problems, however, the models would enter “collapse”, failing to generate any correct solutions. In one case, even when provided with an algorithm that would solve the problem, the models failed.The paper said: “Upon approaching a critical threshold – which closely corresponds to their accuracy collapse point – models counterintuitively begin to reduce their reasoning effort despite increasing problem difficulty.”The Apple experts said this indicated a “fundamental scaling limitation in the thinking capabilities of current reasoning models”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The researchers acknowledged that the focus on puzzles represented a limitation in the work.The paper concluded that the current approach to AI may have reached limitations. It tested models including OpenAI’s o3, Google’s Gemini Thinking, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Thinking andDeepSeek-R1. Anthropic, Google and DeepSeek have been contacted for comment. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, declined to comment.Referring to “generalisable reasoning” – or an AI model’s ability to apply a narrow conclusion more broadly – the paper said: “These insights challenge prevailing assumptions about LRM capabilities and suggest that current approaches may be encountering fundamental barriers to generalisable reasoning.”Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the Apple paper signalled the industry was “still feeling its way” on AGI and that the industry could have reached a “cul-de-sac” in its current approach.“The finding that large reason models lose the plot on complex problems, while performing well on medium- and low-complexity problems implies that we’re in a potential cul-de-sac in current approaches,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)AppleComputingOpenAIDeepSeekGooglenewsShareReuse this content"

For years, Canada has been viewed as a defence loafer and successive prime ministers have failed to bring the country’s commitments in line with allies. A recent Nato report found that Canada spent an estimated 1.45% of its GDP on defence last year.The prime minister pledged to divert billions in spending to domestic manufacturers, warning his country had become “too reliant on the United States” for its defence capabilities.Canadian military flies the flag in frozen north as struggle for the Arctic heats upRead more“The long-held view that Canada’s geographic location will protect us is becoming increasingly archaic. Threats which felt far away and remote are now immediate and acute,” said Carney, pointing to “Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine” and threats to Canada’s sovereignty not only from Moscow but also from “an increasingly assertive China”.The announcements, staggered throughout Monday, come as Canada prepares to host the G7 summit next week in Kananaskis, Alberta.Against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, defence spending will be a focus at theNatosummit in The Hague at the end of June. The secretary general, Mark Rutte, has already indicated he wants an increase to 3.5% for core defence spending and 1.5% in defence-related investments such as infrastructure.In recent months, Canadian military officials and politicianshave shifted focus to the Arctic, warning of Canada’sdeep vulnerabilities in a rapidly changing– and highly coveted – region of the planet.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Canadian navy test a diesel-powered drone meant to withstand harsh Arctic conditions.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The ObserverBut the renewed focus has also revealed the limits of Canada’s ageing fleets.“Only one of our four submarines is seaworthy,” said Carney “Less than half of our maritime fleet and land vehicles are operational.”In the past, Canada turned to the United States to source its military hardware. But in his speech the prime minister acknowledged that while the US had become Canada’s closest ally and dominant trading partner, Donald Trump’s protectionist tariffs and threats to Canadian sovereignty had cast a shadow over the future of that relationship.“Now the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,” he said.Ahead of Canada’s spring federal election, there was spirited debate in the country over whether to cancel a multibillion-dollar order for the US-built F-35 stealth fighter.Canada has committed to buy 16 of the jets from Lockheed Martin at a cost of nearly US$85m each. But revelations that the US would control all F-35 software updates andown all of the spare partshas once again revived arguments for diversifying procurement to more reliable allies.“We will ensure every dollar is invested wisely, including by prioritizing made-in-Canada manufacturing and supply chains,” said Carney. “We should no longer send three-quarters of our defence capital spending to America.”In recent weeks, Carney and Trump have held private, high-level talks as Canada looks to end a trade war instigated by the US.View image in fullscreenA soldier works to repair a Chinook transport helicopter.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianTimothy Sayle, a professor of history at the University of Toronto, says Carney will have a “very difficult needle to thread” in balancing the rhetoric of Canada being able to act independently and the realities of its longstanding defence partnerships with the United States.“The world is an increasingly dangerous place. And Canada’s been under pressure from Nato and the European allies to do more. But how much of this announcement is a result of pressure coming from the United States?” said Sayle. “I suspect that the importance of the relationship with the president played a role in this being a larger and quicker announcement than we might have thought.”Carney’s announcement, which requires billions in new spending, shows “political will matters”, said Sayle – although he warned that previous governments have made similar announcements.“We know that Canada has struggled with defence procurement in the past. Where is the money [for the investment[ going to come from? What does this mean for taxes? But there’s also been broader feeling in Canada that it was necessary to do something – and to do something quickly.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMark CarneyNatonewsShareReuse this content"

The university, which has taken a particularly heavy-handed approach to suppressing student protests against Israel’s war in Gaza,paidat least $800,000 between June 2023 and September 2024 to City Shield’sparent company, Ameri-Shield. The contract was part of at least $3m in spending on higher education consultants and security in response to the protests.The Guardian’s reporting found that dozens of investigators were following student protesters on and off campus, and in some instances were confrontational, cursed at students, threatened them, and in one case drove a car at a student who had to jump out of the way, according to student accounts and video footage shared with the Guardian.The students detailed bizarre interactions with the investigators. In an incident captured by a student on video, a man who had been following him faked disabilities and accused a student of attempting to rob him when he was confronted.0:32Undercover investigator accuses student of threatening him – videoThe same investigator, who pretended to be deaf and mute, appears to have insulted a student recording him, calling him a “special needs student”.“What happened was disturbing, unacceptable, and unethical, and we will not tolerate it,” Grasso wrote in an apparent reference to the conduct in the video.0:27Undercover investigator appears to fake disability – videoThe story drew broad outrage on social media, and from current and former U-M students and faculty.In the email, Grasso said the investigators “were intended to help us keep watch over our campus and enable us to respond quickly to emergencies. However, we are clear: no individual or group should ever be targeted for their beliefs or affiliations.”Katarina Keating, a PhD student who was being followed, said she welcomed the news and called it a “step in the right direction”, but added that it was “insulting” for the university to say pro-Palestinian groups were not targeted for their beliefs or affiliations. There is no evidence that the investigators surveilled anyone aside from pro-Palestinian activists.She called on the university to also eliminate security it hired that is not undercover, and lift campus bans in place for “dozens” students involved with demonstrations.Some evidence collected by the investigators was used by theMichiganattorney general, Dana Nessel, to charge students with violating the terms of bonds from previous arrests for allegedly trespassing and resisting arrest. One student was jailed for four days.Nesseldroppedthe rest of the charges. City Shield did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Keating questioned the university’s focus, in the president’s email, on one investigator’s conduct.“It would be bad even if [the investigators] were competent and followed all the rules,” Keating said. “It’s still bad and scary to be putting private security contractors after your students.”Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesProtestSurveillanceUS educationMichiganUS politicsHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

Wonderful TV to revel in – and weep to.What we said:“Dying for Sex is only sexy when Molly finds it so … it is a feminist endeavour to its core.”Read the full reviewGet Millie BlackChannel 4View image in fullscreenA seductive experiment … Millie (Tamara Lawrence) and Luke (Joe Dempsie) in Get Millie Black.Photograph: Channel 4/HBO /Des WillieCreated by Marlon James, the author of the celebrated novel A Brief History of Seven Killings, this drama is a seductive experiment in multiple perspectives. On the face of it, it’s a crime drama set in Kingston, Jamaica. But as it tells the story of Millie (Tamara Lawrance), a former London detective back in the Caribbean in search of a lost sibling and a missing girl, it becomes clear that it’s much more than that. Instead, Get Millie Black ponders the legacy of colonialism and the search for identity – sexual, national and existential – in the context of a broken family.What we said:“Millie-Jean Black is a force of nature, and a joy to watch, wherever she is in the world.”Read the full reviewHacksSky Max/NowIt was always going to be tough to follow a third season so glorious that it won the best comedy Emmy. But this tale of veteran standup Deborah and gen Z comedy writer Ava hits back with a new roster of scene-stealing minor characters, heart-wrenching moments of pathos and zingers so acerbic you’re in constant danger of spraying tea across the room. It also doesn’t hurt that the relationship between its two leads is one of TV’s most captivating. Roll on season five.What we said:“Season four of Hacks is very funny. But what makes it really special is just how raw it is, too, ready to hit you in the feels when you least expect it.”Read the full reviewHigh PotentialDisney+View image in fullscreenPerfect escapism … Kaitlin Olson as Morgan in High Potential.Photograph: Disney/PASometimes the world feels so dark that you need a bit of eminently watchable trash – and High Potential is a fine slice of such escapism. Kaitlin Olson is super-fun as a lovable genius with an IQ of 160 who is working as a police station cleaner when she solves a doozy of a case – then soon gets brought on as a consultant in the homicide department. She sees things no one else sees, and solves every case of the week – from death by tap-dancing to a nanny bludgeoned in a playground – with her jaw-dropping photographic memory and epic knowledge. An easy-watching delight.What we said:“It is so much desperately needed, perfectly paced fun that, like Kenneth Tynan before me with Look Back in Anger, I don’t believe I could be friends with anyone who doesn’t love it.”Read the full reviewJust Act NormalBBC Three/iPlayerView image in fullscreenAltogether a wonderful thing … Tionne (Akins Subair), Tiana (Chenée Taylor) and Tanika (Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie) in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The ForgeKids fearing they might be taken into care, drug dealers breaking into flats to make threats about unpaid debts, armed confrontations: not your usual comedy drama fare. But Janice Okoh’s adaptation of her 2011 play Three Birds is a singular viewing experience – a wry depiction of three working-class Black children’s lives on a Birmingham estate as they try to fly below social services’ radar to keep the family together after their mum leaves. It’s at times tense, dark viewing – but only when it’s not dipping into chicken-based escapades or sing-alongs to R&B classics. Charming, challenging TV.What we said:“Okoh’s work is done full justice by three extraordinary young actors – we are surely watching stars being born. It is altogether a wonderful thing.”Read the full reviewLast One Laughing UKPrime VideoView image in fullscreenDaisy May Cooper tries not to rise to Bob Mortimer on Last One Laughing UK.Photograph: AmazonTen comedians spend a day in a room together and try to make each other laugh; anyone who so much as chuckles is eliminated. It’s a simple but brilliant concept, which is why Last One Laughing has already been a hit in 26 other countries before arriving here. There is evil-laced glee to be had watching famous faces try to resist the comedy mastery of Bob Mortimer’s magic show and Daisy May Cooper’s re-enactment of being on a rollercoaster. No wonder Joe Lycett only lasted minutes!What we said: “Harriet Kemsley, who may well be the breakout contestant of the show, at one point looked as if she was having a nervous breakdown trying to stop a laugh from leaking out.”Read the full reviewMiss AustenBBC One/iPlayerAh, the joy of a new Jane Austen drama – except this one is about the real author, whose 250th anniversary is this year, and the personal letters her sister Cassandra destroyed. Still, the adaptation of Gill Hornby’s novel is every bit as swoony and whip-smart as one of the literary legend’s stories. Keeley Hawes is at her period drama peak as Cassandra, who reflects on her relationship with Jane after her death, and works to save her legacy – all while playing matchmaker for a female relative, of course.What we said:“The series becomes ever more of a treat as it goes on – warm, intelligent, clear-eyed, confident and thought-provoking.”Read the full reviewMoNetflixView image in fullscreenSharp gags about the US immigration experience … Mo Amer as Mo.Photograph: Eddy Chen/NetflixMo tackles a tough topic at a troubling time, but sharp gags and vibrant storytelling mean the comedy expertly skewers the immigration experience in the US today. This is a show about a Palestinian refugee trying to claim citizenship in the country he’s lived since he was a child – proving himself between two cultures, and (occasionally) making a pig’s ear of doing so. In series two, Mo finds himself trapped in Mexico, selling tacos and moonlighting as a lucha libre wrestler. Can he get back to America to attend the asylum hearing he’s been waiting 22 years for?What we said:“Mo brings together food, identity, immigration, family andMiddle Eastern politicsin a way that’s as fresh and intriguing as the falafel tacos that become central to the plot.”Read the full reviewPoker FaceSky Max/NowView image in fullscreenOddball antics … Natasha Lyonne with Cynthia Erivo x3 in Poker Face.Photograph: ParamountFrom meth-fuelled alligators to magician-splatted gerbils, glorious daftness is the name of the game in this howcatchem detective series. The majestically watchable Natasha Lyonne plays Charlie Cale, a serial crime solver with the handy knack of always knowing when someone is spouting “bullshit”. For its second outing, the homage to Columbo-like case-of-the-week shows feels more rounded, with stellar guest spots including Giancarlo Esposito as a murderous mortician, Rhea Perlman as a grudge-holding mob boss and Cynthia Erivo sharing the screen with herself as five separate sisters. Two seasons in, Rian Johnson’s oddball crime series is going strong.What we said:“With her gravelly-chipmunk New York tones – or “voice like a rusty clarinet”, as one character has it – Lyonne ensures Cale is an idiosyncratically charismatic protagonist you can really get behind.”Read the full reviewReunionBBC One/iPlayerView image in fullscreenEye-opening … Rose Ayling-Ellis and Anne-Marie Duff in Reunion.Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC/Warp FilmsThe best of the year’s TV crime dramas starring Rose Ayling-Ellis (see alsoITV’s Code of Silence) features stellar acting talent, with Anne-Marie Duff and Eddie Marsan also taking major roles. But the really breathtaking performance comes from Matthew Gurney, playing a deaf character newly released from prison after confessing to the inexplicable murder of his friend – and hellbent on vengeance. Action moves seamlessly from spoken dialogue to British Sign Language, and a script that frequently shines a light on the frustrations of living in a world designed for hearing people. It’s an eye-opening, thrilling piece of TV.What we said:“Gurney is a revelation. That he has had to wait until now for a lead television role says at least as much about the blinkered, ungenerous world of unchallenged norms we live in as Reunion itself does.”Read the full reviewSAS Rogue HeroesBBC One/iPlayerView image in fullscreenUnnervingly hair-triggered … SAS Rogue Heroes.Photograph: BBCIn one sense, Steven Knight’s dramatisation of the origins of the Special Air Service went off book for its second outing – sidelining Connor Swindells as main character David Stirling in an Italian jail to focus on Jack O’Connell’s unnervingly hair-triggered berserker, Paddy Mayne. But in another, it is very much business as usual: fist-pumping rock soundtrack, episodes that rattle along at full throttle and such a thrillingly anti-establishment attitude that it’s not hard to imagine even the authority figures flipping the bird every time they walk past a mirror. Quite possibly TV’s most rollicking historical drama.What we said:“A right old romp!”Read the full reviewSeveranceApple TV+View image in fullscreenSo deep and twisted … Severance.Photograph: AppleMore death, more weirdness, more goats: the second season of the surreal workplace science fiction drama is yet another grippingly bizarre exploration of corporate overreach. There are renegade brass bands, terrifying voyages down dark corridors, characters coming back from the dead and Adam Scott putting in a career-best performance as lead character Mark Scout – whose desperate bid to find the wife he believed to have died years ago scales heights of poignant bleakness. Were this buzzy show on a more popular streamer, it would be impossible to escape.What we said:“The first series was fantastically stylish, clever, trippy and compelling. The second is even more so. It demands all your concentration and takes you down rabbit holes so deep and twisted that you may meet yourself coming back.”Read the full reviewThe AssemblyITV1/ITVXView image in fullscreenIn the hot seat … Danny Dyer in The Assembly.Photograph: ITVAfter the success of Michael Sheen’s turn in The Assembly – a room in which a group of neurodivergent people fire questions at a visiting celebrity – the BBC’s decision not to produce more was baffling. Thank the TV gods then for ITV taking it on, and picking Danny Dyer as the first guest in the hot seat. The panel are fearless, funny and not afraid to ask questions most entertainment journalists wouldn’t dare to, while the celebrities (Gary Lineker, Jade Thirlwall and David Tennant also star) answer with rare candour – plus the musical performances will have you bawling.What we said:“This is some of the warmest telly you’ll see this year … even when Danny Dyer starts dropping f-bombs left, right and centre.”Read the full reviewThe ChangeChannel 4View image in fullscreenA call to arms for menopausal women everywhere … Bridget Christie as Linda in The Change.Photograph: Jon Hall/Channel 4Bridget Christie’s comedy drama isn’t just a window into her weird, whimsical mind – it’s a call to arms for “invisible” menopausal women everywhere. In the first hit season, she played fiftysomething Linda, a mother and wife who hops on a motorbike and escapes to the Forest of Dean to reconnect with her roots. The second season picks up with her navigating this new life, with plenty of life-affirming sisterhood moments – but most memorable are the side-splitting scenes with Paul Whitehouse’s Tony in the pub: “No, I like the company,” he tells Linda when she advises him to get shampoo for his lice problem.What we said:“It’s not easy to weave an ecstatic, rousing and laugh-a-minute TV show out of a toxic patchwork of midlife despair, domestic inequality, sexism, misogyny, culture wars and ecological and political crises. But Christie has gone and done it again.”Read the full reviewThe Last of UsSky Atlantic/NowFans of the video game this show is based on knew it was coming: Joel’s untimely death. But could the second season of the big-budget apocalyptic drama really survive without the giant presence of Pedro Pascal? Ellie’s (Bella Ramsey) melancholy, flashbacks and guitar playing proved too schmaltzy for some, but others appreciated these new emotional layers. Plus, it did drive a big new mission plot: bloody revenge on his killer, Abby (Kaitlyn Dever). Episode two, where an army of mushroom monsters invade the village, was a white knuckle ride reminiscent of Game of Thrones’s Battle of the Bastards (Mark Mylod, who worked on GoT, also directed this). Surely one of the most exciting episodes of the year?What we said:“Season one was a lot … relentless, constantly shifting and weaving to deliver devastation and heartbreak in brutal new ways. On its return for a second season, it has earned the right to take a breath and slow down.”Read the full reviewThe Last Musician of AuschwitzBBC Two/iPlayerView image in fullscreenShould ring in your ears for years … Anita Lasker-Wallfisch AKA The Last Musician of Auschwitz.Photograph: Toby Trackman/BBC/Two Rivers MediaThere have been some incredible documentaries to mark 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen (see also Sky’sThe Lost Music of Auschwitzand Sam Mendes’sWhat They Found). This film is exceptional in telling the extraordinary story of 99-year-old cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, the only surviving member of the women’s orchestra at Auschwitz. First-hand testimonies, archive footage and musical performances merge to show the utter confusion of prisoners playing such beautiful music in an evil hellscape – as well as tiny glimmers of resistance.What we said:“This incredibly impressive programme does not let us forget about Auschwitz’s corpse mountains or stench of burning bodies for a second, all the while posing questions about art and humanity that should ring in your ears for years to come.”Read the full reviewThe RehearsalSky Comedy/NowView image in fullscreenDon’t expect answers … Nathan Fielder in The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025Cloned dogs. A brutal musical talent show. An airport bar, fully recreated in a different state. A couple having an excruciating conversation about their intimacy issues while Nathan Fielder looks on impassively. It’s hard to do justice to the strangeness of Fielder’s latest comedy-reality-documentary series – which is ostensibly an attempt to improve inter-pilot communication on commercial aircraft but sometimes, you find yourself forgetting that. Instead, you’ll repeatedly question everything that is happening on screen: is it real? Is it cruel? Is everyone involved OK? How does Fielder come up with this stuff? Don’t expect many answers.What we said:“Frequently plane-crash TV – but my oh my, does it stick the landing.”Read the full reviewThe Settlers: Louis TherouxBBC Two/iPlayerView image in fullscreenNot many could keep their cool like this … Louis Theroux and Ari Abramowitz in The Settlers.Photograph: BBC/Mindhouse Productions Ltd/Josh BakerAfter a few years spent having low-stakes podcast chats with celebrities, it is great to see Louis Theroux back on top form with this bold sit-up-and-watch documentary. As a follow-up to his 2011 film, The Ultra Zionists, he returns to the West Bank in the wake of the 7 October attacks, as more Israeli religious nationalists settle in the occupied Palestinian territory. Not many could keep a level head spending time with Ari Abramowitz, a gun-holding settler from Texas who refuses to even use the word “Palestinian”, or Daniella Weiss, the aggressively outspoken “godmother” of the movement – even Theroux, in a moment that sees him step away from his usual gentle approach, asks whether she is a sociopath. It is alarming but absolutely necessary viewing.What we said:“I’ve been watching Theroux’s films for more than three decades, and watching him be this forthright feels like a true watershed moment in his career. It suits him.”Read the full reviewThe StudioApple TV+View image in fullscreenBreakneck comedy … Ike Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn, Seth Rogen and Chase Sui Wonders in The Studio.Photograph: APComedy doesn’t tend to move at the pace of The Studio, but this Hollywood satire operates at breakneck speed without skimping on the laughs. Seth Rogen plays Matt Remick, the newly installed head of a Hollywood studio whose ambition to make meaningful cinema is thwarted by his given task of getting a cash-grabbing Kool-Aid blockbuster off the ground. Fast-paced episodes see him and his team in farcical movie mogul scenarios: meddling on sets, fighting with directors, and tying themselves in knots trying to keep a glittering cast of cameo actors sweet.What we said:“You mustn’t come to The Studio looking for much hugging or learning. Emotional abruption, not growth, is the name of the game.”Read the full reviewThe TraitorsBBC One/iPlayerView image in fullscreenManna from heaven … Claudia Winkleman in The Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertWeird fake Welsh accents, professional opera singers who couldn’t act, a bizarre row about Harold Shipman: this season of the Claudia Winkleman-hosted murder mystery reality show has no shortage of memorable moments. Arguably the show’s weakest outing yet, each episode nonetheless felt like appointment TV in a way that no other show has managed in years.What we said:“For those who still believe reality TV can be truly edifying, The Traitors is manna from heaven: shedding light on how people lie and how easily others are taken in, how barely perceptible slips can give people away and how fast herd mentality and conspiracy theories can take hold has real sociological worth.”Read the full reviewThe White LotusSky Atlantic/NowView image in fullscreenShocking … Patrick Schwarzenegger in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOIt’s hard to argue that the Thailand-set instalment of Mike White’s luxury resort drama was its finest to date, dogged as it was by complaints over an unsatisfying finale and a fan-angering theme tune. But even a middling season of the gripping wealth satire is must-watch TV, withParker Posey’s accent setting social media ablaze, an incest scenethat proved to be the drama’s most shocking moment yetand Aimee Lou Wood emerging as the international star she’s long deserved to be. Where can the show go to top this?What we said:“Exquisitely shot, scripted, paced and performed, it’s a sumptuous feast for all the senses.”Read the full review#1 Happy Family USAPrime VideoView image in fullscreenLaugh-a-second stuff … #1 Happy Family USA.Photograph: PrimeEverything Ramy Youssef touches in the world of television turns to gold – and his edgy, laugh-a-second adult animation (created with South Park’s Pam Brady) is no exception. Following a Muslim family straight after 9/11, which makes everyone in their community run a mile from them, they double down on their love of all things American: Britney Spears, the Chicago Bulls … Bill Cosby. The funniest show of the year so far.What we said:“This is a show steeped in 00s nostalgia, and mentions of illegal streaming services like LimeWire and Napster, classic anime series Dragon Ball Z and even the Game Boy Advance had me misty-eyed. But it’s also rooted in the present. At a time when religious and racial prejudices seem to be steadily creeping back into vogue, and with Trump back in power, it feels quietly subversive – underlining just how necessary switching between two identities is for many people’s survival in American society.”Read the full reviewThe ResidenceNetflixView image in fullscreenDaffy detective … Uzo Aduba in The Residence.Photograph: Jessica Brooks/NetflixThere’s a dead body! In the White House! Luckily, given the fact that there’s a state dinner taking place for Australia’s top politicians – including a live performance by Kylie Minogue – it’s an open-and-shut case of suicide that should be easy to clear up … shouldn’t it? Obviously not. The gleefully idiosyncratic turn from Orange is the New Black’s Uzo Aduba as a maverick detective fills this daffy procedural with fun, as she strews political chaos in her wake while trying to get to the bottom of the crime. If only US politics were normally this fun …What we said:“A gorgeous, gleeful romp that allows not just Aduba but all of the many players in the cast to shine.”Read the full reviewUnforgotten: Bradford City FireBBC Two/iPlayerTaking place just a few weeks before the Heysel Stadium disaster, the devastating fire at Bradford City FC’s Valley Parade ground in 1985 is, in many ways, a forgotten tragedy. This moving documentary is an overdue commemoration of the 56 lives that were lost (watching the horrifying footage, you’ll marvel that it wasn’t many more) and an exploration of the safety oversights and regulatory failures that allowed it to happen. The Bradford fire changed football as profoundly as the Hillsborough disaster: this documentary explains why.What we said:“Courageously, this film tries to rescue hope and humanity from the ashes.”Read the full reviewWhat It Feels Like for a GirlBBC Three/iPlayerView image in fullscreenFun and vicious … Laquarn Lewis as Lady Die, Hannah Jones as Sasha, Ellis Howard as Byron, Alex Thomas-Smith as Sticky Nikki and Adam Ali as Dirty Damian in What It Feels Like for a Girl.Photograph: Enda BoweSpiky, fierce and up for absolutely anything, 15-year-old Byron (a scintillating Ellis Howard) is so bored they start giving sexual favours for fivers in the local public loos … and so starts a rollercoaster story of self-discovery around the clubs, caffs and grim bogs of their home town Hucknall and the big city beyond: Nottingham. Based on Paris Lee’s thrilling memoir, Byron soon meets a gang of queer and trans friends known as the Fallen Divas and learns the power and bliss of being yourself (not before getting into lots of scrapes, mind.)What we said:“It’s certainly a wild ride – and I’ll struggle to look at a toilet brush the same way ever again.”Read the full reviewShare your favouriteYou can tell us your favourite TV show of the year so far using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Joined in the second half by members old and potentially new, and also the BBC Singers, the sound was thrillingErica JealMon 9 Jun 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 12.32 EDTShareVoces8are 20 years old this year, but with so many speeches and so much goodwill floating around the sold-out Barbican, this birthday concert felt more like a wedding. It was certainly a family celebration on one level: the main MC was Barnaby Smith, who co-founded this agile vocal group with his brother Paul and is still its countertenor and artistic director, while Paul is CEO. And there were several old friends of the ensemble among the composers.The first half showcased the group in its usual format – eight singers, a cappella. It started with Buccinate in neomenia tuba by the Italian Renaissance composer Giovanni Croce, which, expertly sung, felt like an establishment of their credentials: crisp, poised and fast, the Italian skipping off the singers’ tongues.The first half was otherwise full of 20th- or 21st-century music, rounded off with some tightly delivered arrangements of Cole Porter and Nat King Cole, but concentrating on more reflective, recent pieces, of which the most effective was probablyCaroline Shaw’s and the swallow, which plays with some gently evocative fluttering effects at the end. Strikingly, the music that was more than a century old –Elgar’s Nimrod, arranged by John Cameronto fit the Lux Aeterna words from the Requiem mass, orBogoroditse Devofrom Rachmaninov’s All-Night Vigil – sounded no more old-fashioned than most of the works by living composers. That says less about Elgar and Rachmaninov and more about fashions in choral music, with a safe, contemplative, slightly Disneyfied style – the kind of thing the choir sings in the film of Frozen – having become today’s default.View image in fullscreenVoces8 joined by the group’s alumni at their 20th anniversary concert at the Barbican, London.Photograph: Andrew WilkinsonThere was some more ambitious recent music in the second half, in which the core lineup was joined by, variously, 18 alumni members, the eight singers of Voces8’s apprentice programme, violinist Jack Liebeck, and theBBC Singers, who remain an inspiration for every aspiring choral group. Kristina Arakelyan’s An Ode to the World and, especially, Roxanna Panufnik’s Love Endureth brought a welcome dose of punchier, more rhythmically driven music, and pieces by Jonathan Dove and Ken Burton also made an impact, but it was two old choral favourites, William Harris’s Faire is the Heaven and Charles Wood’s Hail Gladdening Light, performed by all 40-odd singers on stage that were the highlights. It’s rare to hear a professional choir this large outside an opera house, and the sound they created was thrilling.OnBBC Radio 3 on 18 June, then on BBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC SingersBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

TV this brief needs to be perfectly formed …. and this is far from itLucy ManganMon 9 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 12.02 EDTShareIf something is going to be small, it needs to be perfectly formed. If it’s a short story, you need to be giving itKatherine Mansfieldlevels of welly. If you’re contemplating a 90-minute adaptation of Great Expectations, you need to be David Lean. If it’s a canape, it needs to be a tiny yorkshire pudding with a mini slice of roast beef tucked in and a dot of horseradish on the top. A smear of cream cheese on a cracker won’t do.And if you are putting together a set of three 15-minute films as the first original drama for Channel 4’s digital platform, to be shown onYouTubeto try to get the youth market to pump the brakes on its handcart to hell and see what this “art” business is all about (before it is streamed in one gobbet on your main broadcast channel), the same principle applies. It needs to be a miracle of compression, a story told without a wasted second or word. It will need to evoke much but still nail the key points and obey the narrative rules by which we make sense of any tale and through which we enjoy it.Beth is a yarn written and directed by photographer and short film-maker Uzo Oleh, about a couple who unexpectedly fall pregnant after giving up on IVF after many unsuccessful attempts. Molly (Abbey Lee) is a willowy, Scandinavian-looking blond. Her husband, Joe (Nicholas Pinnock), is Black. The longed-for baby, Imogen (later played, once we’ve skipped through some years, by Jemima Lown) is the image only of her mother. The doctor, Balthas (Nick Blood) who oversaw their fertility treatments is white, too, and suddenly the comforting hand he placed on Molly’s knee during their last session looks like the tip of an iceberg.If you did not know from the accompanying publicity that this was a sci-fi drama you would be pretty sure where the story was heading. And in fact the couple do split up – we next see Joe coming to collect Imogen when she is about six or seven from her friend’s birthday party because Molly has an appointment, and taking her back to her grandma Gabby (Louise Bangay). On his way to Molly’s house to pick up the medications Gabby has left behind, Joe sees her and the doctor together in the local pub and at the house we see evidence that the two of them are living together. It is not clear if this is news to Joe – and if so, how, given that Imogen’s age suggests it is unlikely to be a recent development – but whatever the case, he is provoked into opening her laptop and reading through the emails between Dr Balthas and Molly about Imogen. Again, questions abound – of the irritating, technical sort rather than a product of intrigue. Are these current emails, in which case does this couple not talk face to face about the child? Or has he seamlessly located a cache from six or seven years ago that discusses her origins? Harking back, what did tip him over into this uncharacteristic fury so long after the event? Perhaps most pressingly – why is he hung up on the suggestion of infidelity when there is a key word in most of the emails that would stop the rest of us in our tracks, suggesting as it does an event of world-changing proportions?Meanwhile, at home with Molly, grandma’s own suspicions are hardening into certainty, while Molly returns home to Joe and confirms his and ours.The ending is not compressed so much as wildly rushed. The entire run time is 34 minutes (I don’t know if this means the YouTube films will break even their quarter hours up to allow adverts, but God we’re in an even worse state than I thought if so) and too much of this is spent depicting the couple’s “unbreakable” bond, the delight in the pregnancy and labouring the sweetness of the child (the latter with no narrative payoff at all – it’s irrelevant to the reveal). I’d rather have had 30 more seconds devoted to contemplating the implications of Joe’s discovery (or even explaining the email thing) and done without quite so much of Joe’s brother dilating on Molly’s attractiveness at a party, presumably to make the possibility of an affair with Balthas more plausible.Beth is a very stylish and confidently directed piece, with fine performances throughout – especially from Pinnock, though he also benefits from having the most to do. But the script needs to be tighter and work harder so that we aren’t left feeling as if we’ve just watched the beginning of a Black Mirror episode. An endeavour like this should feel dense but leave you wanting more – through tantalisation and not, as here, largely through frustration.Beth is on YouTube now and on Channel 4 at 10pm on 9 June.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewYouTubereviewsShareReuse this content"

I was 12 years old and felt continually, grindingly nervous about everything and nothing. I had spent the morning in the student support office, coming down from a panic attack that had left me pinned to a classroom floor, heart pounding and tears streaming down my face. Over a post-recovery cup of tea and Jaffa Cakes, a pastoral adviser told me that if this was to become a regular occurrence, I would hit burnout by the end of term. The idea stuck.‘People would prevail’: why The Towering Inferno is my feelgood movieRead moreWithin my first few weeks at high school, I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder – a conditioncharacterised by excessive and persistent worry, according to the NHS. A perfectionist streak had spiralled into an acute sense of responsibility. I was an overly conscientious student; I felt I had to be better than everyone else and excel at my studies in order to prove my worth. I tried to do as much work as I could, as perfectly as possible, as a way to shore up low self-esteem.It was during this state of unrest that Richard Ayoade’s Submarine waltzed into my world. It might be a curious choice to name a film that traverses a troubled home life, too-much-too-young sexual experiences, and bullying as my “feelgood” movie, but within its equally dark and peppy 97 minutes is a story about writing your own rules.Adapted from theJoe Dunthornenovel, Submarine is touching, sweet and, crucially, very funny. Like its deep-thinking protagonist Oliver Tate, I was not very good at being a teenager. I worried I’d ruined my life when it had barely begun. The film follows Oliver’s romance with classmate Jordana Bevan, a pyromaniac with a fearless sense of rebellion. He enjoys reading the dictionary; she likes to singe her partner’s leg hairs with a lighted match.Cooped up at home for days at a time, often too anxious to attend school, I first came acrossSubmarinevia Tumblr. I would spend hours in bed scrolling through the blogging website, which was awash with gifs of Oliver and Jordana. Their relationship, a true balancing of yin and yang energies, felt aspirational to young fans whose identities were still taking shape.Early on in the film, Oliver becomes overwhelmed by a foreboding sense that he will not achieve anything in life. He indulges in gallows humour, narrating the visualisation of his own funeral – a candlelit vigil that will be filmed by a local news crew. While his misfit character sometimes leans into cliche (he reads Catcher in the Rye, of course) the film’s expressive portrayal of anxiety felt validating. It illuminated many tensions that I instantly recognised, such as how mental illness can isolate an individual, leaving friends unsure how to help.The way Oliver responds to situations can be extreme, but not illogical. A first kiss results in breathlessness. He hides in corridors, peeping at things he doesn’t yet understand – gaining vignettes of grownup existence. Stepping outside of his bedroom is to trigger a mysterious, almost occult change in his confidence.At 15, my life was a swirl of counselling sessions, insomnia, and weight loss. I was forced to drop half of my GCSEs, of which the remaining few were completed under separate invigilation. I was terrified, and beneath the fear, burning with shame. But as the months spooled on, I kept returning to Submarine whenever I needed to be reminded that there was a whole realm of possibility out there not reflected in the day-to-day that I knew.As Oliver offers at one point, what happens during one’s adolescence becomes imprinted in the memory and we can spend years later “revisiting the same handful of images”. I vowed to take another route. It was Alex Turner’s heart-rending soundtrack that instead offered me a way forward, with songs that speak to maintaining a sense of selfhood in difficult circumstances.“Tomorrow, I’ll be stronger/Running colourful, no longer just in black and white,” he sings on Hiding Tonight. That’s when it clicked: resentment could turn into resolve. A calmer, more emotionally stable future didn’t have to feel impenetrable. Dozens upon dozens of viewings have since followed; the film still brings me hope and unfettered joy as an adult.A few years into my career, I interviewed Turner at an east London pub. I was 21, still taking gentle steps towards getting better while making a living out of a love of music that essentially started with him. On the tube home, beaming and overjoyed, I pressed play on the Submarine soundtrack. In it I heard not nostalgia but the sound of my transformation, from a timorous, unwell girl to the journalist I became, to what I am still becoming now.Submarine is available to watch on Amazon Prime in the US and UK and to rent digitally in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieSubmarineRichard AyoadeComedy filmsJoe DunthornefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It seems they were first bankrolled partly by crowdfunding, and then presumably kept going by the production’s low overheads and straight-to-retail distribution to an audience that clearly grooves to quasi-Tolkienian, Dungeons and Dragons-style quests featuring a motley band (there is usually an elf or dwarf). If you like your necromancy tales spiked with huge chunks of nattering as the characters endeavour to bulk out the running time with lots of banter and exposition, this may be just the ticket. Don’t worry too much about not having seen the other five films because this is reasonably watchable, especially as so much time is devoted to filling newbies in on the backstory via dialogue and voiceover.In any case, this is a bit of reboot with the meagre plot unfolding about 15 years after events in the last film. The ensemble is made of up all-new characters who allude to such figures as Marek the slave girl-cum-magician who led the franchise earlier. This go-round, our protagonist is The Stranger (Will Kemp), known just as Stranger to his friends; he is an apothecary/bounty hunter (clearly in this medieval economy everyone has two or three jobs) travelling with a mysterious cargo in his wagon. Stranger finds Erid (Nate Morley), an injured young man, on the road and brings him to an inn run by Irish-accented dwarf Giblock (Joe Abraham). The inn just happens to be where Erid had been living as a one of Giblock’s slaves along with comely Arlin (Ryann Bailey), but Erid recently got caught up in a catastrophe when the local witch, who goes by the delightful moniker Mahitable Crow (Barta Heiner), murdered everyone in the nearby village, making Erid the sole survivor.As a terrible storm is raging outside, other travellers keep fetching up at the inn, including a loudmouth local marshal and his elven sidekick, a hulking hunter, a mysterious vampy woman, and so on. It’s like The Hateful Eight but with slightly less ponderous dialogue and crisper editing. The nocturnal time-frame means the darkness can disguise the shonkiness of the visual effects during the sequence when a human character turns into a CGI bear. In the final scenes – in daytime – the purple smoke and CGI lightning looks even cheaper and shonkier, which is in its way sort of endearing. But credit is due to the cast and director Jake Stormoen (who played a character in the earlier films) for serving this up with a surprisingly persuasive gravity and straight faces. You can tell it comes from a place of respect for the franchise’s audience.Mythica: Stormbound is on digital platforms from 16 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bradford Cathedral echoed with squawks, rattles and primordial grumbling as the combined forces ofOnyx BrassandHammonds Bandconjured Ní Ríain’s vivid soundscape of life on Earth 11,000 years ago (imagine prehistoric megafauna getting theJawstreatment). But those lower brass growls weren’t the score’s most daring feature. That honour goes to the four percussionists who teased waves of soft rustling from cymbals with small battery-operated vibrators.All in a day’s work at theNew Music Biennial– now in its fifth iteration and hosted this year inBradford, UK City of Culture 2025, before the same lineup of 20 short pieces decamps toLondon’s Southbank Centre in July. Most weren’t strictly world premieres (nor is the Biennial strictly biennial) but as a free showcase of activity across the UK music scene, there’s nothing quite like it. Folk, jazz and electronic artists appear alongside classical ensembles – though such labels mean little when most of the featured music crosses such boundaries as standard.View image in fullscreenThorax-quaking … Zubin Kanga performs Alex Groves’ Dance Suite at the New Music Biennial in Bradford.Photograph: Victor FrankowskiComposer and violinistEllie Wilson’s haunting Moth x Human, for instance, turned data about night-time moth activity into a beguiling synthesised fabric (“the moths are collaborating”) with which her small acoustic ensemble duetted in The Loading Bay, an unused warehouse and building site converted into two intimate performance venues and an art gallery.Xenia Pestova Bennett’s Glow was a shimmering, spooky set of movements for magnetic resonator piano andHard Rain SoloistEnsemble, woven through with spine-tingling recorded narration about weird light phenomena in Danish, Welsh and Turkish. Sitarist and composerJasdeep Singh Degun’s Into the Night – bringing together five Indian classical musicians with the BBC Concert Orchestra – was hislatest thrilling example of cross-cultural collaboration, the orchestra amplifying and harmonising the two raags on which the Indian classical musicians improvised, nods and smiles passing between them. Less persuasive (despite a fearless performance bythe Carice Singersand conductorGeorge Parris) wasDaniel Kidane’s fiendishly difficult N’dehou, a rambling, pointillistic tapestry of syllables inspired by aCameroonian single-note bamboo flute.In a longstanding feature of the New Music Biennial, each work is played twice, sandwiching a short interview. “What’s the difference between the piece we just heard and commercial dance music?” asked the presenter between performances ofAlex Groves’ Dance Suite in a small subterranean nightclub. “I don’t think there is one,” grinned Groves. And it’s true that the grimy, thorax-quaking bass, looped vocal melodies and rhythmic prestidigitation ofZubin Kanga’s virtuosic performance – on laptop, keyboard and Midi-controlling Roli Seaboard – were obviously at home in the space in a way most of the audience were not. The huge, unnamed difference, however, was the invitation to listen closely and admire how Dance Suite functioned as a “set of baroque dances for the 21st century” (hardly a conventional description of most electronic dance music): a reminder of the radical impact of how we talk about music – any music – on what we end up hearing.At the Southbank Centre 4-6 July.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicUK city of cultureBradfordreviewsShareReuse this content"

The phrase he’s teaching? “Yo noquieroagua, yoquierobebida”, which in English translates to “I don’t want water, I want a drink”. As people used to say: yolo.This is the vibe ofPitbull’s Party After Dark tour, which returns to the UK for its second run this year. It’s a relentless ride through the era of hedonistic and carefree EDM pop that sprouted up after the 2008 financial crisis, and given renewed economic uncertainty and horrific global events, it’s unsurprising that people are still seeking escapism. Why shouldn’t that be delivered by a bald man in his 40s known for rapping “I saw, I came, I conquered / Or should I say: I saw, I conquered, I came”?Tonight, Pitbull – who has more listeners every month on Spotify than Beyoncé or Lana Del Rey – is like a cult leader: the audience are zealously devoted, and that perhaps explains why they’re able to ignore the flaws. The set is regularly padded by dull DJ interludes, the main attraction disappearing off to change his jacket. The set list is chaotic, the band randomly interpolating The Final Countdown or songs by Guns N’ Roses and Beastie Boys. And when Pitbull is on stage the sound is so muddy that you can hardly make out what he’s rapping.He is magnetic, though, and it’s easy to be seduced by indelible hits such as DJ Got Us Fallin’ in Love Again, Feel This Moment, and line-dance jumper Timber. His frenetic, slightly cheesy performance style is like that of a children’s entertainer, albeit for kids hyped on vodka Red Bull rather than apple juice. During his well-rehearsed chat, meanwhile, it’s more booze-soaked motivational speaker. “Life is not a waste of time. And time is not a waste of life,” he informs the crowd. “Let’s not waste any time and get wasted tonight.”The crowd wildly lap all this up. No one, Pitbull included, seems to care that as a package it’s not particularly good. This show is about losing yourself, taste and quality be damned.

Norse legend has it that this craggy and almost uninhabitable place was created by two warring giants, obsessed with the same mermaid. While throwing boulders at each other, one of the rivalrous giants’ missiles accidentally plopped into the sea: and so the island was born.A version of this mythic tussle is central to Michael Pedersen’s debut novel. When the narrative opens, delivered in a lively present tense sprinkled with Scots, The Father and his 19-year-old son Ouse are the only residents on the island. The Father mans Muckle’s lighthouse, and is as volatile as the waves he illuminates. A gossip from a neighbouring island describes him as irascible, with “a viper in his throat and … a broken soldier’s thirst for whisky”. Ouse, meanwhile, is “a queer sort” “who sounds as if he’s been sooking helium out of party balloons … always staring off into the distance”. He’s famed in the area for being an “artiste”, a dab hand at needlework with a reputation for producing beautiful handmade textiles.What unites father and son is that they take their stewardship of the island seriously. They are devoted to the extraordinarily various wildlife – puffins, gannets, sea otters, peacock butterflies – and hypnotised by the thrillingly chimeric weather. Unspoken grief for The Mother, who drowned two years before the story begins, also binds the two together. The Father assumes his only heir will eventually take over the family business.Pedersen is known as a poet, and his wonder at the magic of language is evident in the self-consciously high styleEnter Firth, a foppish twentysomething failed writer from Edinburgh with griefs of his own. Racked with self-loathing, he has vowed to kill himself after fulfilling a promise: to visit the enchanted isle of Muckle Flugga, much loved by his late grandfather. Almost as soon as he arrives, Firth is entranced by Ouse’s mercurial demeanour, as he parses landscapes and seascapes alien to Firth’s urban eyes. Firth is struck, too, by the blazing potential of Ouse’s artistic talent. He wants to whisk him away to the mainland and make him a star. Thus begins the tug of war for Ouse’s allegiance: The Father, familiarity and tradition yank one way, but Firth, possibility and the seductive unknown pull just as hard.This perhaps presents the plot as neat and fairly recognisable: a narrative of masculine archetypes vying for one-upmanship, with notes of The Tempest. But Pedersen introduces wild cards – spooky visions of religious zealots, a pumpkin-punching contest – that emphasise the strangeness of this remote place, so far away from the norms of the mainland that anything might be possible. Significant among these zany additions is the ghost of Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson. Stevenson – who came from a family of lighthouse engineers – acts as imaginary friend and confidant to Ouse. He counsels Ouse for his maternal loss and guides him through the decision about where his future might lie. Pedersen threads the apparition’s dialogue with aphorisms from the real Stevenson’s work and correspondence.The novel’s most memorable feature, and perhaps most potentially divisive one, is its loudness. The characterisation of the villainous but vulnerable father, of the hapless city type and of the ethereal innocent is bold and broad – sometimes cartoonish. The setting, rich with images of the aurora borealis and storm-lashed shores, is almost psychedelic. But the narrative voice is loudest of all: constantly baroque, with the linguistic and emotional dials turned up high. Firth receives an unexpected letter, and the missive is “a Pandora’s box, a bete noire, a curse, a lifeline, an arch nemesis, a fairy godmother … a gift from the gods”. A flurry of snow after an exchange between the protagonists is “a divine offering, the impetus for reconciliation under the auspices of a natural phenomenon”.Pedersen is known as a poet, and his wonder at the magic of language is evident in this self-consciously high style. In places, the linguistic busyness occludes the plot’s more interesting undertones: the queer desire between Ouse and Firth, considerations about our place in and responsibilities to the natural world.But there is, ultimately, something immensely charming about this novel. It is weird, rambunctious and repeatedly demands the reader surrender to its particular wildness. Its generosity of spirit, its unrestrained warmth and humour – the brilliantly kinetic description of a surprise ceilidh is a case in point – steadily worked away at my scepticism. Like Ouse’s flamboyant designs, inspired by the spectacular landscape around him, it is “garishly alive”.Muckle Flugga by Michael Pedersen is published by Faber (£16.99).

Gwen John’s paintingThe Convalescentshows a subdued yet happy moment, for this woman is free to think and feel. That, we see in Judith Mackrell’s outstanding double biography of Gwen and her brother, was her ideal for living: to be at liberty even if that meant existing in deepest solitude.The quietness of a life spent largely alone in single rooms, reading, drawing, painting and occasionally having wild sex with the sculptor Rodin, is counterpointed in this epic narrative by the crowded, relentless, almost insanely overstimulated life of Augustus John. Lion of the arts in early 20th-century Britain, he was a bigamist, adulterer, father of so many children you lose track (so did he), and an utterly forgettable painter.Today, we take Gwen John’s posthumous triumph over her brother for granted. While “Gus” – as he was known in their childhood in Tenby, Wales, and to her always – was toweringly famous in his lifetime, portraitist ofLawrence of Arabiaand James Joyce, he’s dust now. Growing up in Wales, I liked his portrait of Dylan Thomas on the cover of a biography: curly-haired, baby-faced, rebellious. I didn’t have any idea of the story behind it. As Mackrell relates, Augustus began a relationship with a teenager, Caitlin Macnamara, which she would come to see as abusive, punishing him by having a very physical flirtation with Thomas in front of him. Soon afterwards, she married the poet. Guilty and confused, Augustus would leave money in his coat pockets for the penniless couple to steal.What is success, what is failure? This book raises big questions about how we can judge or know othersAugustus’s exploitation of the future Caitlin Thomas is the only occasion Mackrell judges him. By this time, in the 1930s, we’ve had some jaw-dropping antics. Gwen and Augustus both studied at the Slade, the first British art school to admit women, in the 1890s. Gus married Ida Nettleship, also a Slade student and Gwen’s friend. How romantic, except he rapidly fell for model Dorothy McNeill whom he rechristened “Dorelia”, persuading his wife to accept Dorelia in a menage that was to last until Ida died after giving birth to her and Augustus’s fifth child. No one in their circle complained – except Ida’s mother.Gwen was no cardboard saint either. She shared her brother’s belief that being an artist meant freedom from the Victorian bourgeois morality they’d been born into – Gwen in 1876, Augustus in 1878. All her life she would have sexual feelings for women as well as men. She persuaded Dorelia to sail to France with her and walk to Rome. They made it as far as Toulouse where Gwen portrayed her beautifully. InDorelia in a Black Dress, she wears a flare of pink on her shoulder and gazes at us with unkempt hair and a subtle half smile. Even when it came to painting Augustus’s muse, Gwen outdid her brother. His 1908-9 painting of Dorelia,Woman Smiling, was once acclaimed as a modern Mona Lisa but now looks ridiculous: Dorelia’s grin is foolishly broad, she wears what Augustus saw as “gypsy” garb and poses heftily in a pastiche of Rubens. It is Gwen who captures what made Dorelia magnetic.That’s easy for us to say and see. In the early 20th century it was Augustus who looked like the star. One reason is obvious: he was a man. He bounded on to the art scene, a good-looking youth who learned from his elder Whistler to wear memorable hats and an artist’s beard, seducing women after training himself on a Belgian brothel tour, a rebel dandy who was fascinated by the Romany. Gwen was shy, introverted, hard to know. “I don’t pretend to know anybody well,” she confessed. “People are like shadows to me and I am like a shadow.”Augustus and Gwen had grown up together, both enthusiastic child artists, energetic thorns in the side of their widowed father. Is the contrast in their personalities the scar of gendered expectation? Mackrell goes far beyond a simplistic schema in mapping these lives. Gus is not a pantomime patriarchal villain, nor Gwen a feminist idol: they’re human.The brother had a captivating generosity while his sister could be a tricky customer. Gwen complained that Augustus wasn’t replying to her letters at a time when Dorelia (who stayed with him for life) was ill and his son dying of meningitis. “There was a streak of ruthless self-absorption in her,” Mackrell writes , “a lack of charity and self-awareness.” Gus was quite supportive, but his own life was so complex, tragically so; he got distracted. One of the siblings’ worst fallings-out was over Gwen’s relationship with Rodin. When she confessed she was not only modelling nude for the great sculptor but sleeping with him, her brother expressed disgust that she was being used by this old man, 36 years her senior. Rodin told her she hadun corps admirable.Mackrell agrees. As a dance critic she brings an informed perspective to Gwen’s work as a model, judging that her “body, though small, was flexible and strong. She was elegantly proportioned, with small high breasts, narrow hips, long muscled legs, and a graceful neck – a woman who looked powerful in her nakedness.”That nakedness is preserved in Rodin’splaster statue of heras a Muse, looking gravely downward, for his unfinished Monument to Whistler. Gwen John had stepped into modern art.The story of these two lives is the story of British art in the early 20th century. Artists like Augustus, despite walking – and shagging – like avant gardists, just could not break out of the expectations of “proper” painting demanded by the British public. In 1910, Van Gogh, Cézanne and other “post-impressionists” were introduced to Britain in a show organised by Roger Fry. Augustus felt crushed by this shock of the new. Meanwhile, in her pared-down, conceptual images of women alone, Gwen in Paris was a born modernist.Her affair with Rodin was the great relationship of her life. He filled her with joy and agony, then moved on. Friends, including the poet Rilke, tried to help. But it took God to fill the void. When Gwen converted to Catholicism, Augustus was again shocked, for they had both been atheistic rebels against their Baptist upbringing.Gwen’s life, from the outside, looked lonely, impoverished, eccentric, sad. She died after years of sickness at Dieppe in 1939, on a last trip to the sea, her burial site lost in the chaos of war. Yet her dedication to love, God and art seems fierce and wondrous now, her art a piercingly true autobiography. Meanwhile, Augustus is as slapdash in his paintings as his life.Biography can be a glib genre, but Mackrell approaches her subjects with an almost novelistic sensibility. What is success, what is failure? This book raises big questions about how we can judge or know others.One of Augustus’s best paintings is a1907 portrait of WB Yeatsthat gives the poet black, mystical eyes as if he’s having a vision. I can’t help wondering whether Yeats thought of him when he wrote that the artist “is forced to choose / perfection of the life, or of the work”. This riot of a man believed he could have the two, and got neither. His sister, in her mystery, got both.Artists, Siblings, Visionaries: The Lives and Loves of Gwen and Augustus John by Judith Mackrell is published by Picador (£30).

This is a very big deal, not just because it marks the first time Xbox has co-branded a console (with high-end PC specialists Republic of Gamers), but because it’s packing top-of-the-line hardware under its hood. I played the Xbox Ally X, one of two models coming before Christmas, a few hours after they were revealed during 8 June’s Xbox Showcase, and can easily see it becoming a serious competitor for both the Switch 2 and Valve’s Steam Deck.TheXboxAlly springs from the coupling of four different tech firms: Windows, Xbox, AMD and Asus, and it’s definitely their golden child. Both the Xbox Ally and Ally X models have 7-inch 1080p touchscreens, with 16GB of RAM in the Ally and 24GB of RAM in the Ally X, and 512GB SSD storage and 1TB, respectively. Each has Ryzen Z2 chips, though Xbox Ally X has the AI Z2 chip, which integrates an AI processor directly into the silicon. As for what that actually means for players, Microsoft’s head of gaming devices, Roanne Sones, said during a presentation that players will be able to “take advantage of AI experiences without having to compromise anything on the GPU”. The devices both run Windows, but the team has modified it for optimal gaming.“We’re not loading up the Windows desktop,” Xbox Experiences VP Jason Beaumont said. “We’re not loading up the icons and the task bar and components that really aren’t about playing video games … we can save a bunch of resources and then give those to the game, so that they can perform better.”You can access your collection of games with a library button on the device (there’s also a new Xbox button that functions similarly to the one on a console controller). This library includes your PC games from Xbox and other stores, and will let you stream games from your existing Xbox console, if you own one. If you have an Xbox Game Pass subscription, hundreds of games are available to play on the Allies straight away.View image in fullscreenROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGDuring Microsoft’s presentation in LA, I’m handed an Xbox Ally X over my right shoulder. I have rather small hands, and this thing is big (and heavier than the Switch 2), but it doesn’t feel overwhelming. As a gamer who prefers the ergonomics of an Xbox controller to a PlayStation DualSense, I appreciate the asymmetrical joysticks and how the outer curvature mimics the Xbox pad.The Xbox Ally X boots up immediately into a homepage that shows your most recently played Xbox games, styled much like the console homepage. We’re told to navigate to Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the 2006 classic that’s launching on 26 August. As a huge Gearsfan, the effect of loading a beautifully remastered version of a game I haven’t played in nearly 20 years on a console held between my palms is pretty wild.Muscle memory immediately kicks in: press A to magnet Marcus to a chest-high wall, reload your gun faster by timing a press of the R1 button – except I’m holding this game that shaped my teen years in my lap. I don’t get more than 10 minutes with Gears of War: Reloaded before the Xbox Ally X is somewhat unceremoniously plucked from my hands, and we’re shown a quick summary video with talking heads from Microsoft, Windows, ASUS and AMD. One of them says that the power and capabilities of the Xbox Ally X were “inconceivable even three years ago”.There’s no price point yet, perhaps because the uncertainty of President Trump’s tariffs has Microsoft hesitant to name one at the moment. However, the look, feel, and function of the ROG Xbox Ally will make it a great option for those looking to access both Xbox and third-party games on a portable console, while the Xbox Ally X seems tailor-made for performance perfectionists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s the question thrown up by this touring show fromKatherine Ryan, which pairs 45 minutes of caustic standup with a second 45 of counselling to the crowd. You might protest that that adds up to less than an hour of new material in Battleaxe, plus a second act that’s more improvised therapy session meets audience Q&A. But at least those three-quarters of an hour find Ryan on imperious form, dispensing tart put-downs of men in general and some men in particular.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This ice queen of comedy pose is one Ryan wears lightly now, after a few years where it sometimes felt restrictive and for show. Then came her 2022 show Missus, which diluted (or enriched) the persona to address the Canadian’s then-recent out-of-the-blue marriage. Battleaxe is a retrenchment after that more expansive offering, with Ryan back in her high-status comfort zone, eye-rolling at her children’s foibles, breaching PC protocols for LOLs, and wrinkling her nose at the weaker sex. “If dildos could bleed a radiator, men would be obsolete.” There’s a fine routine on the contrasting ways male and female bodies husband their reproductive material, and many a weary remark at the expense of ’im indoors. See this masterpiece of double-edgery: “I love my current husband so much so far.”The Ryan we meet post-interval sits a little at odds to this act one badass, as she responds to problems volunteered by the crowd with even-handedness in place of cynical certainty. Fair enough: such is (in her own words) her duty of care, as she ministers to a man whose Lego habit his new wife refuses to tolerate, and a couple at odds about the appeal (or otherwise) of having a third child. But, in this touring show of two halves, the laughs in this crowdsourced comedy are milder than the short, sharp hit of concentrated Katherine that goes before.Touring until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsComedyKatherine RyanreviewsShareReuse this content"

He wasn’t the only one.On the face of it, the show about his life, which opened at Liverpool’s Royal Court theatre this week and runs until July, is a knockabout romp about a local character known for raising money for charity by strutting his stuff in a pair of bright blue budgie-smugglers.But it is also a story about addiction, depression and hitting rock bottom. It’s about finding purpose and becoming a hero, but losing yourself along the way. Fundamentally, says the 60-year-old the morning after its opening night, it’s a story about hope.“It’s not happy-clappy,” says Cullen. “But it is funny. It’s got music, it’s got love, it’s got breakups. It’s got hope and perseverance and heart.”In short, it tells Cullen’s extraordinary story with clear-eyed honesty. For 20 years of his life the Liverpudlian sank deep into addiction, abusing drugs and drink and ending up homeless. In 2001, with the help of a friend he credits with saving his life, he managed to get clean.“When you’re wrapped up in addiction, you become a victim to your own circumstances,” he says. “You stop taking responsibility […] there’s a lot of shame and guilt. I’ve had to work hard to become the person I am today, who actually shows himself some compassion and love. I’ve had to rebuild life, one day at a time.”Part of that rebuilding was the invention of Speedo Mick, a one-man fundraising machine, who carried out feats of endurance wearing Everton-branded Speedos and little else. In 2014 he swam the Channel, despite never having had a formal swimming lesson. After becoming attached to his bright blue trunks, the lifelong Evertonian started turning up half naked at Goodison Park on match days, cheerily shaking a charity bucket.View image in fullscreenSpeedo Mick arriving at Goodison Park for a match against Liverpool in 2018.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesHe was asked in those early days what he wanted to achieve: raise £1m was the answer. “People looked at me like I was nuts; I was dreaming too big for them,” he says. “But if your dreams don’t scare you, they’re not big enough. I love that saying.”Then – with a wrecked shoulder and aching knee – he took his now-famous kecks on a series of monumental charity walks: fromJohn o’Groats to Land’s End in 2020, a 2,000-mileGiving Back Tour in 2021, then up Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike in 2023. Occasionally, like when Storm Ciara nearly blew his trunks off, he donned an Everton scarf along with a swim cap and goggles.In the process Cullen raised – and he has the precise figure – £1,036,000. But behind the celebratory news stories his life was beginning to fray at the edges. Without a manager and doing his own social media, he said yes to every request, on one occasion jumping on to a train to turn up in his Speedos at an Evertonian’s wedding.Since recovering from addiction he had been searching for a purpose, and looking to pay back the people who had helped him survive, he explains. “I thought the purpose was to give and it is,” he says. “The giving back process is a beautiful thing. But you can’t draw from an empty well, and I was doing that for years. I found the purpose, and I lost myself.”After his last walk – and months of hugs, cheers and beeping horns as he trudged on through the biting cold – he got home, and his mental health collapsed. His relationship broke down and he ended up in a clinic for six weeks.View image in fullscreenThe Royal Court theatre in Liverpool.Photograph: Mark Waugh/The GuardianIt is a part of his story that the producers of the musical have not shied away from. The Liverpool actor Paul Duckworth has said the role explores Cullen’s complexities and vulnerability. The show’s writer, John Fay, told the BBC that while Speedo Mick seemed superhuman, Cullen wasn’t. Like all of us, he was fragile.The theatre’s stated mission is to tell scouse stories with a scouse accent and Cullen is grateful his story is being told in his home town. “This is where I fell, and this is where I rose again,” he says, before laughing at himself for sounding “a bit Jesus Christy”. But he is also insistent that as well as his triumphs, it’s important to show audiences his darkest moments.“You can’t just see me running around getting medals and being on the telly. It’s not going to inspire anybody, they’re not going to connect to it,” he says. “The connection is, hopefully, for everyone who hasn’t found recovery yet. We’re shouting from the rooftops that hope is there for you. If there’s hope for me, there’s hope for you.”He insists that he is now taking greater care of himself. He struggled at school, and as an adult was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but he’s now training to be a counsellor (“I had a lot of fear going back into a classroom, but man! It’s been a delight.”) and is writing a book about his life.The tears he shed on the opening night were also tears of pride and happiness at the love he felt surrounded by, he says. “I never get used to that. And it’s great that I don’t, because it’s brand new every time. I don’t take it for granted, the love and affection. It’s massive, man. It holds me.”Until 5 July at the Royal Court theatre, LiverpoolExplore more on these topicsTheatreLiverpoolEvertonnewsShareReuse this content"

Try dribbling past a toddler when he’s just jabbed a shiv in your calf, Lionel Messi.‘A knife crime waiting to happen’: how Yoshitomo Nara became Japan’s most expensive artistRead moreFor 40 years now Nara has been dealing in cutesy kitsch with a vicious edge. His paintings and drawings of adorably bug-eyed little nippers are singularly Nara: love it or hate it, he’s carved out his own instantly recognisable aesthetic path.Me, I quite like it. It’s full of punk rock attitude, dark humour and comic book immediacy. This huge show at the Hayward kicks off with a ramshackle shed in the middle of the gallery, filled with empty beer cans, coffee cups and hundreds of drawings on paper and cardboard. A speaker blasts out rock’n’roll and folk classics by Nick Drake and David Bowie. A painting on the outside shows a blissed out little kid in a serene green field: “place like home”, it says in big bold all-caps. The huge wall opposite is lined with old prog and rock LPs.This could’ve been the whole show and it would have been perfect; it’s everything Nara needs to say. Here in this little wooden shack sanctuary he loses himself in music and draws his heart out. The images all over the floor show punk-rocking kids blasting out chords on electric guitars, protesting against war and shooting pistols while standing on a snarling dog, yelling “I’m a son of a gun”.View image in fullscreenBanging the Drum by Yoshitomo Nara, 2020.Photograph: Courtesy the artist and private collectionIt’s Nara summed up: a joyful mashup of music nerdery, political anxiety and the uncontrollable urge to draw, draw, draw. You get the sense that if his career had started and ended in this shack, no success, no big museum-style shows, just music and art, he’d have been pretty happy.But this is a big show so there’s a lot more to get through. His early work is more expressionistic and dark, a little more scrawly and angry, like a pissed off Basquiat, or George Grosz drawing comics. But by the mid-90s he’d figured himself out and stripped everything back. His cartoon-y grumpy kids now sit against plain backgrounds, there’s nothing to distract you from them as symbols of Nara’s emotional states: boredom, anger, loneliness, sadness, frustration. That’s all that’s here, emotion pure and simple. A little girl with a bandaged face is livid about having the mumps, a figure (dressed as kitty) sitting on duck-shaped potty is seriously angry that you’re having a peek, and the world’s naughtiest child is grinning demonically after cutting a flower down with a saw, a big “fuck you” painted on the back of her jacket. It’s super-direct, simple, funny, emotional painting.Nara repeats this approach over and over across the years. His figures burn down houses, swear, smoke, brandish weapons, play guitars. It’s the punk rebellion of youth continuing to find a voice. The kids resemble a take on forest sprites, little mythological figures used to tell stories, express emotions.It’s not all angry self-reflection. More recent work finds Nara fighting for peace. One girl wears a “no war” T-shirt, another stands under a massive “stop the bombs” banner.Things change in 2011, when the tragedy ofFukushimasends Nara spiralling. Now the kids are all hazy and heartbroken. They’re not ranting and raving any more, they just seem to haunt the canvases, barely there, sad and forlorn. I don’t think these are good paintings for the most part, despite being about something incredibly sad: they’re just too washed out and overthought, a bit mawkish and soft focus. And there’s something not quite right about giving these big canvases all this space, and these benches for you to contemplate them from, in a show that’s otherwise all chaos and energy.View image in fullscreenFire by Yoshitomo Nara, 2009.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Yuichi Kawasaki CollectionI’m not totally convinced the work warrants this many rooms. It all gets a bit repetitive and stretched. And the ceramic heads dotted around the space, especially the tea cup fountain at the end, add absolutely nothing to the exhibition. But the best work here can be so joyful, approachable, angry and relatable that you can forgive these faults.Nara is best when he’s being direct and immediate, when his art is about rocking out, fighting back and letting his heart spill on to the canvas. When he’s hey ho-ing and let’s going like his beloved Ramones. I’ve never encountered a show less in need of explanatory wall texts, or more resistant to artsy over-intellectualising: Nara tells you exactly what he feels, all the time. He just does it with the stereo blasting, and a knife behind his back.At the Hayward Gallery, London, from 10 June to 31 AugustExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtSouthbank CentreJapanFukushimareviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the first time I’ve seen it, having missed bothits opening runand the 2018 revival, and it strikes me as an example of Kosky’s work at its finest: probing, insightful, sometimes witty, sometimes dark, always utterly engrossing.Premiered in 1739, Saul has often been compared to King Lear. There is much of Shakespeare in this portrait by Handel and his librettist, Charles Jennens, of the Old Testament king whose mind slowly disintegrates under the challenges presented to him politically and privately by David after the death of Goliath.View image in fullscreenGarish colours give way to black when Saul drags his country into war.Photograph: ASH/Glyndebourne ProductionsMindful that the work also examines the moral arguments around dethroning an anointed king – still a huge issue in the wake of theRevolution of 1688– Kosky updates the oratorio to the time of composition, though his 18th century is a stylised, hedonistic place, reminiscent of Hogarth orFellini’s Casanovain its gaudy seediness. Garish colours give way to black in the second half when Saul’s behaviour drags his country into war. Kosky underpins the Shakespearean resonances by weaving four small roles together for a single performer (tenor Liam Bonthrone), effectively a jester, who stands in relation to Saul much as the Fool does to Lear.Jonathan Cohen conducts the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with great subtlety and dramatic weight, admirably capturing the work’s sometimes unsettling urgency. Christopher Purves (Saul) and Iestyn Davies (David) are both returning to the roles they played in 2015. Purves’s snarling delivery has an almost expressionist ferocity, but he is of course a superb actor and his depiction of Saul’s mental breakdown is at times almost distressingly vivid. Davies is his perfect foil, always calm and psychologically centred, suggesting unswerving certainties of faith. His voice remains unearthly in its beauty, and time stands still when he singsOh Lord, Whose Mercies Numberless.View image in fullscreenWonderfully caustic … Liam Bonthrone as the fool.Photograph: ASH/Glyndebourne ProductionsThe rest of the cast are equally strong. Sarah Brady’s Merab is all hauteur and adamantine coloratura, in contrast to Soraya Mafi’s softer voiced Michal. Linard Vrielink makes an outstanding Jonathan, handsomely lyrical, his love for David beautifully realised, while Bonthrone is wonderfully caustic as Kosky’s newly created fool. The chorus, whether sashaying through one of Otto Pichler’s classy dance routines, or negotiating Handel’s complex counterpoint with perfect clarity, are simply sensational.AtGlyndebourneuntil 24 JulyExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicGlyndebourneFestivalsMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The lunatics in question were a group of up-and-coming artists: Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Berthe Morisot, Camille Pissarro and Edgar Degas.Almost 150 years later, we know now that those lunatics took over the asylum. The impressionists, who rebelled against the old masters by painting lighter, brighter, ephemeral scenes, are today’s old masters; what was so shocking then is now all over our calendars, coffee cups and phone cases. But back in 1876 those looking at their works “are content to laugh at such things,” Wolff wrote sniffily. “But it makes me sick at heart.”View image in fullscreenPaul Cézanne’s The pond, circa 1877-79There were eight impressionist exhibitions between 1874 and 1886. From the first, much fuss was made of these paintings that captured quotidian moments like picnics, laundry day and music lessons, rather than the few subjects deemed acceptable by the establishment (the big three: biblical, mythological or historical). The impressionists – a derogatory label they would later adopt with pride – saw worth and beauty everywhere: a garlic seller or a ballet dancer or a baby nephew deserved immortalising as much as Jesus or Napoleon.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningBut newspapers recorded the public gasping, hooting and even fainting over such art. There was a shared suspicion that these sloppy rebels weren’t bothered to paint properly, or perhaps simply couldn’t. After the very first show in 1874, one critic accused Monet of having “declared war on beauty”, while Morisot’s own tutor wrote to her mother with his damning verdict of her new gang: “All of these people are more or less touched in the head.”View image in fullscreen‘It took courage’ … MFA Boston curator Katie Hanson, pictured at French Impressionism at the NGV.Photograph: Eugene HylandA huge collection of French impressionism has arrived at the National Gallery of Victoria inMelbourne, which is mostly on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston – a gallery founded in 1870, just four years before the first impressionists were shocking France. “Making everyday reality the subject of art – it seems so obvious today, but it’s a wonderful thing to remember that it wasn’t inevitable,” says Katie Hanson, a curator at MFA Boston. “It took courage, and a village, to make impressionism a reality.”View image in fullscreenBarbizon artist Théodore Rousseau’s Edge of the woods (Plain of Barbizon near Fontainebleau), circa 1850-60French Impressionism opens on a room for a literal village: Barbizon, a small town located about 50km from Paris, to which many artists flocked due to its proximity to the very paintable Forest of Fontainebleau – and for being conveniently on a train line. The School of Barbizon inspired many of the impressionists who followed 30 years later. There are even direct links to be found – take Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Peña, who followed Théodore Rousseau around the forest watching him paint; 30 years later, Diaz was in the forest when heran into a young Renoir at work and gave him the career-changing advice to lighten up his palette.“When you start peeling back the onion you find all these points of connection and mutual support underneath,” Hanson says.View image in fullscreenThe ‘masterpieces-on-a-washing-line approach’ means there are so many impressionist paintings on display in the NGV you may struggle to appreciate them all.Photograph: Dan CastanoMFABostonis home to more than 500,000 works, which means it can send off this many masterpieces without a second thought. It can even do it twice: French Impressionism was first staged at the NGV in 2021, before it was closed prematurely due to Covid lockdowns. It is what Julian Barnes once called a “masterpieces-on-a-washing-line approach”; you may find you struggle to appreciate every single painting on display.But you can navigate French Impressionism by playing who-knows-who. There are the mentors like Eugène Boudin who, despite not being an impressionist, gets a whole room to himself for having spotted teenage Monet’s talent and encouraged him to work “en plein air”, as he did; and a few works by Diaz, who supported Renoir and even bought him paint when he couldn’t make ends meet. Then there are the friends who didn’t quite make it into the gang – including the Norwegian impressionist Frits Thaulow, the French realist Henri Fantin-Latour and, of course, Édouard Manet, who was so close to the impressionists that he was widely regarded as their leader, despite his choice to never exhibit with them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The four-year delay in this exhibition returning to Melbourne means Meurent now gets to share the spotlight with Manet’s flirtier view of her – though the exhibition remains an undeniable sausage fest; in the four years since the first attempt to stage it, the number of Morisot paintings has gone from one to two.Pleasure lies in discovering the impressionists’ relationships with one another. Misanthropic Paul Cézanne and argumentative Degas; the social butterflies Monet and Renoir; Morisot, the rare woman among men and a dab hand at dealing with their moods and egos; and Pissarro, the cheerful link between everyone, affectionately dubbed “Papa”. They painted each other’s wives, brothers, children, servants, crushes. Not that they always got along – “They were artists, after all,” Hanson says.So why Boston? Why did a US city take such a shine to the impressionists when Paris was falling over itself to laugh at them? The French gallerist Paul Durand-Ruel, the impressionists’ greatest cheerleader, was already selling Barbizon landscapes to eager Americans when impressionism arrived. When he first exhibited the impressionists in Manhattan in 1886, both the public and press were more curious and impressed than the French had been a decade before. Durand-Ruel opened a permanent gallery in New York in 1888, selling impressionist masterpieces to wealthy east coast collectors, including Bostonians.View image in fullscreenClaude Monet’s Poppy field in a hollow near Giverny, 1885“Boston was prepared to like impressionism because they already liked French painters and unidealised landscapes,” Hanson says. “Bostonians had a real love of nature and naturalism – think of Whitman or Thoreau. People in the Boston area were really focusing on nature’s many splendours, so impressionism wasn’t a step too far for them.”View image in fullscreenA room of one’s own for Monet in the NGV.Photograph: Sean FennessyIf you saw the aborted version of French Impressionism in 2021, it is much more maximalist this time around, with the NGV styling the interiors to look like an opulent Bostonian mansion. The plush lounges scattered around don’t make for good vantage points on busy days – but there are enough instantly pleasing sights on any horizon to keep up morale if you get frustrated by the crowds: the fizzy pastels of Monet’s view of Venice, an unexpected Van Gogh, Renoir’s instantly recognisableDance at Bougival. So while you’re dodging prams or queueing for a look, think back to those first exhibitions in Paris – at least you are not peering past angry Parisians in top hats.

Combining meticulous research with firecracker plots, he published a series of novels that sold more than 75m copies around the world, and won him honours including a CBE in 1997 and the Crime Writers’ Association Diamond Dagger award.Born in Ashford, Kent in 1938, Forsyth flew fighter jets during his national service, but when the Royal Air Force couldn’t guarantee he’d stay in the cockpit he set out to see the world. While working for Reuters as a journalist, he got a lucky break. “The guy stationed in Paris got a heart murmur and had to come home,”he told the Big Issue. “A man stuck his head around the door of my office and said, ‘Anyone here speak French?’ Within days I was on the plane to Paris.”Paris in 1961 was in turmoil, with rightwing militants threatening to assassinate Charles de Gaulle after his offer of independence to Algeria. “We were all waiting for the mega-story,”the author recalled in the Express, “the moment when a sniper got him through the forehead.” Forsyth got the inside track on the security operation from De Gaulle’s bodyguards and when a friend asked if an assassination would be successful, the writer shook his head. “It could be done,” Forsyth replied, “but only by an outsider. An assassin with no name, no face, no record, no dossier. And a professional.” The seed of an international bestseller was sown.After spending time in East Germany, Forsyth moved to the BBC and in 1967 he was sent to Nigeria to cover the Biafran war. He arrived in the newly independent eastern region three days after the federal government’s invasion, having been told that the army would suppress the rebellion in a couple of weeks.“My brief was to report the all-conquering march of the Nigerian army,”Forsyth recalled. “It did not happen. Naively, I filed this. When my report was broadcast our high commissioner complained to the CRO in London, who passed it on to the BBC – which accused me of pro-rebel bias and recalled me to London.”Despairing of the BBC’s reluctance to challenge the British government’s support of the Nigerian regime, Forsyth quit and returned to Biafra as a freelance reporter in 1968. There he helped to break the story of the famine which shocked the world, and began working for MI6. Although Forsyth always denied he was a spy, in his 2015 autobiography, The Outsider,the author admittedhe was an intelligence “asset” for more than 20 years. “There was nothing weird about it,”he told a Guardian Live audience, “it was the cold war. An awful lot of the strength of British intelligence came from the number of volunteers. A businessman might be going to a trade fair in a difficult-to-enter city and he’d be approached, quite gently, with a courteous, ‘If you would be so kind as to accept an envelope under your hotel door and bring it home …’ so that was what I did. I ran errands.”Forsyth returned to the UK as the war came to an end in December 1969, finding himself with “no job, no prospects, no flat, no car, no savings”. Desperate to make money, he “hit on the most no-hope-in-hell way of making some:write a novel. I just sat down and wrote about the invisible assassin with no name. I knew my material; I had walked every inch of it. I wrote night and day for 35 days.”The Day of the Jackal returned to Forsyth’s days in Paris, following an investigation to foil an assassin’s plot to kill De Gaulle. Packed full of operational details and putting fictional characters cheek by jowl with public figures, the novel brought a new realism to the thriller genre. The Guardian hailed it in 1971 as a “chilling, superbly researched story”, asking “Or is it fiction?” It rapidly became a word-of-mouth hit and a global bestseller, with a film adaptation released two years later.In 1972’s The Odessa File, a young German reporter goes in search of the Nazi war criminal Eduard Roschmann and stumbles on an organisation defending high-ranking members of the SS.The New York Times was scathing, suggesting Forsyth had “borrowed painful, live history in order to spring a few quick thrills”, but it quickly became a bestseller. Forsyth also claimed that the novel helped to identify Roschmann in real life. “They made it into a film, which was screened in a little fleapit cinema south of Buenos Aires,” Forsyth told the Telegraph, “where a man stood up and said, ‘I know that man, he lives down the street from me,’ and denounced him. He decided to make a run for it to Paraguay and died of a heart attack on the river crossing. They buried him in an unmarked gravel pit. I hope they tossed a copy of the book in on top of him.”Forsyth began to develop a method, researching a novel for six months then writing it quickly. His commitment to detail was not without danger: in 1974, the author was investigating the illegal arms trade in Hamburg for The Dogs of War, the story of a group of mercenaries who plot a coup in a fictional African republic. When an arms dealer recognised his portrait in a bookshop window, Forsyth was warned he had 80 seconds to leave his hotel. Grabbing his money and passport, he ran to the station and jumped on to a train as it pulled away.Over the next five decades the bestsellers continued, with plots including nuclear weapons, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the cocaine trade and Islamic terrorism. An outspoken critic of Tony Blair, Forsyth was a staunch supporter of Brexit, becoming a patron of Brexit campaign group Better Off Out, and wrote of his scepticism of climate change in his Daily Express column.Forsyth was never romantic about the art of fiction, repeatedly announcing his retirement and complaining that he had to force himself to write. “I am slightly mercenary,” he said. “I write for money.”But Forsyth kept returning to his typewriter and over his lifetime wrote more than 25 books, that have sold over 75 million copies.Speaking to the Times at the launch of his 2018 novel The Fox, the writer declared once more that it would be his last. But even as Forsyth insisted “the interest has gone”, there was still a hint of unfinished business. “I’ve got three unused typewriters in a cupboard at home,” he said, “enough to see me out.”Jonathan Lloyd, Forsyth’s agent, said he last saw the writer a few weeks ago to watch a forthcoming BBC documentary of his life. Lloyd said he “was reminded of an extraordinary life, well lived.”“Having long held The Day of the Jackal as the blueprint of the modern thriller, I was honoured to become his editor for Avenger in 2002 and have remained so ever since,” said Bill Scott-Kerr, Forsyth’s publisher. “Working with Freddie has been one of the great pleasures of my professional life,” he added. “He leaves behind a peerless legacy which will continue to excite and entertain for years to come.”Explore more on these topicsFrederick ForsythThrillersFictionMI6UK security and counter-terrorismnewsShareReuse this content"

The electronic duo Bicep also halted their set on the IICON stage due to overcrowding concerns.At the time, the festival said major artists performing at smaller stages with limited capacities was “part of the magic of Glastonbury” and some fans may be left disappointed.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

That sweltering afternoon in the sun, the largest crowd of New York’s premier music festival – more than could fit on the lawn of Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens – gathered at an unusual hour for a mid-bill set. If you’re lucky, there are a few times in the life of a regular concertgoer when it is not just another great show, when you can feel the gravity of the zeitgeist shift. Chappell Roan, dressed as the Statue of Liberty and ferried to the stage in a giant apple, belting Red Wine Supernova to a sea of pink cowboy hats in one of the loudest sing-backs I have ever heard, is one of those times, a clear sonic boom of a cultural rocket taking off.Governors Ball festival 2024: Coachella gets a strong, and cheaper, run for its moneyRead moreRoan’s star-making moment turned out to be a stake in the ground of a tentpole year for women in pop music, and the 2024 Gov Ball happened to find itself at the center. The festival lucked out in booking Roan before she blew up, unofficially launching her successful campaign for Grammys best new artist. Same for Sabrina Carpenter, also given mid-day booking before Espresso became thesong of the summer. From Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna to proudly queer Broadway crossover Reneé Rapp to headliner SZA, the festival palpably hummed with hype for female acts both ascendant and bankable, taking advantage of Coachella’s so-called flop year for a cheaper, more accessible, banner weekend for, as I heard more than once, the “girls and the gays”.That momentum was palpably absent from this year’s Gov Ball, a colder and soggier affair that felt comparatively removed from the cultural pulse, short on buzzy moments or big debuts, though still an excellent showcase for the breadth and talent of international artists. That’s not entirely the fault of the organizers, who had to grapple with intermittent storms bad enough to delay all of Saturday, forcing cuts to lower-bill acts, shortened sets and exorbitant entrance lines snaking around the park. And no shade to a slate of enjoyable performers who brought as much energy as they could to gray days, and especially not to Saturday headlinerOlivia Rodrigo, a pop princess in her own right who drew easily the biggest crowd of the weekend – the sheer amount of people rushing the gates after her triumphant kiss-off anthem Get Him Back! brought foot traffic to a sardined standstill.View image in fullscreenFans watch Hozier perform.Photograph: Andy Kropa/Invision/APThat Rodrigo would pull the greatest focus of the weekend – Saturday was the only day to sell out – is not a surprise, as Gov Ball notoriously skews young, the festival being relatively cheap (emphasis on relative – three-day general admission starts at $359,compared to $649 for Coachella, and a single day goes for $189) and accessible via public transit. (One hopes the hordes of teenage girls I saw in the outfit of the summer – a lacy, tiered white miniskirt and brown western boots – were not onKlarna payment plans.) Like her one-time idol Taylor Swift, Rodrigo appeals to the very young – girls on their parents’ shoulders, teens who trill in unison “ooooh she looks so goooooood” when she appeared in a red polka dot lingerie set and knee-high Doc Martens, her staple shade of blood-red lipstick pristine. Girls largely too young to understand the import of David Byrne, who showed up for a buoyant duet of Burning Down the House that delighted as much as it confused the audience around me.Rodrigo, still an ingenue when speaking and gloriously fed up in song, delivered on an already well-regarded set, her Guts tour having been under way for over a year. Such was another weight on this year’s Gov Ball, which caught fellow headliners Tyler, The Creator and Hozier on the back end of tour cycles instead of launching them, as with last year’s headliners Post Malone, SZA and the Killers. Tyler, the still-impish provocateur of experimental hip-hop, acknowledged as much during his banger of a Friday set, admitting in typical chillspeak that though he was tired from his Chromakopia tour, “I fuck with Governors Ball and what they do so I decided to show the fuck up.” And he did, offering a masterclass of weirdo charisma from atop a storage container, at turns devilish, mischievous and conspiratorial (“Let’s see what other old shit I got,” he said before launching into 2011 hit She.)View image in fullscreenBenson Boone performs.Photograph: Kyle Stevens/ShutterstockThe ghost of 2011 could be felt elsewhere; if last year skewed pure pop, this one skewed toward the voguish, so-called “stomp clap hey” revival of folk pop, with more acoustic acts such as Mt Joy, the Japanese House and festival-closer Hozier, as well as Spotify-friendly indie pop bands like Wallows (fronted by 13 Reasons Why actor Dylan Minnette) and Australian duo Royel Otis. If there was a viral star of the weekend, it was upstart Benson Boone, appealing to a similar crowd as Rodrigo with ruddy-cheeked earnestness and, by my count, nine backflips. (“Did you really just say don’t flip? What did you think this show was gonna be?” he said to a concerned audience member after his first high arc off the piano.) The same straining balladeer act that drewPitchfork derisionat Coachella won over the crowd here; former YouTuber and Rodrigo BFF Conan Gray stretched the theatrical earnestness even further with a sailor moon-themed set.Coachella 2025 highlights: a sweaty, star-packed year with thrills for all agesRead moreThe zeitgeist is an uncontrollable variable, and though its current was overall weaker this year, it still flashed in lower-billed sets that got the people going. South African siren Tyla performed Bliss for the first time live – albeit so early on Friday the adults were not yet out of work – and, as at Coachella, transfixed audiences with her sinuous dancing and micro-shorts. Mk.gee, whose guitar feats inspired dozens of “how did he do that?” videos last year, kicked off the weekend by blowing out everyone’s ear drums (complimentary) in a smoky, banter-less, virtuosic set befitting a new guitar mystic. Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Young Miko nearly stole the show Saturday, flexing her bars and Puerto Rican pride for one of the most hype sets of the weekend. “New York, is it gay here or is it just me?” she said in English, wishing everyone a happy pride month. (And later, in Spanish and to huge cheers, “Whenever I come toNew YorkI feel at home.”) British chanteuse Raye brought up the energy with her powerhouse vocals, while genre-bending Ghanaian-American singer Amaarae performed in front of clear instructions for her audience: MOSH.View image in fullscreenYoung Miko performs.Photograph: Brandon Nagy/ShutterstockIf the energy – and weather – was hit and miss, Gov Ball at least brought it home on Sunday with back-to-back sets calling to some higher power. For Oxford psychedelic-pop quartetGlass Animals, the catharsis of letting go on a dance floor, let by startlingly (and winsomely) upbeat frontman Dave Bayley; the bass drop of Tokyo Drifting into2020 smash Heat Waveskilled whatever hearing and inhibitions I had left. And for Irish headliner Hozier, the power of solidarity, underscored by 90 minutes of worshipful folk-rock and one extended speech “from the heart” on anti-colonialism, name-checking Mavis Staples, the American civil rights movement, the Irish civil rights movement and the ongoing struggle for Palestinian liberation.“Every single day, we have an opportunity to show up for not only members of our community but people around the world,” he said. “I would advise you to say no to the types of imperialism that lead to cycles of violence that we’re seeing at the moment.” The 35-year-old flattered New York as a “very special place” where he witnessed “acts of goodness, acts of solidarity” and anti-racism. One could dismiss it as pandering, but as a stranger hugged my sister and I to Hozier’s rousing Take Me to Church, and his transcendent chords blended magically with the whirr of incoming flights to LaGuardia, I found myself among the festival faithful.Explore more on these topicsMusicOlivia RodrigoDavid ByrnePop and rockRayeNew YorkTyler, the CreatorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Insomnia – not the “I woke at 3am for a bit” type, but the brutalising “I might have dropped off for a fretful 45 minutes at around 6am” kind – will do that to a person.I have rarely slept well. But this particular stretch of insomnia was, almost literally, a killer. I’d tried every snake oil on the market. A Harley Street hypnotist gave up on me after two sessions. Prescription sleeping pills stopped working. As a last resort, I tried the eight-week NHS cognitive behavioural therapy course for insomnia. It involved a tedious sleep diary, increasing “sleep pressure” by forcing myself to stay up until 2am and strengthening the “bed-sleep connection” by sacrificing my bedtime read. Far from helping, these strategies ramped up my frustration. Then I found one thing that did work – something I had dismissed as the preserve of man buns and pseudo-spiritualists: meditation.With help from an app, I started turning my maddening night-time thought loops into innocuous clouds that passed through the sky of my mind. I discovered that mentally scanning my body from head to toe while focusing on each part without judgment could ease my ever-present tension. And by noticing how thoughts vanish as quickly as they appear, I came to realise this crippling phase would eventually pass.With my cynicism on hold, I started following the standard advice of meditating during the day, rather than reaching for it as an emergency sleep aid. Nothing hardcore. A simple 10-minute bolt-on after brushing my teeth.Over time, I started dreading bedtime less, found it easier to drop off and stay asleep longer. Sometimes for as long as six hours. Horror for some. Bliss for me. So the sleep diaries got binned, but the meditation did not.The one change that worked: I started sketching – and stopped doomscrollingRead moreBy regularly stilling my mind, I was able to step back and appraise problems from a distance. “Respond, not react”, to use the correct meditation parlance. In fact, I was able to look at my entire life from a distance. This clarity helped me see that my marriage was beyond repair. Divorce soon followed, a stressful but ultimately positive process made more manageable by daily meditation. Then came the lion’s den of dating. I honestly don’t know how I would have survived dating apps without meditation apps. They helped me stay grounded, observing the chaotic thrills and rejections with detached awareness.Best of all, meditation has made me a better parent. With patience not being one of my virtues, I had a habit of snapping at my child. Throw my menopause and their teendom into the mix, and you get something more explosive than fireworks on New Year’s Eve. But meditation helps defuse things. If I let the habit slip, the tetchiness – and insomnia – creep back in.Meditation has not only calmed my mind, but also expanded it, making me more open to the things I once dismissed: vulnerability, therapy and perhaps even spiritualism. It’s been such a salve that I’m (almost) grateful to my sleepless nights for forcing it on me.Explore more on these topicsMeditationThe one change that workedSleepMental healthHealth & wellbeingParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We sometimes visited for our summer holidays in the 70s, which took at least two days by train. The pace of life there was slow.Back then it was routine to re-tin the inside of pots and pans because you couldn’t cook anything acidic in copper. Travelling kalaiwallahs, as they were called, would come around to do it every couple of months or so. At that time, the tinning of copper (kalai) was still common in India, even during my childhood. Now they’ve mostly disappeared and you only get a few left in every city as everyone is using aluminium or stainless steel.I haven’t figured out how to tin here in the UK, so for now I can only use the pot for non-acidic foods. Tamarind, tomato or lime would eat away the copper and produce a toxic compound. I use it for a typically Maharashtrian dish my grandmother used to make called bharli vangi – aubergines stuffed with a mixture of spices and ground roasted peanuts, cooked with coriander and green chilies, and so on.View image in fullscreenPriya Deshingkar’s copper pots, made in the 1920s in southern Maharashtra.Photograph: Guardian CommunityCooking with it reminds me of her and the life she lived. Despite coming from a well-to-do family, she was married at 14 and spent the best part of her youth toiling away and bringing up five children.She was a voracious reader and a thinker. Whenever she visited us in Delhi, my mother supplied her with reading material. The most common local language in Delhi is Hindi, but my grandmother read only in Marathi (the predominant language in Maharashtra), so my mother had to go to libraries and friends’ houses to find stacks of books. She got through so many that my mother got fed up, saying: “How much does this woman read?” I often think about how different my grandmother’s life might have been had she had the chance to pursue a career of her choice.View image in fullscreenPriya and her grandmother in Maharashtra in the early 60s.Photograph: Guardian CommunityAfter my grandmother died in 1975, the pot travelled to my parents’ house in Delhi, where it was until I brought it with me to the UK in the mid-1980s. The pot sits proudly in my kitchen, waiting to receive another coating of tin. I will pass it on to my daughters and hope that it continues to keep memories alive in my family.‘My mom’s Dutch oven had the seasonings of her life’Thomas Pickett,Santa Cruz in California, USView image in fullscreenThomas Pickett with his mother’s Dutch oven.Photograph: Guardian CommunityWhen my mother died in 1987, at the age of 56, it was mostly junk that she left behind. She was too busy living to accumulate anything of much value. We were left with boxes of cooking utensils, camping gear, clothes and books. We sat among the tools of her life stunned that she was gone for ever. Mom was not terribly attached to the material aspects of life; she was more attached to people, to laughter and argument. I looked over the boxes for something that would keep her memory alive for me, and lifted out her old Wagner drip-drop baster Dutch oven.When cooking, she would start by opening the pot cupboard. It usually came with a string of expletives as most of the pots fell off the shelf at once. She’d lift the Dutchy’s substantial weight on to the counter, get a cutting board, a knife and a cookbook and start chopping. She’d cook something up for anyone who was home and would open a bottle of wine and share conversation, stories and laughter.View image in fullscreenThomas Pickett (centre) and his mother, Pat Pickett (second from left), and his grandmother at dinner in 1987.Photograph: Guardian CommunityThe history of my mother’s life and her spirit was represented in that cast-iron pot. I’m a retired chef, and most cooks understand cast iron’s absorptive nature and its ability to retain an oily, non-stick finish. For me, Mom’s old Dutch oven not only had a well-oiled surface, it had the seasonings of her life.I have used it to cook decades of comfort food for my family. Our kids have left the nest and in their absence I’ve found Mom’s pot wants to travel. Sometimes more than once a week, it’s been sent full of steaming-hot food to friends’ homes. Friends with the flu, friends living alone with memories of spouses lost to old age, or struggling with cancer who might like a friendly face and a shared meal.‘I feel a connection with generations of women in my family’Riccardina Burdo, LondonView image in fullscreenRiccardina Burdo’s traditional spatula.Photograph: Guardian CommunityThe spatula, orrasaul, I use to shape orecchiette pasta was made in my home town of Andria, southern Italy, by local blacksmiths using wrought iron, a material chosen for its strength and longevity. The spatula is perfectly balanced: lightweight and easy to handle, with a rounded, non-sharp edge – ideal for shaping pasta without cutting it. This tool is essential for making orecchiette from small cylinders of pasta.View image in fullscreenRiccardina Burdo making pasta.Photograph: Guardian CommunityTherasaulis not only key to getting the right look, it is essential for the right texture that defines true orecchiette. This one belonged to my grandmother. I learned to make orecchiette as a child, sitting next to her and my mother in the kitchen. They were so good I’d even eat some of them raw.I still use it, not out of nostalgia but because it is simply irreplaceable. While many in southern Italy now use a kitchen knife, I have never stopped using this tool, which allows me to shape orecchiette just as they used to be made.View image in fullscreenRiccardina and her granddaughter shaping dough.Photograph: Guardian CommunityEvery time I hold it, I feel a direct connection with my roots and with the generations of women in my family who shaped pasta on wooden cutting boards in warm and lively kitchens.I have a three-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter and she’s already started making orecchiette with me. She’s getting the gist – and of course she’s always asking if she can eat them raw, too.‘A testament to my funny, innovative, loving dad’Jean Baxter, LeicesterWhen I got married in 1974, at the age of 19, my mum and dad gave me some things to start myself up. One of them was this plain, stainless steel dish, which my dad made. He worked for a company in Birmingham that made high-end, ornate gallery trays – but their bread and butter was the stainless steel serving dishes used by the curry and Balti restaurant trade.View image in fullscreenJean Baxter’s serving dish.Photograph: Guardian CommunityThe company had a problem with the dish’s curled rim, which would crease as it came off the jig – the tool holding components in place – creating lots of rejects. My dad redesigned the jig to make a perfect finish, and he brought home a couple of the prototypes he had made. They popped out thousands and thousands; we’d see them in Indian restaurants all the time.My dad was very clever, polishing off the Guardian cryptic crossword in less than 10 minutes most days. I’m still using his dish several times a week, 50 years and three marriages later. For me, it is a testament to my wonderfully funny, innovative, loving dad and it will be left to the grandchild who likes cooking the most.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s my contribution to the Filter so far, writingrecommendations for new cat ownersandelectric toothbrushes. Rather than combining the two in a piece on cat toothpaste, I’m instead doubling down on the latter, writing about the wonderful world ofwater flossers.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Water flossers, for those that don’t know, are exactly what they sound like. Rather than sticking a bit of dental floss or an interdental brush between your teeth and along your gums, the idea is that you can instead fire a jet of water. It’s more convenient and saves you the embarrassment of seeing what grim detritus you’ve been hoarding between your teeth each day.Are they as effective as regular flossing? “Probably not” was the consensus I got from the dental experts I spoke to, but it’s also an improvement on nothing, which is, lamentably, what most of us are doing now.“In terms of plaque removal, flossing and interdental brushes will be better,” Dr Sam Jethwa, president of the British Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, told me. “The example I give patients is a boat sitting in a dock for a long time – it’s got algae on the bottom. Get a hose pipe to try to get it off, it’s not going to do anything. You need the water, but you need the mechanical movement there.” I’m pleased to report that my mouth isn’t full of algae, and I certainly felt some benefit from my time water flossing, even if it had its limits.The cordless models look like pregnant toothbrushes – although sadly this isn’t where baby toothbrushes come from. Rather, the distended lower section is designed to be filled with between 150ml and 400ml of water that can then be fired at your unsuspecting teeth and gums.Water flosser showdownView image in fullscreenThe unsuspecting contenders for the best water flosser spot.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianAfter collecting machines from the likes of Oral-B, Panasonic, WaterPik and Philips, and lining them up along my sink like a tiny police identity parade, I set to work devising how to test a group of products that, on the surface of things, are very similar indeed.For starters, some manufacturers list water pressure in PSI, which is pounds per square inch. Others, however, don’t bother with this nerdy nonsense, leading you to guess against the ones that do.One messy (but not especially scientific, given their different heights and jet angles) test saw me firing water from them down the hallway and measuring their reach. My other half had the unenviable job of following the jets down the hallway with a towel, shouting out the measurements like a darts caller, while I tapped the figures into my somehow still dry laptop.The water tank test was far more civilised, if not as fun. This involved filling the tanks from the tap before decanting the contents back into a measuring cup to see if the declared specs were accurate. Some were a little optimistic, while others understated how much water you could get in there.Everyday flossingView image in fullscreenNot all the water flosser testing was as fun as the hallway jet competition.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianOther metrics are obvious as soon as you open the box, like how easy they are to hold and manipulate, and how many tips are supplied. The standard jet head is consistent between them all, but others are designed with orthodontics and periodontal pockets in mind.But there’s plenty that’s subjective too. For example, one model was marked down because you need to hold down a button to stop and start the water flow. That’s a very sensible design for a travel-safe flosser, saving you a suspiciously vibrating suitcase that could be detonated by overzealous airline staff, but less positive when your mouth is rapidly filling with water and you need to cut the power quickly.Mypersonal favourite model, meanwhile, isn’t the most powerful, and nor is it practical for those without much space, given it plugs directly into the bathroom mains. But its handle is light and easy to manoeuvre, and it offers 10 pressure levels to make it the most flexible of the bunch.Towards the end of my testing, I had a long-scheduled dental hygienist appointment where, for once, I could proudly say that I had not just been flossing daily, but multiple times an hour. While a psychologist could undoubtedly take issue with that, surely no dentist would?Sadly, I wasn’t asked, but nor was I given a mortifying critique on my dental hygiene. So I’m calling that a very small win, and an unspoken go-ahead to keep jet washing my teeth and gums.

Particularly if it saves you 15 minutes’ boiling and then mashing some potatoes. Bookmark this for chillier summer evenings – I’m determined to eat as many meals as possible outside right now, and this will keep you warm when the temperature dips to an unseasonal sub-15C.Harissa and gnocchi-topped fish pieUse your favourite type of fish, or add some prawns, if you like.Prep15 minCook20 minServes4250ml milk50g rose harissa– I likeBelazu100g cream cheese1tsp sea salt flakes260g sustainably-sourced cod, or other white fish, cut into roughly 3½cm chunks260g trout, cut into roughly 3½cm chunks150g frozen peas, defrosted500g gnocchi(fresh or vac-packed)20g salted butter100g cheddar, gratedPut the milk, harissa, cream cheese and salt in a large saucepan, turn on the heat and whisk until the cheese melts and is thoroughly incorporated. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a bare simmer – just the tiniest bubbles should break the surface, otherwise you’ll boil the fish. Add all the fish and leave to poach for 10 minutes. Add the peas for the last two minutes. Once cooked, the fish should very gently flake apart when cut with a fork, but still neatly hold its shape.Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to a pie dish or small roasting tin, then scoop out the peas and scatter over the top. Bring the harissa milk mix back to a boil, drop in the gnocchi and cook for two minutes. Then – and stay with me here – you’re going to hold a colander over the fish dish and pour the harissa milk through it on to the fish, leaving the gnocchi in the colander. Stir the butter through the gnocchi in the colander, then tip the gnocchi evenly over the contents of the pie dish.Turn on the grill to medium-high, scatter the cheese over the gnocchi, then grill the fish pie for three to five minutes, until the cheese is golden brown and bubbling – this may take slightly more or less time, depending on how fierce your grill is, so keep an eye on it. Serve hot with a glass of something cold alongside.Explore more on these topicsPieQuick and easyFoodMain coursePotatoesSeafoodFishVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Today’s ones are cooling, nourishing, hydrating and a little more fortifying than the usual chop-and-blitz raw soups such as gazpacho. As much as I love those, sometimes I want something I can get my teeth into; something with the satisfying chew of cold noodles, or a crunchy or herbaceous topping. These are perfect for dining al fresco, or to pour into jars and take along to a picnic.Cold fragrant coconut yoghurt soup with rice noodles and cucumbersThis silky soup (pictured top), thickened with gram flour, gets its mellowness from sweet, comforting coconut yoghurt.Prep15 minCook50 minChill4 hr+Serves4350g natural coconut yoghurt30g chickpea flour½tsp turmeric1tbsp coconut oil1tsp brown mustard seeds1 pinch of asafoetida(optional)15 fresh curry leaves4 makrut lime leaves, stems removed and discarded, leaves torn½tsp cumin seeds1 stick cinnamon, broken up1 thumb of ginger, peeled and grated2 sticks lemongrass, white parts only, finely chopped1 green chilli, finely chopped, seeds and all1 heapedtsp soft brown sugarSea salt1 cucumber, very thinly sliced250g flat, wide rice noodlesJuice of 2 limes1 long red chilli, sliced on the diagonal, seeds and allFresh corianderleaves, to garnishWhisk the yoghurt, chickpea flour and turmeric in a large bowl until smooth, then gradually beat in one and a half litres of water until there are no lumps.Heat the coconut oil in a large saucepan and, once hot, sprinkle in the mustard seeds. As soon as they pop, add the asafoetida, curry leaves and lime leaves and, once they are in turn crackling, follow with the cumin seeds and cinnamon. Saute briefly, then add the ginger, lemongrass and chillies, and cook, stirring, until fragrant. Pour in the yoghurt mix, add the sugar and season with sea salt.Cook, stirring constantly, on a medium heat until the mix comes to a boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes. Take off the heat, leave to cool, then cover and chill in the fridge for at least four hours, until very cold.Meanwhile, sprinkle the cucumber slices with a teaspoon sea salt, leave for 15 minutes, then rinse, drain and squeeze out any excess water.Soak the noodles in boiling water for five minutes (or cook them according to the packet instructions), then drain, place in ice-cold water and drain again.Divide the noodles between four bowls. Add the lime juice to the broth and mix – if it’s too thick, add a splash of water to loosen. Ladle the broth over the noodles, scatter over the cucumber, chilli and coriander, and serve.Chilled pea, green curry and Thai basil soupView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s chilled pea, green curry and Thai basil soup.This verdant soup made with sweet peas gets a spiky kick of flavour from the convenience of a ready-made curry paste, while fresh Thai basil adds vibrancy.Prep5 minCook30 minChill4 hr+Serves41tbsp coconut oil1 bunchspring onions, trimmed and finely chopped2tbsp green Thai curry paste– I use Mae Ploy500g podded fresh peas, or frozen and defrosted peas400g hot vegetable stock400ml coconut milk1 large handful Thai basil50g spinachJuice of1 juicy limeAsian microgreensor pea shoots, to garnishMelt the coconut oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat, then saute the spring onions until softened.

Take off the heat and blitz smooth using a stick blender or food processor. Leave to cool, then cover and chill in the fridge for at least four hours.Before serving, squeeze in the lime juice, then divide between four bowls, drizzle over the reserved coconut milk and garnish with microgreens or pea shoots.Cold tomato rasam with curry leaf and peanut ‘furikake’View image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s cold tomato rasam with curry leaf and peanut furikake.Be warned, this peanut furikake is highly addictive – you’ll want to sprinkle it over just about everything.Prep15 minCook1 hrChill4 hr+Serves4For the peanut furikake1tbspcoconut oil50g salted roasted peanuts, roughly chopped15 curry leaves,torn25g unsweetened desiccated coconut3tbsp sesame seeds1tsp nigella seeds1tsp brown mustard seeds2 nori sheets,crumbled and toasted1tbsp pure maple syrup¾tsp chilli powder½tsp sea saltFor the rasam5 medium tomatoes, finely chopped1bananashallot,peeled and finely chopped100g tamarind paste25g light brown soft sugar2 tbsp coconut oil or ghee1 tsp mustard seeds¼ tsp asafoetida(optional)15 fresh curry leaves1 star anise1 tsp cumin seeds2 green chillies, finely chopped, seeds and all30g piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated1 tsp ground coriander¾ tsp coarsely ground black pepper1 tsp ground turmericTo make the furikake, melt the coconut oil in a frying pan, then add the peanuts, curry leaves, coconut, sesame seeds, nigella seeds and mustard seeds, and fry over a low heat for about five minutes, until golden brown and toasty.

From Roman frigidariums to Thomas Jefferson’s foot baths, cold immersion has long been seen as curative. But does modern science support the idea that it boosts immunity?The answer: it’s complicated. While cold water immersion does activate the body, that’s not the same as strengthening the immune system. “When you immerse yourself in cold water, your body undergoes the cold shock response,” says Tipton. “You get rapid breathing, a spike in heart rate and a surge of stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol.” This may explain why people feel more alert or energised after a cold dip. But does it mean you’re less likely to get sick?Many studies into the effects focus on immune cell activity in the blood – which can increase after cold exposure – but that doesn’t always translate into fewer infections. “It’s easy to cherry-pick results,” says Tipton. He points to afrequently quoted Dutch studyin which people who ended their daily hot showers with at least 30 seconds under cold water took 29% fewer sick days. While it’s often used as an example of the powers of cold plunges, those participants actually reported the same number of infections as those who didn’t have a cold shower. “That might reflect increased resilience or just a willingness to push through because of being part of a study,” says Tipton, rather than better immunity.It may also be that regular cold plungers simply have a healthier lifestyle overall. A recent study by Tipton’s team found that indoor and outdoor swimmers had fewer respiratory infections than non-swimmers, suggesting it may be the exercise, not the cold, doing the work.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At 67 she found a new way to do itPaula CocozzaMon 9 Jun 2025 01.55 EDTShareOne sunny August evening, Jean Walters was sitting in her garden in Meltham, West Yorkshire, when the church bells began to ring. She sipped her glass of wine; the evening seemed idyllic. “A quintessential English country garden,” she thought, and posted on Facebook: “Bells ringing, how lovely!”The next day when the plumber came to fix her toilet, more prosaically, he mentioned that he had seen her post, and being a bellringer himself, gave her the number of the local church’s tower captain. “He said, ‘Come along and try it.’ I did. I loved it. I said to my husband, ‘Did you hear that single bong? That was me.’”Walters was 67 when she first climbed the tower at St Bartholomew’s in Meltham. “And I knew immediately it was something that I could develop and would be good for me.” Just before her 70th birthday, she rang her first quarter peal – nonstop ringing without a mistake for 45 minutes – and earned her badge to become a full member of the Yorkshire bellringers’ association.Walters is 80 now, and to celebrate her milestone birthday, she rang eight different “methods” – as the pattern that determines ringing position is called – one for each decade. From the start, she says, “I just loved the idea that I was making this big noise in Meltham.”Making a noise was something Walters had always done, as a lifelong singer and member of choirs, and as a primary school teacher. Initially a top soprano, she later “went down to a contralto”, but continued to sing for the Huddersfield Choral Society, auditioning every three years to keep her place. Then, a few months before she heard the bells in her garden, three decades of teaching caught up with her and her voice went. “It just packed up,” she says. “Suddenly there was this part of me missing.” She sometimes speaks with a croaky edge, but the bells have given her a different voice. “I just love the sound of bells,” she says.She first heard them aged five, from her bedroom in Tottenham, north London. Walters’ mother was a housewife and her father a waiter. Every evening at 7pm, she would be sent to bed. “And I’d hear the bells. To me it’s the sound of comfort: going to sleep in my bedroom and being secure in my house.”View image in fullscreenJean Walters: ‘It’s social … You have a laugh, a chat, you ring the bells.’Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWalters walks and gardens, but bellringing presents a different physical challenge. “You have to control your bell: stand up straight, your arms up straight, then back down. It’s a workout.” The longer the rope, the harder it is to ring. “If I’ve got a bad back, a dose of bellringing straightens it out. After ringing, I feel exhilarated.” Her favourite bell weighs 5.5 hundredweight (280kg).Walters has congenital heart disease. At 18 she was told she had a tiny hole in her heart. At 58, feeling tired, she saw a specialist who informed her: “You’ve got a grossly enlarged heart and you’ve got five holes in it.” She had open-heart surgery, lasting more than five hours. At the cardiac rehab classes,she remembers: “There were all these older people who had had triple heart bypasses. I couldn’t keep up. And I realised how unfit I was.” Ringing isn’t only a test of strength, but a proof of it.“I’ve always wanted challenges,” she says. “But you’re taught. They’re very patient, the other bellringers. You don’t have to be musical – just be able to count and have a sense of rhythm.” Learning the methods requires focus; ringing improves balance. And: “It’s social … You have a laugh, a chat, you ring the bells – and afterwards you go to the pub.“It’s a very close community. We go to other towers and help out for weddings. I can go anywhere in the world where they’ve got English bells and say, ‘Hi, I’m a qualified bellringer’ … I’ve rung bells in Dorset, Devon, Gloucestershire and all over West Yorkshire.”After singing, bellringing became for Walters “another way of expressing my joy of living”. When she can no longer do that, “I know I will discover something else”. Not that she plans to stop. “I’m aiming for 90. The thing about bellringers,” she says, “is they accept you as you are.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60HobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Toot toot!I began posting biweekly brainteasers at the end of May 2015, originally addressing you folk as “guzzlers” – Guardian puzzlers. The cringy coinage didn’t stick, but the column did, and here we are a decade and 260 columns later.Some data. Total page views are now 38 million, which averages out at about 150,000 views per puzzle – a whopping number, I’d say. Thanks to everyone for the encouragement and support.For today’s offerings I decided to go back through the archive and repost ten of my favourites. Some may be familiar, others not.Please graze, maybe even guzzle – and here’s to the next ten years!1. Bat and ballThree friends (A, B and C) are playing ping pong. They play the usual way: the winner stays on, and the loser waits their turn again. At the end of the day, they summarise the number of games that each of them played:A played 10B played 15C played 17.Who lost the second game?2.

Catch the catView image in fullscreenA straight corridor has 7 doors along one side. Behind one of the doors sits a cat. Your mission is to find the cat by opening the correct door. Each day you can open only one door. If the cat is there, you win. If the cat is not there, the door closes, and you must wait until the next day before you can open a door again.If the cat was always to sit behind the same door, you would be able to find it in at most seven days, by opening each door in turn. But this mischievous moggy is restless. Every night it moves randomly either one door to the left or one to the right. Although if it is behind the first or last door, it has only one option for where it can move.How many days do you now need tomake sure you cancatch the cat?5.

Secure Messaging is an important new technological innovation that will make it easier for people to share confidential information with us.Blowing the whistle on wrongdoing has always taken bravery. Asthreats to journalists around the worldincrease, so does the need to protect confidential sources. One of the most dramatic global shifts against whistleblower safety comes as part of the Trump administration’scontinued assault on the free press.Investigative reporting is extremely important to the Guardian; we have been exposing wrongdoing and scrutinising power with complete independence for decades. We know first-hand how impactful investigations depend on trusted reader-reporter interactions. From theFrank Hester revelationsto thePegasus project,Uber files,Pandora papersand theMichelle Mone/PPE Medproscandal, many of our most powerful recent investigative projects – as well asour biggest stories throughout the decades– have relied on sources feeling confident they can safely share information with the Guardian or ourreporting partners. Secure Messaging is the latest tool in our armoury to protect whistleblowers.Built by our product and engineering team, in partnership with theUniversity of Cambridge’s department of computer science ​and technology​, Secure Messaging is unlike traditional information-sharing platforms​. The technology behind Secure Messaging conceals the fact that messaging is taking place at all by making the communication indistinguishable from other data sent to and from the app by our millions of regular users. By using the Guardian app, other users are effectively providing “cover” and helping us to protect sources.Secure Messaging is not just a tool for the Guardian. As part of our commitment to protecting the media and the public interest globally, the Guardian has published thesource codefor the technology that enables this system. This means that other organisations will be able to use this technology freely to implement secure messaging tools within their own apps.If you have any information to share with us, you can use Secure Messaging within theGuardian appby clicking on the app menu and scrolling to “Secure Messaging”.

But while Elisabeth Ribbans is right that “it would be a mistake to regard language as a fortress”, it is not unreasonable to lament the effect of some invasive species whose proliferation is so rapid that native alternatives face possible extinction (How the use of a word in the Guardian has gotten some readers upset, 4 June).“Gotten” may be an innocuous, if inelegant, English word making a return journey from the US, but some other US variants are more problematic. For example, the phrase “Can I get …?” is suffocating more polite ways of making a request, such as “May I/can I have …?” or simply “I’d like …”. It is also annoyingly inaccurate, since in most cases the person asking has no intention of helping themselves and wouldn’t be allowed to, even if they wanted to.But wholesale adoption not only leads to neglect of alternatives, it can also produce banality. So when both a sandwich and a sunset might today be described as “awesome”, it is reasonable to imagine that even as eclectic a wordsmith as Shakespeare might consider modern English borrowings as diminishing the language through having gotten lazy.Paul McGilchristCromer, NorfolkThank you, Elisabeth Ribbans, for your article on the cosmopolitan and evolving use of words in the English language. I am always stung by the snobbery I encounter among my British peers regarding American words or spellings. Criticism of American accents more so. My country of origin provokes pride and shame in increasingly equal measure, but to be cowed because of my voice, both written and spoken, leaves a foul taste. Once we’ve gotten past this distasteful persnicketiness, we can actually appreciate the meaning of the words being used, not just their spelling.Dr Amy FultonOxton, Scottish BordersI grew up in the old West Riding, only a few miles from the county border with Lancashire. In the early 1950s, we regularly used the word “gotten”. It was frowned on by teachers and others addicted to standard English. I believe the use of the word was common in other districts of Yorkshire. It is an English and not an American word, which has sadly passed out of use. Language evolves!Roderick WilsonAmpleforth, North YorkshireWhen I worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, in the 1980s, my friendly editor had more appreciation of British irony than spelling. She once wrote on a draft paper: “Richard. Please pick one spelling of ‘practice’ and stick to it.”Richard LammingShaldon, DevonAm I alone in finding “shined” for “shone” less than illuminating?

Universities are already in crisis due to a complex web of problems including the commodification of education. Now, I spend much of my time suspecting students of using AI to write essays and even – we increasingly think – to write music. Not being able to definitively prove it renders us powerless.I would estimate that a good half of the written work I see has had some AI input. I genuinely think some of these students don’t realise that it’s cheating. And it’s happened so fast that we don’t even know what to tell our students about these tools. Used properly they are useful, but academics have no idea how to do this.There is now the bizarre reality that work can be written by AI and marked by AI – a truly hellish scenario for the human intellect. Increasingly, academics are realising that in-person exams are going to have to be reintroduced. I would support this, and many others would too.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I’m not one of them, 4 June). As it stands, the bill has major flaws and is a long way from achieving a win-win for nature and development. Environmentalists engaged around the bill in good faith, but, when published, it was clear it was missing the safeguards needed – and the government’s own independent adviser, the Office for Environmental Protection, agrees.The bill does not set out a responsibility to avoid harm to nature and communities wherever possible. We need such a duty to drive development that takes the best route for people and nature, not the low-quality option. We need the proposed Nature Restoration Fund to provide guaranteed results, with evidence to back this up. Without such guarantees the scheme allows destruction of nature on a wing and a prayer that it will effectively be restored elsewhere. Ensuring certainty of outcomes and robust protections are not just vital for nature, they are good lawmaking.Our job is to defend nature, so we must challenge these major protection gaps now and champion the changes that are needed. If not, the whole country will pay the price for a flawed system in future, with increased nature loss, greater pollution and less healthy communities. It makes economic sense too, with nature degradation estimated to lead to a 12% decrease in GDP in coming years.We know the system can work better – it is possible to create a planning system that works hand in hand to deliver wildlife recovery at scale, and the new homes we need. The nature sector has always been, and remains willing, to come to the table with the government to achieve the win-win we all want.Craig BennettCEO,theWildlifeTrusts,Beccy SpeightCEO, RSPB,Harry BowellDirector of land and nature, National Trust,Ali PlummerDirector of policy and advocacy, Wildlife and Countryside LinkExplore more on these topicsPlanning policyWildlifeHousingCommunitiesCharitieslettersShareReuse this content"

Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.Germany, France andBelgiumwill also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.View image in fullscreenPeople walk across a flooded road in Masiphumelele, a township in Western Cape, South Africa.Photograph: Nic Bothma/ReutersMeanwhile,South Africais in the grip of a powerful storm system that has triggered alerts for severe weather nationwide. Over the weekend, Western Cape and Northern Cape bore the brunt of the system. As the week progresses, the storm is likely to intensify and move eastwards, bringing extreme weather to central and eastern regions.The conditions are driving a significant drop in temperature, with daytime highs in some areas plummeting to more than 7C below the seasonal average. Gusty winds are making it feel even more frigid.Heavy rain has also been hammering Eastern Cape, with coastal areas expected to be hit by more than 100mm on Monday, potentially causing floods. Strong winds sweeping across the region are expected to strengthen to about 60mph (100km/h) on Monday, exacerbating the impact of the storm. Snowfall is also expected, with significant accumulations likely to cause widespread travel disruption and infrastructure challenges.The intense weather is the result of a strong cut-off low system, which occurs when a low-pressure area becomes detached from the main jet stream. This allows cold, dry air to descend from higher altitudes and combine with moisture at the surface to produce the volatile mix of rain, wind and snow that has been battering swaths of the country.South African authorities are urging residents to stay alert, limit travel and monitor official weather updates over the coming days.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerEuropeGermanyFranceBelgiumSouth AfricaAfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

He has reportedly shown little response to medical interventions and, according to his wife, needs “a miracle” to survive.On Monday, President Gustavo Petro called for an investigation into the sudden reduction of the security team, posting on social media: “I must now report that the protection scheme for Senator Uribe was reduced, strangely, on the day of the attack, from seven to three people.”Uribe’s lawyer Victor Mosquera said he had filed a criminal complaint against the protection unit in charge of security for high-profile and at-risk personalities, alleging that he had made more than 20 requests for increased security this year alone.Uribe, a 39-year-old senator from the opposition Centro Democrático party, is running to join next year’s presidential race. Footage from the attack showed him speaking to a small crowd in a park, before shots rang out. Uribe was then pictured slumped against the bonnet of a blood-stained white car.Shot Colombian presidential candidate survives emergency surgeryRead moreUribe underwent major surgery over the weekend, which was initially deemed a success, but early on Monday the hospital said he had shown “little response to the medical interventions”.“His condition is extremely serious,” medical director Adolfo Llinás Volpesaid.His wife, María Claudia Tarazona, asked for prayers on Monday morning and said “Miguel needs a miracle”.The 15-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene minutes after the attack, during which he reportedlyshouted: “I did it for money for my family.”Police on Monday revealed that the 9mm pistol the suspect was carrying had beenpurchased legally in Arizonain 2020.The suspect was also injured during the attack and so has yet to be questioned; a security cordon has been set up around the hospital where he is undergoing treatment. He is expected to be charged with attempted murder and illegal possession of a weapon.Uribe hails from one of Colombia’s most prominent political families; he is the grandson of former president Julio César Turbay Ayala (1978-82) and the son of journalist Diana Turbay, who was kidnapped by Pablo Escobar’s Medellín cartel and killed during a botched rescue operation in 1991.A Harvard graduate, former Bogotá city councillor and outspoken critic of president Gustavo Petro, Uribe last year announced his presidential bid from the spot where his mother was killed. “I could have grown up seeking revenge, but I decided to do the right thing: forgive, but never forget,” he said.Petro condemned Saturday’s attack and said “we cannot rule out any hypothesis”. Criminal groups in Colombia have often used minors to carry out killings.Colombia’s defence minister has offered a 3bn peso (£540,000) reward for information leading to the identification and capture of those responsible for the attack, while the government has ordered increased security for all presidential candidates.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The government said at the time the decision was based on studies that had more precisely demarcated areas with “real patrimonial value”.The remote Nazca region located roughly 400km (250 miles) south of Lima contains hundreds of pre-Hispanic artefacts and its plateau is famous for the Nazca Lines, where more than 800 giant desert etchings of animals, plants and geometric figures were created more than 1,500 years ago. Unesco declared them a World Heritage site in 1994.Archaeologists use AI to discover 303 unknown geoglyphs near Nazca LinesRead moreA technical panel of government representatives, archaeologists, academics and members of international organisations, including Unesco, will work together to build consensus on a future proposal for zoning and land use in the area, the culture ministry’s statement said.Critics of the proposed change had said it would weaken decades of environmental protection and open up the Nazca Archaeological Reserve toinformal and illegal mining, just as international gold prices peak.According to figures from the Peruvian ministry of energy and mines, 362 small-scale gold miners operate in the Nazca district under a program to regularize their status. Authorities have previously conducted operations against illegal mining in the area.Luis Jaime Castillo, a former culture minister and an archaeologist who has studied the geoglyphs, said the protected area was already “infested with illegal mining and mineral processing plants”.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasArchaeologyMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

For years, Canada has been viewed as a defence loafer and successive prime ministers have failed to bring the country’s commitments in line with allies. A recent Nato report found that Canada spent an estimated 1.45% of its GDP on defence last year.The prime minister pledged to divert billions in spending to domestic manufacturers, warning his country had become “too reliant on the United States” for its defence capabilities.Canadian military flies the flag in frozen north as struggle for the Arctic heats upRead more“The long-held view that Canada’s geographic location will protect us is becoming increasingly archaic. Threats which felt far away and remote are now immediate and acute,” said Carney, pointing to “Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine” and threats to Canada’s sovereignty not only from Moscow but also from “an increasingly assertive China”.The announcements, staggered throughout Monday, come as Canada prepares to host the G7 summit next week in Kananaskis, Alberta.Against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, defence spending will be a focus at theNatosummit in The Hague at the end of June. The secretary general, Mark Rutte, has already indicated he wants an increase to 3.5% for core defence spending and 1.5% in defence-related investments such as infrastructure.In recent months, Canadian military officials and politicianshave shifted focus to the Arctic, warning of Canada’sdeep vulnerabilities in a rapidly changing– and highly coveted – region of the planet.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Canadian navy test a diesel-powered drone meant to withstand harsh Arctic conditions.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The ObserverBut the renewed focus has also revealed the limits of Canada’s ageing fleets.“Only one of our four submarines is seaworthy,” said Carney “Less than half of our maritime fleet and land vehicles are operational.”In the past, Canada turned to the United States to source its military hardware. But in his speech the prime minister acknowledged that while the US had become Canada’s closest ally and dominant trading partner, Donald Trump’s protectionist tariffs and threats to Canadian sovereignty had cast a shadow over the future of that relationship.“Now the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,” he said.Ahead of Canada’s spring federal election, there was spirited debate in the country over whether to cancel a multibillion-dollar order for the US-built F-35 stealth fighter.Canada has committed to buy 16 of the jets from Lockheed Martin at a cost of nearly US$85m each. But revelations that the US would control all F-35 software updates andown all of the spare partshas once again revived arguments for diversifying procurement to more reliable allies.“We will ensure every dollar is invested wisely, including by prioritizing made-in-Canada manufacturing and supply chains,” said Carney. “We should no longer send three-quarters of our defence capital spending to America.”In recent weeks, Carney and Trump have held private, high-level talks as Canada looks to end a trade war instigated by the US.View image in fullscreenA soldier works to repair a Chinook transport helicopter.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianTimothy Sayle, a professor of history at the University of Toronto, says Carney will have a “very difficult needle to thread” in balancing the rhetoric of Canada being able to act independently and the realities of its longstanding defence partnerships with the United States.“The world is an increasingly dangerous place. And Canada’s been under pressure from Nato and the European allies to do more. But how much of this announcement is a result of pressure coming from the United States?” said Sayle. “I suspect that the importance of the relationship with the president played a role in this being a larger and quicker announcement than we might have thought.”Carney’s announcement, which requires billions in new spending, shows “political will matters”, said Sayle – although he warned that previous governments have made similar announcements.“We know that Canada has struggled with defence procurement in the past. Where is the money [for the investment[ going to come from? What does this mean for taxes? But there’s also been broader feeling in Canada that it was necessary to do something – and to do something quickly.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMark CarneyNatonewsShareReuse this content"

He said the infections could have been prevented through routine vaccination.Congenital measles, which refers to cases in which a child is born already infected with the highly contagious disease, can produce inflammation of the brain and in some cases, death.A huge outbreak has made Ontario the measles centre of the western hemisphereRead moreCanada achieved “elimination status” for measles in 1998, meaning the virus is no longer circulating regularly. But the scale of the outbreak in Ontario could overturn that achievement.Since October, Canada’s most populous province has reported more than 2,000 cases – more than all of those in theUnited States combined in 2025.Public health figures show cases continue to climb despite efforts to quell the rise. Last week, the outbreak reached a grim milestone after the province recorded its first fatality. Moore told the media apremature baby, who contracted measles in utero, died from medical complications, including the presence of the virus.“It’s only a very small subgroup of people who have chosen not to get vaccinated who are having the complications,” he said on Friday.While the vaccine is not recommended once a person is pregnant – in part because it contains a live virus that could be passed on to the fetus – public health groups recommend unvaccinated pregnant people get one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin if they are exposed to measles.“Some people, if they don’t want a vaccine, they may not want the immunoglobulin either. That may be a philosophical choice,” he said.Moore said that Canada’s high levels of vaccination had nonetheless blunted what could be a far worse outbreak, giving large swaths of the population protection against the virus.“I know some will concentrate on the glass being half-empty. You know, to have that level of protection in the face of the risks globally, I think is quite an accomplishment.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMMRAmericasHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Chang refused to give details of the operation, telling reporters that “the more we talk about it, the less likely we are to find” those responsible, adding: “In fact, too much information [has] already gone out.”Jason McKay, a criminologist, said that Jamaica – which is already battling highhomicide rateslinked togun trafficking from the US– should be treating the discovery of “enough guns to fight a government” as a crisis.“You could literally arm a small army with that. At this point in time, our sovereignty is in question,” he said. “That much guns and ammunition falling into any environment could cause mayhem. If you were to drop that much guns and ammunition into London, you could change the culture of London crime. So it has to be looked at as a crisis.”The government has hailed the gun find as a product of a 50bn Jamaican dollars (£231m) investment in security and efforts to tackle organised crime.Andrew Holness, Jamaica’s prime minister, told reporters it was the result of improvements in resources for the Jamaica Customs Agency, improved partnerships with international partners and “significant investment” in scanning technology.Holness also avoided details, saying the weapons had been discovered with scanning technology and predicting that increased interdiction would reduce the supply of guns in Jamaica. “The investigations are ongoing, and I am certain that our security forces will track down, along with our international partners, those who were responsible for this,” he said.Last year the New York attorney general,Letitia James, announced new measures and legislation to tackle gun trafficking from the US to the Caribbean. James quoted Jamaican government estimates that at least 200 guns are trafficked into the country from the US every month, and said that the weapons are fuelling violent crime and enabling networks that traffic drugs to the US.The Jamaican government also pointed to a historic 43% drop in murders since last year. “That means we have a reduction of … [about] 210 murders compared to the period last year, that is, January to May. This is the lowest rate of homicide in the island since 1991,” Chang told reporters.Kamina Johnson Smith, the foreign minister, said the strong crime reduction trend has resulted in the US upgrading Jamaica’s travel advisory fromlevel three, which urges travellers to “reconsider your travel to the destination due to serious risks to safety and security”. Jamaica’s advisory, she said, is now at level two – the same as “much larger and more developed countries” such as Spain and the UK.“This improvement is a timely acknowledgment of Jamaica’s continued progress in enhancing public safety, as well as the travel experience for visitors,” she added.However, while McKay has lauded the “amazing” reduction in crime, he has called for “extreme measures” to deal with the rising number of guns being trafficked. He said: “Of course, the police are doing their best to recover them, but if they’re going to come in at this rate, then it’s not going to be quantifiable. You have to do something drastic at this point.”The criminologist said that capital punishment should be considered. “Jail time isn’t enough for somebody who’s importing 220 guns. It’s more than them just endangering one person’s life or two [people’s lives]; they’re endangering the entire society’s life in Jamaica,” he said.This article was amended on 9 June 2025. An earlier version said that the government has hailed the gun find as a product of a $50bn (£37bn) investment in efforts to tackle organised crime. However, this figure should have been 50bn Jamaican dollars or £231m.Explore more on these topicsJamaicaUS crimeAmericasGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, experts from the Nippon Foundation and Tokyo University said about 200m tonnes of manganese nodules rich in rare metals existed on the seabed near the island.No civilians live on Minamitori, located about 1,900km south-east of Tokyo, but it hosts a small number of personnel from the meteorological agency, the self-defence forces and the coast guard.Saturday’s incident was the latest in a series of incursions by Chinese vessels into Japanese waters. Last month, the Liaoning sailed between two southern islands inside a different region of Japan’s EEZ. In September last year the same carrier group sailed betweenYonaguniand Iriomote – two Japanese islands nearTaiwan– and entered Japan’s contiguous waters, an area up to 24 nautical miles from its coast.Japan’s government condemned the move at the time as “unacceptable” and voiced “serious concerns” to Beijing.Explore more on these topicsJapanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said that Nato “is demonstrating itself as an instrument of aggression and confrontation” with the emerging plan.Western military planners believe Russia will seek to retain an active and experienced army of more than 600,000 personnel as well as maintaining defence spending of about 6.5% of the country’s GDP, and be able to threaten Nato’s eastern flank in less than half a decade.On his trip to the UK, Rutte visited Sheffield Forgemasters, a nationalised steelmaker owned by the Ministry of Defence that makes complex components for nuclear submarines, before meeting Starmer and then giving his speech.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer (left) with Mark Rutte in Downing Street.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockThe former Dutch prime ministerhas been pushing a proposalfor Nato members to agree to lift core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by about 2035, along with a further 1.5% on cyber and other related military infrastructure.Britain is expected to sign up to the plan, to be formally confirmed at the summit, as part of an effort to maintain the support of the US president, Donald Trump, who has pressed for the 5% target.Rutte would not set a concrete date for achieving the target – demonstrating it was still a subject of negotiation among allies – though he initially proposed 2032. Other countries, including the UK, have indicated they expect to settle on 2035. “These discussions are ongoing,” Rutte said.Justifying the need for extra spending, Rutte said Nato needed “a 400% increase in air and missile defence” as part of a wider rearmament to maintain credible deterrence and defence. “We see in Ukraine how Russia delivers terror from above, so we will strengthen the shield that protects our skies,” Rutte said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But a week ago, Starmer acknowledged that discussions about Nato’s future military needs were also taking place. “There are discussions about what the contribution should be going into the Nato conference in two or three weeks’ time,” the prime minister said as he unveiled the UK’s strategic defence review, part of a wider conversation about “what sort of Nato will be capable of being as effective in the future”.Russia said the threat was being exaggerated and that ordinary citizens would have to bear the cost. “European taxpayers will spend their money to defuse some threat that they say comes from our country, but it is nothing but an ephemeral threat,” Peskov said.Rutte was expected to welcome theUK’s strategic defence review. The document said Britain faced “a new era of threat” and that in order to deter Russia the UK had to become, in the words of Starmer, “battle-ready”.Last week, one of the three members of the defence review team, the foreign policy expert Fiona Hill, said the UK needed to recognise that Russia considered itself at war with Britain and that the US under Trump was no longer a reliable ally. “We’re in pretty big trouble,” Hill said in aninterview with the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsNatoRussiaDefence policyUkraineVladimir PutinEuropeForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Guterres also stressed the importance of multilateralism and warned, in an apparent swipe at the US, which was not present at the conference: “The deep sea cannot become the wild west.”“We live in an age of turmoil, but the resolve I see here gives me hope,” Guterres told the summit in Nice. “Hope that we can turn the tide. Hope that we can move from plunder to protection.”His words drew applause from the audience, among them 60 world leaders, including the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and his Argentine counterpart,Javier Milei, heads of small island developing states as well as ministers, policymakers, scientists and civil society activists.The conference, which seeks to finally get the high seas treaty in place, comes against a backdrop of increasing competition for ocean resources. In April, Donald Trump moved tofast-track deep-sea mining under US law,sidestepping international efforts to regulate the industry. His actions have lent urgency to the voices of those calling for a moratorium, amid warnings it will cause irreversible damage to vulnerable ecosystems.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, began his address with an urgent call to “revitalise multilateralism behind the UN secretary general” in order to save oceans.“While the Earth is burning, the ocean is boiling,” warned Macron. He said that working together to “mobilise all actors, heads of state and governments speaking here but also scientists” was the only way to tackle the crisis.Macron told leaders it was a “necessity” for nations to impose a suspension on deep-sea mining. “It’s madness to launch predatory economic action that will disrupt the deep seabed, disrupt biodiversity, destroy it … The moratorium on deep seabed exploitation is an international necessity.”So far 37 countries have announced their support for a moratorium or pause, and in July the International Seabed Authority will meet to discuss a global mining code.Macron said the high seas treaty “will be properly implemented” as he expects the crucial threshold of 60 ratifying countries to be reached. He did not specify a timeline.The high seas lie outside national boundaries, where fragmented and loosely enforced rules have so far meant the vast area is essentially lawless.Getting 60 countries to ratify the agreement, which in itself took 20 years to negotiate, was a crucial goal forFranceand Macron at the summit.“In addition to the 50 ratifications already submitted here in the last few hours, 15 countries have formally committed to joining them,” Macron said.The High Seas Alliance NGO confirmed 18 new ratifications on Monday evening, bringing the total to 49. A further 11 would be ready to sign “in a matter of weeks”, they said, making it possible the treaty could come into force this year.The treaty, signed in 2023, will enter into force 120 days after the 60th ratification. The treaty is crucial to meet a globally agreed biodiversity target of protecting 30% of the oceans by 2030,known as “30x30”. But so too, is increased protection of national waters.The French president has been criticised for doing less than others to meet this goal, by failing to ban bottom trawling in “protected” areas. On Sunday, France announced it would “limit” bottom trawling and seek to protect 4% of its metropolitan waters.Nicolas Fournier, campaign director at Oceana, said: “These announcements bring more questions than answers. President Macron built expectations that the French government would finally act against bottom trawling in marine protected areas – yet these announcements are more symbolic than impactful.”The UK said on Sunday it would ban bottom trawling in half of its protected marine areas.Just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive activities, according to the Marine Conservation Institute.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentSeascape: the state of our oceansOceansAntónio GuterresEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropeUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is important that we support both teachers and young people so that these topics can be discussed.”In the Netherlands, the series is being used in secondary schools after a proposal from the GreenLeft-Labour MP Barbara Kathmann, with materials on social media influencers and peer pressure developed in conjunction with Netflix by a media studies institute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ballet’s owner, Jean-Pierre Gasquet, has waived his fee.Originally a French ballet by Jean Dauberval, Ashton’s choreography, first staged in1960, turned La Fille mal gardée into one of the best-loved English ballets, featuring slapstick humour, a maypole and traditional folk dance.The Ukrainian government hasasked cultural institutions in the country and abroad to boycottballet productions by Russian composers and choreographers on the grounds that Vladimir Putin is seeking to use culture “as a weapon” and justification for the war.The artistic director of ballet at the National Opera of Ukraine, Nobuhiro Terada, said the issue was sensitive, but that the turning point had come when dancers at the Donetsk Opera and Ballet theatre in Russian-occupied Ukraine performed the shape of a Z, a pro-war symbol, in the autumn of 2022.“After that, Putin claimed that Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, Stravinsky, all of them, belong to the Russian world and Russian people,” he said.View image in fullscreenDancers from the Kyiv national opera and ballet during a rehearsal of La Fille mal gardée.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“After this story, the minister of culture of Ukraine at that moment, said ‘no more’. Politics and culture are different things. But at that moment, there were a lot of victims of this war, and we realised relatives of these victims, they don’t want to hear Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and Prokofiev.“It’s a very sensitive question. I’m not a politician, I have to accept an opinion of Ukrainian people. Tchaikovsky, he was in Kyiv, he lived in Kyiv, and Prokofiev was even born in Donetsk.“Of course, we want to perform Tchaikovsky and a lot of performers they want it, and it needs to happen for the next generation, in my opinion. But today it’s not a good time to perform.”The boycott is controversial even among the cast of the La Fille mal gardée, which tells the story of a young woman named Lise who is determined to be with a young farmer rather than her mother’s choice of dim-witted Alain, the son of a wealthy landowner.View image in fullscreenDaniil Silkin, who plays Alain, worked as a combat medic.Photograph: Daniil SilkinDaniil Silkin, 29, worked as a combat medic in the Ukrainian army for the first 18 months of the war but will perform as Alain in the production thanks to a time-limited exemption on service for performers.He said he did not agree with the boycott of the seminal works, which he described as a “big part of world ballet”.“I don’t think the Ukrainian government was right,” he said. “I think they should say to the people that Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and Prokofiev do not belong to Putin. They were of a very different time.”Andrianna Shabaeva, 20, whose role is as one of the friends of the main female character, said she had not had the opportunity to perform the Russian classics because of the full-scale invasion three years ago.“Maybe one day. But not before the Russians go away,” she said.Terada, who came to live permanently in Ukraine without his parents in 1986 as an 11-year-old boy as part of a cultural exchange between ballet schools in Japan and the Soviet Union, said the boycott of Russian works had forced the opera house to look more widely for productions.With international assistance, it has since performed 5 Tango’s by the Dutch choreographer Hans van Manen, Spring and Fall by John Neumeier and Alexei Ratmansky’s Wartime elegy.Terada, who was appointed director in 2022, said: “Before the war, we didn’t have any opportunity to work with these famous names. They decided to help Ukraine and National theatre and ballet because of war.The Reckoning review – shattering stories of invasion in UkraineRead more“And thanks to Ivan Putrov and the other sponsors, we’ve got this production, La Fille mal gardée. It was impossible to get the choreography of Frederick Ashton. You need to pay. That is the reason that this Ukrainian theatre during last 50 years have had the same productions: Swan Lake, Nutcracker, Spartacus.“I clearly understand – it’s not popular, what I’m going to say – but when war is happening, we need to use this opportunity and to get the best from the world, because all world is going to help Ukraine.”The audience in Kyiv will have access to the coat room as a shelter during Russian air raids, but other inconveniences of putting on a show during a war are more difficult to overcome.Putrov, whoseDance for Ukraineevent in London has helped finance the new production, said: “I think it was 60 men who were called up from the stage crew. I think they only have 19 left.“La Fille mal gardée is a beautiful blockbuster, a classic that is sunny, that is the most English of the ballets, with a grand dame, pantomime, maypole, clog dance. It will lift the spirits. What are Ukrainians fighting for? They’re fighting for the way of life they want to live, and it’s very important that the spirit is sustained.”Explore more on these topicsBalletUkraineRussiaDanceEuropePyotr TchaikovskyIgor StravinskynewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s military declined to comment.In 2010,nine activists were killedwhen Israeli commandos raided a small fleet of ships trying to take supplies including building materials to Gaza. Israel began blockading Gaza in 2007.Among the last communications from the Madleen before it lost communications was a photo showing the 12-strong crew gathered in a circle, wearing lifejackets, with their hands in the air. A series of pre-recorded messages from crew members were later released online.“If you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters,” Thunberg said in a brief message, urging family, friends and supporters to put pressure on the Swedish government to secure her release as soon as possible.View image in fullscreenThe Madleen approaches Ashdod port in Israel after being taken over by the Israeli army.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersThe UK-flagged Madleen set sail at a time of mounting international pressure on Israel over the starvation of Palestinians inside Gaza.In an apparent response to the huge amount of publicity generated by the group, Israel’s foreign ministry attacked the crew as “celebrities” on a “selfie yacht” when it announced the yacht had been seized. Shortly afterwards it followed up by posting an image of Thunberg being offered food and others being passed food and water.Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, made personal attacks on Thunberg and the rest of the crew in a post on X, and said they would be required to watch a film about the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, which launched the war. About 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 250 taken to Gaza, where 55 are still held hostage.Israeli bombings and ground assaults in Gaza since then have killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, the majority of them women, children and elderly people, and injured more than 125,000, according to health authorities in the territory, whose figures have proved accurate in past conflicts.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli soldier offers food to Greta Thunberg onboard the Madleen.Photograph: Israel Foreign Ministry/X/ReutersHuwaida Arraf, a human rights attorney and Freedom Flotilla organiser, said Israel had no legal authority to detain the Madleen crew in international waters and confiscate aid onboard, which included food, baby formula and medical supplies.“This seizure blatantly violates international law and defies the ICJ’s binding orders requiring unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza. These volunteers are not subject to Israeli jurisdiction and cannot be criminalised for delivering aid or challenging an illegal blockade – their detention is arbitrary, unlawful, and must end immediately.”The UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in occupiedPalestinian territoriescalled for the UK to secure the release of the Madleen and its crew and urged others to challenge the blockade.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli soldier passes water to those onboard the Gaza-bound British-flagged yacht.Photograph: Israel Foreign Ministry/X/Reuters“Every Mediterranean port should send boats with aid, solidarity, and humanity to Gaza,” Francesca Albanese posted on X. “Breaking the siege is a legal duty for states, and a moral imperative for all of us.”Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been forced to flee their homes and displaced multiple times since the war began, and last month food security experts warned the territory was at “critical risk of famine”.Israel says food is reaching people in Gaza through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a secretive group the current head of which isan evangelical Christianwith no track record delivering aid in conflict zones.The Israeli foreign ministry said in posts about its seizure of the Madleen that “close to” 11m meals had been delivered in the past two weeks. Even if those supplies were distributed equally, they would amount to less than one meal every two days for Gaza’s starving population.The shortages and desperate hunger have combined to deadly effect, with Palestinians repeatedly killed by Israeli forces trying to reach GHF distribution points.In the latest incidents on Sunday, at least four people were killed and many others injured, health authorities in Gaza said. The humanitarian group Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said one of the dead and 13 injured were brought to its emergency room in centralal-Mawasi in Khan Younis, Gaza.MSF said in a statement: “Patients, all men aged between 17 and 30 years old, told us they were shot in Shakoush area, on their way to a food distribution site … They were carried in donkey carts, on bicycles, or on foot.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesGreta ThunbergAidnewsShareReuse this content"

He added evidence would be released shortly, and implied some of the documentation was linked to Israel’s arrest of two Israeli nationals, Roi Mizrahi and Almog Attias, over alleged spying for Iran.Even within Iran there is scepticism that Iranian agents could have obtained such dramatic intelligence. The claim may be designed to warn off Israel from acting on its repeated threat to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites since Iranian insight into Israel’s own nuclear programme would increase the risk of effective Iranian reprisals.European powers are preparing to press for a vote at the 35-member quarterly board meeting of the nuclear inspectorate of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, which starts on Monday, that could lead to the reimposition of UN sanctions in October. France, Germany and the UK will cite a 20-page comprehensive report commissioned from the IAEA secretariat on Iran’s failure to comply with the nuclear deal agreed in 2015, and Tehran’s years-long failure to answer questions about aspects of its previous nuclear programme.Members of the IAEA board will be asked to study a report showing Iran has enriched 400kg of uranium to a purity of 60%, close to weapons-grade, and judged to be enough to make 10 nuclear bombs. Moreover, the Iranian stockpile of uranium has increased by 50% since the last report in March. Rafael Grossi, director general of the IAEA, said the report showed that Iran had not provided answers about a previous structured nuclear programme, and evidence existed that three sites were sanitised to mislead the IAEA inspectors.The three leading European powers will cite the report in calling for a motion declaring Iran is in violation of its safeguards obligations, the first such finding since 2005, and the necessary precursor to reimposing UN sanctions in October when the 2015 deal expires. Due to the way that deal was framed, Russia and China cannot veto the reimposition of UN sanctions.Iran has already threatened countermeasures if the IAEA board says it is in breach, likely to include a further cutback to access by UN weapons inspectors, and a further speeding up of enrichment. Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesperson for Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said that since the last time the IAEA board censured Tehran Iran had increased 60% enriched uranium production sevenfold and launched 20 cascades of advanced centrifuges.If the motion is passed, the French, Germans, and British then have until 18 October to determine whether they wish to reimpose the sanctions provided for in the 2015 deal. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has warned: “Falsely accusing Iran of violating safeguards – based on shoddy and politicised reporting – is clearly designed to produce a crisis. Mark my words, as Europe ponders another major strategic mistake, Iran will react strongly against any violation of its rights. Blame lies solely and fully with irresponsible actors who stop at nothing to gain relevance.”The US and Iran have yet to name a new date for the resumption of bilateral talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, focused on whether Iran should be permitted continue to enrich uranium domestically, an issue that Iran sees as central to its sovereignty. The US, in public at least, insists enrichment must stop altogether as the only sure way of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb.Donald Trump has shown a surprising willingness to cut a deal with Iran, despite in 2018 taking the US out of the nuclear agreement that was reached with Iran by Barack Obama. The US president has reportedly set a 60-day deadline for the talks, which expires on 11 June, and has accused Iran of slow-walking the process. Iran said on Monday it would respond shortly to the US proposal while Trump is expected to speak to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.Grossi said he believed both the US and Iran were sincere in seeking to seal a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has offered to act as an intermediary, and Russia could be the destination for Iran’s growing stockpile of uranium if an agreement was reached. One proposal is for Iran to suspend its enrichment programme temporarily, something it did before in 2004-05.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranMiddle East and north AfricaIran nuclear dealUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shukla said he hoped to “ignite the curiosity of an entire generation in my country”.India’s department of space has called the trip a “defining chapter” in itsambitious space exploration programme. The International Space Station mission (ISS) “stands as a symbol of a confident, forward-looking nation ready to reclaim its place in the global space race”, the agency said before the launch. “His journey is more than just a flight – it’s a signal that India is stepping boldly into a new era of space exploration.”New Delhi has paid more than $60m for the mission, according to Indian media reports.0:43India launches space mission to the sun – videoThe prime minister, Narendra Modi, has announced plans to send a person to the moon by 2040.

This is just the start for a new chapter for the West of England. As well as helping people have a great time over the summer, our first steps on transport should help inspire the next generation of bus passengers.”Bath Bus Company, First Bus and Stagecoach were part of the announcement, which featured one of the hundreds of new zero-emission electric buses to be rolled out in the region over the coming months and years.Raya, the head girl at the primary school Perry Court E-Act academy in Hengrove, Bristol, said: “I don’t live that close to my friends – so I will be able to meet up with them more often. Also, I can go into town and get stuff for secondary school in September.”Cyrus, the head boy at the school, said: “This is really helpful as I have a lot of brothers and sisters, but it costs a lot to use the bus – so my mum will find this really helpful. My grandad can use his bus pass, and I can go with him for free into town.”It was announced last week that West of England would receive £752m of transport funding for improved buses, more trains, and to explore mass transit in the region. Criticsarguedthat the West of England was shortchanged in receiving less than other authorities, including the smaller Tees Valley authority area.The free bus travel will be funded using some of the £13.5m of bus grant funding secured from the Department for Transport by Weca, separate fromlast week’s cash injectionannounced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.The school holidays are due to start on 19 July. The proposed free travel offer would run from then until 5 September across the West of England and NorthSomerset, which is hoping to join the combined authority.Explore more on these topicsPublic transportBus faresTransportBristolSomersetGloucestershirePublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

In total, lenders would write off about £6.7bn of their loans to Thames and its parent company in an effort to reduce the huge load and in preparation for an eventual stock market listing.Creditors admitted their plan hinges on a considerable leniency from Ofwat, the government’s water regulator for England and Wales, over future fines for environmental failings.The creditors have requested that Ofwat set Thames Water lower environmental standards – and even for it to let the water company off without fines for past breaches of its licences and permits.The creditors will argue to Ofwat that the much-criticised leniency is necessary to avoid a “doom loop” of fines preventing recovery. The Guardian previously revealed that creditors are hoping forimmunity for directors from prosecution for environmental crimes.Thames Water has been on the verge of financial collapse for several years, afterdecades of underinvestment and dividend extractionleft it with leaking pipes and treatment works falling apart, even as its debt mountain grew.The company has desperately been seeking a way out of the turmoil without the government being forced to take control under a special administration regime (SAR), essentially temporary nationalisation.The government is also opposed to stepping in unless there is a direct threat to water and sewerage services for 16 million customers in London and south-east England.The creditors were forced to step forward with a rescue plan after the preferred bidder,the US private equity firm KKR, pulled out last week in a shock announcement. KKR is thought to havebalked at the complexity of taking on Thames Water amid intense political scrutiny.KKR’s withdrawal will mean long-term control of Thames Water will sit with the group of about 100 creditors, ranging from big institutional investors such as Aberdeen, BlackRock, Invesco and M&G, to US hedge funds – such as Elliott Investment Management and Silver Point Capital.It is widely acknowledged that creditors will have to write off a significant portion of existing debts to allow Thames to recover.It is understood that the controlling senior creditors will write off £3.2bn from about £16bn of debt, with other lenders forced to write off about £3.5bn.Senior sources at Ofwat told the Guardian there was concern over some of the terms of the creditor proposal, including whether it was possible for Thames Water to return to an investment-grade credit rating without controlling creditors writing off 30% to 40% of their debt – versus about 20% in their initial proposal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is the central driving ambition of the government’s clean energy superpower mission. We know that we’re going to have to see electricity demand at least double, by 2050.“All of the expert advice says nuclear has a really important role to play in the energy system. In any sensible reckoning, this is essential to get to our clean power and net zero ambitions.”View image in fullscreenThe Sizewell B nuclear plant on the Suffolk coast.Photograph: Jason Bye/AlamyThe announcement comes as part of the £113bn of new capital investment Reeves will announce in the spending review that the Treasury hopes will be the key theme – and enough to stave off further disquiet over expected cuts to day-to-day spending.On Monday, it emerged that all departments had settled with the Treasury after a deal was done with the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, who was deeply dissatisfied with funding for policing.The Home Office could still be forced to cut the overall number of police officers in the aftermath of its lengthy spending review negotiations with the Treasury.Whitehall sources said the department had been asked to look at all options including reducing officer recruitment, which would mean an overall cut in the headcount.On Monday morning, Cooper was the last minister still to reach a deal, with reports suggesting greater police spending would mean a squeeze on other areas of her department’s budget. On Monday afternoon, a source said that cuts to police numbers remained “a possibility”.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has also privately complained to the Treasury about Met police funding and a failure to finance any of the capital’s key transport infrastructure requests.On Monday evening it emerged there were concerns that some English regions, including London, would lose money to support local economic growth and tackle poverty through schemes such as the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, Growth Hub funding and the Levelling Up Fund.A source close to the London mayor said: “If the Treasury go ahead with this cut it would be incredibly shortsighted. They say they want economic growth but their actions in failing to invest in new infrastructure in the capital and cutting local growth funds will actually damage our economy, not improve it.“They say they want regional mayors to be the drivers of growth but then remove their levers to achieve growth.”Earlier on Monday, Reeves formally announcedplans to restore the winter fuel payment to all pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less, after a furious backlash to the government’s most unpopular policy to date.While the reversal was welcomed by Labour MPs worried about pensioner poverty and the political toxicity of the issue, there were concerns the £1.25bn price tag would mean more tax rises or spending cuts this autumn.The green light for the development at Sizewell C marks the end of a long 15-year journey to secure investment for the plant since the site was first earmarked for new nuclear development in 2010. Campaigners argued the development of the site would be hugely expensive compared with investment in other energy sources and would create only short-term job opportunities.The government is also expected to announce the winners of a long-running competition on Tuesday for a bid to build one of Europe’s first small modular reactor (SMR) programmes – a model that some in government hope could eventually attract private investment, especially from tech companies, which might build SMRs to power datacentres. FTSE 100 manufacturer Rolls-Royce is the favourite to be chosen to build the first British SMRs.Reeves will confirm the nuclear investment in her address at the GMB congress on Tuesday, including £6bn of investment to the nuclear submarine industrial base to deliver on recommendations in the strategic defence reviewThe investment also includes £2.5bn over five years for research and development of fusion energy. Combined, the Treasury said they would be vital to the UK’s energy security, replacing the UK’s dependency on fossil fuel markets with homegrown power.“We need new nuclear to deliver a golden age of clean energy abundance, because that is the only way to protect family finances, take back control of our energy, and tackle the climate crisis,” Miliband said.He said projects such as these were also essential for making the economic case to voters that the transition to net zero would not come at a cost to their families. “There aren’t enough industries in this country that provide good jobs at decent wages with strong trade unions. Nuclear is one of them. This is absolutely about delivering the kind of economic change right across the country,” he said.He said investment in fusion in Nottinghamshire would be directly on the site of the old West Burton coal-fired power station. “That is the transition in action – from an old coal-fired power station to a new fusion prototype plant,” he said. So for climate, for energy security, for jobs, I genuinely think this is the right choice.”Miliband has argued for nuclear power to be a part of tackling the climate crisis since 2009. As energy secretary in the last Labour government, he said he was brought up in a family that opposed it, but he now saw it as vital.“I didn’t expect to have to become the energy secretary again to make it happen,” Miliband said. “We’ve been too slow, definitely. This is also about accepting the role of government because this is going to be majority state-owned and state invested.“Hinckley was done under a different model. That is a way of lowering the cost of capital, getting a return for the taxpayer. So I think there have been real missed opportunities in the last 14 years.”Sizewell C was one of eight sites identified in 2009 by Miliband as a potential site for new nuclear. The project was not fully funded in the 14 years that followed under subsequent governments. The Treasury said that combined with the ambition to build SMRs, it would deliver more new nuclear to the grid than over the previous half century by the 2030s.Campaigners opposed to Sizewell C said they believed the development would end up as “HS2 mark 2” with years of overspending and delay. Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C said: “Ministers have still not come clean about Sizewell C’s cost and, given negotiations with private investors are incomplete, they have signed away all leverage and will be forced to offer generous deals that undermine value for money.”Explore more on these topicsSizewell CEd MilibandNuclear powerEnergy industryEnergyTax and spendingEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

The presence of older trees are vital for wildlife as they provide food and habitat.Government ‘failing to support natural regeneration of trees in England’Read moreAbigail Bunker, the trust’s director of conservation and external affairs, said: “The nation’s once rich, complex woodlands have become simpler and less biodiverse over time. Alarmingly, many British woodlands have very few – if any – ancient and veteran trees left.”The report laid out a 37% fall in the number of woodland birds over the last 50 years, including a sharp 15% fall in the last five. The number of woodland-associated butterflies fell by 47% between 1990 and 2022.An earlier report by the Woodland Trust in 2021 found that only 7% of Britain’s native woodland was in good condition. It found woodlands with low levels of deadwood, few veteran trees and poor diversity in age and species of trees.Between 2010 and 2020, 393 veteran trees were reported to be “lost” in the ancient tree inventory, meaning they had fallen, been felled or destroyed.A new government taskforce was set up in November 2024 to oversee the planting of new trees with the aim of hitting a target of 16.5% cover by 2050. The taskforce will bring together ministers from all four UK nations as well as several arms-length bodies.Last year, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, allocated up to £400m over two years for tree planting and peatland restoration in England.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Indeed, the rest of the official writing on the plinth was illegible, defaced by three separate graffiti reading “Fuck Ice” and another saying “Dead Cops”.The City of Angels was in recovery and clean-up mode after a fraught, boisterous day of protest on Sunday against Donald Trump’s immigration roundups and his decision to activate theCalifornianational guard against the will of the state’s leaders.A mostly peaceful series of demonstrations were marred, as night fell, by more serious acts of vandalism and violence. Some people, who the LAPD chief later said were not affiliated with the protesters, tossed rocks and paving stones off freeway overpasses on to police cruisers and officers below and a line of Waymo driverless vehicles that had already been spray-painted were set on fire.On Monday morning, street cleaning vehicles were out in force on Alameda Street, on the east side of the federal courthouse complex, where the national guard was stationed on Sunday and where thousands of protesters converged, starting in the early afternoon. The sidewalk and the long block of Alameda flanked by the federal buildings were cordoned off to the public.The 101 freeway, which had been occupied by protesters the night before, was open to traffic again, but most of the downtown exits were sealed off by California highway patrol vehicles. A cleaning crew with a pressure washer was hard at work on the outside of the federal building on Los Angeles Street, which houses a passport office, a social security office and other key federal bureaucratic services.View image in fullscreenProtesters against Trump outside the LA detention center on MondayPhotograph: Eric Thayer/APThe national guard, which played almost no role in policing the protests on Sunday, was once again nowhere to be seen. Federal authorities from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were likewise noticeably absent.With much of the Los Angeles police department recovering from a long day and night, the streets were largely given over to representatives from neighboring police forces drafted in to help – from Pasadena, South Pasadena, Burbank, Vernon and other cities. South Pasadena had the job of guarding concrete blocks set up overnight on either side of LA city hall on Spring Street. Its officers also stood guard on the building’s western steps.Much of the city establishment – council members, local elected officials and union leaders – flocked, meanwhile, to a protest of their own in Grand Park, on a hill overlooking city hall, to demand the release of David Huerta, a leader of the Service Employees International Union who was arrested on Friday while monitoring an immigration raid and was expected in court for his first appearance on Monday afternoon.“David Herta is my brother,” the president of his union, April Verrett, told the crowd to rapturous applause and chanting. “What he would say is, use this moment!”The thousands in attendance blew horns and yelled in approval.Union volunteers acted as marshals for the event and kept a close eye on the perimeter to watch for troublemakers – there appeared to be none. A sole Los Angeles police helicopter hovered overhead, but otherwise law enforcement was entirely absent.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastUS immigrationProtestTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.“The guidelines for importing biological materials into the US for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,” said John Nowak, who leads field operations at US Customs and Border Protection.The scientist was interviewed and arrested on Sunday after arriving on a flight fromChina, where she is pursuing an advanced degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. She planned to spend a year completing a project at the University of Michigan.Her shipments, including an envelope stuffed inside a book, were intercepted last year and earlier this year and opened by authorities, the FBI said.The court filing doesn’t indicate whether the FBI believes the biological material was risky, though US attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr said smuggling “threatens our security”.The scientist remains in custody awaiting a bond hearing on Wednesday.“It doesn’t strike me as something that is dangerous in any way. But there are rules to ship biological material,” said Michael Shapira, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who read the court filing and spoke to the Associated Press.The government last week charged two Chinese scientists who are accused of conspiring to smuggle a toxic fungus into the US. One was turned around at the Detroit airport and sent back to China last year, while the other, a researcher at the University of Michigan, was arrested.

Gunnar Wiedenfels, chief financial officer of Warner Bros Discovery, will serve as CEO of the company built around traditional TV networks, like CNN and Discovery.The traditional TV business, known as Global Networks, will own “up to” 20% of the studios and streaming business led by Zaslav, which it will use to pay down its debt. Warner Bros Discovery had a total debt pile of some $37bn as of March, troubling some on Wall Street.In a statement, Zaslav hailed the “next chapter” of the group’s history. “By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today’s evolving media landscape,” he said.Just last week, Zaslav faced an investor rebellion over his 2024 compensation package of more than $50m, when some 59% of Warner Bros Discovery shareholdersvoted againstthe package in a symbolic vote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The cookware craze redefining ‘ceramic’ and ‘nontoxic’Designer brands such as Always Pan and Caraway are booming – but safety experts are raising questionsSign up for the Detox Your Kitchen newsletterTom PerkinsMon 9 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 18.46 EDTShareThe cookware industry has entered a golden age, largely driven by the wild success of a new generation of “nontoxic” and “nonstick” designer ceramic pans backed by stars includingSelena Gomez,Stanley TucciandOprah Winfrey.But the pans are likely not “nontoxic” someindependent testingandresearch suggests. Nor are they even “ceramic” – at least not in the way the public broadly thinks of ceramics. Now, regulators are investigating some of the pan sellers’ claims.OnInstagram, TikTok and theirmarketing materials, the social media-savvy cookware brands promise “enchantment”, and “non-toxic materials and thoughtful design” that “prioritizes the health and safety of you and your family”.In fact, no legal definition for “nontoxic” or “ceramic” exists, and the marketing has drawn greenwashing accusations exacerbated by the companies concealing their pans’ ingredients.And the blockbuster sellers like Our Place’s Always Pan, Caraway and GreenPan are typically made with a material that thinly coats an aluminum substrate and is characterized in one study as “quasi-ceramic”. Meanwhile, independent testing and research suggests quasi-ceramics may contain toxins like titanium dioxide, siloxanes, lead and mercury.The claims are eliciting regulatory scrutiny. The state of Washington recently ordered quasi-ceramic producers to submit their nonstick ingredients to the state’s ecology department as it attempts to learn which chemicals cookware companies are using to replace Teflon or other toxic Pfas, or “forever chemicals”. The order is about “transparency”, said Marissa Smith, a senior toxicologist with the Washington department of ecology.“It’s challenging for regulators to know when we’re moving to safe alternatives, but it’s also hard for families who want to buy safer products,” Smith said. “There’s this fundamental challenge of figuring out what’s in our products and having the data to make those decisions.”The nonstick, quasi-ceramics have in part quickly blown up because, their producers claim, they cracked the “nontoxic/nonstick” code. Prior to 2019, nonstick pans largely used Pfas, a class of chemicals that contain among the most toxic man-made substances, and linked to cancer and a range of other serious health problems. The quasi-ceramic, design-forward pans with color palettes like “spice” and a millennial aesthetic burst onto a market ripe for an alternative.Their launches coincided with the rise of wellness culture and the pandemic’s outset. With people forced to cook at home and on social media, the cookware became Instagramsensations– Caraway’s monthly ecommerce salesjumped390% between January and May 2020.Celebrity involvement also fueled the quick ascents: Selena Gomez, Tan France, Gwyneth Paltrow, Stanley Tucci and Drew Barrymore now have their own quasi-ceramic pan lines.Gigi HadidandKate Hudsonpromoted their Caraways in the media. Always Pan’s orderbacklog hit 30,000early on. GreenPan made Oprah’s 2024Favorite Things list, and Caraway’s profits grew over 500% between 2020 and 2023.Throughout, the companies have relentlessly touted their products as “nontoxic”.What is ‘ceramic’?Ceramic cookware dates back at least 15,000 years. The concept evolved across cultures – the medieval British pipkin, the ancient Roman testum and the Wampanoag Native American decorated pots. Throughout the ages, the basic formula remained the same: some mix of clay, silica and minerals fired at a high heat to create a solid piece.The new quasi-ceramics are something else. The producers use some variation of a process called “sol-gel” developed in the 1970s to create a material that is a mix of silica, metals and chemicals. The material is sprayed onto an aluminum substrate – the pan is not quasi-ceramic all the way through.The companies won’t tell the public what else is in the pans, and their formulas are shielded by confidential business information laws, making it very difficult to verify their claims. The uncertainty alone raises suspicions among some public health advocates, but sleuthing of peer-reviewed research, legal documents, patents and regulatory documents around the pans raises more questions than answers, and points toward the use of toxic chemicals.Still, Carawaystates: “We believe in full transparency with regard to our products, so we’re happy to share testing reports with anyone via email to prove just how safe our products are.”In an email to the Guardian, it declined to share the formula: “The formulation of Caraway’s ceramic cooking surfaces is proprietary.”Responding in 2022 to I Read Labels For You, a consumer protection site that questioned the pan producers’ non-toxicity claims, Always Pan maker Our Placeconceded the products are not ceramic, but a “ceramic precursor” with a different formula.“We are heating it at a lower temperature, it never gets to that ceramic state,” Always Pan wrote. “Ceramic is totally inorganic whereas our sol-gel has organic and inorganic substances. The inorganic material is glass/silica. The organic material is an organic polymer.”In an email to the Guardian, Our Place said its pans’ materials are “similar in feel to traditional ceramics”, and are made with “a sand-based material, which is why it’s commonly referred to as ‘ceramic’”. It did not immediately respond to a question about why it’s marketed as ceramic if it’s admittedly not ceramic.The distinction is in part important because the surfaces can potentially melt at heat above 260C (500F), increasing the risk of chemicals leaching into food. The pans have also beenreportedtowear downandlosetheir nonstick coating sometimes within months of purchase. True ceramic can withstand much higher heat and is far more durable.Other quasi-ceramic producers use a similar material, all of which include polymers. Polymers may mean any of tens of thousands of chemicals, including Pfas, which the sol-gel patent even details. Applying nonstick organic polymers may also create toxic monomer byproducts, Smith noted, but it’s impossible to know without having the pan makers’ ingredients. Nonstick can liningscan createtoxic bisphenol-A, for example.A 2019 lawsuitallegedGreenPan’s “0% toxins” claim represented false advertising. Citing GreenPan’s patent, the suit alleged the pans contained silane, aluminum oxide, tetraethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, and potassium titanate. Regulatorsclassify some of theseas hazardous, but the suit was dismissed, though the settlement’s terms are unclear. GreenPan has denied using aluminum oxide. It did not respond to a request for comment.Smith said the state of Washington is concerned companies may be using siloxane, a chemical family often used to replace Pfas in consumer goods, but which sometimes pose similar risks. One industrystudycompared the performance of nonstick properties of siloxanes to Pfas in quasi-ceramic pans, finding Pfas worked better.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDetox Your KitchenFree weekly newsletterA seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A 2016studyalso identified titanium dioxide in quasi-ceramic pans, and showed how it can migrate into food. The toxic substance is banned in the European Union for use in food, but not cookware. It’s a potential carcinogen that accumulates in organs and islinked toneurotoxicity, intestinal inflammation and other health impacts.Caraway in 2024 acknowledged using nanoparticles, though they didn’t say which. But, it claimed without supporting evidence, that the levels it uses doesn’t cause health risks.All told, there’s evidence that the pans could contain such ingredients as titanium dioxide, lead, mercury, cadmium, siloxanes, potentially toxic monomer byproducts and other unknown substances. Even if the levels of individual toxins are low, there’s no research into the health effects of all the toxins combined migrating into food, which raises a whole new set of questions.Caraway in a statement to the Guardian said the company could not “speak to the conduct or quality of any testing that is not its own”.“Caraway is proud of the products we have developed and the progress made towards a cleaner home for our customers, there is still much to be done,” the statement added.Public health advocates say the uncertainty is a red flag, and forcing consumers to “go through tests and patents” to know what they’re buying is “absolutely ridiculous,” said Laurie Valeriano, executive director of the Toxic Free Future non-profit, which has raised concerns about quasi-ceramics.“It shouldn’t be up to consumers to sleuth and try to figure out the ingredients in pans so they can protect the health of themselves and their families,” Valeriano added.Maryland-based Xtrema is one of very few companies producing ceramic pans as they have been traditionally made. Production takes up to 25 days, said owner Rich Bergstrom and produces a solid ceramic piece that can withstand high levels of heat. Companies passing off a softer sol-gel coating as true ceramic “irks me – it drives me crazy”, Bergstrom said. He called it a “false term”, and said it’s being “manipulated from a marketing standpoint to give you the impression that it’s ceramic”.Lead and regulationsSome of the pans also contain lead, testing Lead Safe Mama’s Tamara Rubin found. The lids and cooking surfaces of theAlways PanandCarawayshowed some of the toxin, which she said suggests aluminum substrates and pieces are to blame.Rubin also found mercury in theCarawayand antimony throughoutGreenPan. Caraway still advertises “metals free”, and GreenPanstatesits products “lack harmful chemicals and toxins”.Rubin is a polarizing figure for her generally absolutist positions on lead – if a product contains the substance, she recommends against it. This is the most protective approach, but companies and regulators point out that lead is naturally occurring and widespread in the environment, often found at low levels in ceramics’ clay, as well as foods. They claim “trace” levels of lead are OK, especially if it’s not in a food contact surface. But there’s no definition for “trace”.No federal limits for lead in ceramic cookware exist. If lead in a ceramic piece isn’t leaching at the time a consumer buys it, then there isn’t a problem, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) told the Guardian in 2022. However, there’s no testing or oversight program, or assurance it doesn’t leach once it’s scratched, chipped or worn.The FDA has done little to scrutinize cookware materials throughout the decades because it’s chronically underfunded and understaffed, said Tom Neltner, director of the Unleaded Kids no-nprofit, who has legally pressured the FDA to act on leaded food materials: “With all the things coming into the agency, they have not looked at all these lead issues, and there’s no public scrutiny of their priorities.”However, the state of Washington is implementing the nation’s first limits directly addressing cookware – 90 parts per million (ppm) next year, and 10ppm by 2028. Rubin found levels as high as 70ppm in the Always Pan.Rubin in 2018 also found lead, cadmium and other metals like cobalt in Xtrema pieces, and advises against them for that reason. Bergstrom said he eliminated the highest sources of lead, like the logo on the pan’s bottom. He also noted Rubin’s testing looks for the presence of lead, but not whether it leaches into food.True ceramic pans are less of a leach risk because the material is more solid than quasi-ceramic, Bergstrom claims. His pans have passed California’s Proposition 65 leach tests of new products, and he also pointed to testing that showed no lead leaching from an Xtrema pan thathad been used for several years.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingConsumer spendingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Accordingly, compensation committees and boards must tread deliberately and carefully.”Cooley lawyers said there was also a possibility that executives might be unduly punished for tariff impacts that were beyond their control, and that this should also be considered by remuneration committees. It is likely that pay packets will start to reflect tariff impacts from early next year.Trump rolled out sweeping tariffs against most countries in April, in a shock move that left companies looking at how they could offset a potential hit to trade and revenues.The US president later paused and then reduced most tariffs, but last week herefocused attention on steel and aluminium imports, doubling tariffs for all countries except the UK to 50%. Tech companies have also suffered as a result of Trump’s trade war with Beijing, which has included an orderrestricting AI chip exports to China.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe the most useful lesson here is that they are mortals like the rest of us and more moderate pay awards that reflect that fact would be appropriate.”Explore more on these topicsExecutive pay and bonusesTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

One told the Guardian it had been a rolling three-year saga and said some foxes had begun to dig burrows in the perfectly manicured grounds.“There’s a little hole in the garden where one lives,” they said. “We’ve seen her all around the building – one second she’s on the fifth floor, the next she’s on the garden floor. No one has been able to catch her.”Others said they have seen fox poo on the grounds of the Thomas Heatherwick-designed building.View image in fullscreenThe office’s rooftop garden is believed to house 40,000 tonnes of soil and 250 trees.Photograph: Tim Robberts/Getty ImagesMosh Latifi, a co-director of the London-based pest control firm EcoCare, said they could be living off rats.“Foxes thrive quite well on rodents – we don’t live more than three metres away from the nearest rat,” he said, adding that he had also witnessed foxes in building sites scouring for food left behind by workers.Leaky pipes, or even generous handouts from local businesses, could be sustaining the skulk, according to another London pest control expert, who did not wish to be named. “London is a big playground for foxes – they will go absolutely anywhere,” they said.A Google spokesperson said: “Fox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King’s Cross development is no exception. While foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.”According to a search using the firm’s own search engine, the best way to get rid of foxes is to remove food sources, install secure fencing and fill in any gaps.It is not the first time a pricey London building has had such a problem. In 2011, a fox called Romeo wasdiscovered living in the Shard. He survived by living off scraps left by construction workers.Romeo was captured and, after a checkup, released back on to the streets of London.Facebook had to contend with a family of foxes at its Menlo Park headquarters in San Francisco. They were eventually honoured on the social media site – being granted a set of stickers on its Messenger app.Plans for the new Google building were announced in 2013, as its first completely owned and designed company site outside the US. The 11-storey building will accommodate up to 7,000 employees.The 300-metre rooftop garden runs along the length of the building and encompasses the seventh to eleventh floors. It’s believed that 40,000 tonnes of soil has been brought to support 250 trees, with a running track winding through them. The garden was designed to accommodate bees, bats, birds and butterflies. It features a space for dining, deckchairs and a fitness area. It also has an indoor pool.The nearly 1m sq ft building has been under construction since 2018, and is estimated to be completed later this year.In 2022, a topping-off ceremony that featured non-alcoholic Pimm’s and luxury canapés was attended by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and Keir Starmer, whose Holborn and St Pancras constituency includes the office.“This project represents a real vote of confidence in London, in our communities and in our flourishing tech sector,” Khan said at the time.Explore more on these topicsLondonGoogleAlphabetEnglandAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

So much had already happened. For a long time, Alcaraz had been dominated with the same ruthless efficiency Sinner reserved for the rest of the field and he soon stared into the abyss, trailing triple championship point at 3-5, 0-40 in the fourth set.Sinner’s mechanical excellence malfunctions against human ingenuity of relentless rivalRead moreThat moment would instead mark the beginning of Alcaraz’s unprecedented, preposterous comeback as he completely turned the match around. He soon closed in on victory, leading by a break in the fifth set against a weary opponent. With his back to the wall, time running out, Sinner produced a transcendent return game as Alcaraz served for the title at 5-4 to draw level again.In their delirium, desperation meeting sheer ambition, the moment elicited the best of both players. Having invested so much time and effort into their pursuit of this title, they simply had no choice but to abjure all thoughts from their minds and swing as freely as possible. The frenzied final games of the 2025French Openfinal will go down among the greatest stretches of play in the history of grand slam championship matches. In the end, the suffocating pressure imposed by Sinner inspired Alcaraz to elevate his own level to wondrous heights.Despite how rapidly he has built an all-time great career, Alcaraz has had his own struggles on the court. His game is so complete and he has so many more options at his disposal than any adversary, but this can also play tricks on his mind. At its worst, he plays disordered and chaotic tennis. He goes for overzealous, low percentage shots and his impulsiveness takes over. Occasionally, he hits himself off the court. Just as he can bulldoze any opponent on any day, he is also capable of taking astraight-sets loss to Botic van de Zandschulpin the second round of the US Open, as he did last year.View image in fullscreenA French journalist prematurely predicts a win for Jannik Sinner before Carlos Alcaraz saved three match points.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockIn tennis, however, success means rising up in the most important moments. Beyond Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, nobody thrives under those circumstances like Alcaraz. His ability to find order after his game was in total disarray seconds earlier is remarkable. Alcaraz knows his quality and he believes his potential is boundless. He tackles those tough moments with the full belief that he can always find a path to victory regardless of the obstacle before him. Down triple championship point Alcaraz was stillreassuring his coach,Juan Carlos Ferrero: “He was love-40 in the fourth, 5-3, and he looks at me and still make me like this [shaking] the racket, saying: ‘I’m still here,’ said Ferrero.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hetrailed Alexander Zverev by two sets to onebefore turning the match around in last year’s final. He improbably found a path to victory in his breathless 2023Wimbledon win against Djokovic. This comeback victory over Sinner had been preceded by another win from match point down in their 2022 US Open quarter-final before Alcaraz won the title. He is now the second player in history, after Djokovic, to win multiple major titles from match point down and he is a perfect 5-0 in major finals. He is only 22.By defending his French Open title, Alcaraz is the third-youngest men’s player to win five grand slam titles. It has been obvious for years that Alcaraz has set himself on a path to becoming one of the greats but only time will determine if he has the longevity to come at all close to the generation that preceded him. As Alcaraz and Sinner pushed each other to the limits of their powers, the spectacle on Sunday night underlined the important role they will each play in their rival’s career.This was the first grand slam final between Alcaraz, now a five-time champion, and Sinner, a three-time champion, who have equally split the last six major titles between them. There has been so much hype around this rivalry for years and both players felt the significance of the match-up. Still, after decades of dominance by Nadal, Djokovic and Roger Federer, and the many classics they played between them, the standard they set for greatness is so tough to reach. It was reasonable to accept that the new generation might not be able to immediately live up to those high standards.Instead, in a tournament that began withNadal’s elaborate farewell ceremonyand saw an emotional Djokovic admit he is unsure about whether he will return to Paris next year, Alcaraz and Sinner used the occasion to play one of the greatest grand slam finals of all time, affirming their status as leaders in this new era of men’s tennis to the world and setting the tone for what could be a decade at the top of the sport. These matches will make them better, the minuscule margins between them inspiring them to constantly improve and work on their games. Even as they tussle across borders and surfaces, their combined greatness will also help them to stay more than a step ahead of the rest.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Carlos AlcarazJannik SinnerFrench OpenTennisanalysisShareReuse this content"

During Fox Sports’ coverage of the Uefa Nations League finalbetween Portugal and Spainon Sunday, Donovan appeared to reference Pulisic’s withdrawal from the USMNT squad, although he did not mention the player by name.Christian Pulisic’s dad Mark claps back at Landon Donovan for criticizing USMNT players for sitting out of the Gold Cup, referencing the sabbatical he took in his career.Christian Pulisic also liked the post.pic.twitter.com/DfRF3ixsvl— USMNT Only (@usmntonly)June 9, 2025[Cristiano Ronaldo]’s 40 years old,” said Donovan, who won 157 caps for the USMNT. “He’s played a long ass season. He’s tired. He’s out there grinding. Hurt himself in the process, and I can’t help but think about our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It’s pissing me off.”Even with Coppa Italia loss, Christian Pulisic has had the best-ever season by an American man in EuropeRead moreOn Sunday evening, Mark Pulisic posted to Instagram a ChatGPT answer detailing Donovan’s decision to take a sabbatical from soccer in 2013. Mark Pulisic added the comment: “This guy is talking about commitment. Look in the mirror + grow a pair and call names out, or are you afraid? Next time you want an interview, you will get rejected again.”His son added a like to the post.In May, Donovan addressed his own sabbatical in the context of Pulisic’s decision to sit out the Gold Cup.“I understand very clearly what it’s like to need a break,” said Donovan, whose call then-US head coach Jürgen Klinsmann said contributed to thedecision to cut Donovanfrom the 2014 World Cup team. “If there’s something serious going on in your life, in your family, mentally, whatever, I get it. I’m going to assume for the sake of this conversation that’s not going on. If they would actually come out and give reasons, it would help us, but none of them want to say anything publicly. I think it would help them publicly to say ‘this is why.’”Pulisic enjoyedhis best season in Europe in 2024-25, putting in standout performances for Milan, even as the club slumped to eighth place in Serie A. Pulisic’s decision to sit out the Gold Cup is unsurprising – he last played in the tournament, which is held every two years, in 2019. The Gold Cup is contested by Concacaf nations and occasional guest teams – Saudi Arabia will play in this year’s edition.Mark Pulisic’s angry response to criticism of his son has echoes of a dispute involving Christian’s USMNT teammate Gio Reyna. In 2023, the Reyna familynotified the US Soccer Federationof a decades-old incident involving then USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter and his wife in response to Berhalter’s criticism of Reyna at a speaking event.Explore more on these topicsChristian PulisicUSAMilanUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, visa processing times have been slow for several countries,travel bans have been instituted(including forrecently qualified Iran), and raids ostensibly aimed at deporting undocumented immigrants have seen the government arrest and deport visa holders, permanent residentsand even citizens.Los Angeles responds with roaring backlash to Trump’s dramatic escalationRead moreAt a gathering in New York City, Philadelphia host committee CEO Meg Kane spoke for the group when asked by the Guardian what impact the Ice raids have had on the organizations’ ability to welcome fans with open arms – a message disseminated by the host cities themselves and Fifa president Gianni Infantino.“There are certainly things that are happening at the national level, the international level. There are going to be geopolitical issues that we don’t even know right now that are going to affect the tournament next year,” Kane said in part. “We recognize that we’re planning within uncertainty. And one of the things that I think we all recognize is that we have to be really good at operating within that uncertainty. While there are certain situations that we are watching … the [Trump] administration has been extremely supportive of Fifa World Cup. It has recognized both in the second term under President Trump, but also in the first term under President Trump, when the letters of intent were signed, how important the Fifa World Cup is to elevating the nation.”The host city committees are concerned, in part, with communicating potential issues to fans in areas such as transportation, lodging, and safety.All host city heads said they hoped to provide a welcoming environment for all who visit for the World Cup, but demurred when asked how they deal with the contrast of that message alongside heavy-handed immigration crackdowns and travel bans.“I mean, we’re all watching it and monitoring it real time,” said Jason Krutzsch, vice president of the Los Angeles host city committee when asked aboutthe situation in his home city, which is currently experiencing a raft of violence surrounding Ice raids and the deployment of the national guard. “I think our goal is still to deliver the conceptional experience and work with our local administration and public safety officials and making sure that we can deliver a safe and secure event in a year.”Krutzsch, Kane, and other host city chairs said that they are confident that Fifa and the federal government are discussing the topic, but ultimately the decision on who to allow into the US for the World Cup lies with those two bodies.“I think the right people at the federal level, at the Fifa level, are having those conversations,” said Mike Loynd, president of the Boston host city committee. “And I think the intent, even there, is to welcome the world. It’s really not our place in the organization to comment on anything other than that.”Added Kane: “We allow for Fifa to continue having constructive conversations with the administrations around visas, around workforce, around tourism, and that will be prepared for whatever comes our way to make this a great tournament, because that’s what the charge of the host cities are.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026US sportsWorld CupUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

I try not to be careless about it because you only realise how much of a problem it is when you’re in that situation and I don’t necessarily want to be in that situation again.“Off the court right now, I feel good, I feel pretty settled.

He added that his feelings towards the Yankees were not just down to playing for the Red Sox though. “I think whoever I was playing with or whoever I would have been drafted by, I’d still hate the Yankees,” he added.Judge was told about Dobbins’s comments before the game, and duly cracked the first pitch he faced off the pitcher for a two-run homer. Judge was asked if he had thought about Dobbins’s comments when he took the at bat. “Well, once somebody tells you, yeah,” Judge said.Dobbins had arguably the better night though. He gave up three runs in five innings, but came away with the win as the Red Sox completed an 11-7 victory, taking the series 2-1.Yankees infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr, said he didn’t have an issue with the comments but thought Dobbins may have taken things a little too far.“I love competitiveness,” Chisholm said. “But to say that, being a rookie, is kind of crazy to me, to say that you’re going to rule out one out of 30 teams to be a professional athlete.”Judge hit a second home run in the ninth inning, for his fourth multi-homer game of 2025 and the 43rd of his career.

Now it was 4-3, Wales’s extraordinary work to bounce up off the canvas undone but not forgotten, Craig Bellamy’s unbeaten run finally over.In the city of the Delirium Village, a cul-de-sac near the Grand Place with a bar sporting a Guinness world record for the most varieties of beer, theWalessupporters who made the pilgrimage felt deliriousness turn to disappointment. It should not linger too long given the manner of Wales’s response from the moment Jérémy Doku, not for the first time, made those in red shirts look silly before firing a shot into the far corner to make it 3-0.‘It’s about belief’: Craig Bellamy hails Wales’s spirit despite defeat in BelgiumRead moreDoku, who Bellamy coached as a 16-year-old during his two years working across town at Anderlecht, caused havoc. Bellamy had seen this movie before. “Yeah … now I know what every coach felt like when I was coaching him,” the Wales manager said. “You can’t stop him. I actually told him during the game: ‘Please drop deep.’ But this kid is phenomenal … you haven’t got a statue for him yet? Start getting it ready. Today I got a little bit of my own medicine.”At the final whistle techno blared over the speakers and Bellamy made a beeline for the match-winner, saluting De Bruyne, who is expected to join Napoli after leaving Manchester City, before engaging in conversation with Doku and then Romelu Lukaku. Youri Tielemans laid on a midfield masterclass before the Wales penalty, awarded after Matz Sels fouled Chris Mepham at a corner with about 25 seconds of first-half stoppage time to play, shifted the momentum of the game.At that point, though, few envisaged the scenes after Brennan Johnson directed Sorba Thomas’s cushioned header into the bottom corner past Sels with 20 minutes of regular time to play. The Wales bench emptied into the technical area. A few minutes earlier Mark Harris, on as a substitute, nodded another Thomas cross wide with seemingly his first touch. Suddenly the Wales supporters who understandably declined the open invitation to join in the Mexican wave that rippled around this stadium at 3-0 were only too happy to start one of their own.View image in fullscreenBrennan Johnson’s header brings Wales level at 3-3.Photograph: Yves Herman/ReutersBelgium thought they had a winner on 80 minutes when Lukaku fired in but the goal was ruled out after a VAR review deemed the ball had gone out of play on halfway, in front of Bellamy, who was booked for his protests. Wales thought they had survived but then De Bruyne found a winner to cap a ludicrous game. Belgium had gone to pieces but reassembled the jigsaw one last time. Tielemans picked out De Bruyne and Wales finally succumbed to defeat under Bellamy, the first in 10 matches.Belgium were fortunate to be awarded the penalty that set them on their way. The referee, Irfan Peljto, pointed to the spot in the 11th minute but there was a four-minute break to enable a VAR review of the decision to penalise Johnson for handball. The Tottenham forward tried to shift his left arm behind his back as De Bruyne, having feinted his way past Thomas and then David Brooks, blasted at goal.

That was a significant step en route to qualifying for Euro 2016, Wales reaching their first major tournament for 58 years. On the night Jazz Richards, a fringe full-back at Swansea who finished his career at Haverfordwest County, was promoted to the starting lineup to help stifle Eden Hazard. Belgium, who were held to a draw in North Macedonia on Friday in their opening World Cup qualifier under Rudi Garcia, have not lost any of their 42 European or World Cup qualifiers since.For Wales there is, of course, another storied night against Belgium, Hal Robson-Kanu, a free agent after his release by Reading,starring in a 3-1 win in Lilleto march on to the Euro 2016 semi-finals. Here, however, any thoughts of another historic result against Belgium – or indeed their first win in Belgium at the ninth attempt – seemed far-fetched inside the first half-hour, if not earlier. In the end though, for Wales, it was another duel with Belgium that will live long in the memory.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersBelgiumWalesmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

England’s labours in Barcelona were put into sharper focus by the quality of Portugal and Spainin the Nations League finalthe following night. Tuchel, however, insists England are not inferior to those nations and will improve, beginning with the friendly against Senegal in Nottingham on Tuesday.England’s grind, Nations League drama and Ange Postecoglou out at Spurs – Football WeeklyRead more“The level will increase immediately once we are playing against Portugal or Spain. We will rise to the occasion. This will come,” said Tuchel. “It will bring out the very best in us. We shall not develop a complex because there is no need for it. Spain qualified for the final four with a very lucky win over the Netherlands. Everyone is beatable. They play together in a fluidity and a rhythm which is outstanding and the highest level.“It is one of the most difficult things to do to play Spain in a final. I struggle to say ‘we’ because we were not there [in the final of Euro 2024] but it was 1-1 and Spain scored in the last minute and that gave the title to Spain. We have what it takes to compete. We need to improve, for sure. We have not clicked yet.”The former Chelsea and Bayern Munich coach, like many of his predecessors, is already wrestling with the dilemma of why so many gifted individuals do not bring their club form on to the international stage. “That’s the question that needs to be answered,” said Tuchel. “I think that even Cole [Palmer] struggled lately at Chelsea to have an impact. Phil [Foden], unfortunately, struggled over many months now to have the impact that he can have.“It is a different strategy [with England], it’s different principles of the game and to make everyone play to the same rhythm, to make everyone play to the same principles, takes obviously a little bit more time than we would like. I see the structure in the game, I see the control, I see the amount of passes, but we can do better. We can be more fluid. We can be more exciting which since a longer time I feel has been a bit of a problem. I feel it’s a bit stuck, serious, I see us train with a smile but not play with a smile.”Jude Bellingham missed training on Monday to attend a family funeral but rejoined the squad later in the day. Tuchel indicated he could change goalkeepers against Senegal and would have to be careful with the minutes given to playersheading to the Club World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Dane is the club’s No 1 target to replace Ange Postecoglou, who wassacked on Friday, and there is confidence that a deal will be struck in the next 48 hours.Negotiations are due to take place on the cost of recruiting Frank, who has a £10m release clause, and his backroom staff. The 51-year-old Dane wants to join Spurs after almost seven years atBrentford, with terms already in place.Tottenham have moved swiftly after parting company with Postecoglou, who lost his job despitewinning the Europa Leaguelast month and ending the club’s 17-year wait for a major trophy. The Australian’s fate was decided after the chairman, Daniel Levy, looked past the side’s European run and focused on a dreadful Premier League campaign.Spurs finished 17th last season after losing 22 games. That has not made the job less attractive to Frank, who will be taking over a team that earned Champions League qualification thanks to their triumph against Manchester United in Bilbao.Frank has established himself as one of the most respected managers in the top flight since leading Brentford to promotion from the Championship in 2021. They have steered clear of relegation battles and finished 10th last season. Frank has operated with a modest budget and has admitted that Brentford cannot hope to hold on to their best players if bigger clubs try to buy them. Bryan Mbeumo is expected to depart for Old Trafford this summer.It remains to be seen how Brentford respond if everything goes smoothly with Spurs and Frank departs. Kieran McKenna has been suggested as a potential replacement for Frank but it is not clear if he wants to leave Ipswich Town.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurBrentfordnewsShareReuse this content"

Adams was on target twice in the first half after scoring only once in his previous 19 internationals and the Torino forward headed home with the last action of the game.Belgium v Wales: World Cup 2026 qualifier – liveRead moreIt was a night of firsts for Scotland with Ross Doohan, Josh Doig, Andy Irving, Connor Barron and Kieron Bowie making their debuts and Lennon Miller making an impressive first start with a hand in two goals. Doohan flew in from a family holiday in Turkey after being given his first call-up after injuries to Angus Gunn and Robby McCrorie, and Cieran Slicker’s difficult debut in the 3-1defeat against Icelandon Friday. The goalkeeper, released recently by Aberdeen, probably had the quietest game of his career, not needing to make a save and barely touching the ball in the second half.With Scott McTominay and Kieran Tierney injured, the 18-year-old Motherwell midfielder Miller and Adams came in as Steve Clarke arranged his side in a 4-4-2 formation. Anthony Ralston, Jack Hendry and Scott McKenna came into defence as Clarke made six changes to the lineup.Scotland laboured to narrow wins against Liechtenstein in their only two previous meetings, in the Euro 2012 qualifiers, but there was little doubt about the winner of this match from the fourth minute when Adams opened the scoring. Miller’s volley was blocked following a corner and the Torino striker hit the rebound into the roof of the net.Lewis Ferguson missed a decent chance before Adams doubled his tally in the 26th minute. Miller was involved again, winning possession as the home side tried to pass the ball out from the back and setting up Adams to wrongfoot the goalkeeper.John McGinn had a shot well saved after Miller’s pass inside and Doohan almost got his first taste of meaningful action when the Liechtenstein wing-back Kenny Kindle was allowed to run a long way with the ball and get a shot away. His effort just cleared the top corner.The 1,600 away fans were entertained by a Swiss-based pipe band at half-time and they were cheering again within three minutes of the restart. McGinn struck the post from 20 yards before Adams flicked on Ralston’s cross for Hirst to convert at the back post.The Sassuolo left-back Doig and the West Ham midfielder Irving were brought on for debuts just before the hour. Doig got down the left wing to good effect and forced a save before the Hibernian striker Bowie and the Rangers midfielder Barron entered the fray. Scotland continued to play in the opposition half and Adams headed home Tommy Conway’s near-post cross immediately before the full-time whistle.Clarke was pleased to see a positive response to the side’s defeat on Friday but he said neither match offers any indicator of how his team may perform when their World Cup qualifying campaign begins in September.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I trust my players,” Clarke told BBC Scotland. “I’ve had a couple of disappointments, and I know they’ve always shown the resilience to come back and do what they can do, so it will have no bearing on what’s going to happen later in the year, but it’s nice to finish this camp with a nice win.“It’s still a disappointing camp because we didn’t play as we can play in the home game at Hampden, so I’m certainly going to carry that [disappointment] into August. There was a little bit of hurt and anger in the dressing room, I think you saw that in the first 25 minutes when the players were really on it, so hopefully we can harness that and take that into the autumn games.”The Scotland head coach confirmed after the victory in Liechtenstein that his long-serving assistant, John Carver, is stepping down to focus on his role as head coach of Lechia Gdansk. “I think the wave goodbye to the crowd was probably a giveaway,” he told BBC Scotland.“When I approached him to come in and help us, I didn’t think he’d be here for five years because he’s such a talented coach.

Mikel Merino playing as an auxiliary centre-forward after Kai Havertz had broken down made that apparent. This will be a summer with a marked difference withAndrea Berta ready to goas the club’s new sporting director. Berta spent 12 years at Atlético Madrid, supplying the players and foundation behind Diego Simeone’s dynasty. Arsenal seek to avoid friction between Arteta dictating as he did previously and Berta wielding the same kind of power that was so effective in Madrid. Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig is heavily linked to the striking vacancy with Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres seen as too costly. Martin Zubimendi is expected to reunite with Merino in Arsenal’s midfield, though Real Madrid may yet turn the midfielder’s head. Kepa Arrizabalaga will come in as a back-up goalkeeper within a squad well set for success but missing the final pieces.John BrewinAston VillaThere is another profit and sustainability-shaped hole to fill this summer, though the picture is not thought to be as pressing as last year, when Villa’s director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, compared the situation to a ticking timebomb before they sold Douglas Luiz to Juventus. At the same time, another big sale would be a welcome relief to the bottom line, which is why Villa are preparing for the departure of Emiliano Martínez. Villa are targeting the additions of two goalkeepers, with Lille’s Lucas Chevalier among those on the shortlist, and will need to replace the loanees who arrived in the winter window, with none of Marcus Rashford, Marco Asensio and Axel Disasi expected to return permanently. Villa immediately targeted a young striker after agreeing to sell Jhon Duran in January and have agreed a deal for the 18-year-old Zépiqueno Redmond to join from Feyenoord next month.Ben FisherView image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford, who was on loan at Aston Villa last season, is not expected to return over the summer.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersBournemouthNo wonder the Bournemouth technical director, Simon Francis, recently conceded they are victims of their own success. Even before last season ended, the club were being mined for their prized assets, with Real Madrid triggering the £50m release clause in Dean Huijsen’s contract. Milos Kerkez, who has been a superb signing from AZ Alkmaar, is poised to join Liverpool, so a left-back is high on the agenda. Paris Saint-Germain have also inquired about Illia Zabarnyi, another consistent performer. The official line is Zabarnyi is not for sale but it will be tough to keep him if PSG stump up. Regardless, Bournemouth will generate significant funds to strengthen and view a new goalkeeper as perhaps the most important piece of the puzzle. Kepa Arrizabalaga, who spent last season on loan from Chelsea and remains the world’s most expensive goalkeeper, has a modest £5m release clause in his contract but Bournemouth are exploring all options in their search for a permanent No 1.BFBrentfordThis could be a summer of change at the Gtech. Thomas Frank continues to be touted as the next Tottenham manager and there is a possibility that Brentford will be forced to replace the goals and assists of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoanne Wissa. Both forwards have interest from elsewhere – Mbeumo is likeliest to leave, with United circling, while Wissa was targeted by Nottingham Forest in January. But Brentford will back themselves to bounce back. They recovered from losing Ivan Toney last summer and tend to use their funds wisely. They have already made an eye-catching addition in goal,signing Caoimhin Kelleher from Liverpoolafter selling Mark Flekken to Bayer Leverkusen. Michael Kayode, the 20-year-old Italian defender, has joined from Fiorentina for £14.8m.Jacob SteinbergView image in fullscreenBrentford have signed the Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher from Liverpool.Photograph: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesBrightonSummer 2025 recruitment will have been planned some time ago with the ad-hoc approach some clubs still favour a stranger to Tony Bloom’s set-up. Tommy Watson scored the playoff final goal that sent Sunderland to thePremier Leaguewhen the teenage winger was already set to become a Brighton player. Note that Brighton are happy to loan to other Premier League clubs, which may see Watson returned to the north east. The Olympiakos striker Charalampos Kostoulas, for whom a bid is logged, fits the brand of hot property bigger clubs will end up paying more for in the coming years. Brighton can be a selling club but only at the right price, so moves for Kaoru Mitoma will have to be credible, though could fund a defensive rebuild where Lewis Dunk and Joël Veltman are both 34. Olivier Boscagli, 27, out of contract at PSV, is signed as a centre-back.JBBurnleyAs one of the six clubs to have won promotion to the Premier League and suffered an immediate return to the Championship in the past two seasons, Burnley are painfully aware of the leap they need to make this summer. Two years ago, having won the Championship with 101 points, the Clarets invested more than £100m in Vincent Kompany’s squad, only to finish second from bottom of the Premier League with 24 points. This summer, havingwon automatic promotionwith 100 points, Scott Parker intends to keep the core of his squad intact while strengthening in several departments. He may also have holes to fill in goal and in central defence should James Trafford and Maxime Estève depart. Burnley have already signed last season’s loanees Marcus Edwards, Zian Flemming, Jaidon Anthony and Bashir Humphreys on permanent deals and released veterans Nathan Redmond and Jonjo Shelvey. A big summer is required to buck a worrying trend at the top of English football.Andy HunterChelseaChampions League qualification and Conference League glory should be followed by another flurry of activity. The aim is to move quickly given that Chelsea compete in the Club World Cup this month, and there is satisfaction atwinning the race to sign Liam Delapfrom Ipswich for £30m. A new striker was the top priority, but other positions are being targeted. Chelsea want a right-footed winger after sending Jadon Sancho back to Manchester United, view Ajax’s Jorrel Hato as a good option in defence and have checked on the Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan. Another striker is a possibility, too. The pace is relentless. Chelsea will look to make a lot of sales – Noni Madueke could leave for the right price – and a lot of business was done before this window, with deals concluded for youngsters such as Dario Essugo, Willian Estêvão, Mamadou Sarr, Kendry Páez and Mike Penders.JSView image in fullscreenLiam Delap poses for a photo at Stamford Bridge in his new Chelsea kit.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesCrystal PalaceSelhurst spending power is likely to be decided by the ongoing dispute over the club’s participation in the Europa League. Should Palace be excluded, their status as a destination – and a place to stay – will be much reduced. Anyone wishing to buy Eberechi Eze will have to pay a release clause of £68m, a hefty premium following the previous practice of pricing Wilfried Zaha highly. Jean-Philippe Mateta, Adam Wharton and Marc Guéhi will have similar premiums; Wharton would cost significantly north of £60m for interested parties like Liverpool. Who makes the decisions? Dougie Freedman was a hugely admired sporting director but departed to Saudi Arabia, a combination of deputy Ben Stevens and the experienced consultant Iain Moody has stepped in, a hotline to Freedman kept open, too. Oliver Glasner needs bodies if European football happens, particularly in defence and midfield.JBEvertonThe theory that a new stadium plus new owners equals a new start for Everton is appealing, but the reality is not so straightforward. The mess left by the previous regime still lingers. The contracts of 13 members of last season’s squad, including loanees, expire this summer. Eight departures have been confirmed and the futures of four others are yet to be resolved. On the bright side, the impressive Carlos Alcaraz has been signed on a permanent deal. A comprehensive rebuild is unavoidable, there are profitability and sustainability rules issues to contend with, Jarrad Branthwaite is coveted again and both the club’s head of recruitment and director of football have left, the latter at Everton’s behest. David Moyes has admitted being worried at the scale of the overhaul required and no wonder. The Friedkin Group need him to perform heroics in the transfer market once again.AHView image in fullscreenEverton have triggered the option to make Carlos Alcaraz’s loan from Flamengo permanent for an undisclosed fee.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAFulhamThe most important thing is to hold on to Marco Silva. The manager has been linked with Juventus, Spurs and Saudi Pro League clubs in recent months and would not be easy to replace if he leaves. Silva’s influence at Craven Cottage is vast and he will want Fulham to show ambition. A new striker is wanted to compete with Raúl Jiménez and Rodrigo Muniz. PSV Eindhoven’s Ricardo Pepi has been linked, although he suffered a serious injury in January. The Benfica winger Rafa Silva is also on the club’s radar. Fulham need a new wide player following the end of Reiss Nelson’s loan from Arsenal. They are also waiting to see if Kenny Tete and Tom Cairney sign new deals. Willian and Carlos Vinícius have been released.JSLeedsDaniel Farke will aim to strengthen the spine of his promoted side. The Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope and central midfielder Sean Longstaff loom large on his wish list, while the Leeds manager is also a fan of the Millwall defender Japhet Tanganga. A forward is also being targeted, with Lecce’s Nikola Krstović under consideration. Manor Solomon, excellent as theChampionship was won last season, is likely to return to Spurs after the end of his loan deal and there could be other high-profile exits, including those of Patrick Bamford and Illan Meslier. Farke should have around £100m to spend, although it is not ideal that the transfer window’s opening has coincided with the departure of the club’s influential chief executive, Angus Kinnear, to Everton.Louise TaylorLiverpoolThe busy summer that Virgil van Dijk predicted – or was promised during contract negotiations – has commenced in impressive style as the Premier League champions revamp Arne Slot’s squad from a position of strength. The disappointment of losing Trent Alexander-Arnold has been quickly offset by the arrival of Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen, although, Liverpool do not consider the £29.5m signing a like-for-like replacement. Moves are afoot to strengthen on the opposite flank with a deal close for the Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez. But it is the pursuit of Frimpong’s former Leverkusen teammate Florian Wirtz that promises to be the most spectacular piece of business by a club that has kept its powder relatively dry in the last three transfer windows. Wirtz will cost Liverpool a club record fee whatever the final sum proves to be and will bring the creativity and finishing touch that Slot believes can elevate his champions next season. And a new striker is wanted. There will be several exits to help fund a statement of intent this summer.AHView image in fullscreenLiverpool are hoping to sign the Bayer Leverkusen and Germany attacker Florian Wirtz.Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty ImagesManchester CityThe Manchester City chair, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, promised the club would be “aggressive” in this summer window despite the fact they still await the outcome of their hearing into alleged breaches of the Premier League’s financial rules. City certainly have not been shy with their early moves in the market, agreeing a £46.3m fee for Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders and pursuing Wolves’ Rayan Aït-Nouri, who is expected to move for around £30m plus add-ons. City were admirers of Liverpool-bound Florian Wirtz as they eye attacking midfield reinforcements in the wake of Kevin De Bruyne’s departure. Lyon’s Rayan Cherki looks set to fit the bill instead, although City have until 7pm on Tuesday to finalise all three deals if the trio are to feature in the Club World Cup. In terms of outgoings, James McAtee and Jack Grealish could follow De Bruyne through the exit door.Dominic BoothManchester UnitedBruno Fernandes’ decision to reject a move to the Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal, who were prepared to offer Manchester United £100m for their captain, was an early boost in the window for Ruben Amorim’s side. Although the fee may have helped United’s delicate PSR situation, the club’s priority was always to keep Fernandes. That, coupled with the arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, with United meeting the Brazilian’s £62.5m release clause, has given supporters cause for summer optimism. Bryan Mbeumo is next on United’s radar, but Brentford have rebuffed an initial bid, requiring a fee similar to the one paid for Cunha. The club would still like a striker, central midfielder and possibly a goalkeeper to go with the attacking midfield pair. They won’t get them all without significant sales, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho among those deemed surplus to requirements.DBNewcastleNewcastle are in a state of flux. The club’s sporting director, Paul Mitchell, is leaving at the end of June, with chief executive, Darren Eales, also poised to depart on health grounds. While the club’s Saudi Arabian ownership consider replacing Eales with David Hopkinson, a Canadian with previous executive experience at Real Madrid, Eddie Howe seeks a new goalkeeper, a right-sided centre half, a right winger and a striker to understudy Alexander Isak. The Burnley keeper James Trafford and the Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi remain at the top of his wish list. Having missed out on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap, Howe is likely to target Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo, Nottingham Forest’s Anthony Elanga and Brighton’s João Pedro. Fraser Forster or Tim Krul could also return as back-up goalkeepers, boosting the squad’s homegrown contingent demanded by Uefa’s Champions League rules.LTNottingham ForestNuno Espírito Santo wants to add depth after returning Forest to European competition for the first time since 1996. Providing support for Chris Wood is a priority and Forest could revisit a move for Brentford’s Yoane Wissa, for whom they bid £22m in January. There is a familiar figure working in the shadows – Edu Gaspar, the former Arsenal sporting director, who, for now, is working for Evangelos Marinakis on an unofficial basis. First up? A triple signing from Botafogo is in the pipeline, with striker Igor Jesus, centre-back Jair Cunha and left-back Cuiabano being pursued. A back-up goalkeeper and a central midfielder are also on their wanted list. Murillo and Morgan Gibbs-White are of interest to the elite but Forest are hopeful of holding on to their best players.BFSunderlandRégis Le Bris has already made his first summer signing following promotion, with Enzo Le Fée’s loan from Roma becoming a £20m record transfer. Although Sunderland would like to keep Jobe Bellingham, the England Under-21 midfielder is poised to join Borussia Dortmund for an initial fee of around £28m, while winger Tommy Watson, scorer of the winning goal in the playoff final against Sheffield United, has already joined Brighton for £10m. While Sunderland’s sporting director, Kristjaan Speakman, will not be drawn on suggestions that the Ajax captain Jordan Henderson could return to the club where he began his career, he has indicated that a handful of high-calibre recruits capable of stepping straight into Le Bris’s youthful team are being sought. The idea is that four or five new arrivals will solidify the spine of the starting XI. Those targeted could include the Monaco defender Wilfried Singo.LTView image in fullscreenAjax midfielder Jordan Henderson has been linked with a return to Sunderland.Photograph: Marcel van Dorst/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockTottenhamThere had been only one story at the club since the end of the season – whether Ange Postecoglou would stay on as the manager or go. We now have the answer. However, the hierarchy have been pushing on with moves for transfer targets, with the technical director, Johan Lange, prominent. There is also the possibility that Fabio Paratici, the former recruitment chief, who has been working for them in a consultancy role, will return in a more formal capacity. With a Champions League campaign to come, it will be important to add depth. The future of the captain, Son Heung-min, must be resolved – he has one year on his contract and will turn 34 next summer – and a decision must be taken on Cristian Romero, who is a target for Atlético Madrid. Will Mathys Tel be added permanently? The 18-year-old Croatian defender Luka Vuskovic will join from Hajduk Split in a deal put in place in 2023. Fraser Forster, Alfie Whiteman and Sergio Reguilón have been released, while Timo Werner’s loan has ended.David HytnerWest HamMoney is tight because of PSR concerns caused by years of costly, ill-advised deals. The recruitment team have been told that little can be done before sales are made. The problem, though, is that West Ham have few lucrative assets. Much will depend on whether a buyer appears for Mohammed Kudus. Lucas Paquetá could also leave if he is declared not guilty of breaking the Football Association’s betting regulations. As it is, though, Graham Potter knows that he has to be creative as he looks to revamp an ageing squad. West Ham need more legs and youth in midfield, and have scouted Sunderland’s Chris Rigg, Sheffield United’s Sydie Peck and Middlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney. There is also interest in the Sunderland forward Eliezer Mayenda. West Ham want a goalkeeper but are lukewarm on Southampton’s Aaron Ramsdale. A new left-back is also needed.JSWolvesThis summer has so far taken on a familiar theme: headline departures. Matheus Cunha is the latest key player to exit, Manchester United triggering his £62.5m release clause, while Rayan Aït-Nouri is primed to join Manchester City. Twelve months on from Max Kilman leaving for West Ham, Wolves look likely to lose another captain, with Nelson Semedo out of contract this month. It is shaping up to be another rebuild, which Vítor Pereira will oversee. He wants to focus on bringing in at least one forward, while new full-backs will be necessary if Aït-Nouri and Semedo depart. The departure of sporting director, Matt Hobbs will likely give Pereira greater autonomy, with the Italian Domenico Teti, whom Pereira worked with in Saudi Arabia, poised to take on an influential role. The intriguing bit will be whether Jorge Mendes, who represents Pereira, also gains greater control.BFExplore more on these topicsTransfer windowPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Revenues climbed from £48m in the 2022-23 season, an increase driven by growth in commercial revenue, which now accounts for 40% of WSL clubs’ total revenue.

Capitalising on major international tournaments is important at specific points in time, but sustainable growth hinges on the domestic league’s organic development.”The increases were driven mainly by four clubs, with Arsenal (£15.3m), Chelsea (£11.5m), Manchester United (£9.2m) and Manchester City (£6.6m) accounting for about two-thirds of the money made across the league.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueFinancesBusinessWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

I asked Sepp Blatter about Fifa’s United PassionsSean IngleOrganisation’s former president has no regrets over what was lowest grossing film in US history when released a decade agoMon 9 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 07.20 EDTShareThere are movies that bomb at the box office. And then there is theFifabiopic United Passions, starring Tim Roth, Sam Neill and Gérard Depardieu, which was hit with the cinematic equivalent of a thermonuclear strike when it opened in the US 10 years ago this week.You might remember the fallout; the fact it took only$918 (£678) in its opening weekend, making it the lowest grossing film in US history at the time, and the stories detailing how two people bought tickets to see it in Philadelphia, and only one in Phoenix, before it was pulled by distributors.Then there were the reviews. “As cinema it is excrement,” Jordan Hoffman wrote in the Guardian. “As proof of corporate insanity it is a valuable case study. United Passions is a disgrace.” Admittedly, there was never going to be a good time to launch 109 minutes of soft-sheen history and propaganda about Jules Rimet, João Havelange and Sepp Blatter. But when14 Fifa members were indicted on corruption chargesjust days before the $26m (£19m) film’s US release, the film became a byword for hubris and excess. Only in Russia, where it made £140,000 at the box office, did it muster any sort of audience. Although what they made of Neill’s attempt at Havelenge’s accent, which veered wildly between Brazil, New Zealand and Ireland, is anyone’s guess.US state department says World Cup fans ‘want to see’ Donald Trump’s travel banRead moreThe 10th anniversary seemed like the perfect time for me to grit my teeth and watch United Passions for the first time. I also hoped that those involved might have got over their collective embarrassment and would be prepared to talk about it. Was it really the worst sports movie in history? Worse than Rocky V? Or the Love Guru, which starred Mike Myers as a bearded Indian whose task, in thewords of the Observer’s then critic Philip French, “is to counsel a black ice-hockey star whose wife has run off with a French Canadian goalkeeper known as “Le Coq” for the prodigious size of his membrum virile”.Having watched it, I can say that United Passions really is right up there. The script feels like it was written by a 2015 version of ChatGPT that has been programmed to hate the English, who come across as universally pompous. The dodgy stuff in Fifa’s history is danced around, or ignored. And some of it is so cringey it makes you gasp. At one point, for instance, Blatter expresses his fears over the 1978 World Cup in Argentina because the military government is murdering its opponents. “Who cares,” Havelange replies. “During the World Cup they only dream of one thing, that ball. Because football brings consolation to all tragedies and sorrows!” That is the same Havelange who took millions in bribes and kickbacks from Fifa’s deals withthe marketing company ISL.View image in fullscreenTim Roth said his father would be turning in his grave at him portraying Sepp Blatter.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIn fact, United Passions is so comically awful the Internet Movie Database gives it 2.1 out of 10, a ranking so dismal it would qualify for its worst 100 films of all time list if it had the 10,000 votes needed to qualify.When the film came out Roth, who plays Blatter, admitted: “This is a role that will have my father turning in his grave,” before confessing he did it only to put his kids through college. You can fault his performance, but not his honesty. A decade on, however, few others want to revisit it. The publicist sent me a lovely email but didn’t remember many specifics. An ex-Fifa employee jokingly referred to the film as a “blockbuster” but had only vague memories of its genesis. Fifa, meanwhile, didn’t want to comment.The only exception? Blatter himself. When I spoke to his official spokesperson, Thomas Renggli, he asked me to fire over a few questions. A day later, he came back with the replies. “Obviously the movie was not a success,” Blatter, who turns 90 next year, told me. “A movie about Fifa is always controversial, so for me it was not a surprise that the opinions were so different in Russia and in the US.”Blatter also insisted that the concept of United Passions had not come from him and, contrary to internet rumour, he had not tinkered with the script to make himself the hero. “The idea came up after there was a small movie called Goal,” he said. “And in this environment, the Fifa management brought up the idea of producing a big movie. It was definitely not only me behind it. And concerning my part in the production, I was only an adviser. I was not involved in the script.”View image in fullscreenSepp Blatter is not a fan of the upcoming 32-team Club World Cup.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesWhich is just as well, because it is bad. Really, really bad. A few minutes into the film, for instance, Rimet tries to get Football Association bigwigs to join Fifa while speaking to them at half-time during a game. “Our boys are two goals down gentlemen!” Rimet is told. “There are things much more important than life and death. There is football. And at half-time things are deadly serious!”Blatter also insisted he was OK with how the film turned out, but Renggli told me that there was befuddlement when it was shown to Fifa employees before its premiere at the Cannes film festival. “We were all sitting there in this big auditorium and everybody was thinking, ‘what do they want to tell us with this film?’ To me it did not make sense at all.”There are some, of course, who think Fifa will be making another expensive mistake in the US this weekend when it launches its 32-team Club World Cup. The early signs are not positive, with tickets for the opening game between Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami and Al Ahly going for $55 – 16% of the original asking price of $349.There are also concerns with player welfare, given the increase in the number of games and Blatter, who was recentlycleared of fraud by a Swiss court, is not a fan of the tournament, or next year’s expanded 48-team World Cup. “Havelange once told me that I made a monster when I created this wedding between TV and football,” he told me. “But now it’s all too much. There are too many games. And too many teams in the tournaments. Sooner or later, we will have 128 teams, like in a tennis grand slam.”And whatever you think of Blatter, or indeed United Passions, it is hard to disagree too much with those sentiments.Explore more on these topicsFifaSepp BlatterFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

You can’t hide behind the fact that you have few players, you start to find alibis,” Spalletti said. “I did badly and in some ways it is right that I go home.

But Boston’s name has also always been high on the list of candidates overlooked.Hull KR end 45-year wait for Challenge Cup glory as late try denies WarringtonRead moreThat, however, will finally change this week. Boston is expected to be named as a knight on Tuesday to end the sport’s wait for such an honour. The 90-year-old is not only one of rugby league’s greatest players but one of the pioneering black figures in British sport history.Boston was born in Cardiff but his opportunities in rugby union were limited. That led to him signing for Wigan in 1953, where he remained until 1968, setting a number of astonishing records along the way in a glittering career. In 488 games he scored 478 tries, establishing himself as the club’s leading try-scorer with a record that will surely never be beaten. He was also a member of Great Britain’s World Cup-winning squad of 1960, playing for his country on 31 occasions.His accomplishments laid the platform for more players from Wales to make the transition to rugby league from union, with a statue in the centre of Wigan immortalising his importance to the town’s history. There is a similar statue in Cardiff of Boston and two more trailblazers from Wales that starred in league, Clive Sullivan and Gus Risman.Boston’s accomplishments will finally be recognised on a national stage. It is a symbolic moment for league as well as Boston, with the sport getting the honour many believe it has undeservedly lacked for decades.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the pack hit the home straight, he rocketed away from his rivals to collect a 10-second victory bonus and the yellow jersey.“That was really tough,” said Milan. “I was dropped at one point and I was really on the limit, but I have to say thanks to my teammates because they brought me back and guided me until the last metres.”Britain’s Fred Wright (Bahrain-Victorious) was second and the Dutch rider Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) third. Pogacar and his main rivals for overall victory, Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel, rolled home safely in the main pack just behind Milan.UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider Pogacar, who collected a 10-second bonus on Sunday, has the same overall time as Milan, but braked hard in the final metres to surrender places and hand the Italian the tie-break edge and the daily media responsibilities that go with the yellow jersey.View image in fullscreenTadej Pogacar will not be wearing yellow for the third stage of the Critérium du Dauphiné but remains in an excellent overall position.Photograph: Stefano Cavasino/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockThe eight-day race, with four hilly stages, a time trial and three final days in the Alps, has attracted an A-list roster of 154 riders from 22 teams.

The rebels want to attract 300 male players and are targeting “the best of the best” with a view to launching in September next year.While R360’s plans would allow for player release for international fixtures, an agreement between the Premiership and theRugby Football Unionwould render any England stars who join the breakaway ineligible for Steve Borthwick’s side. R360, though, still appears to pose a distinct threat to the Premiership.Georgiou, however, said: “I’ve been involved in sport for 25 years. I can’t tell you how many of these PowerPoint presentations have come across my desk with people who were absolutely certain that what they had on that page was going to be the new thing. It was going to be absolutely the new thing.“ The one question is, how are they going to grow the revenue by putting this event on? Where’s the money coming from? The media industry is going through a massive generational change.“So if these folks believe that they are going to grow the revenue by putting this thing on, I think they’re delusional. I really do. What it will do is further complicate what is already a well-functioning rugby ecosystem.”Figures at Premiership Rugby are relaxed about the prospect of R360 and point to their continued growth with average audiences up 10% this season, a million new fans, a 30% growth among supporters aged 18-36 and a record-breaking sellout for the final on Saturday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tournament is still dominated by European and South American teams. But which continent without a winner (Asia, Africa, Central and North America and, I guess, Oceania) has the best chance of lifting the trophy first?– StaceyThis is a fascinating question and one that brings a wide range of factors into play. To start, what difference will theexpansion of the tournamentmake? On one hand, extending the tournament so the winner will have to get through eight games rather than seven probably makes shocks less likely, but on the other hand an extra knockout round adds another layer of randomness. Even with four knockout rounds, most champions usually had at least one game of significant jeopardy – a win on penalties, or an edgy one-goal victory after extra-time. Winning all five knockout games in 90 minutes, I suspect, will prove extremely rare but the likelihood is still that the winner will be one of the major European powers – France, Spain, Germany, England, Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands – or one of the big two from South America – Argentina and Brazil.On a similar note, weight of numbers should help the other confederations: 15 of the 32 qualifiers in 2022 were from outside Uefa and Conmebol; in 2026 either 25 or 26 of 48 will be. That should increase the chance of a side hitting a run of exceptional form at the right time.But this isn’t just about confederations. Between 2006 and 2018, 13 of 16 semi-finalists in the World Cup were European. There was a clear sense within the game that the major western European nations had in effect industrialised youth production – to the extent that the majority of, say, Morocco’s squad in 2022, had been trained in France. Add a wealthy league in which the best of a nation’s youth can gain an exceptional and immediate education and the advantage enjoyed by western Europe is clear. Argentina bucked that trend in 2022, in part because of the brilliance of Lionel Messi, and in part because of its remarkable reserves of coaching talent (seven of the 10 Conmebol nations are managed by Argentinians, and that’s without counting Óscar Ibáñez, who was born in Argentina but played for and now manages Peru).But to return to the specifics of the question: money helps, so the USA, Mexico and Canada have at least a slim chance of success. Africa has the talent but its football – and this is obviously a generalisation – is beset by poverty and corruption. Morocco showed their capacity in Qatar, and if, say, Nigeria or Senegal managed to find an enlightened coach who could bypass all the political issues at the same time they had a gifted generation, there’s no reason there couldn’t be an African winner – although it doesn’t feel imminent.Asia, perhaps, is most likely, although we’re probably only talking about three countries at the moment.Japanand South Korea have been regular World Cup qualifiers, their level has improved dramatically, there ismoney to invest, a deep-rooted passion for the game, and their players are increasingly gaining experience at the best clubs.Or there’s Saudi Arabia, a traditional power in the Asian game, and hosts in 2034. We’re yet to see what impact all the Saudi PIF’s investment in football will have, but money, a political will to succeed, an improving league must give them at least an outside chance with home advantage in eight years.As an American, I defy anyone to argue the 1994 World Cup jersey is not the best in soccer history. Do you have any personal favorites?– MattI confess I find the fetishisation of shirts a little odd. I hate over-fussy shirts, and I wish Sunderland would go back to black socks, but I’m not sure there are any shirts I really love. I was talking to a friend about this on the way to theChampionship play-off final, looking at the masses of red-and-white all around while we were both wearing very neutral check shirts. We wondered whether it’s because in our formative years of going to games, away games especially, in the late 80s and early 90s, it was useful to be able to blend into the background if any violence kicked off.But I suppose if pressed, I always quite liked the simple Adidas, early 80s, plain colour with three stripes along the sleeves – the pale-blue West Germany goalkeeper’s top in particular.What will predominate: the next tactical evolution, or the rise of the nation-state owner in European and English football?– AndrewI don’t think you can separate the two. Ownership, whether state or otherwise, necessarily creates the conditions in which the game is played. So Pep Guardiola, for instance, was in effect asked to devise his ideal environment at Manchester City, and the result was six league titles in seven seasons. City’s owners had the financial might to attract him to the club, to give him the facilities he needed and to provide an extremely high-level squad. As a result, there was little need to compromise on his principles as a manager at a less wealthy club might have had to.Or take Paris Saint-Germain. Coach after coach was undermined by the club’s insistence on signing major stars, which may have been good for the brand, but left the team on the pitch looking distinctly unbalanced. Once the club changed approach, Luis Enrique was able to put together the side that won the Champions League. What was necessary was the money to buy a squad good enough, but also owners prepared to let a sporting director and manager put together a coherent side free from the egos of the celebrities they had previously been burdened with.It’s probably my age – I’ve watched football for nearly 70 years – but I really miss old-fashioned wingers, playing on the “correct” wing, beating their defender on the outside and providing crosses for their fellow attackers. The case for inverted wingers seems to be that coming “inside” on to their stronger foot increases their chances of shooting and scoring. It’s now de rigueur for wingers to be inverted. Does the likelihood of inverted wingers scoring goals by coming inside really compensate for the fewer effective crosses they make for their fellow attackers?– Derekskip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The preference now is either for wide players cutting infield – Peter Taylor was a pioneer in England, but Dennis Tueart and others did it as well – or to work the ball to the goalline for a low cutback – the classic Manchester City goal of a couple of seasons ago.One of the reasons wide forwards now cut inside is the explosion in attacking full-backs, who now provide most of the width. A full-back could go inside, as say Trent Alexander-Arnold or João Cancelo do, but that is relatively rare and if the full-back is going on the outside, the wide forward has go inside to create space for him. I think there’s also a recognition that forwards cutting in, often against the defender’s weaker foot, is very hard to combat – hence the rise in the sort of goal Lamine Yamal seems to score every week, whipping the ball into the far corner.On this day …View image in fullscreenKevin Keegan embraced celebrity more than most other players of his time.Photograph: Manchester Daily Express/SSPL/Getty ImagesKevin Keegan was perhaps the first English player, certainly in the postwar years, to make a success of a move to a European giant. He left Liverpool in 1977 for Hamburg, where he won the league in 1978-79 and was twice named European Footballer of the Year. He also marketed himself with an eagerness unusual in English players of the time, becoming a bona fide celebrity. And, on 9 June 1979, he released his second, but by some distance his most successful single, Head Over Heels in Love.His first single, It Ain’t Easy, had been released in 1972, just a year after he’d moved to Liverpool from Scunthorpe and made very little impression. But Head Over Heels reached No 31 in the UK charts, and No 10 in Germany. And this is where those of a nervous disposition should look away. Keegan gave a preview of the song on Das Aktuelle Sport-Studio. His German seems very good, but that thought soon fades as he gets to the performance …This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

The reason: He was showing Dončić – who he called “my dear friend” – support.“As a matter of fact, I want everybody to know I’m wearing Luka’s shoes, his new shoes from Nike that just got on the market,” Nelson said. “I’m wearing them in protest for the trade from Dallas.

You put his number up and you honor that player. That’s been my philosophy.”Nelson has deep ties to Dallas, so his reaction to the Dončić trade is understandable.

In Game 2, they made sure there was no repeat, utterly dominating their opponents in a 123-107 victory that leveled the series at 1-1.In Game 1, the Thunder had a 12-point lead at half-time and a 15-point lead in the fourth quarterbefore losing to the Pacerscourtesy of a Tyrese Haliburton basket in the final second. On Sunday night, they took control of the game early on, but this time they didn’t let their advantage go.“A lot of it comes down to just not panicking,” said Thunder’s Jalen Williams of his team’s ability to come back from their defeat in Game 1. “We always talk about winning the days in between [games] so just going back and looking at the film, and realizing not everything is as bad or as good as it seems in the moment.”The result was perhaps not a surprise: the Thunder were 17-2 coming off a loss this season and are yet to lose back-to-back games in this season’s playoffs. And both teams would have recognized that Oklahoma City controlled most of Game 1, only to falter late under a surge led by Haliburton. In Game 2, however, the Thunder executed a far more complete performance, asserting control across all phases. Their aggressive defensive rotations disrupted Indiana’s rhythm, preventing the kind of scoring runs that had enabled the Pacers’ comeback in the opener.“[Our defense] is where it starts,” said Thunder’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander after the game. “They’re a high powered offense and if you don’t get stops, you end up running all night and they can beat you that way.”For the second game in a row, Gilgeous-Alexander was the game’s top scorer, with 34 points, but the reigningNBAMVP also had excellent support off the bench, notably from Alex Caruso and and Aaron Wiggins, who scored 20 and 18 points respectively.Haliburton was the Pacers’ top-scorer with 17 points. That means no Indiana player has passed 20 points in a game this series, a tribute to the Thunder’s defense as much as any failings on the part of the Pacers.“A bad first half, obviously, was a big problem,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “And we just played poorly. A little better in the second half. But you can’t be a team that’s reactive and expect to be successful or have consistency.”The best-of-seven series heads to Indiana for Game 3 on Wednesday night.Explore more on these topicsNBA finalsOklahoma City ThunderIndiana PacersBasketballUS sportsNBAnewsShareReuse this content"

Large reasoning models attempt to solve complex queries by generating detailed thinking processes that break down the problem into smaller steps.AI pioneer announces non-profit to develop ‘honest’ artificial intelligenceRead moreThe study, which tested the models’ ability to solve puzzles, added that as LRMs neared performance collapse they began “reducing their reasoning effort”. TheAppleresearchers said they found this “particularly concerning”.Gary Marcus, a US academic who has become a prominent voice of caution on the capabilities of AI models, described the Apple paper as “pretty devastating”.Writing in his newsletter on Substack,Marcus added that the findings raised questions about the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI),a theoretical stage of AIat which a system is able to match a human at carrying out any intellectual task.Referring to the large language models [LLMs] that underpin tools such as ChatGPT, Marcus wrote: “Anybody who thinks LLMs are a direct route to the sort [of] AGI that could fundamentally transform society for the good is kidding themselves.”The paper also found that reasoning models wasted computing power by finding the right solution for simpler problems early in their “thinking”. However, as problems became slightly more complex, models first explored incorrect solutions and arrived at the correct ones later.For higher-complexity problems, however, the models would enter “collapse”, failing to generate any correct solutions. In one case, even when provided with an algorithm that would solve the problem, the models failed.The paper said: “Upon approaching a critical threshold – which closely corresponds to their accuracy collapse point – models counterintuitively begin to reduce their reasoning effort despite increasing problem difficulty.”The Apple experts said this indicated a “fundamental scaling limitation in the thinking capabilities of current reasoning models”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The researchers acknowledged that the focus on puzzles represented a limitation in the work.The paper concluded that the current approach to AI may have reached limitations. It tested models including OpenAI’s o3, Google’s Gemini Thinking, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Thinking andDeepSeek-R1. Anthropic, Google and DeepSeek have been contacted for comment. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, declined to comment.Referring to “generalisable reasoning” – or an AI model’s ability to apply a narrow conclusion more broadly – the paper said: “These insights challenge prevailing assumptions about LRM capabilities and suggest that current approaches may be encountering fundamental barriers to generalisable reasoning.”Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the Apple paper signalled the industry was “still feeling its way” on AGI and that the industry could have reached a “cul-de-sac” in its current approach.“The finding that large reason models lose the plot on complex problems, while performing well on medium- and low-complexity problems implies that we’re in a potential cul-de-sac in current approaches,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)AppleComputingOpenAIDeepSeekGooglenewsShareReuse this content"

It also mandated the creation of direct hotlines to tech company personnel for law enforcement and a 72-hour response window for police requests, a higher burden than under current law.Additionally, platforms would have had to report on how many minors used their services, how often they did so, for how long and how much those young users engaged with content that violated company policies. Several big tech firms registered official positions on the bill. According to Colorado lobbying disclosures,Meta’s longtime in-state lobby firm, Headwater Strategies, is registered as a proponent for changing the bill.Googleand TikTok also hired lobbyists to oppose it.View image in fullscreen‘[Legislators] chose big tech over protecting children and families.’Illustration: Andrei Cojocaru/Guardian“We’re just extremely disappointed,” said Kim Osterman, whose 18-year-old son Max died in 2021 after purchasing drugs spiked with fentanyl from a dealer he met on Snapchat. “[Legislators] chose big tech over protecting children and families.”Colorado legislators agree to hold social media companies responsible for protecting childrenProtections for users of social media (SB 25-086)passed both chambers before being vetoed on 24 April by governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, whocited thebill’s potential to “erode privacy, freedom and innovation” as reasons for his veto. Colorado’s senate voted to override the veto on 25 April, yet those efforts fell apart on 28 April when the state house opted to delay the vote until after the legislative session ended, effectively blocking an override and keeping the bill alive.The bill originally passed the senate by a 29-6 vote and the house by a 46-18 margin. On 25 April, the senate voted 29-6 to override Polis’s veto. Lawmakers anticipated that the house would take up the override later that day. At the time, according to those interviewed, there appeared to be enough bipartisan support to successfully overturn his veto.“It was an easy vote for folks because of what we were voting on: protecting kids from social media companies,” said the senator Lindsey Daugherty, a Democrat and a co-sponsor of the bill. She said she urged house leadership to hold the vote Friday, but they declined: “The speaker knew the governor didn’t want us to do it on Friday, because they knew we would win.”The parents who advocated for the bill attribute its failure to an unexpected, 11th-hour lobbying campaign by afar-right gun owners’ associationin Colorado. Two state legislators as well as seven people involved in the legislative process echoed the parents’ claims.An abnormal, last-minute campaign disrupts bipartisan consensusRocky Mountain Gun Owners (RMGO) cast the bill as an instrument of government censorship in texts and emails over the legislation’s provisions against “ghost guns”, untraceable weapons assembled from kits purchased online, which would have been prohibited.RMGO launched massive social media and email campaigns urging its 200,000 members to contact their legislators to demand they vote against the bill. A source with knowledge of the workings of the Colorado state house described the gun group’s social media and text campaigns, encouraging Republicans voters to contact their legislators to demand opposition to the bill, as incessant.“[Legislators] were getting countless calls and emails and being yelled at by activists. It was a full-fledged attack. There was a whole campaign saying: ‘This is a government censorship bill,’” they said.The group’s actions were instrumental in a campaign to deter house Republicans from voting against the veto, resulting in the quashing of the bill, and unexpected from an organization that had been facing funding shortfalls, according to 10 people interviewed who were involved in the design of the bill and legislative process. Sources in the Colorado state house spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal from RMGO.The house had delayed the vote until 28 April, which allowed RMGO time to launch a campaign against the bill over the weekend. When lawmakers reconvened Monday, the house voted 51-13 to postpone the override until after the legislative session ended – effectively killing the effort.View image in fullscreen‘It was a full-fledged attack. There was a whole campaign saying: “This is a government censorship bill.”’Illustration: Andrei Cojocaru/GuardianThe gun activists’ mass text message campaign to registered Republican voters asserted the social media bill would constitute an attempt to “compel social media companies to conduct mass surveillance of content posted on their platforms” to search for violations of Colorado’s gun laws, describing the bill as an attack on first and second amendment rights, according to texts seen by the Guardian.A familiar, aggressive foeFounded in 1996, RMGO claims to have a membership of more than200,000 activists. It is recognized as afar-right groupthat takes a “no-compromise” stance on gun rights.Dudley Brown, its founder and leader, also serves as thepresidentof the National Association for Gun Rights, whichpositions itself further to the rightthan the National Rifle Association (NRA). RMGO hasmounted criticism againstthe NRA for being too moderate and politically compromising. Critics have described RMGO as “bullies” and “extremists” because of its combative tactics, which include targeting and smearingDemocrats and moderate Republicans. The group did not respond to requests for comment on its legislative efforts.RMGO is a well-known presence at the Colorado capitol, typically opposing gun-control legislation. Daugherty described its typical campaign tactics as “scary”. She got rid of her X account after being singled out by the group over her work on a bill to ban assault weapons earlier this year.“When we were running any of the gun bills at the capitol, they put my and some other legislators’ faces on their websites,” she said. A screenshot of a tweet from RMGO showed Daugherty with a red “traitor” stamp on her forehead.The group’s campaign resulted in the spread of misinformation about the bill’s impact on gun ownership rights, sources involved in the legislative process said.“The reason I was in support of the bill, and in support of the override, was it has to do with child trafficking and protecting the kids,” said the senator Rod Pelton, a Republican, who voted in favor of the veto override in the senate. “I just didn’t really buy into the whole second amendment argument.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The group generally weighs in on legislation earlier in the process, according to eight sources, including two of the bill’s co-sponsors, Daugherty and the representative Andy Boesenecker.“They really ramped up their efforts,” Boesenecker said. “It was curious to me that their opposition came in very late and appeared to be very well funded at the end.”In recent years, RMGO group had been less active due to well-documented money problems that limited its ability to campaign on legislative issues. In a 2024 interview, the group’s leaders stated plainly that itstruggled with funding. Daugherty believes RMGO would not have been able to embark on such an apparently costly outreach campaign without a major infusion of cash. A major text campaign like the one launched for SB-86 was beyond their financial capacity, she said. Others in Colorado politics agreed.“Rocky Mountain Gun Owners have not been important or effective in probably at least four years in the legislature. They’ve had no money, and then all of a sudden they had tons of money, funding their rise back into power,” said Dawn Reinfeld, executive director ofBlue Rising Together, a Colorado-based non-profit focused on youth rights.The campaign made legislators feel threatened, with primary elections in their districts over the weekend, Daugherty said, particularly after accounts on X, formerly Twitter, bombarded the bill’s supporters.View image in fullscreen‘The bill gave me hope that Avery’s legacy would be to help. So when it didn’t pass, it was pretty soul-crushing.’Illustration: Andrei Cojocaru/Guardian“Folks were worried about being primaried, mostly the Republicans, and that’s kind of what it came down to,” Daugherty said.Aaron Ping’s 16-year-old son Avery died of an overdose in December after buying what he thought was ecstasy over Snapchat and receiving instead a substance laced with fentanyl. Ping saw the campaign against the bill as an intentional misconstrual of its intent.“It was looking like the bill was going to pass, until all this misinformation about it taking away people’s gun rights because it addresses people buying illegal shadow guns off the internet,” he said.Ping gave testimony in support of the bill in February before the first senate vote, alongside other bereaved parents, teens in recovery and a district attorney.“The bill gave me hope that Avery’s legacy would be to help. So when it didn’t pass, it was pretty soul-crushing,” said Ping.Battle lines drawn as US states take on big tech with online child safety billsRead moreStates take up online child-safety bills as federal lawmakers falterSeveral states, including California, Maryland, Vermont, Minnesota, Hawaii, Illinois, New Mexico, South Carolina and Nevada, have introduced legislation aimed at improving online safety for children in the past two years. These efforts have faced strong resistance from the tech industry,including heavy lobbyingand lawsuits.Maryland became the first state to successfully pass a Kids Code bill, signing it into law in May 2024. But the victory may be short-lived: NetChoice, a tech industry coalition representing companies including Meta, Google and Amazon, quicklylaunched a legal challengeagainst the measure, which is ongoing.Meanwhile, in the US federal government, the kids online safety act (Kosa), which had wound its way through the legislature for years, died in February when itfailed to pass in the Houseafter years of markups and votes. Arevamped versionof the bill was reintroduced to Congress on 14 May.In California, a similar bill known as the age-appropriate design code act, modeled after UK legislation, was blocked in late 2023. A federal judge grantedNetChoice a preliminary injunction, citing potential violations of the first amendment, which stopped the law from going into effect.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

The risk assessment process is viewed as key aspect of the act.Meta’s content moderation changes ‘hugely concerning’, says Molly Rose FoundationRead moreIn a letter to Ofcom’s chief executive, Melanie Dawes, organisations including the Molly Rose Foundation, the NSPCC and the Internet Watch Foundation described the prospect of AI-driven risk assessments as a “retrograde and highly alarming step”.They said: “We urge you to publicly assert that risk assessments will not normally be considered as ‘suitable and sufficient’, the standard required by … the act, where these have been wholly or predominantly produced through automation.”The letter also urged the watchdog to “challenge any assumption that platforms can choose to water down their risk assessment processes”.A spokesperson for Ofcom said: “We’ve been clear that services should tell us who completed, reviewed and approved their risk assessment.

We use technology, overseen by humans, to improve our ability to manage harmful content and our technological advancements have significantly improved safety outcomes.”The Molly Rose Foundation organised the letter after the US broadcaster NPR reported last month that updates to Meta’s algorithms and new safety features would mostly be approved by an AI system and no longer scrutinised by staffers.According to one former Meta executive who spoke to NPR anonymously, the change will allow the company to launch app updates and features on Facebook,Instagramand WhatsApp more quickly but will create “higher risks” for users, because potential problems are less likely to be prevented before a new product is released to the public.NPR also reported that Meta was considering automating reviews for sensitive areas including youth risk and monitoring the spread of falsehoods.Explore more on these topicsMetaArtificial intelligence (AI)OfcomInternet safetyFacebookInstagramWhatsAppnewsShareReuse this content"

But Getty called the people who were training the AI system “a bunch of tech geeks” and claimed they were indifferent to the problems their innovation might create.Stability countered by alleging that Getty was using “fanciful” legal routes and spending approximately £10m to fight a technology it feared was “an existential threat” to its business.The ‘death of creativity’? AI job fears stalk advertising industryRead moreGetty represents the work of almost 600,000 content creators globally. It alleges Stability trained its image generation model on its vast database of copyrighted photographs. As a result the program, called Stability Diffusion, outputs images with Getty Images watermarks still on them. Getty alleges that Stability was “completely indifferent to what they fed into the training data”. It told the court the system amounted to “sticking our trademark on pornography” and “AI rubbish”.Lawyers for Getty said the dispute over the unlicensed use of thousands of its photographs, including images of celebrities, politicians and news events, “is not a battle between creatives and technology, where a win for Getty Images means the end of AI”.They added: “The problem is when AI companies such as Stability want to use those works without payment.”Lindsay Lane KC, representing Getty Images, said: “This was a bunch of tech geeks who were so excited by AI that they were indifferent to any of the dangers or problems it presents.”In submissions to the court on Monday Getty claimed Stability had trained its image generation model on databases that contained child sexual abuse material.Stability is fighting the overall Getty claim and its lawyer said the allegations relating to child sexual abuse material were “repugnant”.A spokesperson for Stability AI said it was committed to preventing misuse of its technology, “particularly in the creation and dissemination of harmful content, including CSAM [child sexual abuse material]”. It said it had robust safeguards “to enhance our safety standards to protect against bad actors”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over more than a decade, Google and the Facebook owner, Meta, successfully built tech tools for publishers and ad buyers that helped them to dominate online. Big tech hoovered up almost two-thirds of the £45bn spent by advertisers in the UK this year. Now, Mark Zuckerbergwants to take over making the ads, too.The WPP firm VML used AI to create the ‘One Bic, One Book, Two Classics’ campaign for Bic in Brazil.Photograph: WPPTheMetaboss is gearing up to unleash AI tools to allow advertisers to fully create and target campaigns on his social media sites, prompting fears of the “death of creativity” – and widespread job cuts at agencies.Last week it emerged that these tools are to berolled out by the end of next year, with Zuckerberg describing the capability in a recent interview as a “redefinition of the category of advertising. You don’t need any creative, you don’t need any targeting, you don’t need any measurement, except to be able to read the results that we spit out,” he said last month, in comments that appear to render much of the advertising industry obsolete.Rahul Dravid in Cadbury’s Bournvita campaign, which used AI.Agencies of all sizes – and particularly the deep-pocketed international groups such as WPP, Publicis and Omnicom – are pouring investment into developing their own AI tools and working with tech companies such as Meta andGoogle. But the plan is meant to be to keep clients, not lose them.“I think there is no doubt AI will disintermediate a large number of jobs,” says the chief executive of one big ad agency. “Having said that, there are many agencies with big corporate clients that really could do with being slimmed down a lot. I can see staffing in areas like strategy, consumer insight and some conceptual roles being safe, but what will be really hit is those involved in production and the realisation of ideas.”Big tech executives espoused the benefits of AI at the annual Enders Deloitte conference on the media and telecoms industry last week.Stephan Pretorius, who described himself as “WPP’s AI guy” as he co-led a session with Meta, said: “Creativity, in its purest form, remains a human skill.”WPP’s Stephan Pretorius on AI and advertising.He argued that AI does not equate to job cuts but admitted that agencies need to restructure and advertising client relationships are changing.“AI replaces tasks, it eliminates tasks, it doesn’t eliminate jobs,” he said. “A lot of what we used to get paid for is now getting automated and therefore our commercial models have to change, our team structures have to change. The way we are incentivised by our clients is changing. But that is the transition.”Last month WPP said there would be an undisclosed number of redundancies globally across WPP Media, formerly known as GroupM, which plans and buys billions of pounds of ad space for clients across digital and traditional media.“You have a situation where the big holding companies are in a dilemma,” another ad agency chief executive says. “Clients expect us to invest millions developing AI so they can cut their budgets because things can be done quicker and cheaper. Lots of clients are asking for fee reductions.”So far the AI revolution does not appear to be having a big impact on the UK industry.View image in fullscreenThe Facebook and Instagram owner, Meta, has said it will release AI tools to allow advertisers to fully create and target campaigns on social media sites.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThere were a record 26,787 people employed in media, creative and digital agencies last year, according to the Institute of Practitioners inAdvertising(IPA), the trade body for agencies that represent 85% of ad spend by clients in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You hear creatives saying that AI is never going to come up with something as brilliant as, say,a gorilla playing drums for Cadbury, but I am not so sure. AI will eventually become fine-tuned enough to react to the quite left-field conceptual prompting.”View image in fullscreenThe Cadbury’s Dairy Milk TV advert featuring a gorilla playing the drums – created by the ad agency Fallon – became a viral hit.Photograph: Rex FeaturesSince making the comments that the industry took to mean that Meta is seeking to supplant the role of agencies, Zuckerberg has tried to clarify that the AI tools are primarily expected to be used by small and medium-sized businesses.“In the future, if you were working with a creative agency to make creative, you’ll probably keep doing that,” he said at the Stripe conference, clarifying his position a week after making his initial comments about the scope of Meta’s AI advertising plans. “If you aren’t and you’re just hacking something together and throwing it into Meta’s ad system, well now we’re going to be able to come up with 4,000 different versions of your creative and just test them and figure out which one works best.”Meta and Google have always considered that they have “democratised” advertising by enabling the long tail of millions of small businesses that do not have the financial wherewithal to run TV ad campaigns, or employ an ad agency to run campaigns.“That is the smokescreen they always use,” the ad agency boss says. “When they first emerged as new ad channels decades ago it was all about small businesses, and now they take nearly two-thirds of all UK ad spend.”In the noughties, as big tech grew increasingly powerful, Sir Martin Sorrell, who built WPP into the world’s biggest ad group and is now the chief executive of S4 Capital,labelled Meta and Google “frenemies”– meaning they can be seen as a partner and as a competitive threat to agencies.Two decades on, the rise of AI in advertising is the latest technological development forcing the industry to once again adapt to survive.“Meta’s new promise to ‘auto-generate your ad in seconds’ is the clearest sign yet that the production sausage factory is about to be fully mechanised,” says Patrick Garvey, the co-founder of the independent agency We Are Pi. “It’s not the death of agencies. It’s the death of outdated agency models.”He is supportive of small businesses benefiting from the changes but says Meta’s approach to AI is akin to the “fast food of advertising”. For traditional companies in adland, it could be a difficult meal to stomach.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)MetaTechnology sectorAdvertisingWPP (Media)WPP (Business)GooglefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The app responded: “During the college entrance examination, according to relevant requirements, the question answering service will be suspended”.An attempt by the user to tell the app “this is not the college entrance examination” prompted the same response.Another screenshot also revealedDeepSeek, a leading generative AI toolnew to the Chinese market this year, was telling users that their service was not available during specific hours “to ensure fairness in the college entrance examination”.Yuanbao, owned by the tech company Tencent, Alibaba’s Qwen, and Moonshot’s Kimi have also turned off their picture recognition functions during exam hours,Bloomberg reports.View image in fullscreenStudents attend a pep rally to mark the 100-day countdown to thegaokaoexams.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesThe Guardian has contacted the relevant companies for comment, none of which have made public statements about the functions freeze. The suspension appears to have been publicised largely by university students who have been locked out of tools to assist them in their study and assignments.“College entrance exam candidates, you are all shit,” read one tongue-in-cheek complaint on Weibo. “I can’t use DeepSeek to upload pictures, I have to download ChatGPT again, I hope you all go to community college​​​​.”The AI suspension is not the only tool being used to prevent cheating in thegaokaoexam week, which can decide a young person’s entire future. Several regions have previously announced they would be using AI monitoring tools to watch for “abnormal behaviours”,such as whispers or repeated glancesbetween students, during exams.View image in fullscreenHigh-school students in Handan, Hebei province, work through exam papers.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIn Jiangxi province, for example, footage will be reviewed after the exam and any violations or misconduct “dealt with strictly in accordance with relevant regulations”, the state-backed Global Times reports.Late last month, Chinese authorities also announced stricter entry checks at exam points, biometric identification, enhanced screening for digital devices, and radio signal blockers, state media reported.Reflecting how seriously Chinese society views thegaokao, some cities have postponed disruptive events such as public performances, delayed office starting hours and created dedicated priority traffic lanes to ensure students arrive to the test on time.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingAsia PacificStudentsExamsUniversitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The government said officials would be tasked with figuring how they could use AI technology to streamline their own work wherever possible.Officials are already piloting a package of AI tools called Humphrey – named after the senior civil servant Sir Humphrey Appleby from the 1980s TV sitcom Yes, Minister.Revealed: bias found in AI system used to detect UK benefits fraudRead moreIn March, it was announced that officials would be told to abide by a mantra that says: “No person’s substantive time should be spent on a task where digital or AI can do it better, quicker and to the same high quality and standard.”The practical training, set to roll out this autumn, will give all civil servants a working-level knowledge of AI and show how it is already being used to cut the time spent on everyday tasks.A recent pilot of AI by the Scottish government used a Humphrey tool to sift consultation responses about regulating cosmetic surgery such as lip filler procedures and found its results were similar to those produced by humans but it was quicker.No decision has yet been taken on its wider rollout but the government said across 500 annual consultations the tool could help spare officials from as much as 75,000 days of analysis every year, which costs the government £20m in staffing costs.The Department for Work and Pensions is also using AI to understand high volumes of correspondence, which used to take weeks. This allows benefits or pensions recipients to be identified as potentially vulnerable and in need of urgent support.In a message to all staff, Sir Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, said he was “proud” of the civil service’s “ability to continuously adapt to new challenges” as he urged them to consider how it “needs to evolve and reform”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a very big deal, not just because it marks the first time Xbox has co-branded a console (with high-end PC specialists Republic of Gamers), but because it’s packing top-of-the-line hardware under its hood. I played the Xbox Ally X, one of two models coming before Christmas, a few hours after they were revealed during 8 June’s Xbox Showcase, and can easily see it becoming a serious competitor for both the Switch 2 and Valve’s Steam Deck.TheXboxAlly springs from the coupling of four different tech firms: Windows, Xbox, AMD and Asus, and it’s definitely their golden child. Both the Xbox Ally and Ally X models have 7-inch 1080p touchscreens, with 16GB of RAM in the Ally and 24GB of RAM in the Ally X, and 512GB SSD storage and 1TB, respectively. Each has Ryzen Z2 chips, though Xbox Ally X has the AI Z2 chip, which integrates an AI processor directly into the silicon. As for what that actually means for players, Microsoft’s head of gaming devices, Roanne Sones, said during a presentation that players will be able to “take advantage of AI experiences without having to compromise anything on the GPU”. The devices both run Windows, but the team has modified it for optimal gaming.“We’re not loading up the Windows desktop,” Xbox Experiences VP Jason Beaumont said. “We’re not loading up the icons and the task bar and components that really aren’t about playing video games … we can save a bunch of resources and then give those to the game, so that they can perform better.”You can access your collection of games with a library button on the device (there’s also a new Xbox button that functions similarly to the one on a console controller). This library includes your PC games from Xbox and other stores, and will let you stream games from your existing Xbox console, if you own one. If you have an Xbox Game Pass subscription, hundreds of games are available to play on the Allies straight away.View image in fullscreenROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGDuring Microsoft’s presentation in LA, I’m handed an Xbox Ally X over my right shoulder. I have rather small hands, and this thing is big (and heavier than the Switch 2), but it doesn’t feel overwhelming. As a gamer who prefers the ergonomics of an Xbox controller to a PlayStation DualSense, I appreciate the asymmetrical joysticks and how the outer curvature mimics the Xbox pad.The Xbox Ally X boots up immediately into a homepage that shows your most recently played Xbox games, styled much like the console homepage. We’re told to navigate to Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the 2006 classic that’s launching on 26 August. As a huge Gearsfan, the effect of loading a beautifully remastered version of a game I haven’t played in nearly 20 years on a console held between my palms is pretty wild.Muscle memory immediately kicks in: press A to magnet Marcus to a chest-high wall, reload your gun faster by timing a press of the R1 button – except I’m holding this game that shaped my teen years in my lap. I don’t get more than 10 minutes with Gears of War: Reloaded before the Xbox Ally X is somewhat unceremoniously plucked from my hands, and we’re shown a quick summary video with talking heads from Microsoft, Windows, ASUS and AMD. One of them says that the power and capabilities of the Xbox Ally X were “inconceivable even three years ago”.There’s no price point yet, perhaps because the uncertainty of President Trump’s tariffs has Microsoft hesitant to name one at the moment. However, the look, feel, and function of the ROG Xbox Ally will make it a great option for those looking to access both Xbox and third-party games on a portable console, while the Xbox Ally X seems tailor-made for performance perfectionists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Australian reporter Lauren Tomasi was the second journalist after the British photographer Nick Stern to beshot with non-lethal roundswhile covering protests in Los Angeles sparked by immigration raids. But she was the first to be caught on camera and beamed around the world. There’s no excuse for not knowing what the US is becoming, now that anyone can watch that clip online. Not when you can hear her scream and see the cameraman quickly swing away to film a panicking crowd.It was the scenario everyone feared when Donald Trump took office. Deportation hit squads descending on the kind of Democrat-voting communities who would feel morally bound to resist them, triggering the kind of violent confrontation that creates an excuse to send in national guard troops – and ultimately a showdown between federal and state power that could take US democracy to the brink. Now something like this may be unfolding in California, wherethe state governor, Gavin Newsom, has accused the president of trying to “manufacture a crisis” for his own ends and warned that any protester responding with violence is only playing into his hands. Suddenly, the idea that this presidency could ultimately end in civil conflict no longer seems quite so wildly overblown as it once did.Or to put it another way, Trump has got what he wanted, which is for everyone to switch channels: to stop gawping at his embarrassing fallout with Elon Musk over unfunded tax cuts, and flick over to the rival spectacle he has hastily created. After a brief interruption to scheduled programming, the great showman is back in control. But in the meantime, the world has learned something useful about who wins in a standoff between two giant egos, one of whom has all the money and the other of whom has all the executive power. In US oligarchies just as in Russian ones, it turns out, it’s presidents who still get to set the agenda.You can’t ride the tiger. That’s the lesson here: once populism has grasped the levers of power, even the richest man in the world cannot be sure of exploiting it for his own ends, or imposing his own agenda on the chaos. Not when a vengeful White House still has the power to destroy even the most powerful business empire, anyway. At the weekend, Muskmeekly deleted explosive tweetsabout the president’s alleged relationship with the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, and by Monday he was loyally sharing Trumpian messages about the LA protests. His father, meanwhile, tactfully blamed the outburst onMusk Junior being “tired”after five months working round the clock for the White House.That ought to ring some bells on this side of the Atlantic. For oddly enough, it’s the same excuse offered up by Zia Yusuf, the millionaire businessman brought in to professionalise Reform UK’s perennially chaotic operation, who last week quit as chair in exasperation. Trying to get the party into power was no longer a “good use of his time”, he tweeted, after publicly clashing with its newest MP, Sarah Pochin, over her decision to ask a question in parliament about banning burqas (which isn’t officially Reform policy, or at least not yet). Yusuf, a British Muslim, has long been seen as Farage’s trusted bulwark against those inside Reform desperate to pick up where the jailed thug Stephen Yaxley-Lennon left off, and to become a full-blown, far-right anti-Islam movement.But this time, it seems, Yusuf may have bitten off more than the boss was ready to chew. A whole two days after storming out, Yusuf ended upstorming awkwardly back in, telling the BBC that actually, having thought about it, he probablywouldban burqas and other face coverings. He had just been exhausted, he suggested, after barely having a day off in 11 months. (If nothing else, it seems Reform really means what it says about fighting back against modern HR practices.)To be fair to him, even Farage seems to find the process of trying to control his parties exhausting at times, judging by the regularity with which he has taken breaks from them over the years. While Yusuf won’t return as chair, he will nowjoin Reform’s so-called British Doge, supposedly taking aMusk-style chainsawto council spending – which sounds like a breeze compared with managing Reform MPs. Until, that is, you reflect on how exactly Doge has turned out across the Atlantic.The reason parts of Silicon Valley were quietly enthusiastic about their fellow tech tycoon’s slash and burn approach to US bureaucracy was that they saw profitable method in the madness: a plan to hack the state back to the bare minimum, opening up new markets for digital services and unleashing (or so they hoped) a new wave of economic growth by slashing national debt.Five months on, however, it’s clear that any Doge savings will be utterly dwarfed by Trump’s forecast to send national debt soaring touncharted and potentially unsustainable highs. Any tech titan hoping for the US equivalent of Margaret Thatcher on steroids, in other words, has ended up with Liz Truss after one too many espressos instead – plus troops on the streets of California and the slowly dawning realisation that, as the billionaire venture capitalist Michael Moritz put it, they have“no sway” over what they unleashed.There will be plenty of people back in Britain who couldn’t care less about obscure comings and goings in the Reform party, even as itspoll leadmeans it’s starting to make the political weather. Others simply don’t expect it to affect their lives much either way if Reform permanently supplants a Conservative party from which it alreadyseems hard to distinguish, and a few may already be calculating that they can turn its rise to their own advantage.Yet what the last few frightening days in the US have demonstrated is that once populism has its feet firmly enough under the table, chaos wins. There’s no ability to belatedly impose order, no house-training it either. All you can do is deny it a room in the house in the first place. In Britain, at least, it’s not too late for that.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They’re using that trope to justify huge cuts to the social safety netMon 9 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 13.45 EDTShareAs they race to deliver Donald Trump’s“big, beautiful” tax bill, Republicans in Congress are using familiar tropes to justify massive cuts to the safety net that will leave millions of low-income children and families without healthcare or sufficient food. The programs, they argue, are rife with waste, fraud and abuse, and the people who use them just aren’t working hard enough. So work requirements are necessary to force the obviously lazy “able-bodied” people to get to work.Here’s the reality check: a majority of those receiving this aid who can work arealreadyworking. More than70%of working-age people who receive nutrition benefits or Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income children and adults that coversone in five Americans, are already working, according to the Government Accountability Office. Those who aren’t working,researchshows, are mostly ill, disabled, caring for a family member, or in school.Take the story ofRuaa Sabek. When the Covid pandemic hit in 2020, she and her husband worked at a fast-food restaurant in Philadelphia. Both their hours were cut, but they didn’t qualify for unemployment benefits because they remained employed. With two young children at home, their carefully managed budget began to crumble under rising prices and reduced incomes.What saved them wasn’t extraordinary luck or family wealth. It was the streamlined and expanded government support programs that turned what economists predicted would be afinancial apocalypseinto a springboard toward financial stability for some families.Oneanalysisof Medicaid work requirements by KKF, a health policy research organization, found that most working people with low enough incomes to qualify for Medicaid typically work for small companies or in sectors, like agriculture, that don’t offer employer-sponsored health insurance, or the rates are unaffordable. In other words, their jobs don’t pay them enough to afford basics, don’t offer benefits, and they have no other choice but Medicaid.There’s no doubt that safety net programs like Medicaid could be improved. They’re rife not so much with waste, fraud and abuse, as conservative lawmakers say –though there is some– but confusing red tape;disincentives to upward mobility, because benefits cut off sharply as soon as incomes start to rise; and cumbersome,punitive rulesdesigned to dissuade people from applying for benefits in the first place.Fueling the Republican drive to slash public benefits is a long-held belief among many conservatives that the reason most people live in poverty is because they don’t work, or don’t work hard enough, and are instead lazing about, dependent on government largesse, and robbing Americans of their hard-earned tax dollars.That view features prominently inProject 2025, the playbook for the Trump administration authored by the conservative Heritage Foundation. The foreword reads: “Low-income communities are drowning in addiction and government dependence.”And it was clearly on display in recent House congressional hearings on how to slash $1.5 trillion from the federal budget in order to pay for extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. “That little gravy train is getting ready to run out,”one Republican lawmaker saidof federal safety net programs like Medicaid and food and nutrition aid for people living in poverty. “The spigot is getting ready to be turned off.” The billionaire Elon Musk, charged with cutting federal spending, has even posted a meme calling people who rely on federal spending the “Parasite Class”.Here’s another reality check:Three in 10 Americans, more than 99 million people, rely on some form of federal aid to live. That includes nearly half of all children in the United States. Another52 million households,41% of all US households, make too much to qualify for public safety net benefits but still not enough to survive.Nearly 40%of Americans would struggle to cover a $400 emergency expense.There is a problem with making policy decisions based on theunfoundedbelief that poverty is about people with bad moral character making bad choices, or on debunked racial tropes ofundeserving “welfare queens.” (In fact, white people make up the largest group receiving publicfoodandhealthcare aid.) Shaping policy around false stereotypes, rather than the complex reality, prevents policymakers from working together on real solutions.In fact, if youtalk to people living in poverty,what they say they want tracks nearly exactly with what Project 2025 aims to foster: “empowering individuals to achieve economic independence.”“If I earn good money, I’m not going to be looking for benefits. I’ll take care of my bills,”said Blessing Aghayedo, a licensed practical nurse in Minnesota. Instead, she earns barely more than the federal minimum wage, which has beenstuck at $7.25 an hoursince 2009.Breathing roomIn the Sabeks’ case during the pandemic, expandedMedicaidand enhanced nutrition benefits helped weather health emergencies and soaring grocery prices. Rental assistance prevented them from losing their housing when they fell behind on payments. Stimulus checks and the expanded monthly child tax credit provided crucial cash that covered essential expenses like milk, diapers, children’s clothing, utility bills, and car repairs when they needed a new transmission.Perhaps most significantly, public subsidies for childcare and the Head Start program reduced their childcare expenses from an overwhelming $1,300 per month to $120, enabling Ruaa Sabek to continue working part time and enroll in a banking training program. “I feel like, ‘Oh my God, peace of mind,’” she said of the breathing room the public benefits gave her and her family. As a result, she landed a full-time position in 2023 as a personal banker that pays $45,000 annually with benefits – a dramatic improvement from her previous part-time $12-an-hour cashier job with irregular hours and no benefits.The family is now thriving without public assistance, aligning with decades of research. “You can’t actually figure out how to get to flourishing until you’re in a stable and secure situation,” said Megan Curran, director of policy at the Center on Poverty and Society Policy at Columbia.Researchshows that when families have a stable foundation, they are healthier and live longer. Adults are more likely to keep working, and children are more likely to stay in school, graduate, get better jobs, and pay taxes as adults. Even babies’ brain development is improved.And the stability pays for itself: the Child Tax Credit, for instance, returns$10 for every $1 spentevery year. The United States remains the only wealthy country with no national paid maternity leave, yet the return on investment for paid family leave is20:1. For childcare, it’s8:1.Meanwhile,rather thansaving taxpayers a ton of money, as Musk promised, slashing safety-net support ignores the real problem that keeps families from economic independence:44% of the workforcein the United States, the wealthiest country on earthas measured by GDP, is low-wage, a sharefar higherthan in many economic peer countries.Squeezing families already struggling financially could increase the share of those already waking uphungry,homeless, orworried they soon might be. The United States already has one of thehighest rates of child povertyamong wealthy countries. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine estimates that high poverty rate costs as much as$1tna yearin lost adult productivity, increased crime and poor health.Childcare is keyIf lawmakers are serious about adding work requirements for safety net programs, then ensuring families have access to affordable childcare is critical. Compared with other advanced economies, the United Statesinvests the least in childcare. That meanschildcare costs are second only to mortgage or rentfor most families who have to pay out of pocket. And federal childcare subsidies for low-income parents comenowhere closeto covering those eligible.The lack of affordable childcare sent Kiarica Schields, a college-educated hospice nurse and single parent in Georgia, spiralinginto a cycle of joblessness,eviction, instability, and poverty. “Childcare. That’s my issue,” she said.Trump has said he wants familiesto have more children. Yetsurveysshow that young people aren’t having children, or having as many as they’d like, because they can’t afford childcare.Kel, a divorced parent of four, wants lawmakers to think of public benefits for families like hers as a short-term investment with long-term benefits. Kel, who asked not to use her last name, fled an abusive marriage, struggles to pay bills, though she works as much as she can, and relies on Medicaid for life-saving physical and mental health treatments for her and her children. “Lifting me and people like me up will have a cascading effect on so many lives in a positive way,” she said. “We will give back to our communities tenfold, a hundredfold.

That’s because the French president aims to create momentum for a Palestinian state beside Israel encompassing the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) and the Gaza Strip, reviving what is fast becoming an out-of-reach possibility – a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians.That’s why Macron has earned the fury of an increasingly unhinged Israeli prime minister. France is expected to co-chair anorganizing conference at the United Nationsin New York in mid-June, taking advantage of heads of state already in North America for the Canadian-based G7 summit a few days earlier. He hopes this conference will include the all-important Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states.Right now, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Saudis show up, as they calculate whether there is enough maneuverability on the Palestinian issue for them to expose themselves. I hope they show up – either at the foreign ministry level or, dramatically, with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself as co-chair, as Macron initially envisioned. The reality is that with a far-right Israeli government and prime minister in the clutches of its most extreme elements, it’s urgently important for world leaders who want to maintain a two-state option to turn up and shout out. There is no more important figure right now for Macron to have by his side than Prince Mohammed, who could also help influence a US president who presently appears to have no consistent diplomatic strategy for Israel-Palestine.When an organizing group of Arab states that included the Saudi foreign minister tried to meet with the Palestinian Authority leadership in what has essentially become their city-state of Ramallah about a week ago, the Netanyahu government refused them entry in a rather unprecedented move. For the Saudis, showing up by Macron’s side would be an impactful response. It’s time to call Netanyahu’s bluff, go above his head and speak directly to the Israeli people. Macron should do the same.In decades past, negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians were behind the scenes, out of media range. But now, after decades of an established peace process that has collapsed, it’s time to be bold, and visibly to engage global power to change the situation on the ground.Macron, by promoting a Palestinian state and placing himself in the lead on the world stage on this – especially as the US has lost global leadership under Trump – walks a path that previous French governments have pursued. Indeed, Michel Rocard, who was prime minister during the FrançoisMitterand presidency decades ago, was particularly involved in behind-the-scenes negotiations. Today, Macron has broad support at home – including from political factions on the left – for this effort.Meanwhile, the Israeli governmentis going full force against Macron. The foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, has accused Macron of being on an anti-Israel “crusade”. It’s an unprecedented attack not only on an Israeli ally, but on the country that is home to the largest population of Jews on the European continent. Later, the Israeli defense minister and even the prime minister chimed in to attack Macron in an ugly and dangerous manner.And as the conference approaches, proposals for the hoped-for outcome appear to be lessening, according to news reports.Le Monde’s news coverageclaims that Macron appears to be weakening what began as a bold stance.But Macron and others – especially the Saudis – must not be dissuaded.Europe(and the newest honorary European country, Canada, as Prime Minister Mark Carney seeks global alliances in the Trump era) must be fierce and insistent. Macron must lead the charge within the EU to take bold economic measures against specific Israeli policies that are increasingly slamming the door on a Palestinian state.The EU is Israel’s largest trading partner, covering 32% of Israel’s total trade in goods with the world in 2024. About 29% of Israel’s exports went to the EU that year. The EU must use its muscle. Israel’s announcement of22 new settlementsin the West Bank is the latest salvo – sanctions must be quick and fierce against all these efforts and against West Bank settler leaders and businesses.This should include sanctions against any business, cultural and educational forums in settlements or cities outside of the internationally recognized Green Line, the ostensible border between Israel and a future Palestinian state. Time and again, the world must make a distinction that the Netanyahu government refuses to make between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.There is a reason that the Israeli cabinet passed this new, bold settlement plan. They know that their days in government are numbered. It’s up to the EU and their allies now to ensure every possible economic constraint is aimed at halting the massive settlement growth. And sanctions must be slapped and slapped again on the perpetrators among the Hilltop Youth and other fanatical settler operatives who are threatening and endangering Palestinian lives and livelihoods across the West Bank.But simply forcing the Israeli government’s hand economically isn’t enough. Netanyahu and his ministers including Sa’ar and the defense minister, Israel Katz, who have no public constituency inside Israel outside of Netanyahu’s grasp, will continue to whine and curse Macron and other world leaders in a bid to convince the Israeli public that the world is against them – as Netanyahu has long argued without context.There is another way. Embrace most Israelis, who are desperate to escape the poison of Netanyahu and a vision that has forced Israel into what seems like an endless war. It’s urgent for the world to promote a positive future for the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, too. Bono, that well-known statesman,said it bestwhen he recently spoke during an awards event at London’s Grosvenor House, when he encouraged Israelis to release the country from Netanyahu.He said, so eloquently: “Peace creates possibilities in the most intractable situations. Lord knows there’s a few of them out there right now. Hamas: release the hostages. Stop the war. Israel, be released from Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right fundamentalists that twist your sacred texts. All of you protect our aid workers, they are the best of us.”Every day now, the Israeli media is full of speculation on when the Netanyahu government will fall, leading to new elections that are 99.5% certain to mean a government led by someone other than Netanyahu, and with his two hard-right allies, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, out of office. It will likely be a center-right-left government, based on consistent weekly polling for months now that shows a coalition government comprising parties from these three tendencies. But it will be a government that wants to engage with the world in a rational manner.So, while the prospect of a Palestinian state is not immediate, the world community must ensure now that the hope for such a state does not continue to dissipate with facts on the ground. The horror of the war in Gaza must end. The remaining Israeli hostages must be returned home – their lives already made expendable not only by Hamas but also by Netanyahu and his profoundly cynical politics.Hamas can only be marginalized with a Palestinian political horizon. This is Macron and his European allies’ immediate mission. They need to take measures as bold as possible to make this happen. Not symbolic declarations, but serious moves. Lay the groundwork for a post-Netanyahu and post-Hamas world.Jo-Ann Mort, who writes and reports frequently about Israel/Palestine, is also the author of the forthcoming book of poetry, A Precise Chaos.

William Faulkner wrote: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” What comes to mind about Musk is: “He is not gone forever. He has not even left.”It is profoundly misleading to frame Musk’s departure this past week as “disappointed reformer quits after finding it impossible to make bureaucracy efficient”, just as it is wrong to think of this week’s rift as “Trump regime changes direction”. After all, Musk’s people are still there; and Musk-ism – understood as the wanton destruction of state capacity and cruel attacks on the poorest – will continue on … what’s the drug appropriate to mention here? Steroids? Not least, Trump’s and Musk’s fates remain entwined.Musk and Trump are enemies made for each other – united in their ability to trash their own brands | Jonathan FreedlandRead morePlenty of personnel beholden to Musk are still around anddoubling downon their chainsaw massacre.Continuing deregulationis still very much to Musk’s and other oligarchs’ liking. There is no dearth of bizarre Musk pronouncements about the universe, but his claim that the Doge ethosis like Buddhismmust be somewhere near the top. Yet it reveals a truth: the mentality of blissfully destroying state capacity will persist, except that the practice is likely to become more systematic and less prone to PR statements about “savings” that can easily bedebunked. Russell Vought, who directs the office of management and budget, knows what he is doing and has long beenpreparingto use “executive tools” creatively – read:illegally, according to plenty ofconstitutional lawyers. The level of cruelty is not much different from Musk’s “feeding USAID into the wood chipper”, but the process may well become smoother and less visible.After all, Musk’s own criticism of the budget is that it did not cut enough. The most sycophantic members of the Trump cult – such as therepresentative Andy Ogles– say the same: the bill is “not beautiful yet”; only senators making further cuts can make it so. As one of the world’s most influential political scientists, Adam Przeworski,has pointed out, budgets like this do not get passed under democratic conditions unless there is a major crisis (juntas in Chile and Argentina could make cuts of a similar magnitude with impunity). The potential damage to low-income families – not to speak of science – is so enormous that Reagan and Thatcher look like democratic socialists by comparison.The Trump-Musk rift will reveal much about what kind of regime the Trumpists are really creating, and how far governing as a form of personal revenge might be pushed. In principle, mutual vulnerability remains. Trump still has reasons to welcome help from Musk’s platform – and his money. The US is relying on SpaceX and Starlink in ways that give Musk leverage. Conversely, though, no matter how big the platform, a state can always pull the plug through regulation. Most important, Musk and Trump might know things about one another that should not become public.This, after all, is the underlying logic of what the Hungarian sociologist Bálint Magyar has theorized as a “mafia state”. In such a state, benefits go to what Magyar calls a “political family” (in Trump’s case, it of course includes the biological family); but in return there has to be absolute loyalty and omertà. A mafia state resembles Hotel California: you can officially check out, but you can never leave.This does not mean that nobody ever tries. Yet in conflicts between autocrats and a defecting oligarch, the latter tends to lose. Putin subjugated oligarchs who showed streaks of independence; Orbán defeated his former ally Lajos Simicska. When the latter broke with the Hungarian prime minister in 2015, opposition figures were giddy with excitement about juicy revelations and regime infighting. But financing big PR campaigns about corruption and an anti-Orbán party, as well as a large media empire, were not enough; today, the former oligarchconcentrates on farmingin western Hungary.Manycommentatorshave called for inflicting reputational damage on Musk. It clearly has been an advantage for those willing to protest the Trump regime that Tesla provided a focal point for concrete action; it is much more difficult to rally against cabinet members who do not happen to have a dealership down the road, but rather abstract things like hedge funds.More important still are investigations, starting with the simple – butstill unanswered– questions about who actually runs Doge, how it is structured and on what legal basis its actions proceed (the fact that the chair of the Doge caucus in the House keeps touting the entity’s commitment to “turning transparency into action” only adds insult to injury). If Congress ever rediscovers Article 1 of the constitution, and its duties of oversight in particular, it should not just hold hearings, but produce an analytical record of how an individual – unelected and supposedly without holding any office – could simply be handed a chainsaw and a key to all our data (a golden key was indeed a fitting gift from Trump). It will be difficult – in some cases, impossible – to undo the damage Musk and allies have caused; it will take less effort to dismantle the myth of “if only a business genius ran government, all would be well”. After all, evidence of how things turned out will be there.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

History shows the resultsMon 9 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 14.48 EDTShareNow that Donald Trump’s tariffs have been halted, his big, beautiful bill has been stymied, and his multi-billionaire tech bro has turned on him, how does he demonstrate his power?On Friday morning, federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)conductedraids across Los Angeles– including at twoHome Depotsand aclothing wholesaler– in search of workers who theysuspectedof being undocumented immigrants.Though figures vary, they reportedly arrested121 people.They were met with protesters who chanted and threw eggs before being dispersed by police wearing riot gear, holding shields, and using batons, guns that shoot pepper balls, rubber bullets, teargas, and flash-bang grenades.On Saturday, Trump escalated the confrontations, ordering at least 2,000 national guard troops to be deployed inLos Angelescounty to help quell the protests.He said that any demonstration that got in the way of immigration officials would be considered a “form of rebellion.” Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, called the protests an “insurrection”.On Saturday evening, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, threatened to deploy active-duty marines,saying: “The violent mob assaults on ICE and Federal Law Enforcement are designed to prevent the removal of Criminal Illegal Aliens from our soil. A dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels (aka Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and a huge NATIONAL SECURITY RISK. Under President Trump, violence and destruction against federal agents and federal facilities will NOT be tolerated.”We are witnessing the first stages of a Trump police state.Last week, raids in San Diego, inMartha’s Vineyardand in theBerkshiresled to standoffs as bystanders angrily confronted federal agents who were taking workers into custody.Trump’s dragnet also includes federal courthouses. Ice officers are mobilizing outside courtrooms across the US and immediately arresting people – including migrants whose cases have been dismissed by judges.History shows that once an authoritarian ruler establishes theinfrastructure of a police state, that same infrastructure can be turned on anyone.Trump and his regime are rapidly creating such an infrastructure, in five steps:(1) declaring an emergency on the basis of a so-called “rebellion”, “insurrection”, or “invasion”;(2) using that “emergency” to justify bringing in federal agents with a monopoly on the use of force (Ice, the FBI, DEA, and the national guard) against civilians inside the country;(3) allowing those militarized agents to make dragnet abductions and warrantless arrests, and detain people without due process;(4) creating additional prison space and detention camps for those detained, and(5) eventually, as the situation escalates, declaring martial law.We are not at martial law yet, thankfully. But once in place, the infrastructure of a police state can build on itself.Those who are given authority over aspects of it – the internal militia, dragnets, detention camps, and martial law – seek other opportunities to invoke their authority.As civilian control gives way to military control, the nation splits into those who are most vulnerable to it and those who support it. The dictatorship entrenches itself by fomenting fear and anger on both sides.Right now, our major bulwarks against Trump’s police state are the federal courts and broad-based peaceful protests – such as the one that many of us will engage in this coming Saturday 14 June, on theNo Kings Day of Action.It is imperative that we remain peaceful, that we demonstrate our resolve to combat this tyranny but do so non-violently, and that we let America know about the emerging infrastructure of Trump’s police state and the importance of resisting it.These are frightening and depressing times. But remember: although it takes one authoritarian to establish a police state, it takes just3.5%of a population to topple him and end it.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Stasi or Gestapo officers are a breed apart from the unarmed plod who demands no ID cards from free British people. So when the government contemplates a universal ID, it sends instinctive twitches down some spines.Though not many. Times and public attitudes have changed. And so have the political imperatives, for it seems that, for aLabourgovernment struggling to seize the narrative after a difficult year in power, digital ID cards – and the sense of national belonging they could strengthen – may just be the weapon needed to fight offthe ever-rising threat of Nigel Farage’s Reform.Look toLabour Together, the thinktank closest to government, which hasjust published apaper calling for a digital ID system– a “verifiable digital credential downloaded onto a user’s smartphone, which could be instantly checked by employers or landlords using a free verifier app”. One of its main virtues is simplification.There are currently191 waysto set up accounts and access services on gov.uk, with 44 sign-in methods. A universal ID is popular:More in Commonfinds 53% in favour, with 25% strongly in favour and only 19%against, backed by a majority of supporters of Labour, the Tories, the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK, and across all ages.The co-author of the foreword to the report, the Rother Valley MP Jake Richards, talks in terms of “the citizen taking back control of their own data and public services”. One portal, no more forgotten passwords, simple, safe, everything in one place for everyone. What’s not to like? Some will protest at the apparent loss of a romantic freedom, the right to vanish and start life anew, the call of the open road. But that’s a fairytale, a fantasy of a bygone era. Everyone knows everything already. As Richards puts it to me: “Last night I drank a Guinness. This morning I’m getting ads for Guinness.” The algorithms catch us already everywhere. Buy a lampshade and lampshades chase you all over the internet (which suggests algorithmic cluelessness: I’ve already bought that lampshade). You may restrict what you let out, but AI will find you, assessing your age and address from a host of databases. Better to control everything from one government-run base.It seems clear to me that the report is fundamentally about immigration – Labour wants to make it easier to identify people with no right to live here or claim public services. The policies behind the “stop the boats” and “smash the gangs” slogans can never hope to guard every beach from every rubber dinghy, whatever politicians pretend, any more than they can “end crime”. But ID would be a second line of defence against undocumented migrants who would find getting a job, renting a flat or using public services near impossible without one. Curbing benefit fraud is also cited as another argument in favour by poll respondents in the report; with ID cards for all claimants, those ever-suspicious of benefit cheats, despite the very lowfraud levels at just 2.2%, might be reassured. ID cards, designed to guard borders, could calm some alarm at migration among those who wildly overestimate the numbers arriving undocumented.The report forcefully labels it the “BritCard”, the first of its kind since the second world war. With a groundswell of support among the new cohort of Labour MPs, Richards says it’s not just red wallers in favour, but everyone who’s alarmed by Reform’s frightening advance. Former home secretaries back it – Alan Johnson, David Blunkett, Charles Clarke, Jack Straw, Amber Rudd, plus William Hague. Tony Blair has always advocated it, with a tortured history of trying to introduce a plastic “entitlement” card. First tried in 2003, the idea was backed by the Met police commissioner, who called it an “absolutely essential” tool in the war against terrorism. By 2010 it was briefly available to some, butabolished by the incoming coalition government.The cost was a killer: £85 for a combined card and passport. This time a universal digital ID would be free, say its promoters. The authors would make it mandatory – Jake Richards wouldn’t. But that may make little difference once it became near-impossible to access anything without it. Real risks need to be resolved first, as a computer rejecting you unjustly would cut off access to everything. The Home Office would have to improve radically, given its track record. We cannot forget that some Windrush victims are still waiting for compensation while othersdare notapproach the untrusted Home Office, source of their trauma. Any system would need cast-iron guarantees that being denied services on the basis of not having a valid BritCard would be dealt with instantly by senior enough officials to make robust decisions with rapid appeal to courts not blocked by backlogs.But the political advantages are crystal clear. The almost 37,000 migrants arriving by boat last year signify a state’s loss of control. It hasbeen reportedthat some would-be arrivals in Calais choose the UK because it doesn’t have ID cards, unlike most of the EU. Adjudicating who is entitled to be here is the state’s first duty, controlling who shares in a democracy and the public services that voters pay into. ID cards are a social democratic cause, because they help define security not only as border controls for who comes in, but as the right for everyone here to share in our mutual social security.In truth this is a political rebranding of what’s happening already. E-visas arerolling outto all foreign residents, with the existingOne Login and gov.uk Walletdoing the same digital identity work. Make it one ID system and the government can claim the political credit. Its promoters relish a public fight with civil liberties and privacy groups to prove Labour’s seriousness about national identity.Watch the dash to leave theEuropean convention on human rights(ECHR), promoted by the now near-identical Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage. Labour will rightly have none of it. No 10 is not yet committed on digital ID cards – but lest anyone think Labour lacks a pride and purpose when it comes to British identity, this is the time to bring in ID cards to endow everyone with proof of their national rights.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIdentity cardsOpinionImmigration and asylumPublic services policyLabourHome OfficecommentShareReuse this content"

Mum made me the dress for an anti-nuclear rally sometime in the mid-1970s. I don’t remember wearing it that day, or being carried on my dad’s shoulders as we marched with thousands of protesters, but I do recall wearing many of the other clothes Mum made me as a child.There was a lemon floor-length cotton number that she pintucked by hand for my role as the narrator in the school play that would swish around my ankles as I walked across the stage. And a white cropped top that she splattered with neon paint, designed to show up under the fluorescent lights of the Blue Light disco when I was in my Wham! phase and trying to attract a boy I liked from school. But my favourite was the spotted taffeta bubble skirt of my dreams that I wore to the high school formal, inspired byMolly Ringwald in Pretty in Pink.Mum made most of my clothes until I hit high school and begged relentlessly for a pair of shop-bought skinny jeans, because I was desperate to look more like my peers. She did buy me the jeans but she also kept sewing, filling my wardrobe with patchwork skirts, home-knitted vests and a dark-green corduroy coat that I would kill for now.Learning to sew has given me a common thread with women I otherwise would never have met | Nell FrizzellRead moreI was always impatient when she made me try things on. I’d stand on a kitchen chair, and she’d have a mouthful of pins, and I’d squirm and wriggle and complain, and if one of the pins jabbed my skin then I’d leap down off the chair in protest – even though she was usually sewing something that I’d asked for.She learned to sew and knit out of necessity, out of poverty. If she wanted a new dress for the local dance then she had to make one, and often it involved cutting up something else because buying new fabric was expensive. She even made her off-white raw silk wedding dress, complete with a hidden zip down the back. I’ve kept it, even though it is far smaller than I will ever be, because I like imagining her hands working the fabric.From the outside the dress looks polished, as if it has been plucked from the rack of a shop, but if you turn it inside out then you can see that none of the edges are properly finished and the hem is roughly handsewn. Perhaps she knew she’d only be wearing it for a day, so she didn’t bother spending too much time on all the details. And, somehow, this makes the dress even more special.There were many attempts to teach me to sew when I was a teenager but sadly I showed no interest. Instead I took a job at a local deli so I could start saving for branded things, like a pale pink padded Esprit jacket that cost more than a month’s wages. I wore it until the elbows frayed and the zip jammed at the bottom and even Mum’s skills couldn’t save it.As a child, I didn’t understand Mum’s commitment to making our clothes; I always believed it was a hangover from her upbringing. It was only later that I began to realise that it wasn’t only about saving money: it was also her way of crafting her own style, of creating things that were unique, like the multi-striped knitted jumpers my dad wore for more than 40 years that made him look a little like Ernie from Sesame Street.Mum stopped sewing as my brother and I grew. Occasionally I’d visit for a hem to be taken up or a sleeve to be repaired but never for an outfit. Then, when I became pregnant with my first child, Mum pulled out the knitting needles and got to work. She knitted so many jumpers in one winter that arthritis appeared in both her hands, so she’d stop for a while and move on to sewing quilted overalls that would protect my daughter’s knees as she learned to crawl.Cleaning out my parent’s house, I found the bags of clothes that my children had worn when they were small. After Mum died, I’d stored them under a bed in their house because I couldn’t fit them all in my apartment and I wasn’t ready to hand them on.I was surprised to see that almost all of their clothes were made by my mother. There were dozens of woollen jumpers knitted in stripes, fairy dresses in different sizes with layers of pink tulle and velvet sleeves, padded coats with matching bags, and even blankets to wrap my children up when they were cold. All those hours of work.And buried under the piles of clothes she had made them was the patchwork skirt she’d sewn me when I was 10. Liberty print squares she’d picked up somewhere cheap and sewn together in a mishmash of colours and patterns.I held it up to my waist, wondering if there was some way that I could still wear it, and wishing I’d listened when she tried to teach me how to sew.Explore more on these topicsSewingOpinionParents and parentingCraftFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

They’re typically vanquished by a collaboration of cowboy sacrifice and eloquent leaders who restore order under the stars and stripes.The Eternaut, Netflix’s new sci-fi series that became a global hit this month, breaks this mould: giant alien bugs controlled by an unseen extraterrestrial overlord take over Buenos Aires. Victory always seems far away – it’s not clear that humanity will triumph.Like the 1950s comic it’s based on, the series does not merely transpose alien invasion tropes on a new geography: it rewrites them. The Eternaut isn’t about a lone hero who saves the day – it’s a story about how ordinary Argentinians face existential threat. There is no single saviour in the story, according to the author,Héctor Germán Oesterheld: “The true hero of The Eternaut is a collective hero, a human group. It thus reflects, though without previous intent, my intimate belief: the only valid hero is the hero ‘in group’, never the individual hero, the hero alone.” The series’ tagline adopts this ethos:Nadie se salva solo– nobody is saved alone.The premise is strange even by sci-fi standards. The plot of the comic features a lethal snowfall, robot alien pawns, a time machine and a never-seen overlord species known only as Them. And yet it has struck a global chord: the Netflix adaptation captured10.8m views worldwidein its first week. It made the top 10 in 87 countries. And it has not left the global non-English top 10 since its release. Publishers arerushing to reissuean out-of-print English translation of thebook upon which it is based.InArgentina, the original comic has long been a cult classic. Oesterheld’s decision to anchor the story in the streets of Buenos Aires allowed the work, illustrated by Francisco Solano López, to resonate deeply. It reflects the fears and dreams of mid-century Argentina shaped by the new social mobility led by organised labour and public universities. It is permeated by the belief that scientific progress could lift people and country by their bootstraps.If the original gave workers reading the comic on their daily commute a dose of optimism, the new series reflects a far more battered society. This generational shift is visible in Juan Salvo, the eponymous eternaut. In the 1957-59 version he was a young family man, the prosperous owner of a small manufacturing business, married to a beautiful housewife and the doting father of a cherubic daughter. In 2025 Salvo is in his 60s, a war veteran with PTSD, divorced, and the father of an independent teenager who is likely a sleeper agent for Them.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at a scientists’ protest against budget cuts reference The Eternaut, 28 May 2025.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesThe shift matters. The Argentina reflected in this mirror is older; it’s scarred and haunted by decades of democratic breakdowns, dictatorship, hyperinflation and economic collapse.But it is also a story of resilience. As the local saying goes:Estamos atados con alambre– we’re holding it together with wire – celebrating an ability to improvise with whatever material is at hand. In The Eternaut, “we read a celebratory version of our customs and social organisation, in an artistic format – the comic – that shares some of the conventions of both ‘highbrow’ art and popular and mass art,” writes literary scholar Soledad Quereilhac. The series maintains, and even elevates, this celebration ofargentinidad, or being Argentinian – from humour and music to sociability and card games.Families of Argentina’s ‘disappeared’ ask EU for help as president seeks to thwart searchesRead moreBuenos Aires is not just a backdrop, it’s a protagonist. The characters fight on streets that remain central to our daily commutes and political battles. These arteries form a line of continuity in a text that has constantly acquired new interpretations as it travels through time, just like its protagonist. That successive generations have found new meaning in The Eternaut,despite vastly different circumstances, is part of what makes the text a classic, according to cultural criticMarcelo Figueras.And the mirror The Eternaut holds up to Argentinian society is far broader than just the story within the comic. When books are banned, they often take on new symbolic power. The Little Princewas banned by the 1976-83 dictatorship, giving it a weight beyond the somewhat naive tale. The Eternaut is similarly charged – Oesterheld, his four daughters, sons-in-law and two unborn grandchildren were among the 30,000 “disappeared” in the dictatorship. The faces of Oesterheld and his daughters have been pasted onNetflixposters lining Buenos Aires’ streets – it is a temporally jarring moment worthy of the comic itself. Like the protagonist Salvo, the author – whose remains have never been recovered – is lost in time.And yet the new adaptation makes no mention of dictatorship. For some, this omission may read as historical erasure. But it may also be deliberate – a more general interpretation of collective trauma that sidesteps Argentina’s polarised culture wars in which the politics of memory are dismissed as ideological excess or, more recently, as “woke” distortions by the president, Javier Milei.Or perhaps the absence is the statement. The Eternaut’s ideology was always coded in metaphor. Snow falls silently lethal. Alien overlords pull strings. Some read it as aveiled indictmentof the military bombing of civilians and the later coup that ousted Juan Perón in 1955. In portraying a dignified, resourceful working class – Peronist by implication – it defied an era in which even saying Perón’s name was forbidden.Netflix series reignites search for family of creator disappeared by Argentina dictatorshipRead moreIn the series, that appreciative perspective has shifted to Argentina’s besieged middle class, once the pillar of the country’s exceptionalism, now eroded by inflation and austerity. This too is tacitly political. In Milei’s Argentina, where public universities are defunded, cultural institutions gutted and social programmes under attack, the show’s message of collective survival, of interclass solidarity, is its own quiet rebellion. Though filmed before Milei’s election, its ethos cuts against the libertarian gospel of radical individualism. Even the tagline – Nobody is saved alone – feels like resistance. The symbolism has been adopted by scientists protesting against austerity budget cuts who recently demonstrated against “scienticide” wearing Eternaut-style gas masks.Salvation, hinted at in Salvo’s very name, is the story’s elusive goal. The comic ends ambiguously, in a temporal loop. Salvo is reunited with his family, but the aliens are not defeated. There is no cathartic American-style victory. Instead, another alien race touched by Salvo’s struggle offers him cold comfort: humanity’s fruitless resistance is inspiration for intergalactic intelligent species fighting against Them.It’s not a happy ending. But it’s not hopeless. The Eternaut carries on, buoyed up by human connection, friendship and stubborn resistance. Proudly made in Argentina.Jordana Timerman is a journalist based in Buenos Aires.

Welcome to the RobnaissanceMon 9 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 08.04 EDTShareFew facts feel more perfect than this: Robbie Williams’s current stadium and arena tour is sponsored by a cat food. Yes, the Britpop tour, promoting Williams’s upcoming album of the same title, is brought to us by Felix (he joins the brand’s feline mascot ina new campaign). The show has just spent two nights in residence at London’s Emirates Stadium, having previously stopped off inEdinburgh. It will also see dates in Manchester, Bath, Newcastle and Dublin, as well as other cities in Europe, many of which are sold out.I mention the cat food thing because it feels pretty intrinsic to Williams’s popular persona, and how he’s perceived right now. It is, by anyone’s standards, entirely camp in that particularly British, “hun culture” type of way, where glamour goes hand in hand with ordinariness – and that’s exactly where Robbie’s appeal lies in 2025, as he experiences what appears to be a cultural comeback.Indeed, over the past year or so, and particularly over the past six months, Williams has experienced a resurgence, something he himself acknowledges: “Robbie Williams,” he laughed on stage on Friday night. “Back in stadiums, eh?”That’s not the only bit of evidence, however. He’srumouredto be playing a secret slot at this year’s Glastonbury; he was recently honoured with the PRS for Music Icon award at the Ivors; and while his biopicBetter Manwas commercially unsuccessful, it went down pretty well with critics, who praised it for its candour about class and addiction. Williams shows up on cosy TV shows such as Michael McIntyre’s The Wheel, not to mention the cat food adverts, but he’s also found an audience with generation Z, as the subject of social media posts featuring archive photos of 90s and 00s fashion and celebrity culture. His appeal in 2025 has become widespread; his music still endures (play Angels in any pub in Britain and it’ll have the same effect as telling everyone there’s a free bar). You could, then, call it a bit of a Robnaissance.This is all happening because Williams occupies a unique position. He’s a charisma machine who regularly plays in front of thousands, but he’ll also happily divulge to his crowds that he’s – and I quote – “knackered” after playing certain songs, and exchanges concerns about erectile dysfunction with a lip-fillered, AI version of his future self in a between-songs bit. If someone from a younger, more self-serious generation – Sam Fender, Harry Styles – were being sponsored by Pedigree Chum it would probably raise a few eyebrows, but for Williams, stuff like the Felix partnership is entirely on brand. The first person, after all, to nudge and wink at Robbie is Robbie.There is a whole section in his show about how he no longer cares for being cool, while dressed in a hot pink suit. On stage, he delightedly acknowledges that his audience is primarily made up of middle-aged mums – “and I love it!” He speaks candidly about his poor mental healthon Instagram. Interestingly and marvellously, it’s in this total abandon that his star is rising again.Robbie Williams review – dazzling superstar glow from the ‘King of Entertainment’Read moreAnd this could, it should be acknowledged, very easily not have happened. For a while, he wasn’t well received by the public – a video of him singing as his wife Ayda Field gave birth to their child went down online like a ton of bricks, as did a gag where he used hand sanitiser after touching hands with a New Year’s Eve audience on TV. It was only in 2022 that he was widely criticised for performing in Qatar at the football World Cup,responding to the feedbackthus: “If we’re not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known: I wouldn’t even be able to perform in my own kitchen.”Since then, however, the tide has turned. Williams has publicly shown his softer side again. A 2023Netflix documentaryabout his life saw him reviewing photos and footage on his laptop, in bed in his underwear. There’s also the aforementioned mental health chat online, and, of course, Better Man was further insight into his struggles at the hands of the press and the music industry. Broadly, the vulnerability that he has always embraced in his music (“I don’t wanna die, but I ain’t keen on living either”) has become more and more in vogue for men and male celebrities, in response to the frightening versions of masculinity spawning online. It seems that the mainstream masculinity of the day has caught up with the man who openly sang in 2002: “If you don’t need me, I don’t exist.”Williams will probably always have the ability to put his foot in his mouth spectacularly. But the more he reveals of himself, the more he cements his place as a unique and – let’s face it – unparalleled British performer. There is nobody who does what he does, nobody with his legacy or catalogue, nobody who straddles cool and uncool in quite the same way that Brits love so much.From where I am standing, then, Williams’s popularity in the current moment is deserved and hard won, for a performer who has the type of gift you cannot teach. When he emerged on stage in front of 60,000 people on Friday night, he introduced himself simply: “I’m Robbie Williams. This is my band, this is my arse.” He also told us: “I want to be the king of entertainment.” And at this point, you do have to ask: who else could it be? This is his Robnaissance – we’re just living in it.Lauren O’Neill is a culture writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How do we revive these habitats?Mon 9 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 10.35 EDTShareDeserts are spreading across great tracts of Britain, yet few people seem to have noticed, and fewer still appear to care. It is one of those astonishing situations I keep encountering: in which vast, systemic problems – in this case, I believe, covering thousands of square kilometres – hide in plain sight.I realise that many people, on reading that first sentence, will suspect I’ve finally flipped. Where, pray, are those rolling sand dunes or sere stony wastes? But there are many kinds of desert, and not all of them are dry. In fact, those spreading across Britain are clustered in the wettest places. Yet they harbour fewer species than some dry deserts do, and are just as hostile to humans. Another useful term is terrestrial dead zones.What I’m talking about are the places now dominated by a single plant species, calledMolinia caeruleaor purple moor-grass. Over the past 50 years, it has swarmed across vast upland areas: inmuch of Wales, onDartmoor,Exmoor, in the Pennines, Peak District, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales and many parts of Scotland.Moliniawastes aredismal places, grey-brown for much of the year, in which only the wind moves. As I know from bitter experience, you can explore them all day and see scarcely a bird or even an insect.Not that you would wish to walk there. The grass forms high tussocks through which it is almost impossible to push. As it happens, most of the places that have succumbed toMoliniamonoculture are“access land”. Much of the pittance of England and Wales in which we are allowed to walk freely has become inaccessible. In a great victory a fortnight ago, the supreme court ruled that we havea right to wild campon Dartmoor. But on many parts of the moor, you wouldn’t want to exercise it. As soon as the grass takes hold, all opportunities for enjoyment and employment cease.Moliniachallenges the definition of an invasive species. The term is supposed to refer only to non-native organisms. But while it has always been part of our upland flora, it appears to have spread further and faster than any introduced plant in the UK, and with greater ecological consequences. It is uncontrolled by herbivores, disease or natural successional processes (transitions to other plant communities). In fact, it stops these processes in their tracks.Given the scale of the problem, it is remarkably little studied and discussed. I cannot find even a reliable estimate of the area affected:the most recent in England is nearly 10 years old, and I can discover none for Wales or Scotland. But in the southern Cambrian Mountains alone, judging by a combination of my walks and satellite imagery, there appears to be adead zone covering roughly 300 sq km, in which little but this one species grows. Most of central Dartmoor is nowMoliniadesert, and just as disheartening and hard to traverse.View image in fullscreenNew molinia growth in a burnt area of gorse in the Sawdde Fechan valley, Mynydd Du, Wales.Photograph: Camera Lucida Environment/AlamyWhy is this happening? It seems to be a combination of forces. One is “headage payments”: subsidies that were issued in the second half of the 20th century, which paid farmers for the number of animals they kept. They created an incentive to cram the land with as many sheep and cattle as possible. This, in combination withburning moorlandto produce fresh shoots for the livestock to eat, seems in some places to have pushed ecosystems beyond their tipping points. Even, as in parts of the Cambrians, where there have been no sheep grazing for 40 years, as there’s nothing left to eat (sheep will scarcely touchMolinia), there has been no recovery.Another likely factor is nitrogen deposition. Nitrogen compounds rain down on Britain’s habitats at a rate of roughly29kg per hectare per year. They are produced bylivestock farming, traffic and industry. Drainage (largely for farming) alsoappears to accelerate the spread:Moliniathrives as peat dries out.The Dartmoor ecologist and nature campaignerTony Whiteheadtells me that the degradation of peat caused by drainage, excavation, burning and grazing pressure is likely to be the primary accelerant. Burning in particular – carried out by sheep farmers on Dartmoor and Exmoor and by grouse shoots on northern English moors and in Scotland – favours the plant. While other species are destroyed,Moliniais protected by its deep roots and tussocks, which guard its buds.Various solutions are proposed, but few are satisfactory. One approach is toblast the grass with the herbicide glyphosate. It works for a while, but leaves an even grimmer waste, likely to be colonised again byMolinia. Others propose yet more burning, and/orgrazing with cattle or ponies: temporary “solutions” that look like blood-letting to cure anaemia. Whitehead has watched what happens: the animals graze around the edges of theMolinia, eating only small amounts, while continuing to knock back other plant species.After early summer, they won’t touch the stuff, as its nutritional value declines steeply. Anew reportby the government agency Natural England states that livestock grazing is not required to protect the main habitat type – blanket mire – thatMoliniathreatens.Rewetting the land, by blocking drains and building bunds and perhaps, as one team is attempting,planting clumps of sphagnum moss among the grass, in order to restore the peat, seems to be the only means of reviving blanket mire. It also makes the land less prone to fire. In other places, we should be encouragingthe return of trees, through planting and excluding livestock.Most of the areas overtaken byMoliniahave a temperature and moisture range that would favour temperate rainforest: a vanishingly rare, rich and complex habitat. As the trees mature, they should shade out the grass. In somewet areas, I’d like to see the return of water-tolerant species such as alder, downy birch and willow, to restoreupland carr, another rich and scarce habitat.But anyone who wants to rewild upland ecosystemshits a wall of vested interests– mostly sheep farmers and grouse moor owners – who, like the commercial fishing sector, insist on doing the wrong thing until it destroys their own industry. Where is the urgent government programme? Where is there even official acknowledgment that we have a problem? To fix something, first you must see it.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservationOpinionNational parksSoilGreen politicsFarmingcommentShareReuse this content"

Known as the Nordic-Baltic eight (NB8 in diplomatic jargon), it brings together small northern European states that, individually, might have little clout in international security and politics. But since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, they have wielded growing influence as apressure groupfor western resolve, offering an attractive blend of democratic security, defence integration and societal resilience.Denmark, Estonia,Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden established their regional cooperation format in 1992, after the end of the cold war, with regular meetings of prime ministers, parliamentary speakers, foreign and defence ministers and senior government officials. It began as a forum for wealthy, stable Nordic countries to rebuild bridges with Baltic neighbours with whom they had traded and exchanged for centuries but who had been trapped behind the iron curtain under Soviet rule since the second world war.The group’s salience has grown in the new geopolitical era of great-power rivalry in which the Arctic, the North Atlantic and theBaltic Seahave once again become strategically contested zones. “The world is changing rapidly … the most important thing is to rearm Europe,” the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, the present chair of the NB8, said in explaining why Copenhagenno longer sees its placeas one of the”frugal” countriesopposed to higher EU spending. Denmark will also hold the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union from July, giving the Nordic region greater visibility.While national-populist politicians havegained groundin central Europe, making the region more Eurosceptic and less supportive of Ukraine, the Nordics and Baltics remain a bastion of support for Kyiv and for European and Nato defence efforts, even as their policies on migration have toughened under pressure from their own populists.The NB8 countries were involved from the outset in the Franco-British “coalition of the willing”, established to backUkrainemilitarily and politically when Donald Trump suspended US assistance to Kyiv in an attempt to strong-arm Volodymyr Zelenskyy into a peace deal on Russian terms. As Frederiksen puts it, they see Ukrainian independence and defeating Moscow’s aggression as being in their own vital interest, given their geographical proximity to Russia.Both Nato and the EU are drawing extensively on the “total defence” playbook of Finland and Sweden to engage the public and private sectors and civil society in military readiness, civil preparedness and economic resilience in the face of Russian and Chinese hybrid warfare tactics. There is much to learn from their whole-of-society approach.Finland, for instance, with a population of 5.6 million and just 24,000 in the peacetime armed forces, can rapidly mobilise a wartime army of 180,000 and has a reserve force of 870,000 trained soldiers, thanks to a system of conscription and regularreserve duty. Business leaders are often also reserve officers. They attend regular security seminars and have legal obligations to maintain stocks, share logistics and have spare production capacity for times of crisis. Having fought two wars with the Soviet Union alone in the 1940s, the country maintains enough well-stocked bomb shelters for its entire population.Last year, Sweden mailed an updated version of a booklet to 5m householdsadvising citizenshow to act “in case of crisis and war”, including stockpiling non-perishable food, and having a battery-operated radio and torch, a first aid kit and other necessities. The European Commission recently recommended all member states takesimilar actionto prepare their populations for potential emergencies.The NB8 members regularly caucus before Nato and EU meetings – although Norway and Iceland are not EU members – and coordinate their diplomacy worldwide. Symbolically, the Nordic five share anembassy complexand cultural centre in Berlin, capital of Europe’s biggest economy.The Guardian view on UK military strategy: prepare for a US retreat – or be left gravely exposed | EditorialRead moreIn Europe’s evolving power matrix, the Nordic and Baltic allies have the advantage of being stable, like-minded democracies with a broad consensus in support of defence and deterrence against Russia. That will make them dependable partners for the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, at a time when Poland now facespolitical instability,France has no parliamentary majority and is shackled by debt, and Italy is reluctant to step up defence efforts.All eight have linked their armies to the UK and the Netherlands through theJoint Expeditionary Force, maintaining high-readiness forces that are trained to respond rapidly to crises. They are working with Nato to protectvital underwater cablesand pipelines from Russian and Chinese sabotage efforts.Some members have gone further in defence integration. For instance, four Nordic air forces this year created a Nordic division within Nato, whose task is to implement the Nordic Airpower Concept which enables Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish wings to operate as one force in high-readiness full-scale joint air operations. The three Baltic states are building ajoint defensive lineon their eastern borders modelled on Ukraine’s frontline defences. And Baltic countries are discussing an Estonian concept for a “Baltic drone wall”, using AI and sensors for border monitoring and counter-drone protection.Even if they punch above their weight, there are limits to the NB8’s influence. Small, open economies rely on free trade and a stable global environment to prosper. Within the EU, the group has struggled unsuccessfully to stop the European Commission loosening itsstate aid enforcement rulesto allow more French and German subsidies to industry. More broadly, a world shaped by tariffs, climate inaction, illiberalism and big power spheres of influence is a toxic prospect for the Nordics and Baltics.Growing protectionism and instability could spell high noon for Europe’s high north.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionEuropean UnionRussiaNorwayFinlandUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

Then along came Ultimate FrisbeeLucinda PriceI used to be addicted to exercise in all its most joyless, soulless forms. It took a flying object to show me the magnetic joy of playSun 8 Jun 2025 20.19 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 00.27 EDTShareIt all begins with a flick of the wrist. I hold my breath as I watch a disc wobble through the air. When it starts going sideways, I grimace. In that moment, I bear a striking resemblance to a cartoon hen in Chicken Run, but instead of staring down the barrel of my pie-shaped destiny, I’m playing Ultimate Frisbee – and I’ve just executed a deeply suboptimal “pull”.These are all words I learned mere months ago, and I’m likely using them incorrectly. Either way, they’re the language of a sport that has become my new favourite pastime – and the unexpected key to repairing my once-fractured relationship with exercise.I’d never heard of Ultimate Frisbee until I was added to a ragtag WhatsApp group of 60-odd adults intent on playing the game a few months ago. Every Wednesday, anywhere from eight to 18 thirtysomethings pull up to the park at sunset with 30 drill cones, a 175g disc and most crucially, a desire to have pure, unfettered fun.Why I love ... ultimate FrisbeeRead morePut crudely, Ultimate Frisbee is a non-contact team sport that blends the passing rules of netball with the end zone chaos of American Football.Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete passes and passes out of bounds are turnovers. Rain, wind or other adversities such as a loose labradoodle on the pitch make for fast-paced, nail-biting matches.Perhaps the most interesting element of the competition is that Ultimate Frisbee is self-officiating. Even at the highest levels of competition, there is no referee. The sport relies on a principle called SOTG – “spirit of the game”. This spirit is taken seriously – the World Flying Disc Federation outlines that “highly competitive play is encouraged, but should never sacrifice the mutual respect between players, adherence to the agreed-upon rules of the game, or the basic joy of play”.These principles are felt on the grass. We are amateurs in every way which adds to the chaos and thus, the spirit. We switch up teams each week, we bring a boom box and we let newbies take a few steps when they catch their first disc. We have conspiratorial team huddles, oranges at half-time and the occasional mid-air collision that sends someone headlong into the turf like a rag doll. The basic joy of play is magnetic. Rare, too.View image in fullscreenUltimate Frisbee is a non-contact team sport that has no referee.Photograph: Frazao Studio Latino/Getty ImagesI’m especially attracted to this sport because it’s the first I’ve ever found that feels completely devoid of effort. We run, duck and dive, full pelt, for 45 minutes per game. It feels like five. This is astonishing to me. From my late teens right through to my late 20s, I was addicted to exercise in all its most joyless, soulless forms. I didn’t feel as if I had “worked out” unless I was drenched in sweat and gasping for air. If I wasn’t in pain, I wasn’t doing it right.The power secret: simple, everyday moves you need for a healthier and happier lifeRead moreFor years, I thought that’s just how exercise was meant to feel. It was something to be tracked, to be completed, to be painful or else it was pointless. What kept me hooked was the sense of smug self-satisfaction I felt immediately after a challenging exercise class. When I walked out on to a busy street, I’d see people my age drinking beer with their friends. I pitied them their lack of discipline. I was doing the right thing, but I was missing the point.While recovering from an eating disorder, I stopped “driven exercise” completely. It was a necessary circuit breaker. I needed to prove to myself that I could step away from exercise classes forever and live to tell the tale. Live a meaningful life, full of beer and friends, even. A wild concept.It took years, but finally, the empty space was ready for a new tenant. Thankfully, it’s a flying object that’s a joy to identify.Lucinda Price is a writer, presenter and comedian who goes by the name FroomesExplore more on these topicsFitnessOpinionHealth & wellbeingAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

The 1971 albumThere’s a Riot Goin’ On, a moody reflection on civil rights and the corrupted idealism of the postwar era created predominantly by Stone apart from the rest of his band, is widely regarded as one of the greatest of the 20th century.Born Sylvester Stewart to a Pentecostal religious family in Texas in 1943, Stone grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. His first music came in a gospel quartet with three siblings, the Stewart Four, who put out a locally released single in 1952.As a young man he became well known in the fertile musical scene of countercultural San Francisco: a multi-instrumentalist and radio DJ who had a series of local bands and worked as a producer for garage rock and psychedelia groups such as the Beau Brummels.In 1966, he fused his band Sly and the Stoners with his brother Freddie’s group Freddie and the Stone Souls, to form Sly and the Family Stone. Their breakthrough came the following year with Dance to the Music, and success was fully established by their fourth album in two years,Stand! (1969), which eventually sold more than three million copies. The band’s stylistic and racial diversity attracted a broad audience, and they played both of the defining music festivals of 1969, Woodstock and the Harlem cultural festival.Hits continued more fitfully during the early 1970s, and the group – notorious for no-shows at concerts – slowly fractured amid increasing drug use. Stone would record There’s a Riot Goin’ On predominantly on his own, applying one of the earliest uses of a drum machine; albums such as Fresh!, with its Richard Avedon portrait of Stone on the cover, were also primarily his work. The band split entirely in 1975, though Stone continued to use the band name for solo releases.View image in fullscreenSly Stone in 2015Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesDespite having laid the rhythmic groundwork for disco, Stone couldn’t sustain his career in the late 1970s, and his addiction to cocaine worsened. He continued to perform with peers such as Funkadelic and Bobby Womack, but album releases dried up after 1982’s Ain’t But the One Way.Sly and the Family Stone – 10 of the bestRead moreHe was arrested in 1983 for cocaine possession, and for driving under the influence of cocaine in 1987, prompting him to flee California for Connecticut. He was apprehended two years later, and sentenced to 55 days in prison, five years’ probation and a fine. His difficulties meant that he was little seen during the 1990s, and it wasn’t until 2006 that he performed in public again, at a tribute to Sly and the Family Stone at the Grammy awards.He performed with the Family Stone on a tour the following year, but often erratically, and made a lacklustre appearance at 2010’s Coachella festival. His final album, I’m Back! Family & Friends, featuring re-recordings of old songs alongside three new tracks, was released in 2011.Sly Stone: ‘Albino musicians could neutralise all the racial problems’Read moreIn 2015he was awarded $5min a lawsuit against his former manager and attorney, successfully arguing that royalty payments had been diverted from him, though he ultimately wasn’t awarded the money due to the terms of a 1989 royalties agreement with a production company. Difficulties with royalties meant that Stone spent many of his latter years in poverty; in 2011 he was living in a campervan in a residential area of Los Angeles – voluntarily, he claimed – and relying on a retired couple for food.“Sly was a monumental figure, a groundbreaking innovator, and a true pioneer who redefined the landscape of pop, funk, and rock music,” the family statement added. “His iconic songs have left an indelible mark on the world, and his influence remains undeniable. In a testament to his enduring creative spirit, Sly recently completed the screenplay for his life story, a project we are eager to share with the world in due course, which follows a memoir published in 2024.”That memoir, Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), was praised in a Guardian review: “The charm, playfulness, humour and personality of Stone’s songs come through in his on-page voice”.Ina 2023 interview with the Guardianaccompanying its publication, he said: “I was always happy if someone took the things I was doing and they liked them enough to want to do them on their own. I’m proud that the music I made inspired people.”Among those paying tribute to Stone was musician and actor Queen Latifah, who heralded an “innovator [and] funk aficionado”, and hip-hop icon DJ Premier who wrote: “I thank you for bringing us diversity, funk, soul, rock and a unique band which is why I’m cut from the integrity cloth. I will remain great because of you.” Waterboys frontman Mike Scott wrote: “Thank you for all the inspiration, for breaking ground so others could follow and for being the sassiest, funkiest being on planet earth”.Stone was married from 1974 to 1976 to Kathy Silva, with whom he had a son, Sylvester Jr. He later had two further children: Sylvyette withCynthia Robinson, and Novena Carmel.Explore more on these topicsSly StonePop and rockSoulnewsShareReuse this content"

Suddenly, as I came to, the whole place appeared alive and more and more good stuff leapt out from the 1,600 works on view. What’s that upsidedown stag? It’s by the 87-year-old German master Georg Baselitz. As for those convex mirrors above your head, reflecting you and the floor in radical foreshortening, that’s an installation by Cornelia Parker. In the same room hang eviscerated animal carcasses hooked up on chains, made of textiles by Tamara Kostianovsky.But it’s Jesus who lifts this exhibition out of the ordinary. He moves towards you like a shark in the illusion created by Tracey Emin’s painting The Crucifixion. And like a shark, he is frightening. I thought art had lost its capacity to shock. But what can be more shocking than a celebrated 21st-century artist sincerely painting the passion? Emin shows another work before this startling, upsetting show-stopper – an outsized, melancholy portrait print. It makes you wonder and worry: is the artist OK? And even, is the artist any good? This female face is so broadly sketched it’s a bit clumsy, and yet you can’t forget it.Don't we all share Christ's fate, Emin is sayingEmin’s talent is still raw after all these years and she has painted her masterpiece in the crucifixion. If you doubt her, see this. If you love her, see this. It’s a big painting of the three crosses on the hill of Golgotha. Christ is flanked by two other crucified figures, one of whom is a woman – the only departure from iconographic tradition. Emin is a fan of north European art, including Munch. Here she echoes the intense, macabre Three Crosses of German renaissance painter Lucas Cranach. Then again, she may also be echoing The Life of Brian, for there’s something cinematic about the way the two side crosses are set back, thrusting Christ’s suffering body forward for us to see, to pity. He’s got a crown, a beard, a broken harrowed face, painted blue in a yellow desert. His knees are knobbly, legs thin, chest skinny.View image in fullscreenGreat balls … inside the Summer Exhibition.Photograph: David Parry/Royal Academy of ArtsThe curving dark line enclosing the white semi-circle of the hill of Golgotha strongly resembles the way Francis Bacon enclosed his figures in abstract rooms. Like a Bacon bedroom, this barren hilltop represents the prison of existence we all share. The two other victims – two thieves, according to the Bible – share Christ’s fate, nailed to massive crosses. Don’t we all, says Emin.This is the greatest new painting that’s been seen since Lucian Freud died. But was he ever as universal? Emin shows why religious art, whatever your beliefs or lack of them, has a power to portray our common human fragility. People are always being crucified.This modern masterpiece doesn’t overwhelm the show but opens your eyes to other strong works. Go and look at George Shaw’s painting Survivors 1, which sucks you into its peculiarly British sadness. On a scrap of parkland in front of an estate of featureless houses with blank windows, a leafless tree claws at the drab sky. More trees “survive” beyond it. If you need cheering up after this blast of depressive Gainsborough, head for Frank Bowling’s Red, Yellow and Blue – a tall, slender abstract painting with bits of plastic and medication packaging embedded in it, a fizzing cocktail of gold fire and night blue that seems a homage to Whistler’s Nocturnes, but on a grand abstract expressionist scale.View image in fullscreenSubtlety and fun … another gallery.Photograph: David Parry/Royal Academy of ArtsThe Royal Academy summer show’s days of defining the new are usually thought to be long gone. Yet this is a peculiar moment in art, when what is avant garde and what is conservative are messed up. Perhaps this exhibition has a serious, even urgent job to do, with its unique mix of the famous, unknown, impressive and terrible. Who did that huge grotesque portrait of a woman who looks like a Dada montage? A wild amateur? No, Cindy Sherman.It’s a shame more of the memorable pieces aren’t by unknowns but by and large the art elite justify their prices and honours: Dexter Dalwood, Rose Wylie, Stephen Farthing, Sean Scully, the late Timothy Hyman. At 87, Allen Jones is still perving with panache. There’s a strikingly weird painting of two women on the tube by Paulina Olowska.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other effective political artworks include Jock McFadyen’s Somewhere in Ukraine, a view of a battered apartment block with battle smoke on the horizon, and Marcus Harvey’s Nelson at Trafalgar, which turns the British hero into a mummified corpse.It all kicks off in the courtyard with big black inflatable balls by Ryan Gander, printed with questions: “How much is a lot?” “Does abstraction have rules?” Daft but fun, these pseudo-intellectual japes put you in a good mood for an exhibition full of surprises and subtleties.

Combining meticulous research with firecracker plots, he published a series of novels that sold more than 75m copies around the world, and won him honours including a CBE in 1997 and the Crime Writers’ Association Diamond Dagger award.Born in Ashford, Kent in 1938, Forsyth flew fighter jets during his national service, but when the Royal Air Force couldn’t guarantee he’d stay in the cockpit he set out to see the world. While working for Reuters as a journalist, he got a lucky break. “The guy stationed in Paris got a heart murmur and had to come home,”he told the Big Issue. “A man stuck his head around the door of my office and said, ‘Anyone here speak French?’ Within days I was on the plane to Paris.”Paris in 1961 was in turmoil, with rightwing militants threatening to assassinate Charles de Gaulle after his offer of independence to Algeria. “We were all waiting for the mega-story,”the author recalled in the Express, “the moment when a sniper got him through the forehead.” Forsyth got the inside track on the security operation from De Gaulle’s bodyguards and when a friend asked if an assassination would be successful, the writer shook his head. “It could be done,” Forsyth replied, “but only by an outsider. An assassin with no name, no face, no record, no dossier. And a professional.” The seed of an international bestseller was sown.After spending time in East Germany, Forsyth moved to the BBC and in 1967 he was sent to Nigeria to cover the Biafran war. He arrived in the newly independent eastern region three days after the federal government’s invasion, having been told that the army would suppress the rebellion in a couple of weeks.“My brief was to report the all-conquering march of the Nigerian army,”Forsyth recalled. “It did not happen. Naively, I filed this. When my report was broadcast our high commissioner complained to the CRO in London, who passed it on to the BBC – which accused me of pro-rebel bias and recalled me to London.”Despairing of the BBC’s reluctance to challenge the British government’s support of the Nigerian regime, Forsyth quit and returned to Biafra as a freelance reporter in 1968. There he helped to break the story of the famine which shocked the world, and began working for MI6. Although Forsyth always denied he was a spy, in his 2015 autobiography, The Outsider,the author admittedhe was an intelligence “asset” for more than 20 years. “There was nothing weird about it,”he told a Guardian Live audience, “it was the cold war. An awful lot of the strength of British intelligence came from the number of volunteers. A businessman might be going to a trade fair in a difficult-to-enter city and he’d be approached, quite gently, with a courteous, ‘If you would be so kind as to accept an envelope under your hotel door and bring it home …’ so that was what I did. I ran errands.”Forsyth returned to the UK as the war came to an end in December 1969, finding himself with “no job, no prospects, no flat, no car, no savings”. Desperate to make money, he “hit on the most no-hope-in-hell way of making some:write a novel. I just sat down and wrote about the invisible assassin with no name. I knew my material; I had walked every inch of it. I wrote night and day for 35 days.”The Day of the Jackal returned to Forsyth’s days in Paris, following an investigation to foil an assassin’s plot to kill De Gaulle. Packed full of operational details and putting fictional characters cheek by jowl with public figures, the novel brought a new realism to the thriller genre. The Guardian hailed it in 1971 as a “chilling, superbly researched story”, asking “Or is it fiction?” It rapidly became a word-of-mouth hit and a global bestseller, with a film adaptation released two years later.In 1972’s The Odessa File, a young German reporter goes in search of the Nazi war criminal Eduard Roschmann and stumbles on an organisation defending high-ranking members of the SS.The New York Times was scathing, suggesting Forsyth had “borrowed painful, live history in order to spring a few quick thrills”, but it quickly became a bestseller. Forsyth also claimed that the novel helped to identify Roschmann in real life. “They made it into a film, which was screened in a little fleapit cinema south of Buenos Aires,” Forsyth told the Telegraph, “where a man stood up and said, ‘I know that man, he lives down the street from me,’ and denounced him. He decided to make a run for it to Paraguay and died of a heart attack on the river crossing. They buried him in an unmarked gravel pit. I hope they tossed a copy of the book in on top of him.”Forsyth began to develop a method, researching a novel for six months then writing it quickly. His commitment to detail was not without danger: in 1974, the author was investigating the illegal arms trade in Hamburg for The Dogs of War, the story of a group of mercenaries who plot a coup in a fictional African republic. When an arms dealer recognised his portrait in a bookshop window, Forsyth was warned he had 80 seconds to leave his hotel. Grabbing his money and passport, he ran to the station and jumped on to a train as it pulled away.Over the next five decades the bestsellers continued, with plots including nuclear weapons, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the cocaine trade and Islamic terrorism. An outspoken critic of Tony Blair, Forsyth was a staunch supporter of Brexit, becoming a patron of Brexit campaign group Better Off Out, and wrote of his scepticism of climate change in his Daily Express column.Forsyth was never romantic about the art of fiction, repeatedly announcing his retirement and complaining that he had to force himself to write. “I am slightly mercenary,” he said. “I write for money.”But Forsyth kept returning to his typewriter and over his lifetime wrote more than 25 books, that have sold over 75 million copies.Speaking to the Times at the launch of his 2018 novel The Fox, the writer declared once more that it would be his last. But even as Forsyth insisted “the interest has gone”, there was still a hint of unfinished business. “I’ve got three unused typewriters in a cupboard at home,” he said, “enough to see me out.”Jonathan Lloyd, Forsyth’s agent, said he last saw the writer a few weeks ago to watch a forthcoming BBC documentary of his life. Lloyd said he “was reminded of an extraordinary life, well lived.”“Having long held The Day of the Jackal as the blueprint of the modern thriller, I was honoured to become his editor for Avenger in 2002 and have remained so ever since,” said Bill Scott-Kerr, Forsyth’s publisher. “Working with Freddie has been one of the great pleasures of my professional life,” he added. “He leaves behind a peerless legacy which will continue to excite and entertain for years to come.”Explore more on these topicsFrederick ForsythThrillersFictionMI6UK security and counter-terrorismnewsShareReuse this content"

This striking and dismaying documentary sees him tackle the government to do better for kids today. The scene with Bridget Phillipson is really somethingLucy ManganMon 9 Jun 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareAbout 15 years ago I was at a do for a children’s literacy charity and the guest speaker wasJamie Oliver. He got up and spoke easily, wittily and movingly – without notes – about his experiences as a child at school with undiagnosed dyslexia that meant he only read a book for the first time at the age of 33. Now he is channelling those experiences, with what he has learned over the last two decades as a campaigner (most famously about school dinners, when he brought to public attention the pennies’ worth of cheap slop we were pushing down our children’s gullets five times a week), into the cause of educational reform.Jamie’sDyslexiaRevolution marks the culmination of six months’ work by Oliver and his team, including his right-hand woman for activism, Alison Corfield, and the beginning of a media blitz designed to force the government’s hand.There are a number of striking moments in the documentary and it opens with one of them: we watch Oliver recording the audio version of one of his cookbooks, which he has to do a few words at a time before the jumbled print he sees forces him into error and he has to stop, breathe and start again. It’s the perfect, succinct demonstration of both how his mind works and of the immense frustration at not being able to process the written word in the same way most can.How much greater the frustration and the demoralisation must be when you are an undiagnosed child with dyslexia (“I wrote myself off,” says Oliver) or – as the programme goes on to make clear – a diagnosed child without sufficient support – is brought equally vividly to life. We hear descriptions from children now and from adults recollecting their painful years in an education system not cognisant of their needs. “I hated being me, I hated school, I hated life.” “I remember that feeling in the pit of my stomach, how scared I was.” “When [other children] try their best you can see it. But when I try my best it looks like I’m not doing anything at all.”Another helpful aid for those without the condition to get a sense of what it might be like is the various captions that accompany points made in the film, which are written as a dyslexic reader might experience them. “Dyslexia han sothisg [nothing] to bo with intelligesce.” It is “a learning bifference that affects the adility to reab, sqell, write, qrocess and remember information”. About 10% of children in an average class are thought to have the condition – another 15% are likely to be wrestling with other neurodiverse issues.View image in fullscreenWill it force the government’s hand? … Jamie's Dyslexia Revolution.Photograph: Jamie Oliver ProductionsOliver’s main focus is on the need for teachers to be better trained in the special needs that a quarter of each of their classes can have, and for mandatory early screening of all children for those needs to be introduced. Backed up, of course, by funding that doesn’t hack yet more money out of disappearing school budgets – for the training, screening and ongoing support of children. Specialists and scientists point out that teaching in ways and with materials that help children with dyslexia can help the entire class – no detriment is suffered by the majority by incorporating services for them as well. If anything, the introduction of multi-sensory learning and so on lifts all boats.Statistics suggest early intervention is worth it to society on practical as well as moral grounds. Students with dyslexia are now 3.5 times more likely to be expelled than those without. Expelled students are 200% more likely to get involved in violent crime. An estimated 50% of prisoners have a learning disability often only identified once they are residing at his majesty’s pleasure.Oliver and his team put together the facts and figures, the testimonies, their aims and ideal strategies, and hold a well-attended parliamentary event that they hope will lead – and indeed it does – to a meeting with the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson. Oliver sits with her, explaining his and parents’ and experts’ concerns, and at one deeply satisfying yet dismaying point pulling her up on her fudging or misapprehension of the current practice of screening. “It’s not statutory,” he points out. “And it’s not done for every child.”This raises bigger questions of course, beyond the remit of the programme, about the integrity of politicians, the knowledge of their subjects and why we live in a world where it takes celebrities to pressurise them into making change. Or at least, as Phillipson guardedly promises, to “take that away” and think about it.Oliver has less bounce to him than he did during his school dinners campaign. He looks weary, though still determined. He is doing, on both fronts, still better than the rest of us.Jamie’s Dyslexia Revolution is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJamie OliverDyslexiaSchoolsreviewsShareReuse this content"

What will the actor bring to the great Russian character who leaves her husband and son?Mon 9 Jun 2025 10.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 12.40 EDTShareIt was back in 2019 that the role of Anna Karenina was first mentioned to Natalie Dormer. Six years, many screen roles, one pandemic and two children later, Dormer is finally set to take on the titular role of Leo Tolstoy’s epic as Phillip Breen’s adaptation comes toChichester Festival theatre. The delay has ended up working out well, says Dormer, since Tolstoy’s characters are at the “cutting edge of technology”. The new railways were transforming Russia, and that wasn’t all. “Electric light!” exclaims Dormer. “We talk about it in the play, how that’s going to revolutionise their lifestyles. That trepidation about new technology is so adaptable to today: the terror of the AI train that’s coming our way. That generation of adults in the story – they’re on the precipice of a futuristic world. I think we can identify with that.”It’s only a few days before the first preview of the play, after five weeks of rehearsals, and Dormer is speaking from her dressing room over Zoom, a rail of costumes behind her. She had two children during those years she waited to play Anna. “It was a gift to become a mother before playing this role,” she says, pointing out that Breen’s adaptation has “really zeroed in on her guilt and grief, realising that she replaced her maternal love with amorous love – and that, ultimately, was her undoing”.Of course Dormer, who is 43, could have played Anna – the respected society woman who leaves her husband and son for her lover – without being a mother. “I’m sure other actresses are more than capable of getting themselves there,” she says. “But for me, being a mother has fleshed out this performance. We change and grow, with life experience, travel, relationships, loss, grief. As you get older, your opinion on life, on yourself, changes. Good drama at its core is about analysing the pivotal moments in life where the corner got turned. If I played Anne Boleyn now, I would play her differently to when I was 26, because I’m a completely different person. That’s the interesting thing.”View image in fullscreenHigh profile … with Jack Gleeson in Game of Thrones.Photograph: © HBO EnterprisesDormer’s screen roles have been high profile – Anne Boleyn in The Tudors, Margaery Tyrell in Game of Thrones, Cressida inThe Hunger Games– but she loves being back in the theatre. It was her first passion, lit by childhood trips with her grandmother. “To come back to the stage after seven or eight years, to be involved in a piece that has ambition for big, pivotal, defining emotion – I feel invigorated by the process.”She loves the camaraderie, particularly of this production, which features a large ensemble cast (including her partner David Oakes), musicians, and children from a local youth theatre and their chaperones. What’s it like working with Oakes? He plays the wealthy landowner Levin, she points out, and their stories are separate. “We have the perfect setup. He walks into rehearsal, I walk out. He walks on stage, I walk off. So it’s the best world of working together, but not working together.” At home, she says with a laugh, they practise their lines, because there are just so many of them. “It’s good to have a scene-running partner. ‘Just before you turn off the light, darling, could you just run these two scenes with me?’”Her Anna is, she says, a “proto-feminist” although she knows it can be contentious to inflict modern sensibilities on period pieces. The historian Hallie Rubenhold recently criticised the BBC for The Scandalous Lady W, its adaptation, starring Dormer, of her book about Lady Worsley, the 18th-century aristocrat who caused a scandal with her affair and elopement. Speaking at the Hay festival last month, Rubenhold said that, much as she enjoyed the experience, she was “slightly uncomfortable” that Dormer’s character was portrayed as feminist.“I really feel for academics,” says Dormer, with a smile (she nearly studied history at university, but went to drama school instead). Ultimately, her job, she explains, is to flesh out the character, “make them as three-dimensional and human as I can” – while choices about historical accuracy are made by others. “You can try and steer it,” she says. “I fought for Anne Boleyn to be more overtly evangelical, and educated in the reforming revolution that was happening in northern Europe at the time. She was a true reformer, so I fought to get one speech in that nodded to that.”View image in fullscreen‘Guilt and grief’ … in rehearsals with Phillip Breen.Photograph: CFT Marketing/Marc Brenner/Chichester Festival TheatreDormer, who grew up in Reading, was an only child until she was around seven, and she remembers playing alone a lot, pulling out clothes from her dressing-up box and talking to herself as different characters. As an adult, she says, “there’s always, for me, been a catharsis in storytelling. You’re trying to work out life. You’re trying to work out pain and anger and extreme joy. It’s a way of navigating feelings that are put so neatly into structured stories for us by wonderful writers, that makes them safe to explore.” In Anna Karenina, those feelings amount to: “Holy fuck, the world is crazy. It’s scary, and what world are we giving to our children? That’s one of those themes that makes it universal and timeless.”For a long time, Dormer has supported the children’s charities Childline and NSPCC, and in recent years has been involved with their campaigns on online safety. Dormer rattles off numbers, such as the more than 80% rise in online grooming of young people since 2017, the one in 14 children who have shared naked or semi-naked photos online. She doesn’t do social media, despite being advised early in her career that she should. In the frenzy followingGame of Thrones, and the huge boost to her profile, she could have picked up millions of followers but decided not to.“There’s a fork in the road when you’re in something of that level,” she says, “and I just kept my head down.” Privacy has always been something Dormer has guarded, but she did think about doing social media recently, then stopped herself. “I can’t quite bring myself to – until tech platforms take responsibility for their irresponsibility towards young people.”If there is a through-line in Dormer’s work, it’s that many of the women she plays have been constrained by their times, and the expectations placed on them, but have strategically made it work for them (Anne Boleyn, Margaery Tyrell) or broken free entirely (Anna Karenina, Lady Worsley) – even if many ultimately met an unpleasant end.In a new film, Audrey’s Children, due to be released in the UK this year, Dormer plays Dr Audrey Evans, a paediatric oncologist, who defies sexism and outdated thinking in the late 1960s to pioneer cancer treatment for children and the care of their families. Then, in the upcoming drama The Lady, about the royal aide Jane Andrews who was convicted of murdering her partner in 2001, Dormer plays Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, another woman navigating the clash between society’s expectations and her own excitable personality and reckless choices.View image in fullscreen‘If I played Anne Boleyn now, I would play her differently’ … with Jonathan Rhys Meyers in The Tudors.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyHas the choice of roles been deliberate? It was always about the quality of the part, says Dormer, and whether she wanted to work with a particular writer or director. But she adds: “If there are reccurring themes, then yes, they must be deeply embedded within me.”Dormer also points out how scripts for women have become much more interesting. “When I started 20 years ago, that devil/whore v angel character was still prevalent.” Female characters are allowed to be antiheroines these days, she points out, with unsavoury personalities and questionable actions. “That’s a revolution in itself.”I wonder what it was like to work with Madonna, who directed her in her 2011 film W.E. She laughs: “I can’t tell you – the NDA was that thick.” She holds her thumb and forefinger wide apart. But she does acknowledge that it was something she couldn’t have even dreamed about as a child growing up in the 80s, with her dressing-up box. “One of those moments when you catch yourself and you go, ‘How did this happen?’”It’s the same feeling, she says, when she stands on stage at the Chichester Festival theatre, her face on the posters outside. “So whatever you’re beating yourself up with today, maybe just enjoy it for a moment.” Is she hard on herself? “I increasingly try not to be. I think when I was younger, yes. Now, not so much. I’ve learned compassion for myself, and [had] a lot of good therapists. Understanding how you treat yourself is a mirror to what your children will emulate.”There’s nothing like being immersed in Russian literature, I suppose, to make you question life and its meaning. “Life is transient, as Tolstoy would tell us,” says Dormer with a smile, “so just enjoy this moment.”Anna Karenina is atChichester Festival theatreuntil 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreTelevisionGame of ThronesThe Hunger GamesChichester Festival theatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It was a firework’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 9 Jun 2025 10.31 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 12.26 EDTShareRay Foulk, co-founderIn 1968, when I was 22, my older brother Ronnie got a job as a fundraiser for a swimming pool on the island. I’d done a concert for CND [the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament], so we started talking about doing some sort of festival to raise the money. My younger brother Bill suggested it had to be pop. An agency in London gave Ronnie a list of acts including the Pretty Things, the Move, Fairport Convention, Tyrannosaurus Rex and an American act, Jefferson Airplane. We only had a £750 investment from theIsle of WightIndoor Swimming Pool Association, but after a friend lent us his £1,000 army pay-off, we managed to book all those bands, sell 10,000 tickets and break even. In the interim, the pool association pulled out because it didn’t like the publicity about hippies, drugs and sex, but they allowed us to use their investment and we were able to pay them back.That first event in 1968 was pretty shabby – the stage was a couple of flatbed trucks and the caterer ripped us off. We decided to do it again the following year, but properly. Ronnie had got Bob Dylan’s John Wesley Harding album for Christmas and argued that someone like Dylan would draw people to the island. He got Dylan’s manager Albert Grossman’s number from an underground magazine and called him. Dylan hadn’t performed since his motorbike crash in 1966 so we didn’t get far, but we kept calling. Grossman wanted Dylan to make a big comeback at the Woodstock festival, but the two had fallen out and weren’t speaking. Meanwhile, I’d been getting on well with Grossman’s partner, Bert Block, and one Wednesday night he sent a telegram saying Dylan had agreed to play the Isle of Wight. It felt like winning the lottery. But he wanted me to fly to New York to sign contracts, and said: “Don’t forget the dollars.”We didn’t have any money, so we approached various monied people. The head of Screen Gems Europe understood how big Dylan was and agreed to invest in us.View image in fullscreenGrowing … 120,000 at the festival in 1970.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamySuddenly we had a massive event that pulled in 150,000 people. George Harrison and Patti Boyd came to stay.John Lennon and Ringo arrived on the day. I’ll never forget watching Dylan playing tennis with three Beatles.By 1970, us three kids were big-time promoters who could book a raft of stars, and that year’s event attracted over half a million people. The Who were phenomenal, Joni Mitchell triumphant. The Doors’ Jim Morrison was out on bail and they played a moody, oddly moving set in near-darkness. Murray Lerner’s [1996] film about the 1970 event created a false narrative that it was a disaster. Yes, Kris Kristofferson was booed and there were flare-ups with radicals who wanted it to be a free festival like Woodstock, but most people loved it. It’s a myth that Jimi Hendrix played with the stage on fire – it was a firework. That was his last UK performance – 18 days later he was dead.People poured pints of Newcastle Brown over my head to put my burning helmet outWe had always battled councillors and the like moaning about “kids fucking in the bushes”, drugs and such, and after 1970 new restrictions made it impossible for us to put the festival on again. Still, we’d created a blueprint for the modern festival with camping. In 2002, John Giddings – who had attended in 1970 as a teenager – brought the event back. Today’sIsle of Wight festivalis a well-organised entertainment spectacular. In the 60s it was a pilgrimage to see countercultural artists who were singing about making the world a better place.Arthur Brown, singer, the Crazy World of Arthur BrownView image in fullscreen‘Crowds loved it if performers were doing extreme things’ … Arthur Brown.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyIn 1968 we’d just been at No 1 withFirewhen we were booked to headline a new festival. But then Jefferson Airplane said they would bring a phenomenal PA system from the US if they could top the bill, so we were bumped to headlining the “Great British groups”.In those days, crowds loved it if performers were drunk or doing extreme things. I would arrive on stage wearing a helmet with a pie dish on top filled with petrol and our lighting man would throw lit things at it until – whoosh – it went up in flames. At the Windsor jazz and blues festival the summer before, I’d been lowered on to the stage by crane but caught fire from my burning helmet. People poured pints of Newcastle Brown over my head to put me out, so I arrived on stage more like a drowned raccoon than “the God of hell fire”.From the archive: Dylan finally happens at Isle of WightRead moreAt the Isle of Wight, I’d planned to fly in by hot air balloon from Portsmouth, but on the day strong winds in the opposite direction scuppered that. I went on wearing face paint and a crazy costume, which was unusual then – and still is! In the rain I just couldn’t get the helmet to light, so I ended up swearing over the microphone. I was a God of hell fire without any flames, but people loved us.This year’sIsle of Wight festival is on 19-22 June. Ray Foulk’s books Stealing Dylan from Woodstock and The Last Great Event are published by Medina.

The second biggest English language Netflix series of all time. The most tense scene of an actor retching at the thought of a child eating a cheese sandwich. Such are the lists of firsts for this breathtaking drama abouttoxic masculinity in teensthat it’s nigh on impossible to overpraise it. For a few weeks, the entire world seemed to be talking about the astonishing single-shot cinematography, the terrifying realism of a premise that saw social media fuel a 13-year-old boy to murder a female classmate and stunning performances not just from storied veterans like Stephen Graham, but hyper-young first-time talent such as Owen Cooper. From now on, this is the bar by which all UK drama has to be judged.What we said:“A deeply moving, deeply harrowing experience.”Read the full reviewAmandalandBBC One/iPlayerCreating a spin-off based on Motherland’s least likable character was by no means a shoo-in for winning TV. But the subtlety and vulnerability Lucy Punch brings to her turn as post-divorce queen bee Amanda – paired with a script that skewers Insta-obsessed posh parents – makes for comedy gold. Add laugh-out-loud one liners from the likes of supporting characters Anne and Siobhán McSweeney’s sardonic chef Delia Fry and you have a televisual joy.

On the face of it, it’s a crime drama set in Kingston, Jamaica. But as it tells the story of Millie (Tamara Lawrance), a former London detective back in the Caribbean in search of a lost sibling and a missing girl, it becomes clear that it’s much more than that. Instead, Get Millie Black ponders the legacy of colonialism and the search for identity – sexual, national and existential – in the context of a broken family.What we said:“Millie-Jean Black is a force of nature, and a joy to watch, wherever she is in the world.”Read the full reviewHacksSky Max/NowIt was always going to be tough to follow a third season so glorious that it won the best comedy Emmy.

It also doesn’t hurt that the relationship between its two leads is one of TV’s most captivating. Roll on season five.What we said:“Season four of Hacks is very funny.

But Janice Okoh’s adaptation of her 2011 play Three Birds is a singular viewing experience – a wry depiction of three working-class Black children’s lives on a Birmingham estate as they try to fly below social services’ radar to keep the family together after their mum leaves. It’s at times tense, dark viewing – but only when it’s not dipping into chicken-based escapades or sing-alongs to R&B classics.

There is evil-laced glee to be had watching famous faces try to resist the comedy mastery of Bob Mortimer’s magic show and Daisy May Cooper’s re-enactment of being on a rollercoaster. No wonder Joe Lycett only lasted minutes!What we said: “Harriet Kemsley, who may well be the breakout contestant of the show, at one point looked as if she was having a nervous breakdown trying to stop a laugh from leaking out.”Read the full reviewMiss AustenBBC One/iPlayerAh, the joy of a new Jane Austen drama – except this one is about the real author, whose 250th anniversary is this year, and the personal letters her sister Cassandra destroyed. Still, the adaptation of Gill Hornby’s novel is every bit as swoony and whip-smart as one of the literary legend’s stories. Keeley Hawes is at her period drama peak as Cassandra, who reflects on her relationship with Jane after her death, and works to save her legacy – all while playing matchmaker for a female relative, of course.What we said:“The series becomes ever more of a treat as it goes on – warm, intelligent, clear-eyed, confident and thought-provoking.”Read the full reviewMoNetflixView image in fullscreenSharp gags about the US immigration experience … Mo Amer as Mo.Photograph: Eddy Chen/NetflixMo tackles a tough topic at a troubling time, but sharp gags and vibrant storytelling mean the comedy expertly skewers the immigration experience in the US today. This is a show about a Palestinian refugee trying to claim citizenship in the country he’s lived since he was a child – proving himself between two cultures, and (occasionally) making a pig’s ear of doing so. In series two, Mo finds himself trapped in Mexico, selling tacos and moonlighting as a lucha libre wrestler. Can he get back to America to attend the asylum hearing he’s been waiting 22 years for?What we said:“Mo brings together food, identity, immigration, family andMiddle Eastern politicsin a way that’s as fresh and intriguing as the falafel tacos that become central to the plot.”Read the full reviewPoker FaceSky Max/NowView image in fullscreenOddball antics … Natasha Lyonne with Cynthia Erivo x3 in Poker Face.Photograph: ParamountFrom meth-fuelled alligators to magician-splatted gerbils, glorious daftness is the name of the game in this howcatchem detective series. The majestically watchable Natasha Lyonne plays Charlie Cale, a serial crime solver with the handy knack of always knowing when someone is spouting “bullshit”. For its second outing, the homage to Columbo-like case-of-the-week shows feels more rounded, with stellar guest spots including Giancarlo Esposito as a murderous mortician, Rhea Perlman as a grudge-holding mob boss and Cynthia Erivo sharing the screen with herself as five separate sisters. Two seasons in, Rian Johnson’s oddball crime series is going strong.What we said:“With her gravelly-chipmunk New York tones – or “voice like a rusty clarinet”, as one character has it – Lyonne ensures Cale is an idiosyncratically charismatic protagonist you can really get behind.”Read the full reviewReunionBBC One/iPlayerView image in fullscreenEye-opening … Rose Ayling-Ellis and Anne-Marie Duff in Reunion.Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC/Warp FilmsThe best of the year’s TV crime dramas starring Rose Ayling-Ellis (see alsoITV’s Code of Silence) features stellar acting talent, with Anne-Marie Duff and Eddie Marsan also taking major roles. But the really breathtaking performance comes from Matthew Gurney, playing a deaf character newly released from prison after confessing to the inexplicable murder of his friend – and hellbent on vengeance. Action moves seamlessly from spoken dialogue to British Sign Language, and a script that frequently shines a light on the frustrations of living in a world designed for hearing people. It’s an eye-opening, thrilling piece of TV.What we said:“Gurney is a revelation. That he has had to wait until now for a lead television role says at least as much about the blinkered, ungenerous world of unchallenged norms we live in as Reunion itself does.”Read the full reviewSAS Rogue HeroesBBC One/iPlayerView image in fullscreenUnnervingly hair-triggered … SAS Rogue Heroes.Photograph: BBCIn one sense, Steven Knight’s dramatisation of the origins of the Special Air Service went off book for its second outing – sidelining Connor Swindells as main character David Stirling in an Italian jail to focus on Jack O’Connell’s unnervingly hair-triggered berserker, Paddy Mayne. But in another, it is very much business as usual: fist-pumping rock soundtrack, episodes that rattle along at full throttle and such a thrillingly anti-establishment attitude that it’s not hard to imagine even the authority figures flipping the bird every time they walk past a mirror. Quite possibly TV’s most rollicking historical drama.What we said:“A right old romp!”Read the full reviewSeveranceApple TV+View image in fullscreenSo deep and twisted … Severance.Photograph: AppleMore death, more weirdness, more goats: the second season of the surreal workplace science fiction drama is yet another grippingly bizarre exploration of corporate overreach. There are renegade brass bands, terrifying voyages down dark corridors, characters coming back from the dead and Adam Scott putting in a career-best performance as lead character Mark Scout – whose desperate bid to find the wife he believed to have died years ago scales heights of poignant bleakness. Were this buzzy show on a more popular streamer, it would be impossible to escape.What we said:“The first series was fantastically stylish, clever, trippy and compelling. The second is even more so. It demands all your concentration and takes you down rabbit holes so deep and twisted that you may meet yourself coming back.”Read the full reviewThe AssemblyITV1/ITVXView image in fullscreenIn the hot seat … Danny Dyer in The Assembly.Photograph: ITVAfter the success of Michael Sheen’s turn in The Assembly – a room in which a group of neurodivergent people fire questions at a visiting celebrity – the BBC’s decision not to produce more was baffling. Thank the TV gods then for ITV taking it on, and picking Danny Dyer as the first guest in the hot seat. The panel are fearless, funny and not afraid to ask questions most entertainment journalists wouldn’t dare to, while the celebrities (Gary Lineker, Jade Thirlwall and David Tennant also star) answer with rare candour – plus the musical performances will have you bawling.What we said:“This is some of the warmest telly you’ll see this year … even when Danny Dyer starts dropping f-bombs left, right and centre.”Read the full reviewThe ChangeChannel 4View image in fullscreenA call to arms for menopausal women everywhere … Bridget Christie as Linda in The Change.Photograph: Jon Hall/Channel 4Bridget Christie’s comedy drama isn’t just a window into her weird, whimsical mind – it’s a call to arms for “invisible” menopausal women everywhere. In the first hit season, she played fiftysomething Linda, a mother and wife who hops on a motorbike and escapes to the Forest of Dean to reconnect with her roots. The second season picks up with her navigating this new life, with plenty of life-affirming sisterhood moments – but most memorable are the side-splitting scenes with Paul Whitehouse’s Tony in the pub: “No, I like the company,” he tells Linda when she advises him to get shampoo for his lice problem.What we said:“It’s not easy to weave an ecstatic, rousing and laugh-a-minute TV show out of a toxic patchwork of midlife despair, domestic inequality, sexism, misogyny, culture wars and ecological and political crises. But Christie has gone and done it again.”Read the full reviewThe Last of UsSky Atlantic/NowFans of the video game this show is based on knew it was coming: Joel’s untimely death. But could the second season of the big-budget apocalyptic drama really survive without the giant presence of Pedro Pascal? Ellie’s (Bella Ramsey) melancholy, flashbacks and guitar playing proved too schmaltzy for some, but others appreciated these new emotional layers. Plus, it did drive a big new mission plot: bloody revenge on his killer, Abby (Kaitlyn Dever). Episode two, where an army of mushroom monsters invade the village, was a white knuckle ride reminiscent of Game of Thrones’s Battle of the Bastards (Mark Mylod, who worked on GoT, also directed this). Surely one of the most exciting episodes of the year?What we said:“Season one was a lot … relentless, constantly shifting and weaving to deliver devastation and heartbreak in brutal new ways. On its return for a second season, it has earned the right to take a breath and slow down.”Read the full reviewThe Last Musician of AuschwitzBBC Two/iPlayerView image in fullscreenShould ring in your ears for years … Anita Lasker-Wallfisch AKA The Last Musician of Auschwitz.Photograph: Toby Trackman/BBC/Two Rivers MediaThere have been some incredible documentaries to mark 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen (see also Sky’sThe Lost Music of Auschwitzand Sam Mendes’sWhat They Found). This film is exceptional in telling the extraordinary story of 99-year-old cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, the only surviving member of the women’s orchestra at Auschwitz. First-hand testimonies, archive footage and musical performances merge to show the utter confusion of prisoners playing such beautiful music in an evil hellscape – as well as tiny glimmers of resistance.What we said:“This incredibly impressive programme does not let us forget about Auschwitz’s corpse mountains or stench of burning bodies for a second, all the while posing questions about art and humanity that should ring in your ears for years to come.”Read the full reviewThe RehearsalSky Comedy/NowView image in fullscreenDon’t expect answers … Nathan Fielder in The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025Cloned dogs. A brutal musical talent show. An airport bar, fully recreated in a different state. A couple having an excruciating conversation about their intimacy issues while Nathan Fielder looks on impassively. It’s hard to do justice to the strangeness of Fielder’s latest comedy-reality-documentary series – which is ostensibly an attempt to improve inter-pilot communication on commercial aircraft but sometimes, you find yourself forgetting that. Instead, you’ll repeatedly question everything that is happening on screen: is it real? Is it cruel? Is everyone involved OK? How does Fielder come up with this stuff? Don’t expect many answers.What we said:“Frequently plane-crash TV – but my oh my, does it stick the landing.”Read the full reviewThe Settlers: Louis TherouxBBC Two/iPlayerView image in fullscreenNot many could keep their cool like this … Louis Theroux and Ari Abramowitz in The Settlers.Photograph: BBC/Mindhouse Productions Ltd/Josh BakerAfter a few years spent having low-stakes podcast chats with celebrities, it is great to see Louis Theroux back on top form with this bold sit-up-and-watch documentary. As a follow-up to his 2011 film, The Ultra Zionists, he returns to the West Bank in the wake of the 7 October attacks, as more Israeli religious nationalists settle in the occupied Palestinian territory. Not many could keep a level head spending time with Ari Abramowitz, a gun-holding settler from Texas who refuses to even use the word “Palestinian”, or Daniella Weiss, the aggressively outspoken “godmother” of the movement – even Theroux, in a moment that sees him step away from his usual gentle approach, asks whether she is a sociopath. It is alarming but absolutely necessary viewing.What we said:“I’ve been watching Theroux’s films for more than three decades, and watching him be this forthright feels like a true watershed moment in his career. It suits him.”Read the full reviewThe StudioApple TV+View image in fullscreenBreakneck comedy … Ike Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn, Seth Rogen and Chase Sui Wonders in The Studio.Photograph: APComedy doesn’t tend to move at the pace of The Studio, but this Hollywood satire operates at breakneck speed without skimping on the laughs. Seth Rogen plays Matt Remick, the newly installed head of a Hollywood studio whose ambition to make meaningful cinema is thwarted by his given task of getting a cash-grabbing Kool-Aid blockbuster off the ground. Fast-paced episodes see him and his team in farcical movie mogul scenarios: meddling on sets, fighting with directors, and tying themselves in knots trying to keep a glittering cast of cameo actors sweet.What we said:“You mustn’t come to The Studio looking for much hugging or learning. Emotional abruption, not growth, is the name of the game.”Read the full reviewThe TraitorsBBC One/iPlayerView image in fullscreenManna from heaven … Claudia Winkleman in The Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertWeird fake Welsh accents, professional opera singers who couldn’t act, a bizarre row about Harold Shipman: this season of the Claudia Winkleman-hosted murder mystery reality show has no shortage of memorable moments. Arguably the show’s weakest outing yet, each episode nonetheless felt like appointment TV in a way that no other show has managed in years.What we said:“For those who still believe reality TV can be truly edifying, The Traitors is manna from heaven: shedding light on how people lie and how easily others are taken in, how barely perceptible slips can give people away and how fast herd mentality and conspiracy theories can take hold has real sociological worth.”Read the full reviewThe White LotusSky Atlantic/NowView image in fullscreenShocking … Patrick Schwarzenegger in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOIt’s hard to argue that the Thailand-set instalment of Mike White’s luxury resort drama was its finest to date, dogged as it was by complaints over an unsatisfying finale and a fan-angering theme tune. But even a middling season of the gripping wealth satire is must-watch TV, withParker Posey’s accent setting social media ablaze, an incest scenethat proved to be the drama’s most shocking moment yetand Aimee Lou Wood emerging as the international star she’s long deserved to be. Where can the show go to top this?What we said:“Exquisitely shot, scripted, paced and performed, it’s a sumptuous feast for all the senses.”Read the full review#1 Happy Family USAPrime VideoView image in fullscreenLaugh-a-second stuff … #1 Happy Family USA.Photograph: PrimeEverything Ramy Youssef touches in the world of television turns to gold – and his edgy, laugh-a-second adult animation (created with South Park’s Pam Brady) is no exception. Following a Muslim family straight after 9/11, which makes everyone in their community run a mile from them, they double down on their love of all things American: Britney Spears, the Chicago Bulls … Bill Cosby. The funniest show of the year so far.What we said:“This is a show steeped in 00s nostalgia, and mentions of illegal streaming services like LimeWire and Napster, classic anime series Dragon Ball Z and even the Game Boy Advance had me misty-eyed. But it’s also rooted in the present. At a time when religious and racial prejudices seem to be steadily creeping back into vogue, and with Trump back in power, it feels quietly subversive – underlining just how necessary switching between two identities is for many people’s survival in American society.”Read the full reviewThe ResidenceNetflixView image in fullscreenDaffy detective … Uzo Aduba in The Residence.Photograph: Jessica Brooks/NetflixThere’s a dead body! In the White House! Luckily, given the fact that there’s a state dinner taking place for Australia’s top politicians – including a live performance by Kylie Minogue – it’s an open-and-shut case of suicide that should be easy to clear up … shouldn’t it? Obviously not. The gleefully idiosyncratic turn from Orange is the New Black’s Uzo Aduba as a maverick detective fills this daffy procedural with fun, as she strews political chaos in her wake while trying to get to the bottom of the crime. If only US politics were normally this fun …What we said:“A gorgeous, gleeful romp that allows not just Aduba but all of the many players in the cast to shine.”Read the full reviewUnforgotten: Bradford City FireBBC Two/iPlayerTaking place just a few weeks before the Heysel Stadium disaster, the devastating fire at Bradford City FC’s Valley Parade ground in 1985 is, in many ways, a forgotten tragedy. This moving documentary is an overdue commemoration of the 56 lives that were lost (watching the horrifying footage, you’ll marvel that it wasn’t many more) and an exploration of the safety oversights and regulatory failures that allowed it to happen. The Bradford fire changed football as profoundly as the Hillsborough disaster: this documentary explains why.What we said:“Courageously, this film tries to rescue hope and humanity from the ashes.”Read the full reviewWhat It Feels Like for a GirlBBC Three/iPlayerView image in fullscreenFun and vicious … Laquarn Lewis as Lady Die, Hannah Jones as Sasha, Ellis Howard as Byron, Alex Thomas-Smith as Sticky Nikki and Adam Ali as Dirty Damian in What It Feels Like for a Girl.Photograph: Enda BoweSpiky, fierce and up for absolutely anything, 15-year-old Byron (a scintillating Ellis Howard) is so bored they start giving sexual favours for fivers in the local public loos … and so starts a rollercoaster story of self-discovery around the clubs, caffs and grim bogs of their home town Hucknall and the big city beyond: Nottingham. Based on Paris Lee’s thrilling memoir, Byron soon meets a gang of queer and trans friends known as the Fallen Divas and learns the power and bliss of being yourself (not before getting into lots of scrapes, mind.)What we said:“It’s certainly a wild ride – and I’ll struggle to look at a toilet brush the same way ever again.”Read the full reviewShare your favouriteYou can tell us your favourite TV show of the year so far using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

The kids get absolutely annihilated. But they’d do a whole lot better if they were more like the menacing, knife-wielding little terrors who populate Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara’s world. Try dribbling past a toddler when he’s just jabbed a shiv in your calf, Lionel Messi.‘A knife crime waiting to happen’: how Yoshitomo Nara became Japan’s most expensive artistRead moreFor 40 years now Nara has been dealing in cutesy kitsch with a vicious edge. His paintings and drawings of adorably bug-eyed little nippers are singularly Nara: love it or hate it, he’s carved out his own instantly recognisable aesthetic path.Me, I quite like it. It’s full of punk rock attitude, dark humour and comic book immediacy. This huge show at the Hayward kicks off with a ramshackle shed in the middle of the gallery, filled with empty beer cans, coffee cups and hundreds of drawings on paper and cardboard. A speaker blasts out rock’n’roll and folk classics by Nick Drake and David Bowie. A painting on the outside shows a blissed out little kid in a serene green field: “place like home”, it says in big bold all-caps. The huge wall opposite is lined with old prog and rock LPs.This could’ve been the whole show and it would have been perfect; it’s everything Nara needs to say. Here in this little wooden shack sanctuary he loses himself in music and draws his heart out. The images all over the floor show punk-rocking kids blasting out chords on electric guitars, protesting against war and shooting pistols while standing on a snarling dog, yelling “I’m a son of a gun”.View image in fullscreenBanging the Drum by Yoshitomo Nara, 2020.Photograph: Courtesy the artist and private collectionIt’s Nara summed up: a joyful mashup of music nerdery, political anxiety and the uncontrollable urge to draw, draw, draw. You get the sense that if his career had started and ended in this shack, no success, no big museum-style shows, just music and art, he’d have been pretty happy.But this is a big show so there’s a lot more to get through. His early work is more expressionistic and dark, a little more scrawly and angry, like a pissed off Basquiat, or George Grosz drawing comics. But by the mid-90s he’d figured himself out and stripped everything back. His cartoon-y grumpy kids now sit against plain backgrounds, there’s nothing to distract you from them as symbols of Nara’s emotional states: boredom, anger, loneliness, sadness, frustration. That’s all that’s here, emotion pure and simple. A little girl with a bandaged face is livid about having the mumps, a figure (dressed as kitty) sitting on duck-shaped potty is seriously angry that you’re having a peek, and the world’s naughtiest child is grinning demonically after cutting a flower down with a saw, a big “fuck you” painted on the back of her jacket. It’s super-direct, simple, funny, emotional painting.Nara repeats this approach over and over across the years. His figures burn down houses, swear, smoke, brandish weapons, play guitars. It’s the punk rebellion of youth continuing to find a voice. The kids resemble a take on forest sprites, little mythological figures used to tell stories, express emotions.It’s not all angry self-reflection. More recent work finds Nara fighting for peace. One girl wears a “no war” T-shirt, another stands under a massive “stop the bombs” banner.Things change in 2011, when the tragedy ofFukushimasends Nara spiralling. Now the kids are all hazy and heartbroken. They’re not ranting and raving any more, they just seem to haunt the canvases, barely there, sad and forlorn. I don’t think these are good paintings for the most part, despite being about something incredibly sad: they’re just too washed out and overthought, a bit mawkish and soft focus. And there’s something not quite right about giving these big canvases all this space, and these benches for you to contemplate them from, in a show that’s otherwise all chaos and energy.View image in fullscreenFire by Yoshitomo Nara, 2009.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Yuichi Kawasaki CollectionI’m not totally convinced the work warrants this many rooms. It all gets a bit repetitive and stretched. And the ceramic heads dotted around the space, especially the tea cup fountain at the end, add absolutely nothing to the exhibition. But the best work here can be so joyful, approachable, angry and relatable that you can forgive these faults.Nara is best when he’s being direct and immediate, when his art is about rocking out, fighting back and letting his heart spill on to the canvas. When he’s hey ho-ing and let’s going like his beloved Ramones. I’ve never encountered a show less in need of explanatory wall texts, or more resistant to artsy over-intellectualising: Nara tells you exactly what he feels, all the time. He just does it with the stereo blasting, and a knife behind his back.At the Hayward Gallery, London, from 10 June to 31 AugustExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtSouthbank CentreJapanFukushimareviewsShareReuse this content"

It is important that we support both teachers and young people so that these topics can be discussed.”In the Netherlands, the series is being used in secondary schools after a proposal from the GreenLeft-Labour MP Barbara Kathmann, with materials on social media influencers and peer pressure developed in conjunction with Netflix by a media studies institute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked why it was such a good subject, he said: “People dress up in the rainbow colours, you get some great placards, what’s not to like?” He said he had shot Pride events in Manchester and the Isle of Wight. “Bristol is more lively and quite cosmopolitan.”Though he has lived in Bristol since the 1980s, for years he did not take many photographs in the city. “I told myself, when I am home in Bristol I should rest.” But he is making up for that now. “About five years ago, I said: ‘I must shoot Bristol.’ I had been missing out. How stupid can you be?”Daryn Carter, the director of Bristol Pride, took his first look at the exhibition with the Guardian and was clearly thrilled at the show.View image in fullscreenA selection of Parr’s photographs from Bristol Pride.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian“It’s amazing when you come around the corner and see them,” he said. “The colour really grabbed my attention and then the images – just incredible. Pride is something that is so special and the parade and the festival itself brings so much joy and celebration and I can see that in this room.”Carter said Parr had never made a fuss of attending the event. “I remember spotting Martin in the festival site, I think it was in 2018. I was just like: ‘Is that Martin Parr?’ And then we discovered obviously that he had been coming for a few years and we started to talk about the exhibition. We’re so fortunate that Martin is so passionate and supportive.”Carter picked out an image of a child on someone’s shoulders holding a Bristol Pride flag. “Especially with the current climate, I think of the younger generation as the hope for our future. Times are quite hard at the moment for the LGBTQ+ community and we want to ensure that Pride is an event that’s open for everyone and that all ages come so that they can see and celebrate diversity and expression.”Carter also highlighted a photo of a person carrying a sign reading: “Trans. Here in 1969. Here in 2019. Here always.” Carter said: “I think it’s interesting because I think a lot of people think that trans and the gender debate is something that’s new or it’s just the current thing. But actually it’s not. You know, trans people have always existed.”Another eye-catching image is of a drag queen looking intently at a phone with a can of Blackthorn cider – a drink closely associated with south-west England – balanced in the crook of their elbow.Carter said: “Martin’s got a very candid eye and he captures the behind-the-scenes and people enjoying and embracing the festival.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ballet’s owner, Jean-Pierre Gasquet, has waived his fee.Originally a French ballet by Jean Dauberval, Ashton’s choreography, first staged in1960, turned La Fille mal gardée into one of the best-loved English ballets, featuring slapstick humour, a maypole and traditional folk dance.The Ukrainian government hasasked cultural institutions in the country and abroad to boycottballet productions by Russian composers and choreographers on the grounds that Vladimir Putin is seeking to use culture “as a weapon” and justification for the war.The artistic director of ballet at the National Opera of Ukraine, Nobuhiro Terada, said the issue was sensitive, but that the turning point had come when dancers at the Donetsk Opera and Ballet theatre in Russian-occupied Ukraine performed the shape of a Z, a pro-war symbol, in the autumn of 2022.“After that, Putin claimed that Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, Stravinsky, all of them, belong to the Russian world and Russian people,” he said.View image in fullscreenDancers from the Kyiv national opera and ballet during a rehearsal of La Fille mal gardée.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“After this story, the minister of culture of Ukraine at that moment, said ‘no more’. Politics and culture are different things. But at that moment, there were a lot of victims of this war, and we realised relatives of these victims, they don’t want to hear Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and Prokofiev.“It’s a very sensitive question. I’m not a politician, I have to accept an opinion of Ukrainian people. Tchaikovsky, he was in Kyiv, he lived in Kyiv, and Prokofiev was even born in Donetsk.“Of course, we want to perform Tchaikovsky and a lot of performers they want it, and it needs to happen for the next generation, in my opinion. But today it’s not a good time to perform.”The boycott is controversial even among the cast of the La Fille mal gardée, which tells the story of a young woman named Lise who is determined to be with a young farmer rather than her mother’s choice of dim-witted Alain, the son of a wealthy landowner.View image in fullscreenDaniil Silkin, who plays Alain, worked as a combat medic.Photograph: Daniil SilkinDaniil Silkin, 29, worked as a combat medic in the Ukrainian army for the first 18 months of the war but will perform as Alain in the production thanks to a time-limited exemption on service for performers.He said he did not agree with the boycott of the seminal works, which he described as a “big part of world ballet”.“I don’t think the Ukrainian government was right,” he said. “I think they should say to the people that Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and Prokofiev do not belong to Putin. They were of a very different time.”Andrianna Shabaeva, 20, whose role is as one of the friends of the main female character, said she had not had the opportunity to perform the Russian classics because of the full-scale invasion three years ago.“Maybe one day. But not before the Russians go away,” she said.Terada, who came to live permanently in Ukraine without his parents in 1986 as an 11-year-old boy as part of a cultural exchange between ballet schools in Japan and the Soviet Union, said the boycott of Russian works had forced the opera house to look more widely for productions.With international assistance, it has since performed 5 Tango’s by the Dutch choreographer Hans van Manen, Spring and Fall by John Neumeier and Alexei Ratmansky’s Wartime elegy.Terada, who was appointed director in 2022, said: “Before the war, we didn’t have any opportunity to work with these famous names. They decided to help Ukraine and National theatre and ballet because of war.The Reckoning review – shattering stories of invasion in UkraineRead more“And thanks to Ivan Putrov and the other sponsors, we’ve got this production, La Fille mal gardée. It was impossible to get the choreography of Frederick Ashton. You need to pay. That is the reason that this Ukrainian theatre during last 50 years have had the same productions: Swan Lake, Nutcracker, Spartacus.“I clearly understand – it’s not popular, what I’m going to say – but when war is happening, we need to use this opportunity and to get the best from the world, because all world is going to help Ukraine.”The audience in Kyiv will have access to the coat room as a shelter during Russian air raids, but other inconveniences of putting on a show during a war are more difficult to overcome.Putrov, whoseDance for Ukraineevent in London has helped finance the new production, said: “I think it was 60 men who were called up from the stage crew. I think they only have 19 left.“La Fille mal gardée is a beautiful blockbuster, a classic that is sunny, that is the most English of the ballets, with a grand dame, pantomime, maypole, clog dance. It will lift the spirits. What are Ukrainians fighting for? They’re fighting for the way of life they want to live, and it’s very important that the spirit is sustained.”Explore more on these topicsBalletUkraineRussiaDanceEuropePyotr TchaikovskyIgor StravinskynewsShareReuse this content"

TV this brief needs to be perfectly formed …. and this is far from itLucy ManganMon 9 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 12.02 EDTShareIf something is going to be small, it needs to be perfectly formed. If it’s a short story, you need to be giving itKatherine Mansfieldlevels of welly. If you’re contemplating a 90-minute adaptation of Great Expectations, you need to be David Lean. If it’s a canape, it needs to be a tiny yorkshire pudding with a mini slice of roast beef tucked in and a dot of horseradish on the top. A smear of cream cheese on a cracker won’t do.And if you are putting together a set of three 15-minute films as the first original drama for Channel 4’s digital platform, to be shown onYouTubeto try to get the youth market to pump the brakes on its handcart to hell and see what this “art” business is all about (before it is streamed in one gobbet on your main broadcast channel), the same principle applies. It needs to be a miracle of compression, a story told without a wasted second or word. It will need to evoke much but still nail the key points and obey the narrative rules by which we make sense of any tale and through which we enjoy it.Beth is a yarn written and directed by photographer and short film-maker Uzo Oleh, about a couple who unexpectedly fall pregnant after giving up on IVF after many unsuccessful attempts. Molly (Abbey Lee) is a willowy, Scandinavian-looking blond. Her husband, Joe (Nicholas Pinnock), is Black. The longed-for baby, Imogen (later played, once we’ve skipped through some years, by Jemima Lown) is the image only of her mother. The doctor, Balthas (Nick Blood) who oversaw their fertility treatments is white, too, and suddenly the comforting hand he placed on Molly’s knee during their last session looks like the tip of an iceberg.If you did not know from the accompanying publicity that this was a sci-fi drama you would be pretty sure where the story was heading. And in fact the couple do split up – we next see Joe coming to collect Imogen when she is about six or seven from her friend’s birthday party because Molly has an appointment, and taking her back to her grandma Gabby (Louise Bangay). On his way to Molly’s house to pick up the medications Gabby has left behind, Joe sees her and the doctor together in the local pub and at the house we see evidence that the two of them are living together. It is not clear if this is news to Joe – and if so, how, given that Imogen’s age suggests it is unlikely to be a recent development – but whatever the case, he is provoked into opening her laptop and reading through the emails between Dr Balthas and Molly about Imogen. Again, questions abound – of the irritating, technical sort rather than a product of intrigue. Are these current emails, in which case does this couple not talk face to face about the child? Or has he seamlessly located a cache from six or seven years ago that discusses her origins? Harking back, what did tip him over into this uncharacteristic fury so long after the event? Perhaps most pressingly – why is he hung up on the suggestion of infidelity when there is a key word in most of the emails that would stop the rest of us in our tracks, suggesting as it does an event of world-changing proportions?Meanwhile, at home with Molly, grandma’s own suspicions are hardening into certainty, while Molly returns home to Joe and confirms his and ours.The ending is not compressed so much as wildly rushed. The entire run time is 34 minutes (I don’t know if this means the YouTube films will break even their quarter hours up to allow adverts, but God we’re in an even worse state than I thought if so) and too much of this is spent depicting the couple’s “unbreakable” bond, the delight in the pregnancy and labouring the sweetness of the child (the latter with no narrative payoff at all – it’s irrelevant to the reveal). I’d rather have had 30 more seconds devoted to contemplating the implications of Joe’s discovery (or even explaining the email thing) and done without quite so much of Joe’s brother dilating on Molly’s attractiveness at a party, presumably to make the possibility of an affair with Balthas more plausible.Beth is a very stylish and confidently directed piece, with fine performances throughout – especially from Pinnock, though he also benefits from having the most to do. But the script needs to be tighter and work harder so that we aren’t left feeling as if we’ve just watched the beginning of a Black Mirror episode. An endeavour like this should feel dense but leave you wanting more – through tantalisation and not, as here, largely through frustration.Beth is on YouTube now and on Channel 4 at 10pm on 9 June.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewYouTubereviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the first time I’ve seen it, having missed bothits opening runand the 2018 revival, and it strikes me as an example of Kosky’s work at its finest: probing, insightful, sometimes witty, sometimes dark, always utterly engrossing.Premiered in 1739, Saul has often been compared to King Lear. There is much of Shakespeare in this portrait by Handel and his librettist, Charles Jennens, of the Old Testament king whose mind slowly disintegrates under the challenges presented to him politically and privately by David after the death of Goliath.View image in fullscreenGarish colours give way to black when Saul drags his country into war.Photograph: ASH/Glyndebourne ProductionsMindful that the work also examines the moral arguments around dethroning an anointed king – still a huge issue in the wake of theRevolution of 1688– Kosky updates the oratorio to the time of composition, though his 18th century is a stylised, hedonistic place, reminiscent of Hogarth orFellini’s Casanovain its gaudy seediness. Garish colours give way to black in the second half when Saul’s behaviour drags his country into war. Kosky underpins the Shakespearean resonances by weaving four small roles together for a single performer (tenor Liam Bonthrone), effectively a jester, who stands in relation to Saul much as the Fool does to Lear.Jonathan Cohen conducts the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with great subtlety and dramatic weight, admirably capturing the work’s sometimes unsettling urgency. Christopher Purves (Saul) and Iestyn Davies (David) are both returning to the roles they played in 2015. Purves’s snarling delivery has an almost expressionist ferocity, but he is of course a superb actor and his depiction of Saul’s mental breakdown is at times almost distressingly vivid. Davies is his perfect foil, always calm and psychologically centred, suggesting unswerving certainties of faith. His voice remains unearthly in its beauty, and time stands still when he singsOh Lord, Whose Mercies Numberless.View image in fullscreenWonderfully caustic … Liam Bonthrone as the fool.Photograph: ASH/Glyndebourne ProductionsThe rest of the cast are equally strong. Sarah Brady’s Merab is all hauteur and adamantine coloratura, in contrast to Soraya Mafi’s softer voiced Michal. Linard Vrielink makes an outstanding Jonathan, handsomely lyrical, his love for David beautifully realised, while Bonthrone is wonderfully caustic as Kosky’s newly created fool. The chorus, whether sashaying through one of Otto Pichler’s classy dance routines, or negotiating Handel’s complex counterpoint with perfect clarity, are simply sensational.AtGlyndebourneuntil 24 JulyExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicGlyndebourneFestivalsMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It seems they were first bankrolled partly by crowdfunding, and then presumably kept going by the production’s low overheads and straight-to-retail distribution to an audience that clearly grooves to quasi-Tolkienian, Dungeons and Dragons-style quests featuring a motley band (there is usually an elf or dwarf). If you like your necromancy tales spiked with huge chunks of nattering as the characters endeavour to bulk out the running time with lots of banter and exposition, this may be just the ticket. Don’t worry too much about not having seen the other five films because this is reasonably watchable, especially as so much time is devoted to filling newbies in on the backstory via dialogue and voiceover.In any case, this is a bit of reboot with the meagre plot unfolding about 15 years after events in the last film. The ensemble is made of up all-new characters who allude to such figures as Marek the slave girl-cum-magician who led the franchise earlier. This go-round, our protagonist is The Stranger (Will Kemp), known just as Stranger to his friends; he is an apothecary/bounty hunter (clearly in this medieval economy everyone has two or three jobs) travelling with a mysterious cargo in his wagon. Stranger finds Erid (Nate Morley), an injured young man, on the road and brings him to an inn run by Irish-accented dwarf Giblock (Joe Abraham). The inn just happens to be where Erid had been living as a one of Giblock’s slaves along with comely Arlin (Ryann Bailey), but Erid recently got caught up in a catastrophe when the local witch, who goes by the delightful moniker Mahitable Crow (Barta Heiner), murdered everyone in the nearby village, making Erid the sole survivor.As a terrible storm is raging outside, other travellers keep fetching up at the inn, including a loudmouth local marshal and his elven sidekick, a hulking hunter, a mysterious vampy woman, and so on. It’s like The Hateful Eight but with slightly less ponderous dialogue and crisper editing. The nocturnal time-frame means the darkness can disguise the shonkiness of the visual effects during the sequence when a human character turns into a CGI bear. In the final scenes – in daytime – the purple smoke and CGI lightning looks even cheaper and shonkier, which is in its way sort of endearing. But credit is due to the cast and director Jake Stormoen (who played a character in the earlier films) for serving this up with a surprisingly persuasive gravity and straight faces. You can tell it comes from a place of respect for the franchise’s audience.Mythica: Stormbound is on digital platforms from 16 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The phrase he’s teaching? “Yo noquieroagua, yoquierobebida”, which in English translates to “I don’t want water, I want a drink”. As people used to say: yolo.This is the vibe ofPitbull’s Party After Dark tour, which returns to the UK for its second run this year. It’s a relentless ride through the era of hedonistic and carefree EDM pop that sprouted up after the 2008 financial crisis, and given renewed economic uncertainty and horrific global events, it’s unsurprising that people are still seeking escapism. Why shouldn’t that be delivered by a bald man in his 40s known for rapping “I saw, I came, I conquered / Or should I say: I saw, I conquered, I came”?Tonight, Pitbull – who has more listeners every month on Spotify than Beyoncé or Lana Del Rey – is like a cult leader: the audience are zealously devoted, and that perhaps explains why they’re able to ignore the flaws. The set is regularly padded by dull DJ interludes, the main attraction disappearing off to change his jacket. The set list is chaotic, the band randomly interpolating The Final Countdown or songs by Guns N’ Roses and Beastie Boys. And when Pitbull is on stage the sound is so muddy that you can hardly make out what he’s rapping.He is magnetic, though, and it’s easy to be seduced by indelible hits such as DJ Got Us Fallin’ in Love Again, Feel This Moment, and line-dance jumper Timber. His frenetic, slightly cheesy performance style is like that of a children’s entertainer, albeit for kids hyped on vodka Red Bull rather than apple juice. During his well-rehearsed chat, meanwhile, it’s more booze-soaked motivational speaker. “Life is not a waste of time. And time is not a waste of life,” he informs the crowd. “Let’s not waste any time and get wasted tonight.”The crowd wildly lap all this up. No one, Pitbull included, seems to care that as a package it’s not particularly good. This show is about losing yourself, taste and quality be damned.

But Yen, who looks undeniably good in a suit, is more convincing on his habitual fisticuff grounds than the jurisprudential ones.Yen plays Fok, a one-time hotshot cop who – leaving the force after some over-zealous policing – decides to man the “final gate” of justice and become a public prosecutor. Like a low-carb Perry Mason with years of Brazilian jiu-jitsu behind him, trouble keeps knocking on his door. Suspecting that a young drug smuggler (Mason Yung) whose case he is assigned has pled guilty to get his higher-ups off the hook, Fok starts looking into his slippery lawyer, Au Pak Man (Julian Cheung).Insisting his character’s knees are shot and he can’t do this for ever, The Prosecutor lays the ground for a post-martial arts career for Yen. Not that you’d know it from undimmed reserves of inventiveness here: a hyper-dynamic initial police raid, with Yen toting a submachine gun and riot shield, flits between drone-borne third-person and first-person cop’s eye mayhem. But this brio is dragged down by the convoluted and muddily dramatised legal sequences. Trying to establish Fok’s counter-intuitive prosecuting style, it is confusing in the detail and manipulative in the summary arguments there to set up Au’s cartoon villainy.Maybe a more grounded director, such as Johnnie To, could have made an eyebrow-raising conceit like a vigilante prosecutor work. Though Yen raises fleetingly interesting points about the pliability of the justice system, he can’t bend enough to reconcile the film’s legal and brawling sides in a way that avoids glaring irregularities; surely, for example, Fok’s extracurricular tangling with the drug gang would have seen him immediately struck off? Yen’s self-confidence as a performer may make the courtroom grandstanding appear self-righteous, but that is no bad quality out on the warpath. He even sells saying “I object!” mid-melee in the finale as he and a knuckle-dusting thug pound a metro carriage like a steel drum.The Prosecutor is available on digital platforms on 16 June and on Blu-ray on 23 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsCrime filmsChinaAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Kinkade’s typical subjects – rustic landscapes, sleepy cottages, quaint gazebos – bask in an idyllic calm, a luminous callback to a fabled simpler past. Turning to his unpublished archive, Miranda Yousef’s engrossing documentary portrait unveils the dark shadows that lurked within the self-titled “painter of light”.Through interviews with family members, close collaborators and critics, as well as Kinkade’s own words, the film traces his meteoric success in the 1980s and 90s. Shunned by the art world, he marketed his works through home-shopping television channels and a network of franchise stores to a ravenous fanbase. The Kinkade name became a brand and his pictures were plastered on to collectible plates, cookie jars and mugs. At its peak, his empire generated more than $100m a year.Kinkade proclaimed that his art was for everybody. In reality, his paintings appealed to a specific demographic of white, conservative and largely Christian Americans. Yousef’s film does touch on the ideological nature of his work – how it stands in stark contrast to, for example, the subversive art of Robert Mapplethorpe and other contemporaries – though it could have merited more in-depth insight and contextualisation.‘A modern-day Greek tragedy’: the life and death of artist Thomas KinkadeRead moreYousef’s access to Kinkade’s private archive, however, is revelatory. Once tucked away in a vault, these secret canvases are haunted by tortured figures and somber landscapes, cast in subdued hues of brown, black and burgundy. Together they reflect Kinkade’sstruggles with depression and addiction. Here is a visual portal to a hidden side of a controversial artist – one that is not for sale.Artfor Everybody is at Bertha DocHouse, London, from 13 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPaintingArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

The film follows three twentysomething friends as they navigate various degrees of deafness. Alan, played by first-time deaf actor Marco Ng, is a cochlear implant (CI) user. He is also an ambassador for the surgery, which can help restore sound perception for those with hearing loss. Wolf (Neo Yau), his childhood friend, is a staunch user and supporter of sign language, which at one point was prohibited in local deaf schools; such institutions prioritised speech training, then believed to work better for hearing-impaired students. Sophie (Chung Suet Ying) is at a crossroads: she is a CI user who cannot sign, but yearns to learn.It would, of course, be simplistic to portray these different forms of communication as inherently at odds with one another; instead, Wong’s film emphasises that, whether it is CI surgery or sign language, deaf people must be granted the autonomy to make these decisions on their own. Besides posing these thought-provoking questions, Wong also constructs rich inner worlds for these characters, in which deafness is only one thread of a whole tapestry. Wolf’s passion for the sea, for instance, is felt in the smallest of details, such as the ocean-themed trinkets that line his study desk. It’s the kind of visual attention that renders his dismissal from a diving school due to a lack of sign language interpreters even more heartbreaking.Like many films dealing with social issues, The Way We Talk is not without its moments of didacticism, but the easy chemistry between the three leads lends the film a natural, infectious warmth that engagingly foregrounds its message of community.The Way We Talk is in UK cinemas from 13 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDeafness and hearing lossHong KongAsia PacificHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Particularly if it saves you 15 minutes’ boiling and then mashing some potatoes. Bookmark this for chillier summer evenings – I’m determined to eat as many meals as possible outside right now, and this will keep you warm when the temperature dips to an unseasonal sub-15C.Harissa and gnocchi-topped fish pieUse your favourite type of fish, or add some prawns, if you like.Prep15 minCook20 minServes4250ml milk50g rose harissa– I likeBelazu100g cream cheese1tsp sea salt flakes260g sustainably-sourced cod, or other white fish, cut into roughly 3½cm chunks260g trout, cut into roughly 3½cm chunks150g frozen peas, defrosted500g gnocchi(fresh or vac-packed)20g salted butter100g cheddar, gratedPut the milk, harissa, cream cheese and salt in a large saucepan, turn on the heat and whisk until the cheese melts and is thoroughly incorporated. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a bare simmer – just the tiniest bubbles should break the surface, otherwise you’ll boil the fish. Add all the fish and leave to poach for 10 minutes. Add the peas for the last two minutes. Once cooked, the fish should very gently flake apart when cut with a fork, but still neatly hold its shape.Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to a pie dish or small roasting tin, then scoop out the peas and scatter over the top. Bring the harissa milk mix back to a boil, drop in the gnocchi and cook for two minutes. Then – and stay with me here – you’re going to hold a colander over the fish dish and pour the harissa milk through it on to the fish, leaving the gnocchi in the colander. Stir the butter through the gnocchi in the colander, then tip the gnocchi evenly over the contents of the pie dish.Turn on the grill to medium-high, scatter the cheese over the gnocchi, then grill the fish pie for three to five minutes, until the cheese is golden brown and bubbling – this may take slightly more or less time, depending on how fierce your grill is, so keep an eye on it.

Today’s ones are cooling, nourishing, hydrating and a little more fortifying than the usual chop-and-blitz raw soups such as gazpacho.

Saute briefly, then add the ginger, lemongrass and chillies, and cook, stirring, until fragrant. Pour in the yoghurt mix, add the sugar and season with sea salt.Cook, stirring constantly, on a medium heat until the mix comes to a boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes. Take off the heat, leave to cool, then cover and chill in the fridge for at least four hours, until very cold.Meanwhile, sprinkle the cucumber slices with a teaspoon sea salt, leave for 15 minutes, then rinse, drain and squeeze out any excess water.Soak the noodles in boiling water for five minutes (or cook them according to the packet instructions), then drain, place in ice-cold water and drain again.Divide the noodles between four bowls.
