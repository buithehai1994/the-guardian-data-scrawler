Keir Starmer’s more conciliatory approach to the Trump administrationappeared to have paid off.However, the UK’s growth forecasts are likely to be downgraded as a result, and the tariffs could cost thousands of jobs and force the government to implement further spending cuts or tax rises in autumn.UK ministers have ruled out imposing retaliatory barriers while talks on an economic deal with the US continue, and are hoping for further carve-outs for UK companies, which export more than £60bn worth of goods to the US each year.Trump’s wall of tariffs is likely to raise prices and cause chaos for businessRead moreIn a watershed announcement for global trade, Trump announced that he was setting a universal “baseline” 10% tariff on imports into the US, while hitting dozens of trading partners with higher levies of up to 50%.He also hit out at “exorbitant” VAT rates, which he viewed as a barrier to US firms seeking to sell into markets such as the UK where the taxes apply.At a press conference in the White House Rose Garden, he said: “For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike … our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen any more.“This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our declaration of economic independence. For years, hard-working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, but now it’s our turn to prosper.”Addressing a crowd including his vice-president, JD Vance, the cabinet, White House aides and US workers, Trump added: “This will be, indeed, the golden age of America. It’s coming back, and we’re going to come back very strongly.”After the announcement, Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, said: “The US is our closest ally, so our approach is to remain calm and committed to doing this deal, which we hope will mitigate the impact of what has been announced today.Perilous and chaotic, Trump’s ‘liberation day’ imperils the world’s broken economy – and him | Martin KettleRead more“We have a range of tools at our disposal and we will not hesitate to act … nobody wants a trade war and our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table and the government will do everything necessary to defend the UK’s national interest.”A No 10 source said: “We don’t want any tariffs at all, but a lower levy than others vindicates our approach. It matters because the difference between 10% and 20% is thousands of jobs.”Earlier, Starmer had told MPs the government was“prepared for all eventualities”and while all options were on the table he would avoid any kneejerk response.UK officials are understood to have reached broad agreement with US counterparts on a trade deal, focusing on technology but including other sectors, which they hope will eventually reduce tariffs. However, they acknowledged getting a trade deal over the line could take weeks or months.There is also a risk of the UK being flooded by cheap goods from countries such as China as trade is diverted from the US to other markets, and the government is drawing up plans to protect key industries such as pharmaceuticals, cars, food and drink.“A trade war is in nobody’s interest, and the country deserves, and we will take, a calm, pragmatic approach,” Starmer told MPs at prime minister’s questions.“That is why constructive talks are progressing to agree a wider economic prosperity deal with the US. That is why we are working with all industries and sectors likely to be impacted.“Our decision will always be guided by our national interests, and that’s why we have prepared for all eventualities, and we will rule nothing out.”He added: “It is important at moments like this that we don’t have kneejerk reactions, that we are cool-headed about this.”However, Rachel Reeves revealed the UK was in talks with trading partners about how to respond, and had spoken to the European trade commissioner, Valdis Dombrovskis, about the EU’s plans to retaliate with their own tariffs.The chancellor insisted the UK would not jeopardise the possibility of its own economic deal with the US by “posturing” in response to tariffs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prize on offer is a good economic agreement between us and the United States. We are not going to do anything to put that in jeopardy,” she told the Treasury select committee.But she warned that the UK would not be “out of the woods” even if it secured a deal, as the main impact on the British economy would be from global tariffs rather than UK-specific ones, thanks to depressed demand and higher inflation in other countries.Business groups and unions reacted with dismay to the announcement. The Institute of Directors’ Emma Rowland said: “The implementation of these ‘liberation day’ tariffs will be a blow to British businesses, eliminating any hopes that the UK would be able to avoid the crosshairs of the global trade war.“The UK government has so far sought to pursue constructive engagement with the US administration and with other trading partners. We are supportive of this pragmatic and level-headed approach.”Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “Donald Trump has just made the strongest possible argument for the UK to positively reset its economic relationship with the EU, our largest market. In the face of punitive and arbitrary tariffs, the government must do everything it can to protect British jobs and industry.”In its economic forecast last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that the most “severe” scenario, in which the UK and other nations retaliated to US tariffs, would result in GDP being 0.6% lower than expected this year and 1% lower next year.An alternative scenario, in which the UK did not retaliate, would mean a smaller reduction in growth, with GDP 0.4% lower than expected this year and 0.6% lower next year.Despite repeated criticism of Canada and Mexico, the US’s two closest trading partners,Donald Trumpdid not announce any “reciprocal tariffs” on the two North American countries.The US dollar was falling sharply against key currencies on Wednesday evening. The dollar had dropped about 0.7% against the pound, at 0.768, shortly after the speech began.Trump confirmed a previously announced 25% tariff on cars imported into the US, set to come into effect early on Thursday, hitting a UK export market to the US worth £6.4bn, which includes luxury car manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin.The US president has already imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and industry bosses have warned that customers were already looking for alternative suppliers and in some cases cancelling orders.The White House’s tariff wars also risk reopening simmering Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland, which has continued to apply EU customs laws since Brexit, meaning splits between London and Brussels over the response to US tariffs could drive a wedge between it and the rest of the UK.EU retaliatory tariffs on US imports would need to be paid by Northern Irish importers, even if Starmer secured a carve-out for the UK or chose not to immediately respond. Businesses can claim back the tax through a reimbursement scheme but trade experts said the issue could reopen old political sores.The EU said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, would set out its response on Thursday morning.The shadow trade secretary, Andrew Griffith, described Trump’s tariff announcement as “disappointing news” but suggested that Brexit had spared the UK from higher import taxes.He said: “The silver lining is that Brexit, which Labour ministers voted against no less than 48 times, means that we face far lower tariffs than the EU: a Brexit dividend that will have protected thousands of British jobs and businesses.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrade policyDonald TrumpInternational tradeKeir StarmerGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is the largest international review of neonatal medicine ever undertaken, the results of which show Lucy Letby’s convictions are no longer safe.”He said the new concerns about the insulin cases shows that Letby’s case “must go back to the court of appeal as a matter of urgency”. “I hope the CCRC will realise this and refer the case without undue delay,” McDonald said.He added: “Lucy Letby is currently serving 15 whole life terms in prison, when overwhelming independent expert evidence indicates that no babies were murdered.”Letby has lost two attempts to challenge her convictions for murdering seven babies and attempting to kill seven others after two trials at Manchester crown court.The CCRC began examining criticism of the prosecution case in February after receiving a summary report from the former nurse’s legal team.Lucy Letby murder convictions: what did the expert panel find?Read moreA spokesperson said at the time it was not possible to determine how long it would take to decide whether to refer the case back to the court of appeal, which it can do if it believes there is a real possibility of convictions being quashed.Given the complexity of the case and the volume of evidence presented at Letby’s two trials – which spanned 11 months in total – the CCRC review could take years to complete.Lawyers representing 12 of Letby’s victimssaid last monththey had “no doubts” about her convictions, accusing her supporters of making “hyperbolic, very serious, publicity grabbing statements” without ample evidence.In aclosing speechto the Thirlwall inquiry, which is examining the deaths, a barrister for seven other victims said the material presented so far was “old and full of analytical flaws”.Cheshire constabulary is investigating Letby on suspicion of harming other babies at the Countess of Chester hospital and Liverpool Women’s hospital between 2012 and 2016.It is separately investigating hospital staff on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter, with a second element looking atpossible corporate manslaughter by the Countess.The force said on Wednesday that much of the criticism of its investigation was “ill-informed and based on a very partial knowledge” and that its inquiry had been “detailed and painstaking”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsLucy LetbyNursingChesterCheshireShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, saidGazawas the deadliest place on Earth for humanitarian workers.“Recent aid worker deaths are a stark reminder. Those responsible must be held accountable,”Lammy said.Ahmad Dhaher, a forensic consultant who examined five of the dead at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis after they had been exhumed, said all of them had died from bullet wounds. “All cases had been shot with multiple bullets, except for one, which could not be determined due to the body being mutilated by animals like dogs, leaving it almost as just a skeleton,” Dhaher told the Guardian.“Preliminary analysis suggests they were executed, not from a distant range, since the locations of the bullet wounds were specific and intentional,” he said. “One observation is that the bullets were aimed at one person’s head, another at their heart, and a third person had been shot with six or seven bullets in the torso.”He emphasised that there was room for uncertainty due to the decomposition of the remains, and that in other cases he reviewed “most of the bullets targeted the joints, such as the shoulder, elbow, ankle, or wrist”.Two witnesses to the recovery of the bodies told the Guardian on Tuesday thatthey had seen bodies the hands and legs of which had been tied, suggesting they had been detained before their deaths. A Red Crescent spokesperson, Nebal Farsakh, said on Wednesday that one of the paramedics “had his hands tied together with his legs to his body”.1:23Bodies of Palestinian rescue workers recovered from mass grave – videoDhaher said there was no clear evidence of restraints on the five bodies he examined. “I could not recognise any tying marks on their hands due to the state of decomposition of the five cases I checked, so I can’t be sure of it,” he said.The Israel Defense Forces and Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have said IDF soldiers opened fire on the ambulances and rescue vehicles because they were “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”. Government officials claimed to have killed a Hamas military operative they named as Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, and “eight other terrorists” from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, in the attack on 23 March.However, Shubaki was not among the bodies recovered from the mass grave outside Rafah on Saturday and Sunday, eight of which were identified as Red Crescent ambulance workers, six as civil defence rescue workers, and one as an employee of the UN relief agency Unrwa. The IDF has not responded to questions about why the dead were buried with their vehicles or to reports that some showed signs of having been tied up.The sole survivor from the shootings on 23 March, Munther Abed, a Red Crescent volunteer, contradicted the official Israeli account, saying the ambulances had been observing safety protocols when they were attacked.“During day and at night, it’s the same: external and internal lights are on. Everything tells you it’s an ambulance that belongs to the Palestinian Red Crescent. All the lights were on until we came under direct fire,” Abed toldThe World at Oneon BBC Radio 4. He denied that anyone from a militant group was in the ambulance.Abed, who was in the first ambulance to come under fire in the early morning of 23 March, said he survived because he threw himself to the floor at the back of the vehicle when the shooting started. The two paramedics in the front seats of the ambulance were killed in the hail of Israeli gunfire. Abed was detained and interrogated by Israeli soldiers before being released.The other 13 victims were all in a five-vehicle convoy dispatched some hours later to recover the bodies of the two dead ambulance workers. All of them were shot dead and buried in the same grave.AGuardian investigation published in Februaryfound that more than 1,000 medical staff had been killed across Gaza from the beginning of the conflict on 7 October 2023 – triggered by a Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 Israelis – until the beginning of a temporary ceasefire in January. Many hospitals have been reduced to ruins in attacks that a UN Human Rights Council commissionconcluded amounted to war crimes.Since ending the two-month ceasefire last month, Israel has vowed to step up its military campaign against Hamas. On Wednesday the defence minister, Israel Katz, said that campaign was expanding to “seize extensive territory” in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu said Israel intended to build a new security corridor as it was “dividing up the Strip”.Hospital officials in the occupied Palestinian territory said Israeli strikes overnight and on Wednesday had killed at least 40 people, nearly a dozen of them children.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelGazaBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The series has been credited for invigorating public debate about the links betweendigital media targeting boys and misogyny.Phillipson, addressing the first festival of children organised by the children’s commissioner forEngland, will say: “With toxic online influences on the rise, our boys need strong, positive male role models to look up to. At home, of course, and at school too.“Schools can’t solve these problems alone, and responsibility starts at home with parents. But only one in four of the teachers in our schools are men. Just one in seven in nursery and primary. One in 33 in early years [education].“And since 2010 the number of teachers in our schools has increased by 28,000 – but just 533 of those are men. That’s extraordinary. So I want more male teachers – teaching, guiding, leading the boys in their classrooms.”Phillipson is the latest education secretary to be concerned by the lack of men training to become teachers in England, especially in primary schools, where theproportion of men has barely improveddespite recent recruitment drives.But research into theimpact of male teacherson boys and young men is mixed: few researchers have found any significant improvements in boys’ attainment or behaviour from having male teachers.Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, will call for adults to be more receptive to children, warning that many boys and girls are feeling disconnected from society and instead seeking answers online.“Children want to be listened to. They want to be heard. They want to work hard and do not expect things to come without effort. They understand that they have a part to play in shaping society,” De Souza will say, according to remarks circulated by her office.Social media platforms must be ‘brought to heel’, says UK schools leaderRead more“But some of these foundations of childhood are cracking. A different version of childhood is playing out – one that we are struggling to be honest about. A crisis developing in childhood.”There is a risk of inaction, of apathy – and the antidote to this is listening, connecting. That is why we must listen to children, to engage them.“We need to be willing to accept failures of the past and do better. That means not just papering over those cracking foundations, but fixing them for childhoods being lived right now – and for the ones to come.“If we want children to experience the vivid technicolour of life, the joy of childhood, the innocence of youth, we have to prove that we will respond more quickly to them than ChatGPT.”De Souza plans to investigate the use of mobile phones in schools, using data gathered from a national survey she has launched, and to examine children’s trust in the police, and the impact on children of deepfake technology that uses AI-generated images or audio to replicate faces and voices.Explore more on these topicsTeachingTeacher shortagesBridget PhillipsonChildrenSchoolsAdolescencePupil behaviourShareReuse this content"

Another said they were seeing more people “with poor nutritional status due to poverty”, eventually leading to “prolonged and impaired recovery from acute illnesses”.Scabies is a highly contagious condition caused by mites, resulting in an itchy rash. It is spread through close skin contact and should be treated quickly to stop it spreading.Several patients had contracted hypothermia. One doctor said it was due to the patient not being able to afford heating at home.The Royal College of Physicians has called on the government to set out how its health mission will address these illnesses.Dr Ash Bassi, a consultant gastroenterologist based in Prescot, Merseyside, said doctors have been seeing patients whose health conditions “are worsened by damp and cold housing, where respiratory illnesses become chronic conditions”.Bassi added: “We see the impact of food insecurity, where poor nutrition contributes to long-term health complications. Poor uptake of screening programmes further exacerbates health inequalities. Patients struggling with unstable employment or financial hardship often delay seeking medical help, leading to more severe illness by the time they reach us.”Dr John Dean, the clinical vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: “The UK government came into office promising bold action on the things that make us ill in the first place. Now it must set out the detail of its health mission and how the mission delivery board will tackle the root causes of ill-health such as poor housing, employment, tobacco, obesity and air quality.“With over 2.5 million more people in England projected to be living with a major illness by 2040, there is no time to waste. We need assurances that improving health and tackling health inequalities remain a priority.“Everything from the places we live to the food we eat affects our health. Government must use its health mission delivery board to deliver a cross-government strategy to reduce health inequalities and address the social determinants of health.”A spokesperson for the Department ofHealthand Social Care said: “Through our plan for change, this government will tackle head on the appalling healthcare inequalities that exist within our systems.“One of our core priorities is to halve the gap in healthy life expectancy between the richest and poorest regions in England.“Our fundamental shift from sickness to prevention will play a vital role in tackling inequalities, making people healthier and reducing pressure on the NHS.”Explore more on these topicsHealthDoctorsInfectious diseasesMedical researchMicrobiologyInequalityPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

The customary Merseyside derby controversy.Of more importance toLiverpoolon this emotional occasion were the cold, hard facts of victory. It leaves Slot’s team needing a maximum of 13 points from the remaining eight games to have the Premier League trophy on display at Anfield once again, and to seal a record-equalling 20th league championship. Their performance against an obstinate and dangerous Everton side was hardly enthralling but underpinned by an impressive determination to recover from a painful Champions League exit and deserved Carabao Cup final defeat before the international break.A fixture that finished with a multitude of flashpoints last time around soon offered up another. Tarkowski was fortunate in the extreme not to be sent off and leave his team in a serious hole at Anfield with the contest in its infancy. Jota had just created Liverpool’s first opening, spinning away from Tarkowski and having a shot blocked by Jarrad Branthwaite. The loose ball spun between the Everton captain and Alexis Mac Allister. Tarkowski got there first but, having cleared out the ball, he followed through to catch the Liverpool midfielder with a dangerously high foot.The referee, Sam Barrott, showed a yellow card to the central defender for a reckless foul. The video assistant referee – Jürgen Klopp’s old friend Paul Tierney – surprisingly went with the referee’s initial call. Slot could only shake his head in disbelief on the sidelines while Mac Allister made a point of showing Barrott the stud marks in his shin. Mac Allister and Tarkowski appeared to bury the hatchet after the final whistle.For all their dominance of the ball and composure, Liverpool created few clear-cut openings before the interval. Mohamed Salah had the best, from a Díaz cross to the back post, but placed a header straight at Jordan Pickford. The visitors fashioned the better first-half openings against a Liverpool central defence that was unusually vulnerable to quick, direct balls in behind.View image in fullscreenJames Tarkowski flies into a challenge on Alexis Mac Allister, but escapes with a yellow card.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesBeto proved a tireless thorn in the side of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté. Everton’s lone centre forward had the ball in the Liverpool net when Van Dijk failed to deal with Tarkowski’s searching pass out of defence. Beto raced through to convert between the legs of Caoimhín Kelleher but was just offside. Kelleher again started in goal for Liverpool as Alisson was absent because of concussion protocols, having sustained a head injury while on international duty with Brazil.Beto found himself clean through on goal for a second time when Van Dijk swiped at an Abdoulaye Doucouré pass and missed his attempted clearance. This time the striker was onside but, having beaten the advancing Kelleher, his powerful finish struck the base of a post and cannoned clear. It was a huge let‑off for Liverpool, as was the final action of the first half when James Garner’s free-kick picked out the unmarked Carlos Alcaraz in front of Kelleher’s goal. The on-loan midfielder miscued his header badly wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool started the second half with renewed intent and aggression. Ryan Gravenberch began to exert more influence in central midfield and the pressure was mounting, the Kop expectant, before Jota finally produced an end product. Díaz was clearly offside when Gravenberch attempted to dissect the Everton defence. Crucially, according to the letter of a law that Slot professed to hate, the winger made no clear attempt to play the ball. Tarkowski was not to know that and made a weak interception. Díaz, back in an onside position, teed up Jota with a cute back-heel. The Portugal international swept past Idrissa Gueye into the box and away from Tarkowski before completing his run with a characteristically cool, measured shot beyond Pickford.Everton’s appeals for an offside against Díaz in the build-up were in vain. Their attempts to turn the tide of the derby or at least challenge Liverpool’s authority proved similarly fruitless.Moyes made five late changes in an attempt to salvage a point but Liverpool held firm and could have extended their lead through Díaz. Darwin Núñez, a replacement for Jota, was fouled inside the Everton area by Pickford in the closing minutes but play had already been halted for a foul by Tim Iroegbunam on Dominik Szoboszlai. That, however, was the only late pain that Everton inflicted in this derby.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Because of the type of radios used, it is apparently not easy to identify who broadcast it.A source working at Manston said: “It was about three in the afternoon when someone blasted [the offensive message] over the radios … I’ve never known a message like that go out on our radios before.”Home Office sources confirmed that as a result of the reported incident, a planned upgrade of the contractor radios at Manston was being expedited. The new radios will allow messages to be traceable.It is not known how many newly arrived asylum seekers heard the message. Many of those arriving at Manston after crossing the Channel in small boats are suffering from problems including petrol burns and hypothermia. Many have lived through traumatic experiences, such as torture and trafficking in their home countries or during their journey.While asylum seekers arriving at Manston have had a range of experiences, many from countries such as Sudan and Eritrea have had particularly long and difficult journeys, often passing through Libya where persecution of refugees is widespread.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We completely condemn the use of this language and behaviour. We expect Mitie, our contractor, to investigate this claim quickly.”A Mitie spokesperson said: “This language is unacceptable and we expect the highest standards from anyone working on site. As soon as we were made aware of the allegations, we took immediate steps to investigate. A new closed-net radio system has been agreed with the Home Office.”Manston has been the subject of criticism from watchdogs including HM Inspectorate of Prisons, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration and theEuropean Committee for the Prevention of Torture. In 2022 it became dangerously overcrowded, with outbreaks of diphtheria and scabies and claims of assaults by guards.Anindependent inquiryinto a catalogue of failings at Manston in 2022 began last month. The format of the inquiry is still to be finalised.It is not the first time Mitie contractors have been accused of racism. In 2021 anemployment tribunalsaid it was “deeply concerned” about Mitie contractors who deport people on behalf of the Home Office having used the racist term “cotton pickers” to describe their black colleagues, but it dismissed a claim of race and disability discrimination.In 2022Mitie admittedit had received complaints two years previously about racist comments from some staff in a WhatsApp group, but failed to “escalate them”. Mitie is one of the government’s largest contractors.Louise Calvey, the director of the charity Asylum Matters, said: “This is a horrifying report. The people in Manston have newly arrived into our country to ask for our help. This is by no means the first report of these sorts of rights abuses at the hands of companies which make huge profits from our asylum system. We urge government to address the practices of their contractors and to rebuild an asylum system that places dignity, respect and human rights at its heart.”Maddie Harris, the director ofHumans For Rights Network, which provides support for asylum seekers released from Manston, said: “People disclose to us that they have been subject to extreme physical violence, witnessed death and violent incidents, been forced to work or held in detention facilities and prisons, deprived of their liberty and endured acute psychological abuse. People arriving in the UK to seek sanctuary should be protected from further harm, treated with dignity and respect and provided with support in order to recover.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeKentManston asylum centreMitieEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

If this truly is a causal effect, we have a finding that’s of tremendous importance.”The researchers took advantage of a vaccination rollout that took place inWalesmore than a decade ago. Public health policy dictated that from 1 September 2013, people born on or after 2 September 1933 became eligible for the Zostavax shot, while those who were older missed out.The policy created a natural experiment where the older population was sharply divided into two groups depending on their access to the vaccine. This allowed the researchers to compare dementia rates in older people born weeks apart but on either side of the vaccine eligibility divide.After accounting for the fact that not all those eligible for the vaccine received it, the researchers found vaccination led to a 20% reduction in dementia risk, with the strongest effect in women. Anupam Jena, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School, said the implications were profound.Dementia affects more than 55 million people globally and is the leading cause of death in the UK. One in three will develop the condition in their lifetime, and while drugs that slow the disease have recently been approved, there is no cure.When people contract chickenpox the virus remains dormant in their nerve cells for life. But the virus can reactivate and cause shingles in older people whose immune systems are waning, or in individuals with weakened immunity.The latest work,published in Nature, is not the first hint that shingles vaccines might shield against dementia. When Zostavax was rolled out in the US in 2006, several studies found lower rates of dementia in people who received the shots. Last year,Oxford researchers reported an even stronger protective effectin people who received Shingrix, a newer vaccine. Geldsetzer is now looking for philanthropic and private foundations to fund a randomised clinical trial to confirm any benefits.It is unclear how shingles vaccines might protect against dementia, but one theory is that they reduce inflammation in the nervous system by preventing reactivation of the virus. Another theory is that the vaccines induce broader changes in the immune system that are protective. These wider effects are seen more often in women, potentially explaining the sex differences in the study.In an accompanying article, Jena wrote: “Although it is still unclear precisely how herpes zoster vaccination lowers the risk of dementia, the implications of the study are profound. The vaccine could represent a cost-effective intervention that has public-health benefits strongly exceeding its intended purpose.”Julia Dudley, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said the study strengthened the emerging link between shingles vaccination and reduced dementia risk. “While previous studies suggested an association, this research offers stronger evidence of a direct link, with greater benefit observed in women.“It’s unclear exactly how the shingles vaccine might influence dementia risk. It may reduce inflammation, support the immune system in ways that protect the brain or involve other mechanisms. It’s important to note that this study looked at the Zostavax vaccine rather than Shingrix, which is now more commonly used.“Understanding this link better, including the reason for any differences between men and women, could open new avenues for dementia prevention and treatment,” she said.Maxime Taquet, whose Oxford study found a reduced dementia risk after Shingrix vaccination, said adjuvants in that vaccine, which make the immune response more potent, may play a role. Both studies “provide strong support for the hypothesis that shingles vaccination reduces dementia risk, with the newer recombinant vaccine offering superior protection,” he said. “A key question is whether this enhanced protection is due to improved shingles prevention or the adjuvant’s immunological effects.”Explore more on these topicsDementiaHealthMedical researchWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It included “ADF support” of £1,119,975.The organisation held discussions with a delegation from the US state department, which visited the UK last month before the release of a statement in which the US voiced concern about “freedom of expression in the UK”.ADF UK, which describes itself as an advocate for “the right of Christians and others to freely associate and share their faith in public”, has been heavily involved in lobbying against the introduction of buffer zones around reproductive health clinics.Its cases have included that of Adam Smith-Connor, who wascited by the US vice-president, JD Vance, as an example of free speech being under threat in Europe, after Smith-Connor was prosecuted for breaching a public space protection order.Tossici-Bolt, ADF UK’s latest high-profile case, was mentioned in the US state department statement on Sunday.A verdict on her alleged breach is expected on Friday. She denies the charges.View image in fullscreenLivia Tossici-Bolt pictured outside parliament.Photograph: ADF International/PAADF, which is designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in the US, has close links with Donald Trump’s White House after endorsing his election campaign and has spoken of working with his administration on areas including the reversal of trans rights.The current speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, is a former ADF lawyer.Filings show that the organisation’s British wing has a staff of nine, one earning a salary of £100,000 a year and two others paid between £90,000 and £100,000.The same records give an overview of ADF UK activities in Britain, which range from briefing MPs to supporting campaigns against the assisted dying bill, and “free speech” cases.The organisation is planning a big event in September in Britain as part of a plan to train law and public policy students.ADF UK has five directors. Two, including the lawyers Robert Clarke and Paul Coleman, are based in the organisation’s international branch headquarters in Austria.UK reproductive healthcare providers have voiced concern about ADF’s role and cited the reversal of abortion rights in the US and pressure exerted by rightwing campaigners.Louise McCudden, the UK head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, said: “Before safe access zones were implemented last year, the behaviour we saw outside our clinics included spitting, calling women ‘murderers’ and physically blocking people from entering our clinics.“In the US, abortion clinics have been bombed and burned down, and anti-abortion campaigners have been known to gather outside clinics with guns. Doctors have been assassinated.”Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: “It is deeply concerning that US anti-abortion extremists are using their significant financial resources to attempt to influence women’s access to safe, legal reproductive healthcare here in the UK.“Following the overturning of Roe v Wade and the re-election of Trump as president, the anti-choice movement in this country have become emboldened in their continued attempt to strip women of their rights, dignity, and future.”An ADF spokesperson said it was a registered human rights charity in the UK and was grateful to the US for bringing attention to what it described as the “free speech crisis” in Britain.“We advance the right to live and speak the truth for all people and are proud to support Livia’s case and the cases of our other clients who have been victims of ‘buffer zone’ censorship,” they said.ADF was named in a Facebook post by the US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), an office in the US state department, as being among organisations its delegation met while in the UK.It also met officials from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Ofcom, using its talks with Britain’s communications regulator tochallenge it on the impact of new online safety lawson freedom of expression.The freedom of expression statement was issued after the delegation met Tossici-Bolt and ADF UK.Among the group was Samuel D Samson, who previously worked for US conservative organisations and was pictured wearing a Make America Great Again cap. He was appointed as a senior adviser at the DRL in January. On the day of Trump’s US election, he tweeted: “Today we choose God over pagan idols.”The DRL’s interest in Britain marks a pivot by an agency set up in the 1970s to advance democracy around the world against the backdrop of the cold war.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It means one in six people have taken out a membership.Younger adults are the key demographic behind the boom, according to the report’s authors, UKActive, the trade body that represents most of Britain’s fitness operators.The growth is particularly evident among generation Z – people born between 1997 and 2012, who are between 13 and 28 – who already have a reputation as the healthiest generation ever.“[This] is a significant moment as it shows that more people are making a conscious decision to get active in order to improve their physical and often also their mental health,” said Huw Edwards, UKActive’s chief executive.“We are witnessing strong demand among all age groups and increasing popularity among gen Z, with health and fitness clubs experiencing growing demand for services such as group exercise, strength training and cardio workouts.“Young people are seeing health and fitness as part of their identity and a non-negotiable when it comes to their personal priorities. Many of them are telling us they prefer going to the gym rather than more traditional venues for socialising such as the pub.“With the right support, this could become the most health-aware generation ever.”The findings tally with previous reports by Sport England and its “moving communities” research into physical activity that growing numbers of teenagers are taking part in fitness activities.A “generational shift” in gym visiting has been taking place in recent years, states the report, which is UKActive’s first in-depth analysis of membership of health and fitness clubs across the UK.“Younger generations are demonstrating higher levels of physical activity and gym membership, indicating a shift in societal priorities towards health and wellbeing, and suggesting that for younger people, gym membership is essential.”Older people are the most likely to avoid joining up because they believe they do not need to, “indicating that the positive shift in mindset towards fitness is more prevalent among younger age groups”, the report adds.The findings appear to embellish gen Z’s reputation as having healthier habits and lifestyles than previous generations.David Minton, the founder of Leisure Database, a specialist fitness market analysis firm, said: “The younger generation are also the healthier generation because they are drinking less alcohol than their predecessors and are much more conscious about what they eat, as evidenced by the increase in veganism, low-sugar diets and consumption of sourdough breads.”But young people may be going for reasons not connected to their health, Minton suggested. “Gen Z are also going to the gym in order to meet a romantic partner and to increase their network of friends because, while they spend a lot of time on social media, the gym offers an in-person experience rather than a virtual experience.“For them, gym-going is all about the social element. It’s not about losing weight, because most of them don’t need to.”The value of the UK health and fitness market grew to £5.7bn by last year, while the number of clubs stood at 5,607, which between them saw 616m visits.An increase in lower-cost gyms and those offering access on a pay-as-you-go basis has also helped to increase participation, the report says.When gym members were asked what motivated them to join, 83% cited improving their physical strength and fitness and 76% said boosting their mental wellbeing, including tackling anxiety and depression. But 75% wanted to improve their confidence and appearance, and 68% to sleep better.The proportion of people in the UK who belong to a gym has risen to 16.9%, one of the highest figures in Europe.Explore more on these topicsHealthFitnessYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

A global trade warDavid Smithin WashingtonWed 2 Apr 2025 19.35 EDTFirst published on Wed 2 Apr 2025 19.29 EDTShareIt was Jeopardy!, or The Price Is Right, come to Washington.On an unseasonably chilly day in the White House Rose Garden,Donald Trumpstood with a giant chart listing which reciprocal tariffs he would impose on China, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other hapless contestants.The winner?Trump, of course, the maestro of fake populism, watched by a crowd that included men in hard hats and fluorescent construction worker vests.The losers?Everybody else.Sensing a bad headline, Trump hadn’t wanted his “liberation day” to coincide with April Fools’ Day, so he waited until 2 April to enter his fool’s paradise. It turned out to be liberation for his decades-old grievances about the US getting ripped off as Trump stuck two fingers up at the world.“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far – both friend and foe alike,” the president said against a backdrop of nine giant US flags on the White House colonnade. “Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.”He nodded to American steelworkers, car-workers, farmers and craftspeople in the audience. These blue-collar workers have been central to Trump’s political rise. Their industrial towns in the midwest and elsewhere were hollowed out by the trade policies of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, which sent thousands of jobs abroad where labour was cheaper.Trump couldn’t quite bring himself to say that “liberation day” represents a final repudiation of Reagan, still a god in Republican circles. But he did drive a stake through the heart of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, describing it as “the worst trade deal ever made”.In 2016’s great revolt against globalization, the forgotten workers could have voted for the leftwing populism of Bernie Sanders, but he lost the Democratic party nomination to Hillary Clinton.Instead, enough went for Trump to make him president, believing his promises that he alone could fix it, end American carnage and get the factories throbbing again. As it turned out, he delivered a $1.5tn bill that slashed taxes for corporations and the wealthy.Many workers duly switched back to the Democrats, with Joe Biden in 2020. He did pour money into manufacturing – for example, with the Chips and Science Act, a bipartisan bill investing $52bn to revitalize the semiconductor industry.Yet in 2024 the pendulum swung again.Somehow a Manhattan billionaire with a criminal record again persuaded blue-collar workers that he was on their side. He claimed he could wave tariffs (taxes on foreign imports), which he has described as the most beautiful word in the English language, like a magic wand.In reality, experts say, it will result in higher prices and slower growth. The Ontario premier Doug Ford called this not liberation day but termination day because of all the jobs that will be lost. Trump playing with tariffs is like a child playing with matches.As he prepared to sign an executive order imposing reciprocal tariffs on about 60 countries, he mused that it was payback time: “Reciprocal: that means they do it to us and we do it to them. Very simple. Can’t get any simpler than that. This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our declaration of economic independence.”It was a strange message to hear from the leader of the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world as he slapped tariffs on the likes of Ethiopia, Haiti and Lesotho.“For years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now it’s our turn to prosper … Today we’re standing up for the American worker and we are finally putting America first,” he said.View image in fullscreenTrump in the White House Rose Garden.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersEven then, Trump claimed he was being kind by not going “full reciprocal”. He summoned his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, to bring the chart to the podium and, as if it were a gameshow, began running through the scores on the doors:“China, first row. China, 67%. That’s tariffs charged to the USA, including currency manipulation and trade barriers. So 67%, so we’re going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34%. I think in other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody be upset?“European Union, they’re very tough – very, very tough traders. You know, you think of the European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It’s so sad to say, it’s so pathetic. Thirty-nine percent. We’re going to charge them 20%, so we’re charging them essentially half.“Vietnam: great negotiators, great people, they like me. I like them. The problem is they charge us 90%. We’re going to charge them 46% tariff.”And so on to Taiwan, Japan (“very, very tough, great people”), Switzerland, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia: “United Kingdom, 10%, and we’ll go 10%, so we’ll do the same thing.”Once he’d gone through the figures, Trump rambled, as he tends to do, as if at a campaign rally: “The price of eggs dropped now 59%, and they’re going down more, and the availability is fantastic. They were saying that for Easter, please don’t use eggs. Could you use plastic eggs? I said, we don’t want to do that.”And: “It’s such an old-fashioned term but a beautiful term: groceries. It sort of says a bag with different things in it. Groceries went through the roof and I campaigned on that. I talked about the word ‘groceries’ for a lot, and energy costs now are down. Groceries are down.”In other words, everything is going great despiteSignalgate, despitedisappointing election results on Tuesday, despite afalling stock marketand sapping consumer confidence. Now, a global trade war, too. The US is about to discover the one thing more dangerous than a politician who believes in nothing is a politician who believes in something stupid.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsThe US politics sketchDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS economyEconomicsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t know it will happen, but I hope,” she said. “It means that a woman is powerful, that if she wants to do something, she can.”Yet for the moment, she has no way to attend medical school anywhere. She can barely step outside the apartment in Islamabad where she and her two sisters, her teenage brother, and their mother spend each day terrified that police will arrest anddeport themback to faceTalibanrule.Simply as a woman in the Taliban’sAfghanistanher lifestyle would be severely restricted, but as Christians the whole family would literally be in mortal danger.‘It means death’: Afghan women’s rights activists face deportation from PakistanRead moreHer family has documents from the United Nations Refugee Agency proving that they’re certified asylum seekers, and they were on the verge of getting the green light to come to the US.But to theTrump administrationright now, these plans don’t matter – despite volunteer groups in Texas preparing for months to welcome them.To the police inPakistan, where they are in exile, those UN documents don’t matter either. What matters is that the family is Afghan and is no longer wanted there.“Everywhere is policed. Every day, police come to our house. It’s too difficult for us,” said the woman in an interview over Zoom. The Guardian is withholding the family’s identity while they remain at risk.“In these days, we awake with a fear,” she said of her family. They have already been lying low in Pakistan for three years after fleeing Afghanistan.View image in fullscreenA residential area in Islamabad, Pakistan, on 29 September 2024.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA few months ago, it seemed as though the family was finally on the cusp of relief, soon to fly to eastTexas.“They were nearing the finish line. We didn’t have any certainty, they hadn’t actually been approved and travel wasn’t being scheduled yet. But we were right there – everything, all the screening, was done,” said Justin Reese, one member of a group of Texas volunteers who were getting ready to welcome the family.Then, on the first day of Donald Trump’s second term as president, one of his many immigration-related executive ordersindefinitely suspendedthe US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) – and with it, the family’s chance at reaching imminent safety.“By every metric, they have played by the rules and they are being treated like this,” said Reese. “It’s very damaging to them individually, and it’s damaging, I think, to the future security of the US, for us to be seen as this mercurial, as this incoherent.”A federal district judgetemporarily blockedTrump’s effective ban on refugees coming to the US, offering those on the brink of resettlement a flicker of hope, but a circuit panel has now rolled back that decision, saying only people already approved must be allowed to come. And whether an administration ideologically opposed to refugee resettlement will resume the program at scale – or in anymeaningful way– remains an open question, particularly after the state department has tried toterminateessential funding agreements with all of the US’s resettlement agencies for the entire fiscal year. That was even beforethe prospectof new Trump travel restrictions on Afghans entering the US,and before immigration officialssuddenlypaused green card processing for refugees already here.“I don’t know how you get to a place of suspending refugee resettlement as policy without a series of ideological turns that I don’t understand how to unwind,” Reese said.Before the ascent of Trumpism, USRAP enjoyed widespread bipartisan support for myriad reasons: its protection of American allies and related benefits to national security; its solidarity with “frontline states” such as Turkey and Colombia that are taking in so many of the world’s displaced people; its signal to other nations that the US cares about human rights.In fact, even before the refugee resettlement program was written into US law, organizations cropped up across the nation in response to the atrocities of the second world war – and the US’srolein rejecting refugees early on who then became victims of the Holocaust. These agencies welcomed displaced people from around the world, many fleeing communism from the Baltic states, Hungary or Vietnam.After Congress established a more universal, standardized refugee framework, general support for resettlement continued, even following the 11 September 2001 attacks that reshaped much of theUS immigrationsystem. Sometimes, scandals would arise within the program, but administrations would address them and move on.Then, in 2015, Trump ran for president and soon started trumpetinga narrativethat refugees posed a security threat to American communities, despite them being some of the most thoroughly vetted newcomers in the country.“There [was] already a kind of deteriorating bipartisan support,” Yael Schacher, director for the Americas and Europe atRefugeesInternational, the humanitarian organization, recalled of that moment.By fiscal year 2020, the first Trump administration had gutted the US’s refugee resettlement infrastructure and set the annual ceiling on refugee admissions at 18,000 – thelowestcap on record.When Joe Biden took office, his administration eventually rebuilt resettlement capacity in the US,with more than100,000 people welcomed in his last full fiscal year in office.To do so, Biden made innovations, such as an initiative called the Welcome Corps, which invited Americans and green card holders to form private groups and financially sponsor refugees for resettlement in the US.“I think the idea of the Welcome Corps was that it was politically foolproof,” said Schacher, and that “because it relied on private funds and private individuals to step up … that these folks would push back against the Trump administration and make sure that folks still come. And they would step in if government funding was withdrawn. I think it remains to be seen if that’s actually going to work politically.”Reese and his family knew that they wanted to participate in the Welcome Corps. A software developer by trade, he had spent the better part of a decade learning about the politics and policy of offering refuge.Just before the coronavirus pandemic gripped the US, he traveled to Greece to serve in a refugee camp with 20,000 residents representing 40 different nationalities. The corner of camp where he volunteered hosted mostly Afghans, and he returned home to east Texas with new friendships and phone numbers from within that community.So when Kabulfell to the Talibanand the USwithdrew troopsfrom Afghanistanin 2021, his phone started buzzing with alerts from worried Afghans whose loved ones were still stranded in danger. He sprang into action, attempting to cut through red tape to try to get desperate families in Afghanistan on US evacuation flights. It was frantic and exhausting.View image in fullscreenA Taliban security guard patrols as an Afghan woman waits to receive winter supplies from Unicef in Badakhshan province on 25 February 2024.Photograph: Wakil Kohsar/AFP/Getty Images“Everything felt like an inch away and then a mile away at the same time, because you just knew if you just were smart enough or well-resourced enough, then you could make this happen,” he remembered.Simultaneously, the Afghan family of five he would eventually try to resettle through the Welcome Corps was fleeing Afghanistan for Pakistan. The Taliban’s return to power was the final straw that dashed any hope they had for stability in their homeland, though it was hardly their first brush with persecution.As members of the Hazara ethnic community, their people had long been victims of massacres and genocides,including by the Talibanat the turn of the 21st century. Having converted from Shia Islam to Christianity, the family had been targeted by their neighbors, beaten and forced to move many times. And as a household in which the patriarch died about a decade ago, the women had been subject to constant unwanted attention and harassment from unscrupulous men.“We miss, a lot, our country,” one of the daughters said. “We miss our memories that we had. But unfortunately we can’t go back because I have lots of bad memories from Taliban … situations, and it makes me sad.” As she described the family’s experience, she wept.Her family met Reese in person when they were all in Islamabad in late 2023. Until then, they had been names on a list for Reese, names he was still trying to help find refuge. After getting to know the family face to face, he wanted to bring them to his own community, where he thought their life experiences would resonate with people.He found willing volunteers back in east Texas. With 10 members, Reese’s Welcome Corps group is far larger than required and includes a veteran who served in Afghanistan, a missionary’s kid who grew up in Afghanistan and Pakistan, a couple whose children work with Afghans abroad, and others uniquely equipped to help.Offers of housing and other support flowed in.And Reese’s commitment to sponsor the Afghan family made a huge difference in their lives, even as they remained in a precarious situation abroad. They suddenly felt as though they were waiting in Pakistan for a reason, and they stopped worrying as much about their future while imagining safety together in the US.“It made my family so happy,” one of the daughters said. In Texas, she hoped, “we can continue our studies and we can continue our lives without any worries”.Now Reese’s garage is full of donated household items from an online wishlist to outfit what would have been the family’s new home in Tyler, Texas.It’s unclear when or if the family will ever arrive – news Reese had to deliver personally.“I have a hard time talking about how it made us feel without being angry because I do feel that it’s not just unnecessary and harmful, but strategically incompetent,” he said. “I don’t believe that anybody involved in turning [USRAP] off had to deliver phone calls like the ones that we had to over the last few weeks.”Despite the setback and theincreasingly serious threatsof deportation the family faces in Islamabad, one of the daughters expressed gratitude for “brother Justin”, as she calls Reese, and appreciates at least hearing an update on their case.Trump’s actions have made her “sad, but I hope”, she said, adding: “I have hope in my heart that this program will open again.”"

People will start shaking their heads and reckon that Labour have something to answer for. But we’re not quite there yet. At least not at prime minister’s questions. For half an hour in the Commons every Wednesday theConservativesremain the villains of the piece.Partly it’s the size of the Labour majority. The sheer volume of half-witted Labour MPs who are happy to bounce up and down to askKeir Starmerwhether he agrees with them that the Tories left the country in a shocking mess and only the prime minister can save their constituents. The Lib Dems and the SNP are only slightly fiercer critics of the present government. They too hate the Tories more than anyone else.But maybe it’s also something to do withKemi Badenoch. You get the feeling that even she reckons the Tories have been a waste of space for the past 10 years. She doesn’t go as far as rubbishing her predecessors in public – she is under orders from her advisers in CCHQ to make as few enemies as possible – but you can sense the contempt. Her heart simply isn’t in the job. She’s wondering why she ever bothered.So Kemi does little more than go through the motions. A scattergun approach of “Labour’s job tax”, business confidence and low growth. To which every Starmer answer is exactly the same. You broke the economy. And KemiKaze is happy with that. Because she knows it’s true. She suspectsLabourmight not be that competent after all, but knows that even a Nobel prize winner would be struggling with an inheritance like that.She looks at her prepared questions and responses and feels like giving up before she starts. Take that figure of every family being worse off by £3,500 that the economically illiterate Mel Stride was forced to come up with the day before. Kemi is bright enough to know that it’s completely bogus. There isn’t a single person in the country who thinks the figure can survive contact with reality. It hurts her to have to repeat it. And she dies a little inside when she does so.What Kemi would much rather be doing is indulging her latest conspiracy theory, courtesy of Elon Musk, that the writers of the Netflix drama Adolescence based their screenplay on a true story but changed the race of the killer from a black boy. The writers have denied this, but Kemi is convinced she knows otherwise. She knows what they were thinking better than they do. Their minds have been captured by the Gods of Woke. So on brand for Kemi.But her minders had made her stick to their script so anotherPMQspassed off in disappointment for the Tory MPs. Their leader didn’t crash and burn. She never left the starting line. They long for her to give the appearance of defiance, but neither she nor they can summon that level of caring. They are all still suffering from PTSD. So yet another week went by where Starmer came out unscathed with everyone nodding that the Tories are the source of all hopelessness.The same orthodoxy has also crept into the Treasury select committee. Not so long ago, a chancellor would fear an appearance before it. It had a reputation for being the fiercest of the fierce, packed with some of the brightest backbenchers in the Commons. And Chris Philp. The Nose in search of a Bum. There’s always one exception. Fellow members of the committee from that time still want to curl up and die as they remember him asking George Osborne: “So Sir, would you agree with me that this is the best budget ever?”Sadly the current iteration of the Treasury select committee is closer to the Philp mould. Either hopelessly fawning or desperate to prove that they have understood the detail of an Office for Budget Responsibility forecast. Or both. The committee’s chair, Meg Hillier, tried to resurrect the reputation for rigour and independence but she was fighting a lone, futile cause. No wonder Rachel Reeves was smiling when she went in. And was grinning by the time she left about two hours later.In another life, Rachel might have had a tricky time explaining away her spring statement. How did she square away the benefits cuts? What was she planning to do if her fiscal headroom disappeared by the autumn? Or sooner if the tariffsproved even more damaging than expected?But for Reeves, the afternoon was a doddle. A snooze. She could dazzle the crowd by clearly knowing far more than they did. A percentage here, a footnote there. She barely needed the Treasury’s director of strategy as her wingman. William Macfarlane is on a six-figure salary purely for his ability to never say anything that might in some way be helpful or revealing. People have had more fun watching paint dry than listening to Bill.It wasn’t that none of the right questions were asked. It was more that it was so terribly cosy. Mainly new Labour backbenchers desperate not to cause the chancellor offence. “Er … Can I just check that you did consider the impact of cutting the welfare budget?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She wanted everyone to know that no one could possibly have given more consideration to benefits than she had. Would that do? It would.Nor were the two Tories on the committee much better. Harriett Baldwin and John Glen aren’t the dimmest minds around but they are hardly attack dogs. More friendly, cuddly cockapoos. Inclined to believe the best of people. Baldwin was immensely reassured to discover that Rachel would deal with the problem of the fiscal headroom as and when it occurred. No reason to get alarmed in the interim.We did eventually get to tariffs with Glen. Might they just be a wee bit tricky? Rachel had come pre-programmed for this. She didn’t want to see any tariffs. They were bad for the global economy. But if He Who Cannot Be Named – everyone in the cabinet automatically throws up if they utter the words Donald and Trump – were to do so then she would consider her options carefully and pragmatically. In other words, we would roll over and suck it up.Cue drinks all round.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchHouse of CommonsLabourConservativesKeir StarmerKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

Minecraft, even more than most computer games, is what you make of it, an experience generated by the player. So in a way, the idea of making a film set in the Minecraft world is counterintuitive, because it can never replicate what is good about Minecraft, it can only tell you what is good about Minecraft. In addition to that, this comedy-fantasy takes aspects of the Minecraft world and uses them as building blocks in a rollicking adventure suitable for almost all ages, giving Jack Black andJason Momoacarte blanche to wild out and be deeply silly. Your affection for and/or tolerance of this latter prospect will dictate to a large extent your enjoyment of this film.Black plays Steve, a crafter who in the game was the original default player, although that doesn’t especially matter here. Momoa is Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison, a washed-up video game champ with an aesthetic stuck permanently and delightfully in the 1980s: pink leather fringed jacket and luscious locks flowing down past his prodigious shoulders like the first snowmelt off a mountain range. As this is kinda-sorta an ensemble film, we also have Henry (Sebastian Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks) rounding out the good guys squad. It’s not the fault of any of the three latter actors, but it’s hard for them to make an impression alongside Black and Momoa going full-throttle – and it would become an exhausting experience if they tried. That does mean their storylines feel like downtime, a chance to relax and catch your breath, rather than providing the emotional core that the writers presumably intended.Used more sparingly, but also firing on all cylinders is a hilarious – and when is she not? – Jennifer Coolidge, whose teacher character is exactly the kind of breathy over-sharer that Coolidge has made her speciality. She immediately tells Henry, a child in her care, that she stuck it out in a dead marriage for 20 years for the sake of “the dogs”. Coolidge is, quite simply, a genius at this, and can do this stuff in her sleep, without the slightest suggestion of effort.Black is a very different type of performer; you can see effort in every swivel-eyed tic and line delivery, but that’s the whole point: it’s funny (mostly) to see someone commit that wholeheartedly to the bit. It’s a shame the film as a whole doesn’t work quite as well as its standout performances, with a tendency to ping pong along from scrape to scrape with little sense that it would matter much if you rearranged the various monster attacks or obstacles to be overcome in a different order. A little more craft on the storytelling side could have elevated this to something special a laDungeons and Dragons from 2023, but it’s an enjoyable if hectic experience nonetheless.AMinecraftMovie is out on 3 April in Australia and on 4 April in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsJason MomoaJack BlackMinecraftComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Why has he decided to make a musical of seedy, gutter-life classic Midnight Cowboy, a film he can’t bear?Wed 2 Apr 2025 10.44 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 12.24 EDTShareTroop into Eg White’s living room, past the bright, spacious kitchen and the yapping terriers (“Meet the unwelcoming committee!”), then descend into the snug basement studio with its underfloor heating and you will have reached the place where pop bangers are born: hits for Adele (Chasing Pavements),Will Young(Leave Right Now), Duffy (Warwick Avenue) and countless others. The Ivor Novello award-winning songwriter, born Francis White, sits in front of a desk cluttered with screens and consoles and thingamajigs. In T-shirt, jeans and trainers, he looks as lean as the neck of a Stratocaster. When he is in quizzical mode, as he very often is, four deep grooves appear on his forehead like the strings on a bass guitar.White’s newest project is the music for a stage version of Midnight Cowboy, the Oscar-winning 1969 buddy movie with Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman as deluded outsiders adrift in New York, adapted now byBryony Lavery. Most of its 15 songs – from sanguine ballads to Latin-tinged stompers – were composed not here in White’s west London home but on a family holiday to Colombia. For two hours each morning, while his wife and children were still in bed, he wrote on a cheap baritone ukulele, which he plucks off the wall from between rows of guitars to show me. “You can take it in the hand luggage,” he says cheerfully. “If your kid sits on it, which happened a few times, it lives.” Presumably he means the ukulele, not the kid.He finds the film too depressing – but wrote the songs as a favour for his wife’s sister’s husband’s cousin’s builderI had arrived expecting to hear tales of adolescent identification with Voight’s naive gigolo, or Hoffman’s grungy conman, but White turns out to have no affection for the film whatsoever. “Too depressing. Couldn’t bear it.” Many of his compositions for the show temper the dourness that put him off the film. New York Bus, a hymn to the Big Apple that features the line “I hear they’ve got a weakness for a refugee”, suggests Simon & Garfunkel at their antsiest.Listen to Eg White’s Don’t Give Up On Me Now, from Midnight Cowboy.“Interesting,” he says, in a way that suggests he disagrees entirely. “If there’s a smell to the thing, Brown Eyed Girl is where I was heading. The cast did it in rehearsal and I suddenly thought, ‘Christ, if we’re not careful, this is going to turn into Hair!’ So I’m going, ‘No, no – you need to be bad-tempered.’ Think Van Morrison. Think grumpy old cunt.”The commission came to White, somewhat implausibly, via his wife’s sister’s husband’s cousin’s builder, who decided after 50 years in construction that he wanted to produce a musical and ended up with the rights to Midnight Cowboy. Soon, White was sitting by the pool in Cartagena, on Colombia’s Caribbean coast, trying to evoke life in the gutters of late-1960s Manhattan. He arrived home with a suntan and a completed score. It all sounds remarkably … “Easy? We can go with easy. Absolutely free of trauma. Because you have the structure already. You’re moving the story forward.”Writing in character, too. That must be close to impossible when working with a pop star who has a persona to maintain: listeners might get the singer muddled up with the song? “Oh yeah. You’ll write some horrible, ugly character stuff and they’ll go, ‘I can’t sing this. I’m just not that much of a …’”View image in fullscreen‘Touched by God’ … Adele circa Chasing Pavements,  co-written by White.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAOlder musicians like character songs, he says, “whereas I work with young people.”Adelewas 17 when White first wrote with her. “I met her before she was the queen of the world. Before anyone. Her demo was touched by God. You don’t hear that every day: the playfulness, the accuracy, the language.”He plays down his own contribution. “If I’m feeling too full of myself, then I’ve probably stolen from the other person. Ultimately, they’re the one who’ll be sitting on top of the missile. All I know with Adele is it didn’t feel like being in the room with a 17-year-old. I’d try something and she’d say, ‘You might want to reconsider that.’ And she’d be right.” Chasing Pavements came about after White strummed “some very boring chords” while Adele sang over them. “Once she lit the fuse, it got explosive. Then it got good.”What would once have been a four-minute song has to fly in seven seconds on TikTokWhite had his own short-lived ride on the missile in the late 1980s, when he and his brother David were in the boyband Brother Beyond, fronted by heart-throb Nathan Moore. “Brother Beyond was good until it wasn’t,” he says. “Without being rude – no, I have to be rude – Nathan was a brilliant pop star but a terrible singer. Stock, Aitken and Waterman were famously brutal with him. I’d written a song called Here Come the Rockets, which I gave Nathan to sing. It was clear it wasn’t going to work. That’s when I went, ‘I’m out.’”He recorded the song himself in the early 1990s with Alice Temple, as the duo Eg and Alice. Around the same time, he began his producing career with two albums for indie rockers Kinky Machine. He was working so hard he neglected to have a debauched rock’n’roll lifestyle. “I’m old now,” he says. In fact, he is 58, but you take the point. “I write songs about having a spankingly amazing night out that ends in near-death by the side of the M25 at six in the morning. Things I never did and would love to have done. I was too busy making a living to sleep with millions of people.”View image in fullscreenGutter life … rehearsals for the Midnight Cowboy musical.Photograph: Pamela RaithHe grew up in London, the son of classical musicians. “BBC orchestras were being made redundant in the early 1980s. My dad was like, ‘Kids, this is dying. Run for the hills.’” A childhood pianist, violinist, flautist and double bass player, White had always been averse to pop music. But hearing Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now at the age of 11 was life-changing. Is it possible to say what struck him about it?“It’s more than possible,” he says, springing to his feet and cueing up the track. All at once, a cobwebbed anthem is re-invigorated by his running commentary. “The second chord’s unusual … This is a bit of timing fuckery here … Then a flat seven … His melody is great … Oh, statisticallythisnever happens … Double-fast … Wait …Wait… There’s no chorus on this song.” His jaw drops. The bass strings reappear on his forehead. “It’s got no chorus! It’s just three verses one after another!”That sort of commercial perversity is his sweet spot. It’s what he strives for. “You need it, otherwise you die creatively,” he says once the song ends. What’s perverse about Chasing Pavements? “Normally, when you’ve got a good chorus melody, you repeat it. And Adelechangesthe melody. Big fail.” What was his reaction when she did it? “‘Nooo!’” he shrieks, hands outstretched as if he is the passenger in a crashing car. “And the timings are all over the place. It goes three bars, not four. None of it is even slightly geometrical.” He gives a rueful sigh. “I should be doing more of that kind of thing. Less safer work. I could use more bravery.”View image in fullscreen‘It was good until it wasn’t’ … White, crouching in front, in the boyband Brother Beyond in 1989.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyLike his father, he is prone to talk as if he should run for the hills. “There was a five-year period from 2003 where I was writing what people wanted to release: slower songs which take longer to unfold and have more real instruments and aren’t about tightly controlled phrases and beautifully clean productions. There was a brief moment when that shit was flying, and thank God I made some money then. With the financial crash in 2008 came a fear about radio advertising. Tempos go up because you don’t want to lose workplace listenership. The sort of stuff I write is in abeyance now. What was once a four-minute song has to fly as a seven-second clip on TikTok.”I have the sensation of eavesdropping on an argument that has been raging in White’s head since long before I rang his doorbell today. “I think I’m blaming external stuff,” he decides finally. “When in fact I would do well to have more nerve, ‘Where are your guts, boy?’”Homophobic? Maybe. But at least Midnight Cowboy showed me gay men on screen | Ryan GilbeyRead moreAI is nipping at his heels, and it may be this that forces him to take the risks to which he is alluding. “AI is built on human output, and most human output in this area is not perverse. So I’m determined to head to the edges because that will be less vulnerable to attack.”Riding the missile, lighting the fuse, vulnerable to attack: White makes pop music sound like a health and safety nightmare. He makes it sound like war.Midnight Cowboy is atSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, London, from 4 April to 17 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreAdeleWill YoungMusicalsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

You might be fishing for a narcissist.Astudy by behavioral researcherslooked at the corporate speak used in job postings and found that certain turns of phrase are catnip for those with, as a researcher puts it, “a grand view of self”.After noticing how often executives seemed to show narcissistic tendencies – associated with a sense of superiority, an extreme drive “to be admired and succeed” and a willingness to “do what it takes to achieve that” – Jonathan Gay, an assistant professor at the Patterson School of Accountancy at the University of Mississippi, decided to investigate. “We were thinking about it as: what’s the earliest stage in which these people with more narcissistic traits get lined up with these companies?” he says.Typing loudly, wearing AirPods: ‘taskmasking’ is how gen Z pretends to work at the officeRead moreIn the study, Gay and his colleagues Scott Jackson and Nick Seybert divided language used in job ads into two categories: phrases that might attract “rule-followers” and phrases that might appeal to “rule-benders”. Postings seeking an applicant who is “grounded and collaborative”, “thinks methodically” and “communicates in a straightforward and accurate manner” went in the “rule-follower” category. Phrases like “ambitious and self-reliant”, “thinks outside the box” and “communicates in a tactical and persuasive manner” were filed under “rule-bender”.The team then gave study subjects fake job ads with either “rule-bender” or “rule-follower” language, and asked the subjects to evaluate how well-suited they’d be to the fictional roles – both of which were written to be appealing. Separately, the researchers assessed narcissistic traits by asking subjects to choose between statements such as “I always know what I am doing” versus “sometimes I am not sure of what I am doing”, or “people always like my stories” versus “people sometimes like my stories”. (You can probably guess which options raised a red flag.)The researchers found that “rule-bending” language drew in those with higher levels of narcissism, who often fancy themselves persuasive and creative, as Gay recently wrote inthe Conversationof the study, which was published in September in the journal Management Science.The takeaway for companies: use phrases like “results-oriented”, “creative and innovative”, or “flexible and strategic” at your peril. Who wants to work with a narcissist? Beyond the annoyance factor, studies also suggest they may be more likely to engage in unethical or illegal behavior. (Cue biting political joke about current US president.)“Even before a single job seeker has clicked ‘apply’, language contained in a job posting may be too seductive for narcissists to ignore, increasing the chances of attracting unethical applicants to the position,” Seybert, associate professor of accounting at the University of Maryland’s Robert H Smith School of Business, tolduniversity media.On the other hand, as the researchers point out, there are some jobs in which this mindset can be helpful – narcissistic people, they say, can be great at sales. You just might not want them as accountants balancing your books, bending the rules to hit earnings targets. To advertise those jobs, it might be better to seek a person who “relies on time-tested solutions” and has a “concrete and practical mindset”.Indeed, while narcissists are often manipulative, Gay says, they’re not necessarily always “bad people”. “They feel like they should succeed because they feel like they’re more creative and capable than everybody,” he says, but “they’re not always domineering or remorseless”. Those traits are more associated with machiavellianism, which can overlap in a “dark triad” with narcissism and psychopathy.Another caveat: just because you find “rule-bending language” appealing, or consider yourself creative and ambitious, it does not mean you are a narcissist, Gay says. Some who have commented on the study online have worried about this – but the researchers simply found that those with higher scores on narcissistic traits also preferred such language.So what does all this mean for those of us who don’t write job ads? Well, it may offer some insight into why we see narcissists in positions of executive power – as well as some guidance to anyone involved anywhere in the hiring process: if you’re looking for a more down-to-earth type, choose your language carefully.Perhaps it also goes some way to explaining why the “move fast and break things” crowd is so insufferable. Narcissist-friendly language is common “in job postings for more innovative and higher-growth companies”, Seybert wrote.Outside the workplace, it might also have powerful implications for dating profiles: swipe left on anyone who thinks outside the box. Stay away from flexible and strategic types who develop creative and innovative solutions to problems. Grounded and collaborative is the new hot.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleUS work & careersWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Monaka runs a cafe in Tokyo called Monster Party, where people go dressed as characters from a subculture known astanganmen. Her brother is holding a picture of their mum’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 2 Apr 2025 10.09 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTShareMy personal projects have often focused on the topic of identity, so the world of cosplay immediately appealed to me. I knew nothing about it until I saw some photographs on Instagram and became interested in these people who spend their free time turning themselves into characters from manga, anime, movies and video games – or even into creations they’ve come up with by themselves.Italy’s biggest annual cosplay event is held in the region where I live, Tuscany. I started going and taking pictures, just on my phone at first, and that’s where I first approached cosplayers to ask if they’d like to help me with a project I had in mind. In the 1970s, John Olson took someportraits for Life magazineof musicians such as Frank Zappa and Elton John at home with their parents. They contrasted the individual identity of the rock stars and the social identity represented by their parents, and that seemed the right way to photograph cosplayers, too. I thought it was far more interesting to show them in a domestic setting, alongside people in everyday clothes, than in the environment of a fantasy-themed event.If you ask a cosplayer to make a picture, they’re happy. The problem was convincing the parentsIf you ask a cosplayer if you can take a picture, they’re always really happy. The problem is convincing their parents, a lot of whom think the hobby is a waste of time and money. Of the 200 or so cosplayers I’ve approached so far, at least half were unable to participate because their parents said no. But others recognised the passion their children have for this pursuit, and the artistry involved in making the costumes.Initially my plan was to take all the photographs with parents, but as the project went on I sometimes included different family members, depending on the cosplayer’s circumstances. For example, the photograph I took in Livorno, Tuscany, ofManuel posing as Spider-Manin his grandparents’ bedroom: his grandfather sits on the bed beside him while his grandmother uses her exercise bike in the background.C-3POs, Wonder Women and a trio of Alices: the stars of cosplay – in picturesRead moreJapan is the mecca of cosplay. It was born there at comic conventions in the 70s and 80s. That’s where I photographed Monaka, who you see here. The cyclops character she’s dressed as is part of a subculture calledtanganmen, which I think only started five or six years ago. A designer came up with this one-eyed mask which quickly spread in Tokyo, where Monaka runs a cafe called Monster Party. Customers dressed intanganmenmasks gather there – this costume is what she wears to work.The guy next to her is her brother, and the portrait he’s holding is of their mother, who died 12 years ago. I found it on a table in the house while we were setting up and, when I asked about it, Monaka told me her mother was the first person to take her to a cosplay event, when she was 20 years old.Another photograph I took in Tokyo shows Monaka’s close friendPitan in the bedroom of her tiny apartmentwith the three cats she describes as her family – her parents no longer live in the city. Pitan’s costume is a character she invented herself, a sort of doll with the face of a cat.Because the practice has been established for so long in Japan, many of the cosplayers I photographed were in their 30s, 40s and 50s. There were better costume-making materials available in Japan and Europe too, whereas a lot of the outfits I saw when I took the project to Kenya had more of a homemade feel. For example, a young woman called Brenda had created afemale version of the manga character Chainsaw Man, and I much preferred her cardboard chainsaws to the plastic, 3D-printed versions I saw Italian cosplayers wearing.Everyone involved in this series, which I calledThey Don’t Look Like Me, seemed to enjoy the process and it has been very satisfying to see both generations responding positively to the finished pictures. It’s an ongoing project reflecting a global phenomenon – next I want to move on to Latin America.View image in fullscreenNiccolò Rastrelli’s CVBorn:1977, FlorenceTrained:Fondazione Studio Marangoni, FlorenceInfluences:“Many sources, from fashion and documentary photographers to films and books.

Well, we shall see. Yet even if one puts the noise and nastiness that accompany a Donald Trump announcement to one side – in this case tonight’s pronouncement that there will be an executive order announcing “reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world”, a 10% tariff on the UK and 20% on the EU – the significance of the theatre is hard to miss. Whether they presage the US’s liberation, or instead the disintegration of theglobal trading order, Trump’s tariffs add up to an attempt to transform a badly broken economic model. And that is something that affects us all.Trump’s announcement was awash with insult and rambling nonsense. The rest of the world had looted, raped and pillaged, had scavenged and ransacked America – shocking claims if they had come from any other US president, yet water off a duck’s back today. But the hard core was there all the same: tariffs on the whole of the rest of the world. The shutters were up.Thisthreatened trade warwill appear to supporters – of whom there were rather fewer this week in some important USelectoral contests– exactly like the Maga big bazooka he promised in his inaugural speech in January. “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,” he said back then. The new tariffs turn those words into realities.Even to Trump’s opponents, though, the tariffs should be seen as the most important piece of evidence so far that he has American workers on his agenda. Where Joe Biden tried major tax, borrow and spend programmes to combat post-Covid economic precarity, Trump is deploying tariffs, ostensibly to the same purpose. There has been speculation that this will be merely tactical, to be quickly lifted or adjusted. Right now, that looks a long way off. For Trump, tariffs are not so much a negotiating tactic as a policy, a new revenue stream and a “made in the USA” commitment.Before the announcement, markets and foreign governmentswere jittery. But the uncertainties have not disappeared. Listening to Keir Starmer continue to advocate a “calm pragmatic approach” does not disguise the fact that he knows, as we do, that Trump’s approach is the exact reverse. We are in a trade war now, whether we like it or not, and Trump, as the leader of the strongest economy in the world, likes it a lot because he thinks the US will win.Things may not look so benign, however, when the rubber hits the road. It is inevitable that enthusiasm will be dulled – either among the public or in markets – when the inevitable price hikes are passed on to consumers, when inflation and the cost of mortgages begin to rise, when real wages remain flat, or when investment stalls and theUS economystarts to experience a Trump slump.All this, though, is speculation about the future, and a lot of it is for the fairly long-term future at that. It takes time for the real economic effects to be felt from a tariff wall of the kind Trump is planning. It is true that the tariffs have to be charged immediately, and that retaliatory tariffs are likely to kick in fast too. Nevertheless it will be months, if not years, before many US companies or sectors have the confidence and the cash to invest in the way “fortress America” supporters hope. Longer still, maybe, before US car workers or farmers feel truly confident about paying down their debts and spending again.It makes perfect sense, therefore, to emphasise the uncertainties that Trump has just unleashed. All the more so because of the man himself, as well as the policy. It is hard not to feel, yet again, that part of what drove Trump’s decision was the sheer thrill he gets from his power. He glories in the way the world hangs on his every move, as the world must when its largest economy is controlled by a grudge-bearing manchild with guns who governs by decree.Yet step back a little and it is also apparent that Trump is acting more logically than that. He is acting, albeit in a wilful and perverse manner, because the international economic model has been broken. He is responding to something real, namely a global recession that stems most immediately from the combined impact of the banking crisis of 2008-9 and the Covid pandemic of 2020. This was not something fake or imagined. Nor was it – or is it still – something felt in the US alone, but elsewhere, certainly including Europe and Britain.The common root of today’s economic burden was the overload of debt and credit that caused the banking crash of 2008. That crash was principally confronted by spending massive amounts of public money on quantitative easing. But, just as before the crash, this was money based on credit more than on production or goods. This triggered attempts to square the circle – tax cuts in the US, austerity in Britain, pension cuts in France – which in turn provoked so-called populist responses, such as Trump’s election win in 2016, Brexit in the UK, thegilets jaunesin France. But before any of these national responses could resolve, Covid arrived, causing recessions all round, stock-market collapses and a rise in inflation.Faced with these continuing problems, Trump’s response takes the form of tariffs. It is very uncertain whether they will work, even for the US itself. They may also trigger recessions, and the resultant tax and spend policy dilemmas elsewhere, in places such as the EU, Britain, Canada and Japan. In addition, they are likely to widen the gulf between the US and its postwar allies. While Trump talks of liberation, Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, talks of “independence from the USA”.Trump and Musk have ushered in a terrible era of cataclysm capitalism. But I have a plan to counter it | Julia SteinbergerRead moreIn his tariffs, Trump is clutching at straws. He may divert the US’s tariff income into orthodox neoliberal tax cuts for corporations and the rich, like him. But his approach can also be seen as an illustration of the limited strategic options that today’s democratic political leaders have at their command when faced with economic recession or, worse, depression.In arecent articlein the London Review of Books, Perry Anderson has drawn an illuminating historical contrast with the post-depression 1930s. In the early 1930s, he writes, governments also followed economic orthodoxy with disastrous consequences. Back then, their failure forced the public works programmes of the New Deal (and of the Nazis) and then, after emerging from the abyss of war, the postwar establishment of Keynesianism. John Maynard Keynes himself, it is worth noting, was no dogmatic free-trader and was sometimes an advocate of tariffs.In the 2020s, governments face a comparable dilemma. They, too, have been constrained by an economic orthodoxy that is increasingly difficult to sustain. They, too, have occasionally been forced into interventionist measures such as the Covid furlough scheme.But beyond that? Trump is no New Dealer; he is the New Deal’s sworn enemy. At least he sees the need to do things differently. But his tariffs are the opposite to the new paradigm of political economy that the democratic capitalist world so obviously and urgently craves.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You canparade outside a Tesla showroom. You can hold up dumblittle signsduring Trump’s address to Congress inscribed with slogans such as “This is not normal” and “Musk steals”. You can, as Democrats appear to have been doing since the election, play dead.Alternatively, you can go for the ostentatious, performative gesture. On Monday evening, Cory Booker, the Democratic senator for New Jersey who carries himself like someone who’d have been happier in an era when men wore capes, startedspeaking on the floor of the Senateand carried on for 25 hours and five minutes, breaking the chamber’s record by almost 50 minutes and delivering – finally – a solid, usable symbol of rebellion.This wasn’t a filibuster per se; no legislation was being passed. Booker decided to speak for “as long as I am physically able”, he said, in general protest against Trump and in what he described as a “moral moment” – a claim that, when he ended his speech on Tuesday evening, hoarse of voice and teary-eyed, didn’t seem to me an exaggeration.The power of the filibuster is vested in the iron-man stamina required to perform it: in Booker’s case, standing for longer than a direct flight between Washington DC and Sydney, without food, rest or toilet breaks. It puts him in a category of protest that floats somewhere between a sit-in and a hunger strike, a measure of commitment that demands a kind of default respect, as does the technical challenge of filling the airtime. A few hours into his speech, Booker asked a Senate page to remove his chair and with it the temptation to sit down. Democratic senators were permitted to ask him questions or make short remarks to give him brief respite from speaking. Mostly, however, it was on Booker to keep talking and talking, which he did – it should be noted, quite easily – by enumerating all the terrible things Trump has done in his first three months in office.View image in fullscreenA supporter outside the US Capitol holds up a sign in support of Cory Booker after his speech.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty ImagesThere was something immensely satisfying – cathartic, even – in watching Booker protest against Trump via a form of dissent that, while radical and pushed to its absolute limit, still fell within congressional norms. Part of the fallout from Trump and his cohorts’ behaviour has been the shocking realisation that you can ditch standards and protocols, ignore judges and bin entire social and scientific programmes created by Congress, and, at least in the immediate term, nothing will happen. (In the medium to long term, of course,people will die.)It could be argued that Trump’s extraordinary, norm-busting behaviour requires protest that meets it in the extra-political realm. Democrats aren’t going to storm the Capitol, but I have friends who have talked about withholding their federal taxes this tax season. Teslas aren’t only being boycotted butset on fire. Beyond the US, Europe is targeting Republican states in particular withreciprocal tariffs– Alabama beef and soybeans fromLouisiana– to inflict personal economic pain on Trump and his supporters.Still, it is the direct political victories that matter the most. In a ringing blow to Trump this week, theelection of judge Susan Crawfordover her Musk-backed rival for the Wisconsin supreme court – in a race that garnered a huge turnout from voters – highlights the power of boring, process-observant political pushback over more flamboyant gestures. This race was critical in determining the state’s congressional lines, gerrymandered by the Republican-controlled state Senate to favour Republican outcomes. But it also sent a more broadly cheering message: that the involvement of Elon Musk – who, along with affiliated groups, ploughedmore than $20minto trying to get Brad Schimel elected – ended up motivating the Democratic vote more emphatically than the Republican.Meanwhile, Booker kept talking. It was telling that, during and after his marathon speech, neither Musk nor Trump acknowledged him on their various social media platforms, although a White House spokesman did derisively refer to Booker’s performance as a “Spartacus” moment. Over the course of the 25 hours, people drifted in and out to watch his feat of endurance, while his staff kept his face wipes replenished and placed folders of material before him to read from. To date, the art of the political spectacle has been almost exclusively Trump’s for the taking. It was a relief, finally, to see a Democrat seize and hang on to the mic.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Five years on, neither they nor voters really know him or his planWed 2 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 06.41 EDTShareUpsetting backbench MPs is an occupational hazard for prime ministers. Government is an endless sequence of messy compromises. Incumbency is a drag on popularity. Poll ratings sink and nerves fray. Careers are thwarted. There are fewer ministerial jobs than ambitious candidates.This is normal party discontentment. It grows over the course of a parliament, becoming critical at the point when rebel numbers threaten the leader’s majority. By that metric, Keir Starmer can afford to provoke a lot of dissatisfaction in the ranks. And, together withRachel Reeves, he has.The Labour mood in the aftermath of last week’s spring statement is bleak.Shrinking benefitsin the name of fiscal rectitude was never going to go down well with MPs who spent years in opposition denouncing the Tories for that sort of thing. But the demoralising effect is greater for being cumulative. It is just over a month since Starmerraided the overseas aid budgetto fund higher defence spending. Weeks earlier, Reeves landed Heathrow airport expansion on a party that would rather be striving for net zero.Each time,LabourMPs are presented with a plausibleforce majeurejustification – economic growth is the precondition for revenue to fund good causes; Vladimir Putin makes rearmament urgent; a welfare system marked by perverse incentives that steer people away from work needs reform. In isolation, any single unpalatable choice would be easier to swallow. As a multi-course meal, it turns the stomachs of MPs who feel they weren’t consulted on the menu.Open defiance is still rare. Ruthless whipping encourages discipline. MPs newly elected in 2024 are reminded that they owe their seats to Starmer, although that line is wearing thin. Submissive gratitude isn’t what motivates people to enter parliament. Some with slim majorities, eyeing opinion polls gloomily, are already thinking about life post-politics.Anxiety, tending towards despair, swells largely under the surface. It isn’t confined to any one faction. Downing Street would like to imagine that dissent springs only from a recalcitrant left, fomented by people who will never forgive Starmer for not being Jeremy Corbyn and then parlaying that distinction into a massive election victory.That is one source of dissatisfaction, but far from the only one. The malaise afflicts young MPs who were handpicked for loyalty to Starmer, grandees of New Labour vintage and every flavour of soft-left social democrat in the middle.It is hard to get the full measure of a syndrome that is expressed in exasperated whispers through gritted teeth and pained rolling of eyes. There are plenty of Labour MPs, including cabinet ministers, who dutifully cheer the prime minister in the Commons, then seethe with frustration in the adjoining corridors.Different wings of the party have rival policy prescriptions, but the core complaint is the same. It is the lack of discernible strategic purpose. There are “milestones”, but on the road to where? There are “missions”, but how will Britain be different,feelbetter, once they are accomplished?Loyal defenders of the government point out, fairly, that these are still early days in an exceptionally tough climate. There were no shortcuts back to prosperity, given the abject state of things left by the Tories. The performance of a new administration in its first year is not a reliable guide to its future prospects. In early 1981, for example, it looked feasible that mass unemployment and social unrest wouldsink Margaret Thatcher. She stayed comfortably afloat through two subsequent elections.One elaboration of that comparison configures Donald Trump’s upending of the global order, and Starmer’s seizure of the diplomatic initiative in support of Ukraine, as a pivotal moment in the prime minister’s national standing; a boost in stature much as Thatcher’s prestige soared after the Falklands war.That is a stretch. Still, there is somepolling evidencethat the Labour leader’s sure-footedness on the international stage has helped his domestic reputation. And, come the next general election, Starmer doesn’t have to be cherished as a visionary prime minister if enough voters continue to think that he is the safer choice than any of the alternatives.That doesn’t reassure MPs who crave a nobler purpose, and a less shrivelled message, than just keeping the Tories out. Also, that imperative has dwindling purchase on the growing cohort of voters who see Labour and Tories as interchangeable and equally contemptible.Starmer’s struggle for definition predates his arrival in No 10. This week he will mark his fifth anniversary as party leader, and throughout that time his successes have been a function more of the people he wasn’t than by things he wanted to achieve. He wasn’t Corbyn, for a start. He was the antithesis to Boris Johnson; the antidote to Liz Truss; the available alternative to Rishi Sunak. Now he is good at being unlike Trump – a positive attribute but a passive one.A leader whose outline can only be drawn with reference to other, worse politicians ends up appearing to voters only in silhouette, without colour or humanising contour.The government’s agenda is also circumscribed by decisions made in opposition, defining the project by things it was not. Labour’s pre-election fiscal policy was drafted in fear of being cast by the Tories as profligate with public money and wedded to high taxes.As a result, while Reeves is the nominal author of her budget and forthcoming spending review, she has to fit them in impossibly narrow margins. The lines on the page were ruled for her by Jeremy Hunt as a deliberate act of sabotage when he knew he would soon be vacating the chancellor’s desk.Even if current growth-boosting policies work, the benefits won’t accrue fast enough to compensate for deteriorating services. Budget cuts also save less money than advertised when they exacerbate social deprivation, increasing pressure on other services.Absent some unforeseen cash windfall, a revision of tax policy is inevitable if the government is serious about rehabilitating the public realm. Abler communicators than Reeves and Starmer would have started narrating their way out of that particular corner already. Trump’s tsunami of tariffs would be a valid reason to declare previous commitments void.It is especially unfortunate that the prime minister and the chancellor share the same deficiency in this regard. They speak as if every phrase has been scanned for originality, frisked for authenticity and prevented from carrying any unprocessed feelings from the heart through the maximum security gates of their mouths. They are both politicians who reached the top by winning internal battles, not public arguments.This is something even their close allies concede is a problem, although they are obliged to downplay its significance. It isn’t going to change. It didn’t stop Labour winning before and, less than a year since the election, it is far too early to know whether it will win again.But when, after five years, the leader is still defined by things he is not, Labour MPs are justified in worrying that their time in government is being squandered and they will end up being remembered for all the things they failed to do.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

It is not too lateWed 2 Apr 2025 13.26 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 14.25 EDTShare“We purchase and pay for a resilient setup from our suppliers,”Thomas Woldbye, Heathrow’s under-pressure chief executive, told the transport select committee, adding that the airport racked up energy costs of £135m a year. “Are we then also supposed to have a setup next to it? And then we would have to have a whole power station at the cost of billions to the airlines.”So runs Heathrow’s case that there was no alternative toclosing the airport for a full daylast month after a fire knocked out a nearby National Grid substation, one of three serving the airport.Heathrow’s engineers had to reconfigure an internal grid to take electricity solely from the other two substations. The reconfiguration involved shutting down and restarting 1,000 systems and could not be done in less than 10 hours. Therefore, passengers had to stay away during the process. Any other approach would have been unsafe.The persuasive part of this account is that a lengthy closure was inevitable if Heathrow needed 10 hours to do its stuff. There was some back-and-forth at the committee on whether Terminal 5, the least affected by the power cut, could have reopened sooner but Woldbye’s preference for caution on that detail was understandable. As he said, there is a difference between being able to land an aeroplane safely and being able to process its passengers through border control, baggage reclaim and the rest of it.Yet 10 hours to reconfigure! The core question is why Heathrow was happy to tolerate such a timetable in its emergency planning. One can understand an airport is a more complex operation than a humble datacentre, but the MPs didn’t properly challenge Woldbye’s presentation of the choice at Heathrow as a binary one between a 10-hour restart and an investment running to zillions. Were there no options in between?Perhaps not, but one wanted to hear a more detailed version of Heathrow’s cost-benefit analysis than the one Woldbye offered. He said his engineers estimated it would cost “more than £1bn” to refit a power ring around Heathrow and that the airlines would never agree to pay for it. OK, full resilience may not be economically viable. But could a less gold-plated investment have contained the downtime to a couple of hours, say?That is an electrical engineering question that is beyond this column’s expertise. But it is also a question of what decisions were made by the Heathrow board about risk and resilience, and on what basis. The role ofNational Gridand Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, transmission and distribution operators respectively, cannot be overlooked. But, as Southern Electricity’s operations director, Eliane Algaard, pointed out, the two additional electricity intakes were available throughout and Network Rail, also affected by the substation fire, was able to transfer its power sources automatically.One hopes “the Kelly review”, mentioned repeatedly by Woldbye, will address the board’s past risk assessments and judgments on operational resilience. Unfortunately, the Kelly in question is the former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, a main board director of Heathrow for the past six years. Asargued here last week, that appointment will look like a case of marking your own homework. An external examiner would have more credibility. It is not too late.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportNils Pratley on financeAir transportTransportNational GridcommentShareReuse this content"

It is estimated that the use of antibioticsadds about 20 yearsof life expectancy for every person worldwide (on average). As the King’s Fund put it, if we lose antibiotics, “we would lose modern medicine as we know it”. Doctors, public health experts and governments take the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) very seriously, yet the problem appears to be getting worse.A report from theNational Audit Officein February finds that out of five domestic targets set in 2019 to tackle AMR, only one has been met – to reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals. Others, such as the target to reduce drug-resistant infections in humans by 10%, haven’t made much progress; in fact, these infections have actually increased by 13% since 2018.AMR is often misunderstood. I have often heard people say “I’m afraid of taking antibiotics and becoming resistant to them.” But AMR isn’t about individuals becoming resistant to antibiotics. It’s about pathogens – most often bacterial infections but also viruses, fungi and parasites – evolving to become resistant to our current drugs, so that the infections they cause become untreatable. Think of ear, urinary tract and chest infections, or procedures such as C-sections and other routine surgeries, becoming life threatening because the drugs we use to treat infections or to prevent them after medical procedures don’t work.However, I despair at Britain beating itself with yet another stick. The country has actually been fairly good at tackling AMR. In 2023, our research team led byJay Patelpublished an analysis in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal measuring the global response to AMR in 114 countries. The UK made the top three “best performing” countries with only the US and Norway ahead, followed by Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Japan. The credit in the UK largely sits withDame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England from 2011 to 2019, who made it a priority during her tenure and continues to lead as the UK special envoy on AMR. The UK government has led on national guidelines and oversight in human and animal health in conjunction with the EU.We may worry about doctors overprescribing antibiotics in the NHS, needlessly exposing pathogens to these drugs and allowing them to evolve resistance. But having worked onAMR governancebefore, my take is that the biggest threat is the rise of resistant pathogens emerging in countries using huge amounts of antibioticsin their animalsfor growth and cheap meat. Think of pigs, chickens and cattle in China, Brazil, India and, evenuntil recently, the US. Livestock alone is estimated toconsume 50% to 80%of the antibiotics produced in high- and middle-income countries. These resistant pathogens develop in animals, which are given antibiotics as a prophylactic even when they’re healthy. They then infect a human, who may travel and spread it to other humans. It is a straightforward formula. Antibiotics in animals plus farm workers plus air travel equals drug-resistant infections in the UK, and elsewhere.It is not just theoretical. In 2018, astudy in Naturefound that widespread colistin-resistant bacteria, including in hospitals in London, could be traced to a single event in 2006 in China when a bacteria jumped from pigs into humans. Colistin is a last-line antibiotic for certain infections, meaning it is given after other drugs have failed, yet it was used heavily for growth promotion in pig farming in China. Since these findings, the Chinese government, as well as India and Japan,banned colistinin animal feed. This probably will have a larger impact on reducing AMR than anything being done in UK clinics and with human prescribing practices.AI may help us cure countless diseases – and usher in a new golden age of medicine | Samuel HumeRead moreThe UK is best protected from drug-resistant infections by working with other countries to regulate the use of antibiotics, especially in animals. Davies has tried hard to push this agenda globally, bringing together human health, agricultural and vet experts to agree on standards and regulations that are a universal good. However, there is a clear conflict with those who argue that boosting animal production, including of cheap and available meat, is the priority, especially in middle-income countries with large populations.Why can’t we just develop new antibiotics if our current ones become ineffective? Simple question and tough answer. These are technically difficult drugs to develop and we have made very slow progress. Developing similar versions to existing antibiotics isn’t enough because they won’t be as effective against pathogens that have developed resistance: we need totally new classes of drugs. And a recentWorld Health Organization reportnoted that since 2017, while 13 new antibiotics have obtained authorisation, only two represent a new chemical class.Our best to shot to tackle AMR is to protect our current arsenal of drugs and make sure they remain effective. This means working with other countries on a shared approach to how and when drugs are used in humans and animals. This is an ongoing challenge, especially in a world where cooperation is breaking down and isolationist approaches are on the rise. Yes, we can blame the UK government for many things, but on the issue of AMR it is a standout country and a global leader.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author ofHow Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsAntibioticsOpinionHealthFarm animalsFarmingAgriculturecommentShareReuse this content"

Many in the US could be forgiven for wondering what exactly they’ve just been liberated from.After much hype, the president unveiled his plan for a new era in global trade: a blanket 10% tariff on goods imported into the US starting Saturday, and higher “reciprocal” tariffs (of up to 49%) on countries taxing US exports starting next Wednesday.Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, upending decades of US trade policyRead more“April 2nd 2025 will be forever remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” according to Trump.Historians will be the judge of that. But before anyone writes this chapter, millions of Americans need to navigate the present.Trump was re-elected last November after years of heightened inflation, and upward pressure on the cost of living. On the campaign trail he pledged, repeatedly and unambiguously, to rapidly liberate the nation from higher prices.But tariffs, his administration has conceded, risk doing the opposite. The treasury secretaryrecently dismissed cheap goods as “not the essence of the American dream”after acknowledging that costs may rise as a result of Trump’s aggressive trade strategy: music to the ears of anyone seeking liberation from lower prices.Anyone sitting in the White House Rose Garden might be reassured. “Prices are way down,” the president has claimed, since his return to office.Anyone who has visited a grocery store in that time might feel differently. Most prices have, in fact, not fallen since January;inflation is still risingwell above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2% per year.“Now it’s our turn to prosper,” he proclaimed. But many US firms are bracing for problematic, not prosperous, effects of this action: higher costs they warn will be passed on to their customers.“What we have heard from business of all sizes, across all industries, from around the country is that these broad tariffs are a tax increase that will raise prices for American consumers and hurt the economy,” said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, the corporate lobby group.Trump likes to present the world as black and white. The US is either winning or losing. A policy, deal or plan is the best or the worst. A person, country or company is supporting or screwing you.There is rarely space for nuance, time for complexity or tolerance for inconvenient facts. The simplicity of this narrative is its power.By Trump’s telling, the US is about to raise trillions of dollars for the federal government by taxing the world, not its citizens: a typically black-and-white choice.But reality is often more complex than rhetoric. There are myriad shades of grey.Import tariffs are not paid by other countries. They are paid by importers – in this case, US firms and consumers – buying goods from overseas. These costs often trickle down through the economy, raising prices at every clink in the chain.Trump promised lower prices. He is betting his tariffs won’t raise them too high, for too long.“This is going to be a big moment,” he said on Wednesday. “I think you’re going to remember today.”He may well be right.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

I asked a fewAdrian ChilesWhy is the moral panic only ever about younger generations? It’s time we heard what confuses or worries them about usWed 2 Apr 2025 07.03 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 12.58 EDTShareEvery generation looks at the next generation, and the one after that, with bafflement and concern. There’s probably a name for this phenomenon. That’s not to say we (the olds) aren’t right to be more worried than ever about what they (the young) are up to. There’s a lot for us to be worried about and confused about in equal measure. TheTV drama Adolescencegot at this. Even having had its emojis and red pills – and emojis of red pills – patiently explained to me, I remain concerned and confused. Mainly confused. It’s all decidedly mysterious – and not in a good, exciting way.This intergenerational bewilderment seems only to work in one direction: down, rather than up. We flail around trying to make sense of what’s going on with the young. If you are young, this is relevant to you, too, because you will soon be feeling like this about those coming up behind you. What I want to know is what, if anything, baffles the young about the old. Do they get together to express despair and confusion at the conduct of the olds? Is there stroking of chins, scratching and shaking of heads, as they ask: “What’s going on with elderly people today? I can hardly understand a thing they’re saying. I don’t know what’s going to become of them, I’m sure.”Why is the moral panic only ever about the young? Come on, kids, have a moral panic about us! Did you not see that story aboutsexually transmitted infections risingfastest in adults aged 65 and over? Think on that, if you can bear to.I’ve been alarming some gen Z people by asking them what they find alarming about us. What confuses them about our ways? What is it they find unknowable about us, in the same way that we (or perhaps it’s just me) can’t quite work them out? In my family, I don’t feel they find me remotely unknowable. I get the sense they regard me, in the nicest possible way, with affectionate exasperation. To them, I’m basically sweet and a bit simple and therefore rather easy to work out. It’s not that they don’t understand me, rather that, as far as they’re concerned, there’s not a lot to understand. They may be right, I suppose.Looking for a view from outside the emotionally freighted confines of family, I sought the advice of a twentysomething I know – a trainee lawyer in Birmingham called Amy – and took some delight in the list of things she doesn’t get about us.For starters, why can’t we work out how to mute ourselves on Teams? Bit specific, that, but it’s a fair point. Why do we feel the need to print everything when digital versions exist? Why are we suspicious of modern tech – apps such as Apple Pay and Monzo – but at the same time believe and share scaremongering posts on Facebook? Why do we romanticise struggle: “We had to walk to school in the snow with no phones,” etc?The questions come thick and fast. Why do we check weather apps all day, every day? What is it with the undying loyalty to our “usual places”, cafes and so on – “They’ve known me for years here” – as if this gives us some elite title or membership status? Why can’t we change our habits or ways, even though the world is changing around us?All good points, but they express wry amusement, rather than the contempt we deserve. How dare we bleat about what the modern world is doing to our young when the modern world is of our creation? We’ve all played a part. The young need to be angrier with us, if only to motivate them to try harder to sort things out, so that, when they cock things up as badly as we have, their young won’t rise up and exact vengeance on them.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionAgeingAdolescenceSocial trendsSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

A century later, when noxious fog choked the capital, parliament passed the firstClean Air Act, limiting coal fire emissions.When a dangerous toxin assails the senses, polluting public space to the detriment of all that use it, the case for legislation is self-evident. The argument is more complex when the poison has no chemical properties; when it exists in a virtual realm. This is the conceptual challenge for regulation of digital content. It is made all the more complex by conflation with arguments about free speech and censorship.The UK has a law that grapples with these questions. The 2023Online Safety Actmakes social media companies, websites and search engines responsible for harmful content published via their services. Offending material named in the statute is uncontroversially horrible – violent pornography, incitement to violence and terrorism. Such things are commonly proscribed even in very liberal jurisdictions on the basis that, with some types of communication, the state’s duty of public protection is paramount. No one argues that child abuse images, for example, are a legitimate expression of free speech.Yet implementation of the Online Safety Act is now in question because Donald Trump’s government has identified it as a symptom of wider European infringement of free expression. As theGuardian revealedthis week, US state department officials expressed their concern in a meeting with Ofcom, the regulator responsible for enforcing new digital regulations.That intervention should be seen in the context of an aggressive trade policy that cannot tolerate any foreign restriction on the extension of American economic interests overseas. Thatexplicitly includesregulation that “incentivises US companies to develop or use products and technology in ways that undermine free speech or foster censorship”.The invocation of liberal principle here is cynical and ideological. TheTrump administrationdefines freedom of speech as the right to propagandise for the president. Any effort to correct wilful misinformation or conduct public discourse on a foundation of verifiable fact is liable to be denounced as censorship.Mr Trump’s power is bolstered by alliance withtech industry oligarchs. The unwritten deal is that the president’s cause is boosted on social media and the platforms’ commercial interests are driven by the president. That is why US trade policy is being deployed against European regulators that have tried to make the internet – or the part of it over which they have legal jurisdiction – less lawless.Yielding to that pressure would cede control of the digital information space to people who actively subvert it for the cause of American ultranationalism. It would mean accepting that a vital part of the digital infrastructure for a free society operates according to rules set by companies that are poisoning the wells of public discourse.There is a legitimate debate to be had about the boundary between safety online and censorship. The two issues are entangled because regulation of information space involves a distinction between permitted and intolerable content. But no European democracy can conduct that debate on terms dictated by a US administration that sees all digital space as its sovereign domain, and that holds tenets of liberal democracy in contempt.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Canvassing the views of a Dagenham audience ranging from low-paid retail employees to white‑collar professionals, Prof Sandel drew two principal conclusions: work was widely viewed as a potential source of self-esteem and communal purpose; but for too many its oppressive reality was one of stress, precarity and a sense of disempowerment.Some of the bleak consequences of that divide are outlined in theimpact assessmentsaccompanying Angela Rayner’s employment rights bill, which is now passing through the House of Lords. In 2022/23, for example, 17.1m working days were lost due to stress, depression or anxiety – equivalent to an estimated £5bn in lost output. Around 2 million employees reported anxiety due to a lack of clarity over the number of hours they will work, or shifts suddenly being changed. A lack of adequate employment protection means that some 4,000 pregnant women and mothers returning from maternity leave lose their jobs each year.For a Labour government, a commitment to improve everyday life for millions navigating the sharp end of the modern jobs market should come naturally. Measures in Ms Rayner’sbillsuch as the reform of zero-hours contracts, and better access to sick pay, are a necessary response to what the deputy prime minister hasdescribedas an era in which “the good, secure jobs our parents and grandparents could depend on were replaced by low-paid insecure work”. This is apopularagenda with the public, and one that disproportionately benefits workers in communities where 20th-century deindustrialisation hit hardest.Ms Rayner apart, however, Labour seems ominously reluctant to shout about it, as anaemic growth predictions continue to unnerve the Treasury. Amid persistentspeculationthat the package may be watered down in response to lobbying by business groups, the political headwinds and noises off are mounting. In its latest report on the UK economy, published to coincide with last week’s spring statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)suggestedthat greater regulation at the workplace would have “material, and probably net negative, economic impacts on employment, prices and productivity”.That was a narrow and contestable judgment. Delivering greater security and dignity to the low‑paid will come at an annual cost to employers, estimated in the low billions in the impact assessments. But the wider social and economic benefits are likely to be greater in terms of knock-on effects generated by improved living standards, increased participation in the labour market, and better health and wellbeing outcomes. Pacethe OBR, happier employees will also be more productive ones.For a brief period in the 2010s, Prof Sandelappearedto be making the intellectual weather in Ed Miliband’s Labour party. His defence then of a politics of the common good, against the reductive and dehumanising calculations of the market, is echoed in the vision underlying Ms Rayner’s employment bill. The government has beenaccusedof betraying core centre-left values on issues such as disability benefits and international aid. By forging ahead with the deputy prime minister’s flagship project, it can begin to restore some of that lost faith.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The world’s leaders must tell the truth about what that means, 28 March). This ever-increasing threat to world stability from both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is obvious to all, and our leaders’ fear of addressing it head-on is palpable. Our prime minister must now show leadership and speak openly to the country about this threat.We live in an era where free speech has been stifled. We are in fear of reprisal from a few rich and powerful people who appear to be able to act with impunity. The US has always been our ally, and there is no reason why this should not continue. The Senate and the American people must initially take the responsibility by rectifying their error in electing this dictatorial president. What happened to impeachment? Richard Nixon was removed for, by comparison, a minor misdemeanour. If the American people do not act, they will bear the burden of shame when this is over.Royston EvansCharlton,WiltshireMaybe Keir Starmer should followMark Carney’s example. Canada’s historical links with the US are even closer than the UK’s, but this didn’t deter Carney from being forthright in his condemnation of the US president’s behaviour. Despite this – or perhaps even because of this – they had what Donald Trump described as “extremely productive talks”. Bullies generally respect people who stand up to them and have nothing but contempt for those who try to appease them.Steve BamfordLittlehampton, West SussexThe only way to respond to Trump is to target the two things that truly matter to him – his (alleged) wealth and his ego. Trump is reckless, transactional and untruthful, and creates uncertainty, because he has been allowed him to profit from this.Put a 100% surcharge on any product or service made or provided by any company based in the US, or bearing an American brand name, that is sold anywhere in the UK, Europe, Canada or Mexico. Start with Boeing, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Cisco Systems etc, and see how Trump and his 52% support base like it when the market capitalisation of these entities falls along with their pension fund valuations.Tim BourkeRome, ItalyDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Plus letters fromColin LeiskandMichel GrattonWed 2 Apr 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 12.33 EDTShareWhile I abhor the politics of Marine Le Pen, I believe the recent decision by the French judiciary to bar her from running for public office for five years raises important and uncomfortable questions about the relationship between justice and democracy (Report, 31 March).The idea that someone convicted of serious offences may be unfit for high office is entirely reasonable. But in this case, the use of relatively new legal powers – at a moment of high political consequence – risks appearing politically motivated, even if it isn’t. That perception matters. Democracies must defeat dangerous ideologies at the ballot box, not in the courtroom.When I raised these concerns in a comment on a Guardian post on Facebook, I was struck by how many responses simply told me what I must be saying, rather than engaging with what I had actually said. The nuance of my point – that democratic principles must apply even to those we oppose – was lost in the noise.This, in my view, is part of the environment in which populism thrives: when we stop listening, assume bad faith and trade complexity for certainty. We defend democracy not just through institutions, but through the quality of our public discourse. We need to do better – or there will be far worse to come.Anthony RichardsLondonOh, the hypocrisy of the far right. You can bet that if a mainstream political party had been found guilty of fraud, the likes ofElon Musk, Viktor Orbán and Matteo Salviniwould have been crowing. But because it is one of their allies, they play the victim card and claim the verdict is a threat to democracy.Let’s look at the real threat to democracy. By fraudulently funding theNational Rally(RN), Le Pen and her colleagues were able to grow its base and support, thereby changing the political landscape in France. It isn’t the only reason why support for the RN has grown, but fraud gave it the resources to compete with more mainstream parties.Fortunately, the French courts did their job, unlike those in the US. If the US justice system worked effectively,Donald Trumpwould be behind bars instead of creating mayhem in the White House.Dave PollardLeicesterMarine Le Pen has just got what she asked for, quite literally. Not so long ago, she advocated total firmness against convicted elected officials: “When are we going to implement lifelong ineligibility for all those convicted of crimes committed during their term of office?” Le Pen asked on the television channelPublic Sénat in 2013. And: “I have an ethic and sense of morality that I would apply to others’ corruption as I would to myself.”Colin LeiskParis, FranceSome politicians have decried the court’s verdict, and they dare say that they defend democracy. That’s disgraceful. No privilege for Marine Le Pen. No special treatment for her. The law is the law. The verdict would have been a political decision indeed if the court had found Marine Le Pen not guilty, yielding to thepoll published recentlyby the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, which found that Le Pen could have won the next presidential election. Le Pen was banned from running for the election in 2027, not the RN.Michel GrattonSt Jean de Boiseau,FranceHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Díaz came from an offside position to regain possession from a James Tarkowski attempted clearance to set up Jota for the winner. According to the rulebook, however, the Colombian had to be “clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent” to be adjudged offside. He did not.Diogo Jota breaks down Everton’s blue wall as Liverpool move closer to titleRead moreWhile grateful for the decision, theLiverpoolhead coach admitted the rule is counterproductive. Slot said: “Do I like the rule? No, I don’t like the rule. It’s a rule that is not helping the team that wants to attack. Normally we go to the halfway line, they [the opposition] kick the ball long to a player who is in an offside position, and my centre-backs feel like they have to head the ball away.“I always ask the linesman: ‘Was he offside?’ And they say: ‘No, he was not interfering.’ I hate that rule. But the execution of the rule was fortunately for us today, well done in that situation.”Moyes insisted Liverpool’s winner should have been disallowed. TheEvertonmanager said: “Liverpool were the better team, no complaints with that. We had some opportunities and we did a great job, we were resilient. But it is disappointing to lose to a goal that is clearly offside. It is quite an easy one to give.”Moyes conceded that Tarkowski was lucky to avoid an 11th-minute red card for a dangerous challenge on Alexis Mac Allister. The Everton captain was only booked. “I thought at the time it was a brilliant tackle,” the Everton manager said. “But since I have seen it again, we could have been lucky we didn’t get a red. It was a high one.

After beingdumped out of the FA Cup quarter-finalshere on Saturday by Nottingham Forest in a penalty shootout, there was more heartache for the Brighton manager as Marcus Rashford’s third goal in his past two games, yet another for Marco Asensio, and Donyell Malen’s first for the club gave Aston Villa a crucial win in the battle for a top‑five finish.It meant Unai Emery’s side moved above Brighton and vastly improved their chances of matching their achievement last season of qualifying for the Champions League.

Yet after making some shrewd acquisitions in January including Rashford and Asensio – who now has eight goals for Villa since joining on loan from Paris Saint-Germain – you wouldn’t bet against them doing it.Manchester City 2-0 Leicester, Brighton 0-3 Aston Villa and more: Premier League – liveRead more“The most important thing is how he is feeling – how he is recovering confidence in himself and concentrating on playing football,” Emery said of Rashford’s impact. “But everything with him is getting progressively better and it’s the same with Marco [Asensio]. We signed these players because we knew they could help us.”Hürzeler criticised his team for “playing soft” against Forest but they were again outfought by a well‑drilled Villa outfit. There was frustration when Simon Adingra’s equaliser was disallowed for handball just after Rashford’s opener but more than a smattering of boos greeted the third from Malen – who joined Villa from Borussia Dortmund in January – in the 10th minute of stoppage time.“It’s not easy when all the little things go against you, you try to force it in some moments and we didn’t have the right answer,” said Hurzeler, whose team face a trip to play their arch-rivals Crystal Palace on Saturday. “We have a chance to make it better.”It took Villa’s fans less than five minutes to remind their hosts that they are heading to Wembley this month to face Palace with a chorus of “Que Sera”. With the first leg of their Champions League quarter‑final against PSG to look forward to as well next week, Emery was delighted that Ollie Watkins was able to return from injury as a second-half substitute alongside Asensio and Malen.It was Villa’s bench that made the difference, although the option to make Rashford’s move permanent from Manchester United in the summer for £40m is looking more and more attractive by the day.View image in fullscreenMarco Asensio celebrates his eighth goal for Aston Villa since joining on loan in January.Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesThe referee, Stuart Attwell, waved away appeals for a first-half penalty after Kaoru Mitoma went down rather easily under pressure from Matty Cash inside the area. Emery could not resist offering his own opinion that the Japan forward had dived as he and Hürzeler had to be separated by the fourth official Simon Hooper.Villa had their own appeals for a penalty turned down despite the video assistant referee taking a long look at Jack Hinshelwood’s challenge on Jacob Ramsey. Brighton felt they had another shout for a penalty when Yasin Ayari’s free-kick cannoned back off the post and struck Ramsey on the arm but again Attwell said no.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jan Paul van Hecke’s header from a corner was straight at Emi Martínez and the Villa goalkeeper wasted no time finding Morgan Rogers with a quick throw. His pass over the top was perfect for Rashford to race on to and he squeezed the ball past Bart Verbruggen via a deflection.Brighton thought they had found the perfect riposte when Adingra swept home from close range but VAR correctly ruled out the goal after replays showed Mitoma had used his arm to control the ball in the buildup.Rashford’s night came to an end midway through the second half as Emery attempted to close out the victory with a triple substitution that included Asensio. Not to be outdone, Hurzeler made a quadruple change for Brighton. But it was Asensio who made the difference when he finished off a lightning quick break before Malan rounded off the scoring in injury-time to give Villa’s Champions League hopes a shot in the arm.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Afterwards on Instagram, Grealish said: “With me always, especially this day – that was for you Keelan.”Diogo Jota breaks down Everton’s blue wall as Liverpool move closer to titleRead moreHe told Sky: “My little brother passed away 25 years ago [aged just nine months]. This day is hard on the family but I was happy to score. My mum and dad were here. This day is always difficult in the family, so to score and to win was brilliant.”Grealish’s opener was his first in the league since he scored against Crystal Palace on 16 December 2023.“As soon as I scored I knew this would be what people say but listen, this season I’ve not been at my best – even last season,” he said. “I’ve not started in the Premier League since before Christmas. But I was happy I started tonight and to score.”Omar Marmoush was the player billed pre-game as the injured Erling Haaland’s capable stand-in; his response was to score City’s second. For Pep Guardiola, who adores the Champions League, the end result is business accomplished in the bid to seal a qualification berth: victory lifts City to fourth. Yet as is the story of an underwhelming campaign, the manager’s charges lacked sharpness and intensity and Guardiola will spend the close season addressing this as he targets a return to a high-octane game.Those who waited until nine minutes to take their seat in protest at City partnering with Viagogo, a ticket resale site, missed Grealish’s opener, which instantly made it feel like the Foxes would be lucky to depart without serious embarrassment. Guardiola, seated in the stands due to a one-game ban, swigged from a bottle of water and would be overjoyed at his choice of Grealish as the playmaker.Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side last scored on 7 February via Bobby De Cordova-Reid. So when finally planting a few boots in City territory you understood why Bilal El Khannouss tried to curl an equaliser past Ederson from long range.View image in fullscreenJack Grealish (centre) celebrates scoring Manchester City’s opening goal before protesting fans take their seats.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAHe missed, but more measured was a move down the right that ended when Patson Daka twisted away from Josko Gvardiol but ran the ball out. The Leicester advance pointed to City lacking the iron-fisted control of past seasons. Where once the ball was guarded, sloppiness informs the opponent they have a chance.Rúben Dias’s loose pass upfield was an example. So too was Savinho slipping over to allow El Khannouss to pilfer possession. After this show of City weakness, cue Leicester imploding, or rather Hermansen: another poorly aimed Dias ball went straight into the keeper, but he spilled and Marmoush steered home off an upright.Marmoush went close to netting a seventh since joining in January but a shot was blocked. Then Savinho drew a sharp Hermansen save after an Ilkay Gündogan cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moments later Grealish weaved into the area, Leicester parted like the proverbial, and the forward fell on his backside. A penalty was demanded but Darren England was not interested, nor did the VAR ask the referee to take a second look. Replays seemed to show a Grealish miskick only.In potent mood City know when to speed up the patient stuff, as Grealish did when pivoting infield and finding O’Reilly. Suddenly the local boy saw an opening and a smart outside-of-the-boot stab followed that might have been City’s third. Yet cleverness was absent from Marmoush’s wild blaze over following silken Savinho-Grealish-Jérémy Doku passes: the Egyptian should have made it 3-0 and put Leicester away.But no, and what ensued was tepid fare. City were at 70%-plus possession and the counter showed 14 shots to Leicester’s paltry one but the champions had settled into keep-ball mode, tapping it about in and around halfway.A Savinho pratfall summed this up. Sunday’s crosstown trip to Manchester United for the 196th derby will hopefully be more vibrant.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityLeicester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

What does he think of Turkey?”“I believe that Fenerbahce’s management will impose the necessary sanction before the federation does,” Ozturk added. In his post-game press conference, Buruk tried to play the incident down although admitted it was “not a classy move”.“There was nothing between me and Mourinho,” Buruk said. “He pinched my nose from behind. There was a slight scratch. Of course, it wasn’t a very nice or elegant thing to do. We expect managers to behave more appropriately in such situations.

In the second half, Irfan Egribayat denied Gala’s Gabriel Sara from close range, but Buruk’s Super Lig leaders saw out the result to boost their bid for a league and cup double.A skirmish in stoppage time led to Galatasaray’s Baris Alper Yilmaz – who had just been taken off – and unused substitute Kerem Demirbay being dismissed.

Galatasaray lead Fenerbahce by six points in the Super Lig having played a game more, and Wednesday’s win boosted their hopes of a double.In February, Mourinho was accused of making racist comments by Galatasaray after a goalless Super Lig draw between the Istanbul rivals.

Europe beckons, tantalisingly, for the newly minted Carabao Cup winners.Howe’s Wembley history-makers may be in the words of their captain, Bruno Guimarães, “legends” on Tyneside now, but they were up against opponents aiming to extend a run of five straight away wins.“We were always in the game,” said the visiting manager, whose players remained unfazed as Newcastle initially stretched them down the flanks, nearly taking an early lead when Alexander Isak headed narrowly wide. “Tonali’s goal was one in a million.”While Isak menaced before his eventual withdrawal with a tight groin, Brentford came alive on the break. It was easy to appreciate why Frank’s right winger, Bryan Mbeumo, ranks so highly on Howe’s summer shopping list.Mbeumo’s amalgam of outstanding movement and laser-like accuracy of delivery dictated that, on the left of the home defence, Tino Livramento and Dan Burn could never relax. Neither could Tonali. Howe had his Italy midfielder to thank for intercepting a series of counterattacks as his intelligent interpretation of the No 6 role once again underlined his importance.As the dangerous Kevin Schade, deployed nominally on the left wing, and the rest of Frank’s front line interchanged positions with a dizzying rapidity, Newcastle looked more leggy than legends.They are nothing if not resilient though and they do possess Isak. Sure enough, with half-time approaching, the Sweden striker conjured the opening that prefaced a narrowly offside Harvey Barnes turning the ball into an empty net.Undeterred by the decision to disallow that goal, Isak swiftly connected with Jacob Murphy’s superb cross and, capitalising on Mbeumo’s unfortunate stumble, volleyed his 20thPremier Leaguegoal of the season beyond Mark Flekken’s reach from close range.View image in fullscreenTonali’s effort flies past Mark Flekken.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersNot that Mbeumo is too shabby in front of goal either.

The moment had arrived for Tonali to reassert himself and he did not disappoint. Given that he struck his goal from a classic crossing position near a corner flag it was also one of the most impudent finishes imaginable.Whether it was really supposed to be a cross or not, the former Milan playmaker had spotted Flekken off his line and reacted instinctively. It proved the cue for the Tonali song – “drinks Moretti, eats spaghetti”, to tumble, gratefully, down from the stands.Afterwards Frank, smiling ruefully, asked the man of the moment: “Did you mean that?” Tonali grinned broadly. As he later reflected: “It was hard for the goalkeeper and hard for me but there was also a little bit of luck.”Howe, winking, joked that Tonali practised the manoeuvre every day in training.“I was mightily relieved when it hit the back of the net,” said Newcastle’s manager.“We weren’t at our finest. I’m relieved to come through with three points.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, the BBF signed a 15‑year agreement with an American consortium to operate a new men’s professional league from 2026.The existing nine Super League Basketballclubs are deeply unhappy with the BBF’s plans for the sport. On their behalf Vaughn Millette, the Sheffield Sharks owner, wrote in February to the government after the BBF had entered exclusive negotiations with Marshall Glickman’s GBB League Ltd (GBBL), to outline their concerns.Hoop dreams in peril as British basketball’s crisis reaches boiling pointRead moreIn a reply seen by the Guardian, Peacock describes the issues raised in the letter as varying between “serious” and “potentially criminal” and that officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will askUK Sportto investigate.The allegations are understood to revolve around the legality of the BBF’s tender process for operating the new league. SLB had been expected to make a bid to run the league itself, but club sources say it was advised not to on legal grounds.“Some of the matters you raise in your letter are serious and some are potentially criminal in nature,” Peacock wrote in response to the clubs’ concerns. “The Code for Sports Governance sets out the mandatory governance requirements for organisations receiving public funding from UK Sport or Sport England. DCMS officials will raise the concerns you have set out to UK Sport and Sport England to ensure all of the processes under the code are being complied with.”The BBF confirmed the new deal with Glickman’s group on Wednesday morning, igniting a civil war in the sport that could jeopardise some of the £4.75m in public money basketball receives each year from UK Sport and Sport England, which are responsible for elite and grassroots funding respectively.In response Super League Basketball released a statement in which it threatened to set up a breakaway league in defiance of the governing body, and accused the BBF of running an illegal tender process.“The new league operator proposed by the British Basketball Federation has no clubs, fans, arenas or expertise to build the infrastructure and future that British basketball and its communities deserve,” an SLB spokesperson said.“Super League Basketball has been clear from the outset that the tender process undertaken by the British Basketball Federation was illegal and unjust.“SLB would like to make clear that it does not legally require the BBF licence to continue to operate the professional basketball league in Britain. SLB clubs and their owners have worked tirelessly and invested well over £15m this season alone to create a sustainable future for professional basketball in Britain, its fans and the communities it serves. All nine partner clubs are united in the vision to continue operating a stable and viable league for the 2025-26 SLB season and beyond.”The BBF declined to respond or comment, but has consistently denied claims that it has acted improperly and views the backlash as sour grapes from clubs who will no longer be in control of the league.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn announcing the deal the BBF chair, Chris Grant, said: “We’re delighted to welcome GBBL to the British Basketball family. The award of this licence not only heralds the biggest ever level of financial investment into the league, it also brings the knowhow, connections and vision to excite those who already love the game and to attract new fans and participants.“The GB women’s and men’s teams have both qualified for Fiba EuroBasket this summer, and our progress on the court will be boosted through the LA Olympic cycle funding recently announced by UK Sport. To have booming professional leagues which enable our top players to compete in front of British fans, week in and week out, is just what we need in order to fulfil British Basketball’s huge potential.”In her letter to the clubs, Peacock suggested appointing an independent mediator if there was insufficient evidence to warrant a criminal investigation into the agreement.“Should none of the issues you raised be an issue for the police, and should UK Sport and Sport England set out that they do not have subsequent concerns about the BBF’s governance, DCMS cannot get involved in commercial disputes between two private parties where there is no criminality and where there has been no misuse of public funds,” the sports minister wrote.“Were this to be the case and no agreement between the SLB and BBF is reached, then we suggest that both parties enter independent arbitration. We hope that everyone would agree that the survival of a sustainable professional league is the priority and best outcome for the future of basketball in this country, from the elite level to the grassroots game.”Explore more on these topicsGB basketballUK SportBasketballnewsShareReuse this content"

Waugh also confirmed that players who have represented Australia and New Zealand but subsequently switched nationality will not be considered, ending Israel Folau’s hopes of appearing in another Lions series and ruling out Charles Piutau.The Lions will lock horns with an invitational Australia and New Zealand side for the first time since 1989. When the fixture was announced in 2023, the then Australia head coach, Eddie Jones, turned his nose up, saying: “I don’t want to be involved with the Kiwis.” With the former All Blacks head coach Ian Foster leading the combined side, Waugh believes the fixture in Adelaide will have star appeal.Hong Kong in frame to host Nations Championship finals and Lions matchesRead moreAll Blacks involved in their summer fixtures against France will not be eligible but Waugh pointed to those playing in Japan, a list that includes Richie Mo’unga, Brodie Retallick, the former captain Sam Cane and Aaron Smith, who all faced the Lions in 2017, as potential members of the New Zealand contingent.“Ian Foster being announced as the coach is helpful because he has existing relationships with New Zealand players,” said Waugh. “We want to make that a real festival game. Big name players to maximise the exposure. If you think about all the Australians and New Zealanders in Japan, we’re pretty excited about filling out that team.”Folau was a shining light for the Wallabies during the 2013 Lions series but wassacked by Rugby Australia in 2019after homophobic posts on social media. He switched allegiances to Tonga, making his debut in 2022, and is now in Japan. Folau recently expressed a desire to be considered for the Anzac match before Waugh shut down his potential return on the basis that he had played for Tonga. Folau has since reacted angrily, suggesting that he was indirectly encouraged to express an interest by Rugby Australia.After an autumn revival under Joe Schmidt when the Wallabies beat England and Wales, hopes are high they will be competitive against the Lions. Schmidt is set to leave his role after the series and while the former England head coach Stuart Lancaster has been linked with the job, Waugh strongly suggested Rugby Australia would be turning elsewhere, with Les Kiss the clear favourite.“We’ve been pretty disciplined about not talking about candidates,” said Waugh. “We want to make sure it’s the right cultural fit and the right capability. Our biggest focus is continuity and stability.“We don’t want to have a complete reset and be starting again, given where we were in 2023 and where we are now. We want progression rather than disrupting things by starting again. It’s not just about the head coach, it’s about the management team and Super Rugby.”Meanwhile, the Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney has broken his silence since facing down a grassroots rebellion last week, writing in a letter to the organisation’s members that “it has not been an easy time for me personally”.Last week Sweeney comfortably won a vote of no confidence at an RFU Special General Meeting – triggered after it was revealed he received a £358,000 bonus last year, taking his overall remuneration to £1.1m – before the union’s interim chairman Bill Beaumont promised “meaningful change”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her family’s video footage is a reminder that the one club Caroline Weir always wanted to play for was Real Madrid.Fast forward two decades and that same all-white shirt – this time with Weir on the back – hangs on the walls of an Edinburgh cinema as the 29-year-old greets guests attending the premiere of a documentary the Scottish Football Association have made to honour their 108-times-capped midfielder. It feels fitting the film is being released within a fortnight of Weir scoring two decisive late goals in the women’s team’sfirstelclásicovictory over Barcelona.Nadia Nadim and the pursuit of happiness in women’s footballRead more“It was a big decision to leave [Manchester] City. I had a dream when I was younger to play for Real Madrid one day so I have lived that dream,” Weir says. “It’s gone pretty well, with some difficult moments thrown in there of course, that’s football, but I do want to win things so I have fully bought in to the project of the Real Madrid idea and what they want to do with the women’s team.“As much as we have had some really good moments, I want to be competing with the best, [win a] Champions League, the league, getting closer to Barcelona. That’s my motivation every single day, to go and win things.”In Weir’s first season in Spain after leaving Manchester City in 2022, she played a starring role, scoring 28 goals in all competitions, from midfield, but an anterior cruciate ligament injury, sustained while playing for Scotland in September 2023, sidelined her for 12 months. She is now back to her best and much of the hard work required during her recovery was captured during the filming of the documentary.Galáctica is an intimate insight into Weir’s life, there are more lighthearted reflections such as her driving a maroon-coloured version of the car made famous by The Inbetweeners when she was playing for Arsenal, walks his her dachshund, Skye, through to more sombre moments including a scene where Weir fights back tears when recalling her ACL surgery.View image in fullscreenCaroline Weir after scoring Real Madrid’s second goal in their victory over Barcelona in March.Photograph: Mateo Villalba/Getty ImagesThe affection her Real Madrid teammates have for her is also evident. The Colombia winger Linda Caicedo has given Weir – an avid collector of football kits – the shirt she wore whenscoring against Germanyat the World Cup.Weir, who describes the film as a “huge honour”, says her technical game is evolving in Real’s system. “The role I play is slightly different,. I have quite a lot of freedom, the manager trusts me a lot in that No 10 role, and I’ve had to adapt to the league. It probably suits my abilities quite well.“I definitely feel like I’ve grown as a person. I don’t think I would have that if I’d stayed in England. [I’m also] trying to lead by example and move into that kind of leadership role, something I’m still developing and learning, but I’ve had freedom and trust from Real Madrid from the moment I signed.View image in fullscreen‘I have quite a lot of freedom,’ says Caroline Weir of her role at Madrid.Photograph: Scottish FAThat seniority and experience is something she is now trying to bring into the Scotland camp and she craves one other thing above all else –qualifying for another major international tournament. Scotland are preparing for a double-header of Nations League meetings with Germany and she says: “I’m definitely not the loudest player in the team, but I like to think I lead by example by my behaviours.“Inspiring girls and boys in Scotland, that is also important. Young boys seeing women playing football and the Scotland national team doing well, just to normalise that a bit, because Scotland has probably been a little bit behind other countries in that way. We do take that responsibility seriously.”That is something Shirley Martin – the SFA’s head of girls and women’s football – hopes can be aided by having a Galáctica in the team. “It’s a real fairytale story; a local girl from Dunfermline,” she says. “To say we’ve got a Scotland player playing at Real Madrid is fantastic. She is that player who is capable of that moment of magic. It’s amazing to say to young girls ‘this could be you’.”Explore more on these topicsReal Madrid WomenWomen's footballScotland women's football teaminterviewsShareReuse this content"

Biodiversity and preservation need rethinkingChris SmithHurricane Helene proved a hard truth: a freezer of seeds is the literal version of putting all your eggs in one basketSupported byAbout this contentWed 2 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 18.03 EDTShareAbout a month afterHurricane Helenedevastated western North Carolina last fall, Rodger Winn and I met in an Asheville, North Carolina, supermarket parking lot. He’d driven two hours from Little Mountain, South Carolina, where the passing storm had also left its destructive mark.“When the power finally came back on,” Winn said, “two of my freezers didn’t work.” Winn was worried not about spoiled food inside, but his seed collection. On that autumn day, in an act of forced downsizing and seed philanthropy, Winn handed over two boxes filled with seeds. He wanted me, as founder of the non-profit Utopian Seed Project, to share the seeds with farmers across the region. The boxes contained a trove of Appalachian varieties: speckled field peas, white mountain half-runner beans, purple-podded bush beans and lots of butterbeans.Over many years of being active in the seed-saving community, Winn has more than 100 varieties of carefully stewarded seeds. He recalled collecting sugar maple seeds in third grade when he “planted them in Dixie cups and sold them door-to-door”. As a child, Winn helped his grandmother shell dry butterbeans on their porch. He remembers how she admired the spectrum of lavender and pink seeds. But “when she died, [family members] basically cleaned the freezers out and threw everything away, including all her seeds,” he said.View image in fullscreenJim Veteto.Photograph: Veronica LimeberryUnlike some of his butterbeans, it’s not a rare story.Seeds have a finite lifespan, but when cooled to below-freezing temperatures, seeds’ metabolism slows and they can remain viable for decades or more. This makes freezers an important, albeit mundane, tool for long-term storage. Essentially, the freezer is an insurance policy against the loss of seed varieties.That’s also the principle behind facilities such as the Millennium Seed Bank in Sussex, England, which stores billions of seeds underground at -4F (-20C). This kind of institutional seed preservation is called ex-situ, which removes varieties from their natural environment. Winn is growing and saving seeds within his community, practicing in situ conservation.Persimmons and pears: the farmers’ market program getting kids excited to try new foodsRead moreFreezing seeds is a double-edged sword. The ability to store large seed collections with a few hundred dollars worth of plug-in technology has created a preservation problem. Or perhaps the problem is preservation itself.In Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass, the Red Queen said: “Now,here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.” The “Red Queen’s hypothesis” in evolutionary biology argues that species must be constantly evolving and adapting just to maintain their place in the ecosystem. A world without freezers would force seeds to be grown and saved regularly. But preservation can be a trap, both for the seeds frozen in time and the seed keepers who preserve them.Hurricane Helene reinforced another hard truth: a freezer full of seeds is the literal version of putting all your eggs in one basket. Dr Jim Veteto, living in Celo, North Carolina, manages the Southern Seed Legacy Project and recorded oral histories of people like Rodger Winn.His barn collapsed during Helene, burying his entire seed collection of hundreds of rare seed varieties collected from Appalachian and Cherokee seed keepers. In the days after the storm, he tried to dig the freezer out of the debris and muck. Later, local seed-savers showed up to help, and they pulled the freezer from the wreckage. Amazingly, the seeds appear to have survived.View image in fullscreen‘Seed-saving should not be the goal, but merely a skill that is used in an ongoing relationship with the plant.’Photograph: Veronica LimeberryLarge-scale, government-funded seed banks also have their problems. They collect and store seeds from peasant, Indigenous and rural communities across the world. Bonnetta Adeeb, founder of Ujamaa Cooperative Farming Alliance, refers to them as “seed jail”. I visited the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) S-9 Seed Storage at the University of Georgia’s Griffin campus. A large room cooled to a constant 18F was filled with hundreds of shelves, thousands of containers and millions upon millions of seeds.In theory, everyday people can request seeds from the USDA’s extensive collections. But, in practice, the USDA seed banks are primarily accessed by academic and corporate plant breeders, who rely on crop diversity to develop elite breeding lines. The preservation can become predatory, leading to claims of biopiracy and the “gene rush”, equivalent to gold rushes where outsiders rushed in to extract precious metals and profit from them. Seeds over people, even when those people and their relationships to the land are the reason the seeds exist and endure. Often, “improved” seeds are sold back to the original communities, further undermining their stewardship of biodiversity.Food security project that helps farm workers springs from ashes of wildfiresRead moreWinntold me that the hurricane prompted an ongoing shift in his own thinking. “This disaster made me start thinking about my seeds. For the most part, it’s been fun. It’s given me purpose.” Winn highlighted the friends and community he had made along the way, all the times he had swapped and shared seeds. The Southern Seed Legacy Project’s Veteto, who feared for his own life at the peak of the storm, said almost everyone he received seeds from had already died. “It’s just me out here with a freezer full of seeds,” he said. “I’ve become the type of person that I started out documenting. But that’s OK because these seeds give my life meaning.”Veteto was a student of Dr Virginia Nazarea, co-founder of the Southern Seed Legacy and author of Heirloom Seeds and Their Keepers. Nazarea once wrote: “Seedsaver contribution to the conservation of biodiversity needs to be understood as conservation in vivo, or conservation as a way of life.”This speaks to something greater than preservation, which often treats seeds like artifacts, not living things. Seed-saving should not be the goal, but merely a skill that is used in an ongoing relationship with the plant. People, seeds and relationships change over time. Life is messy, and that’s OK.In 2019, I accompanied culinary historian David Shields on a visit to the “Dark Corner” of South Carolina, near Greenville. As part of his work with the Carolina Gold Rice Foundation, he researched and sometimes rediscovered old seed varieties that dropped out of commercial circulation or had never achieved it.We traveled there to follow a lead from Craigslist, which mentioned someone growing what was believed to be an extinct corn. In the late 1800s, Cocke’s Prolific was a nationally renowned corn, but became less available by the turn of the 20th century and was considered a lost variety until six years ago. That day, we visited 96-year-old Manning Farmer, who proudly showed us 18in corn cobs. They were perhaps the only ones in the entire world.He’d grown and saved Cocke’s Prolific for nearly seven decades. Like any good seed-saver, he kept backup seeds in his freezer. His motivations were utilitarian, not preservation. It was his way of life. Farmer died shortly after his 99th birthday, in November 2021.View image in fullscreenHurricane Helene cleanup.Photograph: Veronica LimeberryOur desire to preserve is strongly linked to a narrative of loss, both for biodiversity writ large and for rare heirloom seeds. But we recognize the need for biodiversity and destroy it in the same breath. What if we protected the Amazon instead of just the genetics within it? What if we supported small-scale diversified agriculture instead of industrialized monoculture?Seed preservation has a place, but it’s not the thing that will save us. Heirloom seed keepers attempt to preserve the past, while plant breeders control genetic resources to commodify the seed. Neither camp is particularly focused on how to expand biodiversity into the future, as if biodiversity and seed varieties are fixed and finite things.Compounding this problem is the climate crisis, which is dramatically affecting our ability to grow food. Diversity is a core component of resilience, so we need rapid, ongoing and diverse adaptation of our regional food systems – everywhere, all the time. If we’ve been preserving all these seeds for some imagined future need, then the need is now. Arguably, it’s already too late.For me, events like Hurricane Helene represent the limits of adaptation. You can’t adapt to a 30,000-year flood, which wiped entire farms and towns from the landscape. You can only roll the dice and cross your fingers. Enormous climate mitigation is our only hope. In the meantime, we need to heed the Red Queen’s advice to“keep running”, to adapt while we still can. For me, this means emptying the freezers into the fields, a radical reverse flow from preservation back to the people. Because what’s the point in dying with a freezer full of seeds?This article was amended on 2 April 2025.

They successfully argued that the plan by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the EA to improve the stream lacked the legally required measures necessary to restore it – for example, it did not include the tightening of discharge permits for sewage treatment works.Thejudge in the high courtfound that the government had unlawfully failed to assess and identify specific measures to achieve the legally mandatory targets for the waterbody. That ruling was on Wednesday upheld by the appeal court.Penelope Gane, the head of practice at Fish Legal, said Reed could show a real commitment to restoring rivers and lakes. “What we need is meaningful action to clean up rivers,” she said. “Anything short of that will be a tacit admission that the government has abandoned its environmental ambitions for water.”Defra has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsRiversSteve ReedPollutionEnvironment AgencyCourt of appealNorth YorkshireWaternewsShareReuse this content"

This level of global heating above preindustrial times is well beyond the 2C limit agreed to by governments and would lead to catastrophicheatwaves,floods,economic strifeand other upheavals.TheMorgan Stanleyinvestor research forecasts, though, that multiplying heatwaves will provide a windfall for companies that provide air conditioning, and that the global market could grow by 41% to be worth $331bn by the end of this decade. The analysis outlines several dozen air conditioning businesses around the world that are likely to profit from a hotter world.“Progress on climate change is likely to fall short of net-zero targets,” the report states. “We expect cooling – critical to human health and productivity in many climates – to be a potent long-term growth theme.”The skepticism of top Wall Street firms over climate targets is shared bymany other analysts, includingat the United Nations, who have predicted that the Paris goals are wildly off-track due to persistently high greenhouse gas emissions.The parlous trajectory of the climate crisis has been underscored by the return ofDonald Trumpas US president. Trump has called climate change “a giant hoax”, withdrawn the US from the Paris treaty and set aboutdismantling environmental rulesdesigned to limit harmful pollution.Banks, too, have shown signs they are scaling back their climate concerns. Since December, the six biggest US banks – JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs –have all quit a group called the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which sets responsible banking practices to meet climate goals.“We are clearly seeing a broad retreat on climate from the finance sector,” said Paddy McCully, senior analyst at Reclaim Finance, a group that pushes financial firms to act on the climate crisis.“It is to a very large extent being influenced by Trump and his agenda of accelerating climate change, although also due to banks using Trumpism as an excuse to roll back commitments that they had never actually intended to keep.”Morgan Stanley’s investor research on air conditioning is “mind numbingly cynical”, McCully said. “Especially as it comes just months after they first weakened their decarbonization targets and then quit the Net ZeroBankingAlliance.”Morgan Stanley’s report does acknowledge that surging deployment of air conditioning, primarily in wealthier countries, is not a panacea in a hotter world. If powered by fossil fuels, air conditioning use itself causes more planet-heating emissions that will further raise global temperatures.“Morgan Stanley Research does not provide firm views, we assess evidence provided by experts such as those developed by the scientific community,” said Stephen Byrd, global head of sustainability research at Morgan Stanley.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I would instead suggest that we will see large volumes of capital deployed to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and cooling (among other products, such as smart power grids) would be one such category of increased capital allocation.”As the world warps from higher temperatures, some businesses have eyed opportunities such as shipping routes through a previously ice-bound Arctic Ocean. This motivation, as well as the valuable minerals being exposed for mining as ice retreats, is thought to be part of Trump’s rationalefor wanting to annex Greenland.“This is a bit like saying the quiet part out loud,” said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, about the banks’ forecasts. Wagner said that there is “lots of greenhushing”, the opposite of greenwashing, now occurring among corporations.“Indeed, the world won’t stay below 1.5C of warming, largely because we’re already there,” Wagner said of the Paris deal’s most ambitious stretch target. Last year was the first individual year, globally,to top 1.5C of heating.“And yes, that means that climate risks will get worse before they get better,” he said. “That much is clear.

But the data from theUK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme(UKBMS), in which volunteers scientifically count butterflies at more than 3,000 sites across the country, reveals that 31 of the native species are in long-term decline.The decline of the small tortoiseshell is mystifying scientists because the butterfly was once ubiquitous in gardens and its caterpillars feed on stinging nettles, an extremely common plant. The summer of 2023 was theworst on record for the small tortoiseshell, only for the butterfly to suffer a further decline last year.While conservationists have scorednotable successeswithreviving critically endangered butterfly speciesin recent decades, among those experiencing their worst ever years were species already listed as threatened onthe “red list” for British butterflies: thegrizzled skipper, small pearl-bordered fritillary and chalkhill blue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He said the conversations took place after “a couple of incidents of, unfortunately, theft of wire and cable around some of the power supply” – which had on one occasion affected the lines on a runway.Wicking criticised Heathrow for the speed of making a decision to turn to its alternative power supplies and the length of time the process took – claiming that Terminal 5 could have been partly operating much earlier.Woldbye said: “It became quite clear we could not operate the airport safely quite early in this process, and that is why we closed the airport.“If we had not done that, we would have had thousands of passengers stranded at the airport at high risk to personal injury … The risk of having literally tens of thousands of people stranded at the airport, where we have would have nowhere to put them, we could not process them, would have been a disastrous scenario.“Just because the lights were on doesn’t mean all the systems were working … We didn’t have CCTV or fire surveillance.”Asked if more flights could have entered Heathrow without full power at the airport, he replied: “We would be able to land aircraft … But we would then be leaving passengers on the runway, which would not be acceptable.”Wicking said, however, that the decision to close the airport for 24 hours “should have been constantly under review”, and that more inbound flights could have been processed with manual systems, including immigration controls. “We had checks in with Border Force during the day and they had resource and capability,” he said.He told the committee the cost of the closure to airlines was difficult to quantify but estimated it was in the range of £60m to £100m.Woldbye, however, said the cost of ensuring more resilient power backup than the current process would be far higher than airlines would accept. “If we were to refit, the best estimates of my engineers is that it would cost a billion pounds,” he said.He said the airport paid £135m for its power supply. “We rely – for resilience – on our suppliers,” he said. “We have contracted specifically a resilient setup which includes backup transformers and three different power lines … All of that is supposed to be resilient.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said SSEN “did not have visibility” of the airport’s internal setup, but added: “What I do know is that Network Rail was able to transfer automatically.”Woldbye told MPs he believed the process that was followed ensured safety and was correct for “an event as unlikely as this one. We are still at a stage when we don’t know why it happened.”Heathrow has commissioned a full review of the incident and its response, to be carried out by the independent director and former transport secretary Ruth Kelly.A Heathrow spokesperson said that the power supply issue Wicking referred to had “no relation to the North Hyde substation … We were well aware of that incident before Mr Wicking raised it. Our contingencies were stood up and the incident was resolved quickly.”Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportAirline industryAir transportTransportEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Jenrick called for Lord Justice Davis, the head of the Sentencing Council for England and Wales, to be sacked amida row over new sentencing guidelines.Speaking to parliament’s joint committee on human rights, Hermer said that “we are entering a dangerous moment in which not simply on social media but indeed on the floor of the House of Commons, people are attacking judges on a personal basis.“That is entirely unacceptable and creates a huge threat to the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.”Hermer told the committee that “we are at a juncture in history” where the rule of law faced “a whole range of challenges” in the UK and overseas.There have been tensions between ministers and some senior judges in recent months. In response to Hermer’s comments, Jenrick claimed that Hermer had “turned on his friend, the prime minister, for voicing perfectly legitimate criticisms about activist judges”. In February, Keir Starmerexpressed disagreement with a judge’s rulingin an immigration case concerning a Palestinian family who had applied to live in the UK through a scheme designed for Ukrainians.Responding to Kemi Badenoch, who said this ruling was “completely wrong”, Starmer said he agreed and that “it should be parliament that makes the rules on immigration”.This triggeredan intervention from the lady chief justice, Lady Sue Carr, the most senior judge in England and Wales, who said that she was “deeply troubled” by Starmer and Badenoch’s “unacceptable” remarks about the case.Separately this week, ministers announced legislation to overturn guidance from theSentencingCouncil intended to tackle bias during sentencing. The guidelines would have required magistrates and judges to consult a pre-sentence report before deciding whether to imprison someone of an ethnic or religious minority, or a young adult, abuse survivor or pregnant woman.Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, had strongly criticised the proposals and said there would “never be a two-tier sentencing approach under my watch”.In the Commons on Wednesday, Jenrick called for Davis to be sacked after he defended the guidelines.During the debate, another Conservative MP, John Hayes, said that all members of the Sentencing Council should resign, and a third Tory MP, Desmond Swayne, said that Carr should be “rebuked” for her “impertinence”.Hermer himselfhas faced criticism from some inside government, who have accused him of slowing down progress and taking an overly legalistic approach.At the committee on Wednesday the attorney general defended changes he made to the way government lawyers provide advice to ministers, which are said to have caused tensions. He insisted that the revised guidance amounted to a “change in tone” that would not delay government policy.“I had a very real concern on entering government as attorney that a practice had developed in which lawyers were being asked to advise ministers as to whether there was a respectable legal argument to support the policy,” he said. “But respectable legal argument means something is highly likely to be unlawful but not so bad you’d be struck off.”Hermer said the result was that “ministers were thinking it was respectable without realising it was highly likely to be unlawful”, and that the changes were intended to give ministers an “unvarnished assessment” of the legal risks of their policies.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsRobert JenrickUK criminal justiceSentencingEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The jury found him not guilty of causing or allowing Lexi’s death.Giving evidence in court, Wilband described how she had been in a relationship with Wheeler for about three years but Lexi was conceived with another man when they had separated.The court heard she faked a DNA test during her pregnancy, stating Wheeler was “100%” the “father” of her then unborn child. The word “father” was spelt incorrectly and he became suspicious.After Lexi was born, a genuine DNA test found Wheeler was not biologically related to the baby. In court, Wilband admitted faking the document, telling the jury: “I wanted him to be Lexi’s dad.”When asked about the night of the baby’s collapse on 12 April 2020, Wilband claimed Lexi had hurt herself while in a baby bouncer.Lexi was taken by ambulance to Gloucestershire Royal hospital before being transferred to Bristol children’s hospital, where she died on 18 April.Paramedics who went to the child’s aid noted that Wilband was rolling a cigarette and using her mobile telephone when answering questions. Wilband was asked by medical staff whether she would like to hold her baby before she was intubated but she declined. A staff nurse held Lexi’s hand throughout the night she died.During the trial, the jury heard that Wilband used to use cocaine while in bed, with Lexi in the Moses basket alongside her.Miranda Moore KC, representing Wheeler, suggested to Wilband that she had shaken her daughter. She replied: “My daughter was my life. I never killed my daughter, I am telling you.”Outside court, Det Insp Adam Stacey of Gloucestershire police, said: “Wilband told lie after lie after lie – right from Lexi’s conception, and all the way throughout the pregnancy.“These lies continued and were made to medical professionals trying to save Lexi’s life, to the police, and all the way through to her giving evidence in court.“The jury saw those lies for what they were. Lexi should be five years old now with her whole future ahead of her. She was shaken by someone who should have been protecting her, someone who should have put her safety and wellbeing above everything else.”In a statement, Wheeler’s family said: “Obviously we are relieved that this trial is over and Jack has been found not guilty on both counts. It has been a difficult five years. But we do not forget that a little girl he loved as his own has lost her life.”Wilband was granted conditional bail and will be sentenced on 22 May.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

We think that was the right priority.”If she had not raised taxes, Reeves said, it would have meant “further increases in NHS hospital waiting lists”, instead of which they have declined for the past five months.Asked by the Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin about the impact of her policies, Reeves added: “Other people would say, ‘no, don’t put more money into the NHS,’ and it is absolutely their right to say that … but you have to be honest, because if you want that extra money, you have to support the taxes to pay for it”.New research by the Resolution Foundation suggests that households will be on average £400 worse off in the coming tax year as a result of higher taxes and bills, including freezes to income tax thresholds, which drag more people into paying a higher rate.Adam Corlett, the thinktank’s principal economist, said: “The new tax year has arrived, and brings with it higher taxes, even larger bill increases, and benefits that aren’t keeping pace with the rising cost of living.”The Resolution Foundation is calling on the government to bring forward a planned 2% increase in the basic universal credit payment by six months, to this October, to help ease the burden.Business groups have warned about the risk of job losses caused by the NICs increase coming alongside the 6.7% increase to the national living wage for people aged 21 and over from this week.But the chancellor said there was little evidence so far of a significant downturn in the jobs market.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Williams suggested she was wearing a minidress at the time.“I don’t think it made any difference whether she’s wearing a minidress or not,” said Osborne. “The allegation is that Mr Clarke took a picture of her that had her underwear on, [and] it was fairly close up.”When Williams raised it, Osborne also said that whether Evelyn was drunk or not was irrelevant to her allegations against Clarke.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the Indian courts havenot granted his brother bail, despite the prosecutor’s failure to produce any credible evidence or witnesses in the Punjab court.Gurpreet said UK consular staff met his brother in jail on Tuesday and were told he had been put into solitary confinement with a 24-hour guard, adding no explanation had been given.He said: “I fear for his physical and mental welfare since he is being excluded from contact with all other prisoners. He has been in jail for seven years, acquitted and now he is being further punished. He is being mentally tortured and I am concerned something is going to happen to him. The aim is to break him.”Gurpreet added that a critical window of opportunity existed after the Punjab acquittal, in which the judge was damning about the quality of evidence assembled by the Indian prosecutors, to secure his brother’s release.He said the Foreign Office had to realise his brother was not being held to secure his conviction but to keep him in detention. “What is missing from the British government is political will. I am told the prime minister raised the case when he met the Indian external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, but I do not know what exactly they are raising, or how central it is to the conversations ministers are having.”‘It’s about political will’: is the Foreign Office failing Britons detained abroad?Read moreGurpreet said that what the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Patten had dismissed as “by the way diplomacy” was not enough to make India sense there would be consequences for the mistreatment of British nationals.He added: “The current prime minister is an ex-prosecutor, the current foreign secretary is an ex-lawyer and both should be well apprised of what double jeopardy means and how this can be applied.”Dan Dolan, the deputy executive director of the legal NGO Reprieve, said double jeopardy protected people from being put on trial twice for the same crime and was enshrined in international law and India’s constitution.Reprieve and Johal claim the eight other cases brought by the Indian National Investigation Agency are essentially duplicate cases, with no additional evidence provided, and all the evidence is based on torture.The Indian government denies torture has been used. The central allegation in all nine cases is that Johal transferred money to supposed co-conspirators, and that this was used to fund a series of attacks in Punjab between 2016 and 2017. The Indian authorities do not claim Johal was directly involved in any of these attacks.David Lammy, the foreign secretary, who met Gurpreet in November, has said he is willing to meet again but not for a further seven weeks, a timetable that Gurpreet says fails to understand the urgency of the crisis. “The window of opportunity is narrow, and he needs to meet a lot sooner. It is urgent,” Gurpreet said.Explore more on these topicsLawDavid LammyIndiaSouth and central AsiaSikhismReligionForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

You will see extra officers in the area during the coming days – if you have any concerns then please speak to them.”A woman said she carried a life ring to the Thames shoreline to try to save Kaliyah but was unable to find her.Kerry Benadjaoud, 62, told the PA news agency on Monday: “My neighbour next door, she was outside doing her garden and there was two little kids running, and they said ‘my friend’s in the water.’”A man told Benadjaoud that he had called the police, she said, adding: “But he said at the time he could see [the girl’s] hands going down.

Overlapping tracks suggest that the dinosaurs drank at the lagoon at about the same time.“The footprints are mostly worn, but there are some fantastic examples that preserve really exquisite features which showcase these dinosaurs to the max,” said Tone Blakesley, the research lead on the project at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s surprising they haven’t been found until now.”The most striking footprints are about 45cm long and belong to the three-toed megalosaur, a mid-Jurassic predator that sported sharp, curved claws. The sauropod footprints, which are round and slightly larger, had previously been mistaken for fish resting burrows.View image in fullscreenAn artist’s interpretation of what the meat-eating megalosaurs, right, and plant-eating sauropods might have looked like.Photograph: Tone Blakesley/PAUsing a drone, the scientists took thousands of overlapping images of the shoreline bordering the remote bay on the Trotternish peninsula. These were processed to reconstruct digital 3D models of the footprints. Their report ispublished in Plos One.“Rocks that date to the mid-Jurassic are very rare, which is annoying for us researchers because this was a time when dinosaurs were rapidly evolving into a variety of forms,” Blakesley said. “When we find dinosaur footprint sites like Prince Charles’s Point, we can look at how these dinosaurs interacted with their environment and how they were distributed as well.”The footprints were created as the dinosaurs ambled through the shallow water lagoon. Over millions of years, the prints became preserved in the vast, rippled sandstone platform that stretches out to sea today.“It looks like someone has pressed the pause button,” said Blakesley. “It’s a surreal feeling to see these footprints with my own eyes, to be able to put my hand in the sole of these footprints. You close your eyes and the tides wash back and you are in the mid-Jurassic. It’s a spine-tingling feeling.”‘It won’t end like Jurassic Park!’ The man who wants to bring the mammoth and dodo back to lifeRead moreResearchers discovered the first tracks at the site five years ago, but it has taken successive trips to uncover the full extent of the impressions preserved in the rock. On one recent visit, the team found what appeared to be a theropod footprint inside a sauropod trackway, suggesting the predator was walking in the larger beast’s footsteps. “There are definitely more footprints to be found,” said Blakesley.“It boggles my mind to think that when Bonnie Prince Charlie was being pursued by English troops, he might have been following the footprints of dinosaurs to safety on Skye,” said Steve Brusatte, a professor of palaeontology and evolution at Edinburgh. “He wouldn’t have known what a dinosaur was, as the word hadn’t been invented then, and of course he had many other more pressing things on his mind, but I do wonder if he looked down and saw these big holes in the rock with finger and toe impressions and wondered what they might be.”Explore more on these topicsScienceDinosaursFossilsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 and later recovered, after treatment with chemotherapy and trachea surgery that had reduced his ability to speak and breathe.Val Kilmer: an ethereally handsome actor who evolved into droll self-awareness | Peter BradshawRead moreKilmer died on Tuesday night in Los Angeles, surrounded by family and friends, Mercedes confirmed in an email to the Associated Press. He had been scheduled to appear on the red carpet at the Beverley Hills film festival that evening.The president of that film festival, Nino Simone, spoke of their shock at the news, particularly as Kilmer had only been confirmed to attend last weekend.Numerous actors and directors paid tribute to Kilmer on Wednesday. Writing on X, Cher said she would miss her “great friend”, who she called “funny, crazy and a pain in the ass”. Last year she told Howard Stern’s SiriusXM show she had been “madly in love” with him when they were romantically involved in the 1980s.Ron Howard said he was incredibly fortunate to collaborate with Kilmer, praising his “awesome range”, a sentiment echoed by Heat director Michael Mann. “I always marvelled at the range,” he said, “the brilliant variability within the powerful current of Val’s possessing and expressing character. After so many years of Val battling disease and maintaining his spirit, this is tremendously sad news.”Said Francis Ford Coppola on Instagram: “Val Kilmer was the most talented actor when in his High School, and that talent only grew greater throughout his life. He was a wonderful person to work with and a joy to know — I will always remember him.”“I thought he was a genius actor,” added his Bad Lieutenant co-star Nicolas Cage, “and I admired his commitment and sense of humour. He should have won the Oscar for The Doors.”Meanwhile te actorJosh Brolin wrote: “See ya, pal. I’m going to miss you. You were a smart, challenging, brave, uber-creative firecracker. There’s not a lot left of those. I hope to see you up there in the heavens when I eventually get there. Until then, amazing memories, lovely thoughts.”Born in Los Angeles in 1959, Kilmer was one of the youngest students ever admitted to the acting programme at the Juilliard School, aged 17. He started out as a stage actor and rose to prominence in the 1980s with his roles in movie comedies Top Secret! and Real Genius, before landing a role as Iceman in the 1986 box office smashTop Gun.With his star ascendant, he took the lead role in Ron Howard and George Lucas’s 1988 fantasy epic Willow, where he met his future wife – his co-star, Joanne Whalley, with whom he would have two children. The pair divorced in 1996.View image in fullscreenKilmer in The Doors.Photograph: Cinetext/Tristar/AllstarOliver Stone cast him as Jim Morrison in his biopic The Doors, and Kilmer also landed roles as Elvis Presley in True Romance and Doc Holliday in the western Tombstone. It was this performance that landed Kilmer the biggest role of his career, that of Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Forever. The film received mixed reviews but was a box office hit, and Kilmer became a huge star, able to demand millions of dollars for his roles.He did not return as the caped crusader for the next film in the series, Batman and Robin, and instead took roles as Simon Templar in a reboot of The Saint and oppositeMarlon Brandoin the poorly received The Island of Dr Moreau.After another box office disaster in 2000, Red Planet, Kilmer took roles in smaller films with a lower profile. In 2005 he was cast opposite Robert Downey Jr in Shane Black’s directorial debut, the crime comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang; in 2012 he starred ina one-man show Citizen Twain, in which he played the writer Mark Twain; and in 2017 he appeared briefly in Terrence Malick’s music-industry drama Song to Song. He returned to the Iceman role in 2022’s Top Gun: Maverick, in which his character has become the commander of the US Pacific fleet, with most of his lines delivered by being typed out on a phone.2:09A look back at some of Val Kilmer's most prominent roles – videoKilmer was well known for falling out with his directors and castmates on set.Joel Schumacher, who directed him in Batman Forever, said: “I pray I don’t work with [Kilmer] again … we had two weeks where he did not speak to me, but it was bliss.” Marlon Brando, his co-star in The Island of Dr Moreau, reportedly told him:“You are confusing your talent with the size of your paycheck”, while that film’s director, John Frankenheimer,was quoted as saying: “I don’t like Val Kilmer, I don’t like his work ethic and I don’t want to be associated with him ever again.”However, despite the feuds, his ability was respected. Even Schumacherlater said he considered Kilmer to have been the best Batman, while Irwin Winkler – Kilmer’s director on At First Sight – described working with him as a “wonderful experience”. “Some people expect an actor to be like a wooden Indian, to do what he’s told and never open his mouth,”Winkler added. “But Val has lots of great ideas and he should be listened to.”View image in fullscreenKilmer and Cruise in the original Top Gun.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyKilmer took part in Suzuki Method training; while filming Tombstone, he filled his bed with ice to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis, and while playing The Doors frontman, he wore leather pants all the time and asked his castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison.“I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed,” Kilmer said in Val, the 2021 documentary about his life and career. “And I am blessed.”View image in fullscreenKilmer and Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick (2022)Photograph: ParamountIn his later years, Kilmer became more engaged in politics, and said in 2009 thathe was considering running to be governor of New Mexico, where he lived.

Forecasters warned the storms could track over the same areas repeatedly and produce heavy rains and dangerous flash floods capable of sweeping cars away.Rain totaling up to 15ins (38cm) was forecast over the next seven days in north-eastern Arkansas, the south-east corner of Missouri, western Kentucky and southern parts of Illinois and Indiana, the weather service warned.“We’re potentially looking at about two months of rain in just a handful of days,” Thomas Jones, a weather service meteorologist in Little Rock, Arkansas, said Monday.Parts of Arkansas, west Tennessee, western Kentucky and southern Indiana were at an especially high risk for flooding, the weather service said.At least one tornado was spotted Tuesday night in Kansas. “Take cover now!” the weather service’s office in Wichita warned residents on the social platform X. No injuries were reported.Another tornado touched down in the north-eastern Oklahoma city of Owasso at about 6.40am Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service office in Tulsa. There were no immediate reports of injuries, but the twister heavily damaged the roofs of homes and knocked down power lines, trees, fences and sheds.Tornado warnings were also issued in Missouri on Wednesday. Authorities in eastern Missouri were trying to determine whether it was a tornado that damaged buildings, overturned vehicles and tore down utility poles, tree limbs and business signs Wednesday morning in and around Nevada, Missouri.The Missouri state highway patrol reported that the damage shut down a portion of US Route 54 in the city of about 8,300 people about 95 miles (153km/h) south of Kansas City, Missouri.Along with tornadoes, high winds with gusts of up to 50mph (80 km/h) were also expected across large parts of the midwest.The ominous forecast comes nearly two years to the day that an EF-3 tornado struck Little Rock, Arkansas. No one was killed, but that twister caused major destruction to neighborhoods and businesses that are still being rebuilt today.More than 90 million people are at some risk of severe weather in a huge part of the nation that stretches from Texas to Minnesota and Maine, according to the Oklahoma-based Storm Prediction Center.About 2.5 million people are in a rarely called “high-risk” zone. That area most at risk of catastrophic weather on Wednesday includes parts of west Tennessee including Memphis; north-east Arkansas; the south-east corner of Missouri; and parts of western Kentucky and southern Illinois.A tornado outbreak was expected Wednesday, and “multiple long-track EF3+ tornadoes, appear likely”, the Storm Prediction Center said. Tornadoes of that magnitude are among the strongest on the Enhanced Fujita scale, used to rate their intensity.In Michigan, crews worked to restore power after a weekend ice storm toppled trees and power poles. More than 135,000 customers in northern Michigan and 11,000 in northern Wisconsin were still without electricity Wednesday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.Heavy, wet snow also was forecast into Wednesday across the eastern Dakotas and parts of Minnesota.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherMissourinewsShareReuse this content"

Using his social media platform, X, Musk referred to it as “terrorism”.There are 13Tesladealerships in Italy, all managed by the parent company, the majority of them in Rome, but also in other cities including Florence and Milan.An interior ministry source said the circular was aimed at “raising awareness” of possible anti-Tesla protesters amid a global wave of vandalism in response to Musk’s political activities in the US. If needed, surveillance of dealerships would be increased, it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seven vehicles were set alight at a dealership in Ottersberg, Germany, on Saturday, and two Tesla stores in Sweden, one in the capital, Stockholm, and the other in the coastal city of Malmö, were vandalised with orange paint on Monday.Musk has nurtured close relations with European far-right party leaders including the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who in an interview in early January described him as “a brilliant man”.Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right League, a member of Meloni’s ruling coalition, expressed solidarity with Musk after the Rome incident.“Too much unjustified hatred against the Tesla car company,” Salvini wrote on X. “The season of hate and conflict must come to an end as soon as possible.

The tourism sector has been heavily affected and only major resorts have back up generators. Hospitals, schools and households have also struggled with regular interruptions to power supplies..Explainer: what will the withdrawal of USAid mean for the Pacific?Read moreOn Monday, Fiame warned the crisis could wipe off about 16% off the national economy this year due to “severe disruptions” to public services and economic activity.Business owner Filisitia Fa’alogo, who runs a small shop on the southern side of Upolu, is among those to suffer heavy losses. Fa’alogo told theGuardian she had just bought over US$500 worth of frozen goods when the power outages began more than two weeks ago.“Initially the ice was able to hold up the goods, but after the second day, I literally had to give the meat away to save it from spoiling,” Fa’alogo said.The loss meant she could not make a profit for the month, as she only sells basics to the local villages, such as milk, bread, butter and canned goods.“This is just outrageous, this is a bare necessity I need to run my village store,” she said.Fa’alogo is just one of many business owners who have suffered as a result of the failure of the power sector. More than 90% of businesses have experienced frequent outages, with 70% facing disruptions multiple times per week, according to a survey by the Samoa Chamber of Commerce and Industry conducted in mid-March. Firms reported equipment damage and significant revenue losses. More than half of the businesses reported losses exceeding $1,000 tala ($350) per incident.Power outages are not unusual in Samoa, but they are usually associated with cyclones. It is rare for them to occur island-wide and drag on for such a long period of time.The crisis has been caused by multiple technical issues, including the breakdown of key generators at the Fiaga power station on Upolu island, and a fault in a crucial underground transmission cableThese problems, compounded by ageing infrastructure and delays in acquiring replacement parts, led to widespread electricity outages across Upolu. At one point, the entire island was without power.The state of emergency declared on Monday will run for 30 days. Authorities have begun efforts to urgently restore power supplies and support affected homes and businesses. Full power restoration across Upolu is expected before the end of April. Permanent generators aren’t due to be ready for use until August.Pacific business sustainability expert Tupa’imatuna FotuoSamoa said the persistent power failures have harmed Samoa’s economy.“There is significant impact on business … continued disruptions can have long-term impacts for many in our community.”“While it’s welcome news that there is consideration for relief, such as importing generators, you need to think broader, not just relying on hydropower but incentivising other means of power generation nationally.”Explore more on these topicsSamoaPacific islandsAsia PacificEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

His office had earlier said he was “troubled” by the sentence. He also appeared open to the idea of a bill to change the way such sentences were handed down.Xavier Bertrand, the rightwing head of the Hauts-de-France region, said Bayrou should never have said he was “troubled” by Le Pen’s sentence. He told RTL radio that the prime minister and other politicians were “falling into a trap by Marine Le Pen: the trap of victimisation.Marine Le Penis not a victim of miscarriage of justice.

Klain replied: ‘Sir, when you look perplexed, people just think you’re perplexed. And this is our problem in this race.”Whipple’s book,Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History, will bepublishednext week. The Guardian obtained a copy.Biden isreportedlyplanning his own book but Whipple’s blockbuster is not even the first such volume to hit the shelves. This week saw the publication of Fight, by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, which also contains extensive reporting on Biden’s decline and Harris’sstruggleto win over party elites.Like Parnes and Allen, Whipple reports both sides of a campaign Trump won despite a criminal conviction, civil penalties including one related to an allegation of rape, and indictments over election subversion and retention of classified information.But Whipple focuses another harsh spotlight on Biden, an octogenarian president longbeset by questionsabout his fitness for office.Last week, Whippletold Politico: “I have fresh reporting on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis of Biden’s final days, and obviously his decline is a major part of the story.“I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.”In early 2024, as the campaign warmed up, Klain was among those who said he believed Biden was the right candidate to beat Trump a second time,tellingthe New York Times: “If I thought he wasn’t the right candidate to beat Donald Trump, I wouldn’t be for him running. But I think he is the right candidate.”Even after the disastrous debate, by his own telling to Whipple, Klain believed Biden should have stayed in the race – a statement that jars with Klain’s account of debate prep at Camp David.“At his first meeting with Biden in Aspen Lodge, the president’s cabin,” Whipple writes, Klain “was startled. He’d never seen him so exhausted and out of it. Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.“That evening Biden met again with Klain and his team, [Biden aides] Mike Donilon, Steve Richetti, and Bruce Reed. ‘We sat around the table,’ said Klain. ‘[Biden] had answers on cards, and he was just extremely exhausted. And I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he was. He was just very, very focused on his interactions with Nato leaders.’”Klain, Whipple writes, “wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of Nato instead of the US. ‘He just became very enraptured with being the head of Nato,’ he said. That wouldn’t help him on Capitol Hill because, as Klain noted, ‘domestic political leaders don’t really care what [Emmanuel] Macron and [Olaf] Scholz think.’”Klain, fellow aides and visitors including the film mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg tried to get Biden into shape. Two mock debates were organized, focusing on domestic policy.“The first was scheduled to last 90 minutes but Klain called it off after 45. The president’s voice was shot and so was his grasp of the subject. All he really could talk about was his infrastructure plan and how he was rebuilding America and 16 million jobs. He had nothing to say about his agenda for a second term.”Klain says Biden grew irritable, saying he would not make promises as he would be criticized for failing to deliver. Klain says he tried to persuade Biden to run on unfinished business, including his attempt to “subsidize state and local efforts to do childcare and bring down the cost to $20 a day. And you ought to try to fight for it again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It brings down costs for people. It’s responsive to inflation. It will bring more people into the workforce. It’s good economics. And you know this is something you’re for.”But “Biden didn’t want to talk about it” and “25 minutes into the second mock debate, the president was done for the day. ‘I’m just too tired to continue and I’m afraid of losing my voice here and I feel bad,’ he said. ‘I just need some sleep. I’ll be fine tomorrow.’ He went off to bed.”“The president was fatigued, befuddled, and disengaged,” Whipple writes. “Klain feared the debate with Trump would be a nationally televised disaster.”It was. On 27 June, Biden arrived at the Atlanta venue with minutes to spare – because, Klain said, “He was the president of the United States. They weren’t going to start without him.” Onstage, for two hours and six minutes, Biden stumbled, stared and mumbled.As described by Whipple, Jill Biden praised her husband’s performance but all others around the president could see “something was terribly wrong”. Whipple quotes an unnamed close friend of Biden who took a call from Valerie Biden Owens. The president’s sister and longtime adviser was “so angry, she was practically incoherent”. The same friend reports a later call from Biden, laughing at his predicament and sounding like the senator and vice-president of old.Biden aides argued dropping out would bring ‘mistake’ of Harris, book claimsRead more“Where didthatvoice go?” the friend wondered … “Where didthatguy with that voice go? What the fuck happened tothisguy?”To Whipple, that was a question “on which the political fate of the nation would turn”.Eventually, Biden bowed to reality. On 21 July, Klain took a call from Jeff Zients, his successor as chief of staff. Biden was out. Despite the debate disaster, the news was a “gut punch” to Klain.“Jeff, that’s too bad,” he said. “I think that’s a mistake. I think this was an avoidable tragedy.”Harris faced opposition from Democratic grandees including Obama and Nancy Pelosi, but wrapped up the nomination by August. In early September, Klain gave Whipple his interview. With the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate, Harris mounted an energetic campaign. In November, she lost to Trump.Explore more on these topicsBooksJoe BidenBiden administrationKamala HarrisDemocratsUS elections 2024US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But US immigration officers argued the crown tattoos on his wrists were proof he was part of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang, despite Hernández Romero telling them he was not. Last month, he was flown from Texas to a maximum-security prison inEl Salvador, a facility that his lawyer said was “one of the worst places in the world”. His removal comes as the administration undertakes what Trump has pledged would be a mass deportation campaign.‘He is not a gang member’: outrage as US deports makeup artist to El Salvador prison for crown tattoosRead moreIn a 29 March episode of his popular podcast, Rogan, whoendorsedTrump for president last year, said it was “horrific” that “people who aren’t criminals are getting lassoed up and deported”.“This is kind of crazy that that could be possible,” Rogan said. “And that’s bad for the cause. The cause is let’s get the gang members out – everybody agrees – but let’s not let innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs.”The criticism was notable as prominent conservatives have generally been reluctant to speak out against the Trump administration.TheJoe RoganExperience has for years been one of Spotify’s top podcasts. Rogan, a former mixed martial arts commentator and comedian, has amassed a large following and garnered much attention and criticism for his controversial guests including Kanye West, Elon Musk and Alex Jones.Rogan himself has expressed support for Trump’s crackdown and in last week’s episode was highly critical of Joe Biden’s immigration policies, arguing an “open border” brought criminals into the US. In the same episode, he suggested pro-Palestinian protests at US universities had been paid for, and suggested that people were being paid to protest against Tesla.But Rogan argued that conducting deportation operations recklessly would cost Trump supporters.“If you want compassionate people to be on board with you, you can’t deport gay hairdressers seeking asylum – that’s fucking crazy – and then throw them in an El Salvador prison,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationJoe RoganDonald TrumpUS politicsRadioPodcastingnewsShareReuse this content"

Humanitarian agencies urged other countries to increase aid before the monsoon rains.Close to the epicentre, in thedevastated cities of Mandalayand Sagaing, traumatised survivors slept in the street, with the stench of corpses trapped under the rubble permeating the disaster zone. Water, food and medicine are in short supply, and the monsoon could hit in May.View image in fullscreenA woman resting at a temporary roadside shelter in Mandalay.Photograph: Nyein Chan Naing/EPA“The devastating impact of Friday’s earthquake is becoming clearer by the hour – this is a crisis on top of a crisis for Myanmar, where the humanitarian situation is already dire,” said Arif Noor, the Myanmar country director for the humanitarian agency Care.“Rescue teams are still recoveringthose trapped under the rubble, and hospitals are overwhelmed. The physical and mental scars of this catastrophe will last for decades.”Friday’s powerful quake is the latest in a succession of blows for the impoverished country of 53 million, which has been plagued by a civil war since the military seized power in a 2021 coup.‘It’s beyond description’: Bodies pile up in mass graves as Myanmar grapples with quake tollRead moreThe junta said on Wednesday that it was declaring a temporary ceasefire until 22 April to facilitate relief efforts, a day after armed resistance groups opposed to military rule declared unilateral temporary ceasefires.In its nightly news bulletin on Tuesday, the state-controlled MRTV quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying the military had halted its offensives but that unspecified minority ethnic armies were planning to exploit the disaster. “The military is aware they are gathering, training and preparing to attack,” it said, quoting the general as saying at an event to raise funds for quake victims: “We consider it as attacking us and will respond accordingly.”View image in fullscreenPeople bathing in the Irrawaddy River in front of a collapsed bridge in Sagaing.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesThe UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said: “We must act swiftly to provide relief before the upcoming monsoon season, which, of course, will even worsen this horrendous crisis.”In addition to those killed, more than 4,500 people were injured and 441 remained missing, according to Min Aung Hlaing. “Among the missing, most are assumed to be dead. There is a narrow chance for them to remain alive,” he said in a speech.Some agencies say the unofficial death toll could be as high as 10,000.Aftermath of the Myanmar earthquake – a visual guideRead moreUN agencies said hospitals were overwhelmed and rescue efforts hindered by infrastructure damage and the civil war.Julie Bishop, the UN special envoy for Myanmar, urged all sides to immediately cease fire, permit humanitarian access and ensure aid workers are safe. “Continuing military operations in disaster-affected areas risks further loss of life,” she said in a statement.Residents and representatives of Myanmar’s exiled opposition National Unity Government (NUG) have accused the junta of continuing to drop bombs in the wake of the disaster, and ofblocking emergency aidto areas that are beyond the military government’s control.1:32'We have to go on': Bangkok pushes on with quake rescue despite 'no signs of life' – video“[On Monday], five bombs were dropped around Nwe Khwe village. Although there were no casualties from that, the public is already traumatised by the earthquake,” said Ye Lay, 21, from Chaung-U, a town in the region of Sagaing.“Because of the earthquake damage people are staying outside their homes, and when bombs are dropped, they have to take shelter in trenches,” she said. “If an earthquake strikes, we can’t run away, so people are experiencing a profound sense of insecurity.”Amnesty International said it had received testimony corroborating reports of airstrikes near areas where quake recovery efforts were focused. “You cannot ask for aid with one hand and bomb with the other,” said Amnesty’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.The junta has declared a week of national mourning, with flags to fly at half mast on official buildings until 6 April “in sympathy for the loss of life and damages”.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarEarthquakesAsia PacificNatural disastersSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Globally the bird is classed as vulnerable to extinction because of hunting and habitat loss.Every year it flies from sub-Saharan Africa across the continent ofEuropeto breed in the UK and other northern European countries in summer, and in some countries, such as Spain and Italy, people shoot them for sport during their migration.Wild bird numbers continue ‘alarming’ decline in UK, Defra figures showRead moreBut after a temporary ban three years ago on the annual shoot of the migratory birds as they pass through France, Spain and Portugal, there has been a remarkable25% increasein the bird’s western European population, which includes the 2,000 individuals in England.According to the BirdLife International charity, the data shows that bans on hunting are successful in boosting populations. In the western flyway of Spain, France, Portugal, and north-westItaly, the dove has started to recover. But in the central-eastern flyway of Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Malta, Romania and Cyprus, where hunting bans have not been properly enforced, no recovery has been observed.Barbara Herrero, the senior nature conservation policy officer at BirdLife Europe, said: “The turtle dove did its part. Left alone, it started to recover. But governments failed to uphold their end of the deal. Instead of fixing weak enforcement and protecting habitats, they’re rushing to lift the ban. This is reckless and shortsighted. We know where this path leads – straight back to the brink. The European Commission should have stood firm and kept the moratorium.”European hunters say efforts to bolster turtle dove numbers have paid off, and argue they have a strong cultural and economic attachment to hunting them.Massimo Buconi, the president of the ItalianHuntingFederation, said turtle doves have traditionally been used to open the Veneto hunting season, describing the celebrations as “an important day that is celebrated like the first day of the football season”.“Of course, we eat the doves,” he added. “Hunting in Italy has always been closely linked to the kitchen.”InSpain, where the “maximal harvest” of turtle doves under the new recommendations exceeds 100,000, the bird is classified as game because it can be hunted sustainably and serves a social, traditional, economic, culinary or cultural purpose, said Alejandro Martínez from the Royal Spanish Hunting Federation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They believe these conditions have been met and will therefore allow 1.5% of the turtle dove population to be killed.The minutes read: “There was consensus (with the exception of Estonia and BirdLife) to reopen hunting with the 1.5% quota in the western flyway. Meanwhile, the reaction of the birds’ population to the hunting take will need to be closely monitored in the next years.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentBirdsEuropean UnionHuntingAnimalsWildlifeEuropeShareReuse this content"

His finest hour as an actor came in Shane Black’s comedy action thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang in 2005, when he was quite superb as the camp private investigator Gay Perry Shrike: a gloriously sleek, plump performance which was transparently – and outrageously – based on Tom Ford. If only Kilmer could have started his acting life with that bravura performance, and shown the world what he could do. Instead, and at a crucial stage in his career, he was trapped in the body and face of a staggeringly beautiful young man.View image in fullscreenKilmer in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto Ltd/AllstarHe could somehow never quite persuade Hollywood to accept him as a leading man and above-the-title player in the mould of his Top Gun contemporaryTom Cruise, who in 1986 played Pete “Maverick” Mitchell to Val Kilmer’s Tom “Iceman” Kazansky. As the 80s and 90s rolled by, Kilmer never ascended to the league of Cruise, Hanks, Clooney and Pitt. Medication for the illness he latterly suffered can’t have helped, and it is a great sadness that fate never allowed him to mature in the same way as, say, Kurt Russell.It is a great sadness that fate never allowed him to mature in the same way as, say, Kurt RussellIn the mid-90s, Kilmer had a real shot at mainstream stardom. He took over from Michael Keaton in the role of the caped crusader inBatmanForever, a film which performed very respectably at the box office but which was received coolly by the critics on the grounds of its sunnier, goofier style, closer to the 60s TV show. This was in an era when superhero movies did not cultivate the Comic Con fanbase in the way they do now, although it is not clear that DC fans would have taken Val Kilmer to their hearts. Kilmer also played Simon Templar in The Saint, the classy sub-Bond caper made famous on the British small screen by the young Roger Moore. To this, the reaction was a resoundingmeh.View image in fullscreenKilmer as Jim Morrison in The Doors.Photograph: Allstar Picture LibraryKilmer however made a powerful, even stunning impression in other roles. He was an almost ethereally handsome hero in Willow in 1988, a fantasy adventure planted in relatively stony soil (this being an era before Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones made fantasy a big important genre). A frustrating non-breakthrough came three years later when he was cast in the difficult, unlucky role of Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone’s The Doors, but the director encouraged an interpretation heavy on the preeningly self-destructive and unsympathetic “legend” of Morrison, the iconic rock star heading for an obese drug-addled crisis; the American life with no second act. In George P Cosmatos’s acclaimed western Tombstone in 1993, Kilmer got respect for his performance as the tubercular gunslinger, drinker, womaniser and card-player Doc Holliday, and almost stole the picture from Russell as Wyatt Earp. It was the Holliday performance which got him his chance at superhero glory.Val review – unusual doc offers fractured portrait of actorRead moreKilmer also played a supporting role in the classic Michael Mann action thriller Heat in 1995 as Chris Shiherlis, an armed crew member working for the legendary villain Neil MacCauley, played by Robert De Niro. Here, sadly, Kilmer had no opportunity to upstage the main players Pacino and De Niro, whose alpha-gorilla face-off is epitomised by the great coffee-shop scene. Could Kilmer have taken either of those two leads? Well, it was not to be.Anyone wanting to see the very best of Kilmer should get hold of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and thrill to his wonderfully funny, seductive performance as Perry, the LA dude in gorgeous suits who is sexier and savvier than anyone else on screen: gay or straight, law-breaking or law-abiding. He even managed to make his fleshiness look sensual, with a droll and witty self-awareness. In his autumn years, and all too briefly, Kilmer showed us his real star quality.Explore more on these topicsVal KilmerTop GunTom CruiseBatmanOliver StoneWesternscommentShareReuse this content"

According to the star, he was forced to hear it so many times at the height of his fame that the mere sound of it made him feel miserable.“I’ll be really honest, there was a time for quite a while that just hearing the theme song would really … uggh,” he said during an appearance on Matt Lucas and David Walliams’ Making a Scene podcast.“You know what I mean? I just had that reaction. I just had heard it so many times. Any time you’d go on a show or a talkshow or an interview, that would be your intro song. So I just didn’t have the greatest response to it.”The star’s dislike of The Rembrandts’ I’ll Be There for You came during a period of his life when he also struggled with the level of fame he earned from playing Ross Geller. According to the actor, he can date the last time he was able to inconspicuously appear in public to 1994.“Jim Burrows [the director] took the cast to Vegas … this was before we were on the air or anything. We were walking through the casino at one point, and he said to us, remember this moment, it’s the last time you’re going to be able to walk through a casino like this – basically, with total anonymity.”For Schwimmer, this was far from a welcome development. “The moment that I realised Jim Burrows was right, I was at LAX … trying to catch a flight. I’m not one of those actors that has an entourage with me. It’s me, that’s it. I just go solo,” he said.“So, I’m going through … I hear ablood-curdlingscream. I was genuinely frightened. I thought someone was being stabbed or something. And a group of girls come and like – like literally just scream and grab me. And they won’t let me go … I mean, it was terrifying.“It took me a long time to get adjusted to that kind of fame. You had three cars following you everywhere you went, staked outside your house. You had absolutely no privacy ever.”The star’s fondness for hisFriendscareer has, however, improved in recent years – largely thanks to his daughter.“I never watched the show after we finished it. For me, it’s like: ‘I did it. I’m moving on.’ Then my kid discovered it around age nine or something, and started watching it. And I’d be making breakfast or whatever, and I’d hear my kid’s laughter. My whole relationship to that song and to the show changed again.”Explore more on these topicsFriendsDavid SchwimmerTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

I was in France at the weekend to check out theParis Noir exhibitionat the Pompidou Centre, an odyssey through the generations of Black artists from across the world who found a complicated sanctuary in the city. This was supplemented with a walking tour on the life of the artist Beauford Delaney, guided by the companyEntrée to Black Paris, and finished off with a mind-blowingly delicious Senegalese dinner. Yes, I’m trying to make you jealous.In depth: A voyage to Paris NoirView image in fullscreenParis Noir features the work of 150 artists of African heritage.Photograph: Luc Castel/Getty ImagesYou’re invited intoParis Noirby the frank, sobering gaze of its lead exhibition image: a self-portrait by the South African artistGerard Sekotocompleted in 1947. A modernist, expressionist work with bold, contrasting colours seeming to convey unease, reflection and solemnity, Sekoto painted it days before travelling to London as a self-imposed political exile from South Africa. That year, he would arrive in Paris where he faced difficult living conditions,finding employment as a jazz pianistand singer of South African melodies and Negro spirituals at the nightclub l’Échelle de Jacob (Jacob’s ladder).Of the 150 Black artists across 350 works exhibited, many of them have stories like Sekoto’s – coming from the US, Caribbean, South America andAfricato find an artistic refuge in Paris. The scope of the exhibition is expansive, an excavation of artistic movements from Afro-Atlantic surrealism to Parisian syncretism. There’s paraphernalia from Présence Africaine, the pan-African culture magazine founded by the Senegalese writer and editor Alioune Diop in the 1940s (to which Sekoto contributed), theological meditations in the Ivorian sculptor Christian Lattier’s 1957 work Le Christ, and subversions of US racial stereotypes in advertising and comics abstracted into a collage by the French-Haitian artist Hervé Télémaque.What emerges from this vast collection is a beautiful sense of the Black Atlantic. Of artists and writers and thinkers pouring in from across the globe, finding a haven in which aesthetic expressions, debates and dialogues were forged in a world contending with decolonisation through pro-independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean as well as western civil rights struggles. They often documented these times: Bob Thompson depicted US lynchings and the violent quashing of civil rights protests; Sekoto covered the tragic revolutionaries in Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia).View image in fullscreenA detail from The Struggle, 1963, by Bob Thompson.Photograph: Courtesy of the Michael Rosenfeld GalleryBut political art was not only of the world outside France. In May 1967, in response to a racist attack, riots broke out in Guadeloupe, a Caribbean island that morphed from a colony to an overseas department. Protesters wereviolently suppressed by French police, who opened fire on striking workers in the economic capital, Pointe-à-Pitre. In 1975, the French Guianese artist José Legrand painted a photorealistic diptych of a scene from the demonstrations.In this Parisian Black Atlantic, the refining of method and a collaborative, artistic corpus flourish. Networks and friendships are formed. Black artists enter one another’s orbits and are moved to create even greater works. In the 1990s, the Senegalese artist As M’Bengue created a visual language in his paintings, with its graffiti, graphic art and anti-capitalist social criticism, inspired by the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, whom he had met inParisin 1988. Equally, the abstract, impressionist works of Ed Clark, which includes an untitled painting of three bold strokes created by a “big sweep” technique, are inspired by the works of his friend Beauford Delaney.If Sekoto is the face of the Paris Noir exhibition, then Delaney is its beating heart. The first piece in your line of sight when you enter the show is his 1968 painting Street Scene (Paris), a sunny, hazy vision of the city through thick, swirling yellow brushstrokes applied using his signature impasto technique, reminiscent of the style of Vincent van Gogh. Tennessee-born Delaney features in all corners of the exhibition, his work relevant to discussions of abstraction, representation, political resistance and portraiture.View image in fullscreenStreet Scene (Paris), painted by Delaney in 1968, © Estate of Beauford Delaney.Photograph: Centre Pompidou/Joseph BanderetDelaney’s life was fascinating but tragic, as I learn from Monique Y Wells ofEntrée to Black Paris, which provides guided walking tours of Black Parisian history, culture and contemporary life (and which I cannot recommend enough). Wells takes me on a stroll through Montparnasse, a neighbourhood steeped in history.As Wells tells me, Henry Ossawa Tanner, often described as the first famous African American painter, came to live in Paris in the late 19th century, which became a draw for other African American artists to arrive. After the second world war, US legislation provided a package of benefits including education funding, low-interest loans and low-cost mortgages for returning veterans to readjust to civilian life and access opportunities. As such, Montparnasse received a wave of African Americans travelling to Paris to attend art schools. Though Delaney was not a veteran, it was this pre-established enclave that he was welcomed into when he moved to Paris on the invitation of his friend James Baldwin in 1953.Wells tells me that Montparnasse was “in effect a slum” with ramshackle properties – meaning that poor artists such as Delaney could afford to live and create there. There were a number ofbouillons, inexpensive restaurants, that Delaney would frequent, such as the Les Mille Colonnes. Wells also takes me to the site of La Bohème, a former club exclusively for white GIs who had imposed their racist attitudes on to post-second world war French proprietors. It was eventually taken over by Buttercup Powell, the girlfriend of the musician Bud Powell, who transformed the premises into Buttercup’s Chicken Shack - a space where musicians and artists could eat cheaply, and where the Trinidadian jazz pianist Hazel Scott played.In the Paris Noir exhibition, the affectionate relationship between Delaney and Baldwin is honoured. As Black gay men, with Delaneystruggling with acceptance of his sexuality, their friendship was especially important in light of the hardships and social pressures they faced. Next to a Delaney painting of Baldwin is a quote by the Giovanni’s Room author: “I learned about light from Beauford Delaney: the light contained in everything, in every surface, in every face.” Delaney created more than a dozen works featuring or inspired by Baldwin, presenting him in different modes – from the majestic intellectual thinker to the compassionate source of warmth and intimacy he had come to know so well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His textures seem to capture sound through image: he uses yellow impasto brushes to paint the contralto and civil rights figure Marian Anderson, reminiscent of Byzantine iconography. As the exhibition text reads, the portrait “vibrates like a strange music”.The tragic details of the artist’s life that I learned on the walking tour added a poignancy to his works. As Wells tells me, Delaney lived in poverty and struggled with mental illness for much of his life. He spent the final years before his death in 1975 in hospital “for the insane” .Much like Delaney is threaded throughout the exhibition, he is also felt everywhere in this corner of Paris. There are numerous plaques for residences and restaurants he frequented, and so many cafés he would sit outside for hours, people watching and doodling - Le Dôme, La Select, La Coupole. At the end of the weekend I’m left with a sense that Paris, as a crossroads for the meeting of Black artists and cultures, has a strong claim for being one of the great Black diasporic cities – something Monique Wells tells me is under-discovered, and continues to surprise people.I finished my time in the French capital with a visit toWaly-Fay restaurant, which serves traditional Senegalese cuisine, and ate one of the best meals of my life – fish pèpè soup, suya skewers breaded in cassava flour and chicken yassa, washed down with a hibiscus drink. I wondered about the Black artists of today who come through here, making plans for radical work and sharing ideas over incredible food.Paris Noiris at the Pompidou Centre until 30 June.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsParisThe Long WaveExhibitionsFranceArtPaintingAfricanewslettersShareReuse this content"

It was the Nintendo livestream we’ve been waiting for:a deep dive into the new consoleafter so much speculation. Sure, the Switch 2 is the company’s first real hardware sequel – an updated and spruced-up version of its predecessor rather than a radical new piece of kit. But the updates are the intriguing part.Naturally, we’re getting a larger (7.9-inch, to be precise) screen that displays in full HD at 1080p; but we’re also getting re-thought Joy-Con controllers that now click to the console via strong magnets rather than those fiddly sliders we all put on the wrong way. The buttons are larger, too, so adults will be able to play Mario Kart with some semblance of skill. But the main new feature for the controllers is a new rollerball that enables each one to operate as a mouse. This will allow for new point-and-click features and some interesting control options. I like that they showed this off with a wheelchair basketball game, where you slide the controllers a long a surface to mimic pushing the wheels.View image in fullscreenThe Nintendo Switch 2.The new Mario Kart game, Mario Kart World, looks rather nice. Perhaps taking inspiration from the likes of Forza Horizon and Test Drive Unlimited, it offers an open world to drive around, and, as well as circuit races, there will be endurance competitions where you drive from one side of the map to the other. According to the trailer shown during the livestream, 24 drivers can take part in each race, the most in the history of the series. There’s even a free-roam mode that lets you explore wherever you like, and take scenic drives with friends.“With friends” was definitely the theme of the stream. A new C button on the Joy-Con opens up the GameChat facility, which lets you start a group discussion with friends and family who also own Switch 2 consoles; it even has a video chat option if you also buy the Switch 2 camera. Like a sort of candy-coloured version of Zoom, your pals appear along the bottom of the screen as you play a game and you can all chat, even if you’re playing different things. Several of the trailers shown during the presentation suggested that video footage of your friends would even be incorporated into the game itself. This is whereNintendoalways does best: finding new ways for you to embarrass yourself and/or confuse and delight elderly relatives.View image in fullscreenDonkey Kong: Bananza on the Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoWas this a knockout victory for Nintendo? Well, there were alotof game announcements, but we didn’t get a big new 3D Mario adventure – although those do sometimes come a little while after launch. Also, fans are already tutting about game prices. While the machine is launching at an acceptable £395.99 (or £429.99 bundled with Mario Kart World), it looks like Mario Kart World will retail for £75. It’s a lot, but then Mario Kart 8 lasted for the entire lifespan of the Switch and most owners got hundreds of hours of entertainment out of it.The pre-order process, which opens on 8 April, is going to be interesting. Scalpers turned the launches of the Xbox Series X and PS5 into an ugly and expensive drama, with Sony’s machineturning up for sale at $2,000at one point thanks to limited availability.Nintendo is good at joy, and this looks like a truly lovely machine. But in an economic climate far from joyful, fans (and their parents) will be watching pre-order and sales figures very closely over the next few long weeks.What to playView image in fullscreenTough cerebral challenges … Rosewater.Photograph: Grundislav GamesI’ve been a sucker for western adventure games ever since I played Accolade’s classic Law of the West for the Commodore 64, so it’s lovely to see a newcomer in town.Rosewateris a steam punk-infused point-and-click puzzler following would-be journalist Harley Leger, who arrives in the titular frontier town for a job at the local newspaper but instead gets embroiled in a treasure hunt.Created by GrundislavGames, it’s a spiritual successor to the studio’s 2018 title Lamplight City, but you can come to this one fresh.

A lot of people have forgotten it did actually get a Wii-U release, though, and it was … OK? An interesting read, though.The new industry site Games Businesshas an interviewwith Alain Tascan, the head ofNetflix games. He sees Wii-style family TV games as the future for the platform: “For party games, I believe we can give instant fun, using the phone as a very innovative controller. On every phone you have a gyroscope, you have a microphone, you have a speaker, you have a touchscreen … if you give that to creative people, what do they do? Whether you’re alone, or with two people, or 20 people, why not? Can we do something really engaging?” Um, yes you can – as Sony showed several years ago with its PlayLink technology for PlayStation 4. Sadly, that initiative was undersupported, despite having some brilliant games. Maybe Netflix will hang in there a little longer.As a fan of weird mid-1990s horror games, I was very pleased to see Christian Donlanwriting for Eurogamerabout Harlan Ellison’s twisted terror adventure,IHave No Mouth and I Must Scream.

Does it exist?”My equally concise answer is: It’s complicated. It depends on how we interpret the term.My copy of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines counterculture as: “A way of life opposed to that usually considered normal.” That could almost embrace the entire independent game development community, but we can get more specific.Perhaps the hyper-challenging games of Bennett Foddy are countercultural because they are deliberately not intuitive to control. Or perhaps theFlatgame scene, in which developers create deliberately simple games with limited interactivity, is countercultural because it challenges the ideas that video games need cutting-edge visuals and a strong challenge component.MaybeRobert Yang’s gamessuch as The Tearoom and Hurt Me Plenty are counter-cultural because they challenge the heteronormative orthodoxy of the mainstream industry. As ever with this subject, I defer to the developer and writer Anna Anthropy, whose brilliant bookRise of the Videogame Zinestersmakes a compelling and detailed case for the existence of a global video game counterculture, existing happily for years on the periphery.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterNintendoNintendo SwitchGames consolesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We go from light to dark and back again, from room to room, and constant shifts in tempo and register, swerving from one medium to another. Along the way, we keep meeting the artist. Atkins drawn in coloured pencil, pensive in profile. Atkins as half-man, half-spider, splayed across the paper. Here’s his naked foot, drawn monstrously huge, and a hand clenching. He’s the author of his own descriptive wall texts, a collector of lists and, most pungently of all, the digitally tweaked persona who appears and reappears in the various guises of his CGI-avatar. One of which, early on in the exhibition, is swallowed by a sinkhole, along with his Ikea-filled apartment, but not before we have discovered rather too much about the state of his mind and the grim things people get up to in the privacy of their homes.‘My brain reaches for morbidity’: inside the unsettling world (and 700 Post-it notes) of artist Ed AtkinsRead moreThere’s so muchstuffin Atkins’s art, so much weirdness and generosity, so much bleakness and humour. A curtain opens on an empty stage and things begin to fall from above. A bed, stepladders, books, cardboard boxes, an anchor on its chain, bricks, several large tuna, bones, scatter cushions, skulls. Things pile up, they bounce, they get crushed; other things twirl in freefall, freeze mid-air or swipe into digital oblivion. Even gravity has glitches. But the cartoon rain, the flashes of lightning and the fall of pixelated snow keep the action moving. As I watch, I hear a spooky voice say: “My proper name is death.”Where did that come from? I never did find out, in the hours and hours I spent here, among all the sound leakage, drifting from room to room. A lot gets subsumed along the way through Atkins’ exhibition. The pleading, reproachful eyes of a borzoi sighthound; the plaintive unaccompanied renditions of Randy Newman songs, and all that kerfuffling and crashing, the film about the sandwiches, and the quiet, nearly blank fields of the embroideries, with their tiny sewn words. And what of the young lad who runs endless circuits through a bucolic landscape, as though he’s trapped in an animated medieval manuscript? And now the 468 repetitions of the same note that Atkins plays on an upright piano, in his performance of Swiss composer Jürg Frey’s 2001 composition Klavierstück 2. It all adds up, but to what?Pungent … Ed Atkins at Tate BritainEncumbered by a Lycra motion-capture suit and gloves, and with an iPhone braced to his head to record and track his face and hands, Atkins sat at the piano to perform Frey’s spare, exacting composition. The version of Atkins on the screen, performing, is a largely faithful, nearly seemless digital representation of the artist. Homing in on his face, on fingers playing and lingering above the keyboard, on feet at the pedal, on his expression and his concentration, we see none of the gubbins that were used to record him. We hear his breaths and snufflings and quiet groans along with the music, and think we perceive the turbulence of the player’s emotions, and catch him counting time, although the being at the piano is a digital model, a not-quite-real apparition, in whose expression I imagine I see feeling. As the end credits scroll, we read that Atkins finished making this video “in great sadness”. His expression, in the small photograph that slides down the screen beneath the text seems to confirm this. But where and to whom or to what does that sadness belong, and is my own sadness, as a response to the music, or at least to the video, appropriate?View image in fullscreenIt all adds up … Pianowork 2 by Ed Atkins.Photograph: Ed Atkins/Cabinet Gallery, London; dépendance, Brussels; Galerie Isabella Bortolozzi, Berlin and Gladstone Gallery, New YorkHere he is again, talking to his mother on the phone. Their conversation is real enough, intimate and warm, though at odds with the slightly soiled, avuncular gameshow host appearance of the Ed Atkins projected before us (note the grubby spectacles, and the meaty hand that raises a glass that isn’t there to his lips). The scene is projected on to the exterior back wall of a cavernous and empty plywood box that fills most of the gallery. This guy’s an off-the-shelf digital stand-in for Atkins. Only his voice seems real. Another of the models for this scene, and for the entirely digital set (including the cigarette smouldering in an ashtray), is the famous last television interview with screenwriter and playwright Dennis Potter, recorded in 1994,two months before Potter’s death.If we get snagged up on all the references and the details – the wall texts, the embroideries, the posters and the postcards, the live TV giving us the news on Sky (luckily it is streaming on mute), we’ll never get to the end of it. You could spend days in here, lingering, moving on, backtracking, getting cloistered among the racks of opera-house costumes. I keep trying to find the thread, then losing it again. Which is all part of the pleasure of Atkins’ work. He also has a great capacity to surprise, to enmesh us and keep us rooted, even on a tiny scrap of silent film, a sequence from Dimitri Kirsanoff’s 1926 Ménilmontant, that Atkins has had colourised and added Foley sound to, so that we can finally hear the old man in the film chewing on his bit of bread, and the sausage he is paring with his knife, wordlessly passing scraps to the young, starving mother who has found herself beside him on the park bench. What a tender, almost real moment this is. For all its artifice, it is like touching a wound.View image in fullscreenLight to dark and back again … Children by Ed Atkins, 2020-ongoing.Photograph: Ed Atkins/Cabinet Gallery, London.Coming towards the end of the exhibition, Atkins’ most recent work, made with writer Steven Zultanski, jettisons the use of digital beings entirely. The video Nurses Come and Go, But None for Me is over two hours long. ActorsToby Jonesand Saskia Reeves play couple Peter and Claire. Claire ushers an audience of young people (these too may be actors) into a large, comfortable room where Peter reads Sick Notes, a diary kept by Atkins’s father, Philip, during the six months between his diagnosis with kidney cancer and his death in 2009. Enormously affecting, spirited, candid, a sometimes funny and frequently harrowing account of physical deterioration, Philip Atkins’ diary is leavened by his mental fortitude and stoicism. As we listen and watch, the camera drifts and alights too. Claire – whom I take as a surrogate for Atkins’ mother – sits apart, smoking in the corner. There’s Peter’s clumpy shoes, and his troubled expression as he turns the loose-leaf pages. The diary is upsetting for some members of the on-screen audience, and all the more affecting for being read aloud by Jones. Towards the end, following the text, his measured tones break into expletives and yelps and broken words. It is as if we have come to the limit of language.Note perfect: Ed Atkins’s daily Post-it drawings – in picturesRead moreJones the actor, playing Peter, also fully inhabits the role of Philip. After the reading is finished Peter and Claire play a game devised by Ed Atkins’ young daughter Hollis Pinky. Peter has now adopted a further persona, and lies on the floor, and Claire, taking the role Ed Atkins used to play in this once-private game, first pretends to be an ambulance, then some sort of doctor, who attempts miracle, fantasy cures for imaginary ills, games of coping and resuscitation, of childhood fears being allayed through play. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing. “I want everything I make to corpse,” writes the artist. Where is the real Ed Atkins? Where is the real anybody? We’re all corpsing all the time, for all the time we have.At Tate Britain, London, until 25 AugustExplore more on these topicsVideo artArtArtificial intelligence (AI)Toby JonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The director and translator stagedan impeccable revivalof Eugène Ionesco’s The Chairs three years ago at the Almeida, complete with the masterstroke casting of husband-and-wife duo Kathryn Hunter andthe late Marcello Magni.Now comes his version of Ionesco’s magnum opus about the dangers of conformity. This might or might not be set in Ionesco’s provincial French town in which Berenger (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) becomes the hapless witness of a malaise in which humans are turning into rhinoceroses. It is dismally timely in a world of rising rightwing authoritarianism, with its critique of passivity in the face of barbarism and herd-like conformity.But where The Chairs nailed Ionesco’s balance between meta-comedy and existentialist dread, this production is not as clever – or rather, it is too clever, teeming with good ideas, but slack in pace and tone.Its look suggests a laboratory experiment, perhaps sending up the logician of the play whose syllogistic reasoning is perversely employed to impede truth. Most of the cast emerge as a lineup of scientists, one of whom calls himself the “Provocateur” (Paul Hunter) and narrates stage instructions archly.View image in fullscreenTricky … Anoushka Lucas and Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù in Rhinoceros.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe production encapsulates the spirit of Ionesco’s avant-gardism: anti-theatrical, always aware of its construction, and enlisting audience participation from the off, but the mechanics of the storytelling distract from the story itself.Our world is tucked into Ionesco’s (with mentions of Gary Lineker, fomo and fake news) but the clinical white set designed by Ana Inés Jabares-Pita allows the audience to project meaning. The danger is that this results in vagueness or abstraction and the play becomes a showcase of form alone.The drama plays out like improv for a while, with actors sometimes raising eyebrows or performing narrated scenarios wryly. Berenger is the only straight man, bewildered but also emphatically playing a part, like the others. Dìrísù deliberately stays at a remove, a blank of a character, but the distancing is so great that you never feel the pervading menace and fear in this town.The audience becomes the animal herd outside; some are given kazoos and instructed to blow every time the rhinoceroses trumpet their growing presence. It is a pantomime sound, absurdist yet not unsettling.View image in fullscreenLab experiment … Rhinoceros at the Almeida, London.Photograph: Marc BrennerStill, there are delightful moments of silliness and some lovely clowning, with Hayley Carmichael and Hunter standing out in a cast that juggles multiple roles. Foley sounds are created along the sides of the stage to the miming of invisible props and furniture, which extend the idea of audience participation to actively imagining a scene. A superb touch comes with a cafe table built out of a tray and tablecloth held by character. An over-active photocopier in the newspaper office scene is superbly conjured with light, sound and mime.But the play is too stretched and the slowness undercuts the sense of stampeding alarm. The transformation of Berenger’s friend, Jean (Joshua McGuire, robust), into a rhinoceros brings high-pitched hysteria and comedy yet without ruffling enough feathers. The unravelling of Berenger’s office crush, Daisy (Anoushka Lucas), holds greater weight. But the switch to dread never comes, despite the projected close-ups and ominous music.It is a production that has all of Elerian’s signature intelligence and playful imagination but is ultimately a reminder of how tricky a play this is, and how form can so easily eclipse content.At theAlmeida, London, until 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreEugène IonescoAlmeida theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a life-threatening condition that often stems from a physical issue many doctors refuse to seeCourtney MaumWed 2 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 13.12 EDTShareIn February, I taught memoir writing at a conference in Mexico where the faculty is traditionally put up with local hosts. Mine was especially communicative in the months leading up to my arrival, going out of his way to indicate affordable rooftop bars, the finest locations to view murals, and general best practices for the city he’d adopted as his own.So when I told my host that I have chronic insomnia, I felt he’d take me seriously, given how generous he’d been in his emails. “I’ve traveled a lot throughout Mexico,” I wrote him. “And the one thing I can’t deal with as an insomniac is roosters.”There was a rooster in the vicinity, my host admitted, but it was way off in the distance and shouldn’t be a problem; his home had thick walls and was well insulated against noise.Color me surprised when I arrived, a few hours shy of midnight, to the news that the rooster had recently relocated to the tree outside the guest bedroom where I’d be staying for the week. “He starts crowing at 4am,” my host explained, “and he just keeps on going.”I clock up to 20,000 steps a night: my life with restless legs syndromeRead more“He’s lucky we’re vegetarians!” joked a visiting friend of his.I went to bed disheartened and prematurely anxious. In addition to teaching a full load of courses, I had a novel under consideration at several publishing houses, so my week was jammed with high-stakes editorial calls. I can barely sleep with someone breathing next to me, so there wasn’t a chance in hell I’d be able to sleep through a rooster crowing outside my window.After a sleepless night, I fled the coop on day two, relocating to a poultry-free hotel nearby, which made me feel guilty – the host had been so kind. I was also frustrated, knowing he probably thought I was exaggerating, using the word “insomniac” to stand in for “sensitive”.When I tell people that I have immense trouble with sleep, what they hear is that I’m difficult, neurotic, a diva with control issues. For nearly 40 years, every doctor I’ve pleaded with has announced that the problem is in my head. That I need to relax, take hot baths, do a lot of yoga. Or, you know, go back and be born a man, because ladies arehigh-strung.But last year, at 45, I finally found a doctor who listened to my conviction that there was a physical root to my ailment.This is the story of how I got through his office door.As anyone trying to get through the day after a sleepless night will know, mental health is strongly linked to sleep satisfaction – and Americans are doing poorly in both of these departments.A 2023 poll by theNational Sleep Foundationfound that “one in four adults who were dissatisfied with their sleep also met probable criteria for a depression diagnosis,” with women and the elderly suffering from insomnia, depression anda reliance on sleeping aidsmore than any other demographic. Last year, a fresh survey by theAmerican Academy of Sleep Medicineannounced that 12% of Americans had been diagnosed with chronic insomnia, the very condition I’m up against.The message that I was overly sensitive, persistently hormonal and ‘keyed up’ was drilled into me so many times by doctors of both gendersMy struggles with disordered sleeping started far younger than the national average. By age nine, I had entered the pattern I’m currently entrenched in – I could fall asleep but couldn’t stay asleep, usually waking up at about 4.30am, exhausted and disgruntled, unable to lure the sandman back.I don’t think I knew the word “insomnia” at the time, but I knew something had shifted inside me for the worse. My home life was in shambles – my younger brother was suffering frequent, terrifying seizures and the stress of his undiagnosed illness was crumbling my parents’ already fractured marriage. When I complained to my mother about my sleep troubles, she gave me a “join the club” look. She brought home a pack of Sleepytime tea, but it only made me jealous of the narcoleptic brown bear on the packaging who could fall asleep wherever: in a lounger, in a hammock, in a field of chamomile.The tea was the extent of my mother’s efforts to “deal” with my insomnia. My father doesn’t do emotions, so I stored up my complaints for the doctors I saw annually, giddy with the knowledge that they’d know how to “fix” me. My pediatrician, my dentist, the gynecologist I started seeing as a teen, even the health counselor the school sent in for sexual education – I told everyone in a lab coat that I was unable to stay asleep at night, that I was developing debilitating canker sores from sleep loss, that I didn’t understand why I couldn’t stay asleep like my healthy friends.“It’s because of hormones,” was the common answer. “We see this in good students,” was another observation. “You should play more sports.” Then there was the MVP of answers: “It’s just a woman thing.”The message that I was overly sensitive, persistently hormonal and “keyed up” was drilled into me so many times by doctors of both genders, I eventually turned my disorder into a point of pride. Throughout my youth and well into my 20s, I hid my broken mental health by presenting a sharp and willing mind to my employers, colleagues, friends. By day as a copywriter, I was known as a fixer, someone who could deliver website copy for a luxury hotel chain on a moment’s notice. At night, I went into author mode – someone able to brightly chat about her latest novel at book signings even though she felt costumed in the body of someone no longer alive.When I added “mother” to my growing list of responsibilities, the train went off the rails. By the time my daughter turned two, I stopped sleeping completely – even sedatives couldn’t turn off the neon light constantly buzzing in my head. I started shedding weight, developed irritable bowel syndrome, and was too out of it to drive. The canker sores that had always plagued me turned into mouth ulcers so painful I couldn’t speak or eat.Most pointedly, I couldn’t “show up” and “power through” professionally as I’d been doing for so long. I missed the deadline for my second novel. There were mistakes in all my emails. Squiggles in my sight path. I was hearing voices, seeing things in corners. I’d always been told that my brain was the problem – that I alone was responsible for my inability to sleep. Therefore, I had to eradicate the problem. I started to fantasize about driving off the road in my rural, wooded town. Straight into a tree.My husband put his foot down. Neither he nor my daughter could continue living with the human shell I had become. Either I got myself into therapy, or we talked divorce.Cue a montage of fresh intentions. I found a talented therapist and a psychiatrist generous with her scripts. I started anti-depression medication and was prescribed an entire pharmacy aisle of sleeping pills. I went to a nutritionist, dropping a small fortune on new-agey supplements including valerian root and lion’s mane. I started acupuncture, hypnosis, reiki, and I took a lot of baths. I gave up coffee and tried to exercise more even though I was so sleepy, I didn’t register my limbs moving until they already had. I drank less alcohol; I ate my weight in food.I also did the sleep hygiene thing, becoming even more rigid around the act of sleeping, which frankly made things worse. I bought expensive sheets. I bought expensive pillows. I enrolled in two sleep clinics to test for sleep apnea; I failed both so was denied the CPap machine that I thought might help me rest.These efforts – laborious, expensive – lasted nearly 15 years. And then, at 45, a new development occurred: I started snoring so loudly that my husband decamped to the guest room. How could I be snoring if I was barely sleeping?After nasal strips failed to quell my honking, I posted to Facebook for snoring solutions, and a friend suggested that I see an an ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor. Doctors and acquaintances have recommended everything under the sun – including the sun itself – for my insomnia, but no one had ever recommended this specific specialty, so I drove to the ENT Institute of Connecticut with something close to hope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Early, like age nine.” I held on to the information that this is also when my insomnia started and my family fell apart. If I admitted that, the consult would end like all the others – the problem was my brain, the problem was my gender; I needed tochill out.“You have an anterior nasal valve collapse and upper airway resistance syndrome,” the doctor said instead, holding up a laminated poster of different mouth and throat types. “When you got braces, your jaw wasn’t done growing. Your tongue kept growing, but your jaw’s growth was stunted and now you can’t breathe properly, especially at night where you’re basically choked by your own tongue. This isn’t a mental thing; you have a real, physical problem. You haven’t been breathing properly for over 30 years and no CPap is gonna fix that. I’m recommending you for surgery.”I cried when I got to my car, but not out of relief. After decades of medical gaslighting, hearing that my problems weren’t invented didn’t feel liberating or validating. I felt robbed of time.I mourned the years where I could have been more comfortable, happier, healthier and rested; a better writer, better mother, a better friend and human. All those doctors, for all those years, declaring that my canker sores were unfixable and linked only to my menses? In the space of five minutes, my doctor had explained it all: my mouth wasn’t able to properly sanitize itself because I couldn’t breathe right. He also explained why my face turned beet red when I did the slightest amount of exercise (a tendency I’d been bullied for as a middle schooler): I wasn’t getting the oxygen I needed to run around the gym.All you really want is for doctors to say, hey, let’s drop everything and help this person out. But most of the time, you can’t even get anyone to return your callsLara PrescottI got braces in the 1980s when American orthodontics was excessively focused on cosmetics. Today, there’s more awareness around orthodontics and otorhinolaryngology, countless articles, some podcasts; there’s even a 2024 documentary calledOpen Widethat explores the teenage rite of passage that is – or was – getting braces young. Accordingly, when the New Hampshire-based writerSarah Canneywas told by a dentist that her eight-year-old son’s overcrowded mouth, constant migraines and sleep troubles would be remedied by orthodontics, she had a tool that wasn’t available to my family: the World Wide Web.“There’s an unseen trickle-down effect of doing so much to a young mouth,” explains Canney, who researched extensively to find a doctor who wouldn’t force tooth extraction on her child’s overcrowded mouth, because she’d learned this practice can detrimentally affect mouth size, causing considerable problems as the patient ages. She says she went into that first appointment with her guard up, ready to protect and advocate her son, but she didn’t have to. The practice Canney chose takes a holistic approach to dentistry, looking at neck curvature and body alignment before anything else. Canney’s son is in phase two of what is looking like a successful orthodontic program, where the patient’s quality of life is prioritized over having perfect teeth.The poetChristina Stoddardis the person who originally told me to see an ENT in the comments of my Facebook post, because she was saved from debilitating sleep issues by an ENT herself. For years, Stoddard was getting the recommended amount of sleep but was waking feeling like she hadn’t slept at all. Given that her father has sleep apnea, she was certain she’d leave her ENT appointment with a prescription for a CPap – a continuous positive airway pressure machine that uses a combination of water and suction to help its user breathe. Instead, Stoddard was recommended for five different surgeries to correct nasal and laryngeal issues that were affecting her ability to breathe correctly, especially lying down.Stoddard underwent the recommended operations, and though the recovery was gnarly, within a month she said the results were transformative. “I didn’t know what I’d been missing,” she told me on the phone. “I went to sleep. I stayed asleep. I woke up in the morning feeling like I wanted to belt out a Broadway song.”I had three surgeries for my own breathing issues: a nasal valve repair, a septoplasty and a turbinate reduction, all of whichI underwent in May of 2024. Unfortunately, the cartilage graft inserted to prop my nostrils open didn’t take on one side of my nose, so in November of 2024, I went under the knife again for revision surgery.A lot of things have improved for me since my second operation. The headaches that used to plague my waking hours have completely dissipated, and my canker sores have gone from being a daily burden to a monthly one. My face no longer turns bright red when I exercise and I feel generally calmer, happier and more poised. For months after the second surgery, I was sleeping better than I have in decades, but at the time of writing, I’m experiencing a relapse: I haven’t slept more than four hours a night for three weeks.Though I’ve finally identified and treated the physical cause of my sleep issues, I now have to go back and course correct my mind. After researchingthe benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia(shorthand, CBT-I), I was given a list of local providers by my therapist, but I’m having a hard time finding a human being to treat me, given that most programs are online and self-paced.Trouble sleeping? This therapy can help with insomniaRead moreThe novelistLara Prescottis currently enrolled in such a program, the Harvard-designedStellar Sleepmobile app. Having tried every solution in the book for her lifelong insomnia, she’s skeptical that CBT-I will provide the life-changing breakthrough that she’s desperate for.“Right now, I’m in a really cranky I-don’t-want-to-do-this mode,” Prescott admits. “Insomnia is such a lonely condition. You’re up and you’re so lonely and you can’t get back to sleep, and all you really want is for doctors to say, hey, let’s drop everything and help this person out. But most of the time, you can’t even get anyone to return your calls.”While I wait for human CBT-I practitioners to return my own phone calls, I’m trying out new rituals to regulate my circadian rhythm and establish healthier thought patterns around my sleep performance. First thing every morning and last thing every night, I go outside and take in the sights, the sounds, the light. I’m supposed to do this for 20 minutes a sitting. (I don’t.) But even with modest time I give to outdoor meditation, I can see and feel the benefits of choosing to rise and set with the sun and moon, instead of my phone’s screen. I ordered a demonic acupressure mat that I endure nightly while listening toAyla Nova yoga nidrapodcasts. I’m slowly trying to replace my Ambien and Trazodone with edibles and tinctures, but I’m not quite off the pharmaceutical sauce.Until a full night’s rest comes to me (which won’t be for a while, thanks to perimenopause), I find relief in connecting with people who understand that insomnia is not a grievance made by difficult, whiny women but rather a life-threatening condition that frequently stems from a physical issue many doctors refuse to see.My complications were identified later in life than I’m comfortable with, but better late than dead. If you’re reading this as a fellow insomniac, I hope you find someone who hears and sees you, too.Courtney Maum is an author who wrote about her sleep issues and related mental health struggles in her memoirThe Year of HorsesExplore more on these topicsWell actuallySleepHealth & wellbeingSleep apnoeaUS healthcareDentistsMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And yet, this time last year, fashion influencers were doing just that. The “office siren” trend was all over TikTok and headlines in Vogue and InStyle. Sirens, we’re told, wore skintight pencil skirts, collared shirts unbuttoned to show ample cleavage, and maybe a pinstripe vest to tie it all together. It was corporate Barbie cosplay, with nods to a submissive Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary, or Betty Boop moonlighting as a call center employee.Office sirens were celebrating returning to the office post-pandemic while signaling a secret freakiness (one channeled well by Nicole Kidman inBabygirl, in which she played a Lean In feminist CEO who enters into a kinky office romance with a much younger intern and can’t stop adjusting her blouse buttons).The trend seemed destined to end in a meeting with HR. But that was all part of the appeal: corpcore as a kind of fetishization.View image in fullscreenTina Leung and Gala Gonzalez at Milan fashion week in 2021.Photograph: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesFast forward to 2025, though, and workers (or those who wish to dress like a cartoonishly sexy version of one) feel less playful. Recession indicators abound, the job market has stalled, stagflation seems imminent. The office siren has died, giving way to a morestaid, traditional uniform.Fortunereportedthis week that gen Z are “terrified of layoffs and the spiraling economy – so they’re copying Steve Jobs and showing up to the office in uniforms”. On TikTok, young people admitted to copying the Apple founder’s habit of wearing black turtlenecks, Levi 501s and New Balances into the office as a way to signal he didn’t care for the frivolity of dressing up. On TikTok, women share their more conservative go-tos: oversized white boatneck tops, baggy tailored trousers, sweater sets. “I recently found a TikTok about about finding your Steve Jobs outfit, and I realized, wait I have one,” one usersaidin a video. “I live, breathe, and die in Oxford shirts.”Freya Drohan, a fashion writer based in New York, says that she has noticed a shift in more image-conscious dressing. “There’s a move away from outfits that are rooted in self-expression,” she said. “People are instead leaning toward safeness in terms of color and silhouette and toeing the line with their outfits. I can’t remember the last time I saw someone commuting or in an office in a bright patterned blouse. Maybe they’re simply too tired to think of putting together unique looks when the news cycle and pace of things is so exhausting.”View image in fullscreenYoung people have admitted to copying Steve Jobs in adopting a work uniform.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images“The decision fatigue is real,” said Isobelle Panton, a 32-year-old from Manchester, England, who leads commercial for a podcast production company. “I used to follow trends, but I wound up with an eclectic mix of stuff that didn’t go together. So I decided that I wanted to go with a uniform.” This includes three blazers, three pairs of pants and a couple of tops.What constitutes a work-appropriate outfit has always been somewhat vague: you know it when you see it. Cierra Gross, founder of the independent firm Caged Bird HR, believes that the desire for more conservative outfits fits into the US’s overall embrace of conservatism, especially in politics. She referenced the fast-fashion brand Pretty Little Thing, which used to sell eye-catching clubwear, but rebranded earlier this year to sell beige shift dresses and brown blazers that wouldn’t be out of place if seen onKaroline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary. “Now it’s old money, which is a complete 360 from those very revealing, individualistic looks they used to sell prior to the [Trump] administration,” she said.While the plain, cashmere look might be Republican-coded, it’s also inoffensive and apolitical. That explains the soaringpopularityof Quince, a discount site that sells bland, plain clothing (plus home goods) and appeals to younger shoppers who feel they have grown out of overly trendy fast-fashion brands – but not the cheap price tag.Drohan adds that while corporate sirens may have left the office, you can spot them after-hours. “Ironically, I think gen Z women are more likely to dial up this trend outside of their 9-to-5, when they can cosplay in the vein of what they see on the runway, or what they imagine they might wear if they were on Wall Street,” she said. “There’s an escapism and manifestation element to the look. I can see them wearing pieces associated with the very sexy secretary archetype not necessarily at work, but on their nights out.”Explore more on these topicsFashionWork & careersUS work & careersSteve JobsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Often the simplest dishes feel in the least need of an actual recipe, yet surely I can’t be alone in thinking that the leathery, greasy roast new potatoes that turn up so often on tables at this time of year show some room for improvement.I used to be of Jane Grigson’s opinion that “new potatoes should either be steamed or put into boiling water with sprigs of mint” – after all,they’re so good, and their season so short, from April to August, why meddle with perfection? But, having recently enjoyed crisp-skinned, buttery- fleshed beauties from a restaurant oven, I’d like to add them to my repertoire, too. While anyone can roast a potato, doing it proper justice clearly requires a little more thought.The potatoesNew potatoes are, as the name suggests, the first of the early potatoes to crop each year – the ones with the thin, papery skins that can be rubbed off with a fingernail. The first and smallest of these are, I think, still better steamed and buttered or oiled; there’s not really enough skin on them to crisp, but the slightly larger, more robust ones that follow are admirably suited to this endeavour, which seems only to intensify their slightly nutty flavour.View image in fullscreenNigella Lawsonsteams her spuds first, which makes them taste ‘more satisfyingly potatoey’ than boiled versions. All thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.Though the term “new” refers only tofreshly dug potatoes of any early variety, those sold as such in this country tend also to be waxy, with a high moisture and a low starch content. Their dense, smooth flesh is ideal for salads and boiling, because it retains its shape after cooking, but they’re no good for fluffy mash or baked potatoes.Jersey royalstend to be the earliest in the shops each year, thanks to the island’s milder climate, but you can use anything that’s labelledsalad potatoes– anya, la ratte, charlotte, epicure – for the recipe below.Don’t bother to peel them (if they’re really fresh, they should come unwashed, and you can just rinse off the dirt and rub off any sorry-looking bits of skin); not only will the skin crisp up pleasingly, but I think it contains much of the tuber’s flavour (in this, and perhaps this only, I dare to disagree with the great Simon Hopkinson, who writes in Week In Week Out, “there truly is nothing worse than a new potato cooked with its skin intact. Just go away all of you who say: ‘but all the goodness and vitamins of a potato lie just beneath its skin!’ This does not mean you have to leave it there to get to it”). Do, however, make sure they’re all roughly the same size, because that will ensure they cook evenly. (Cutting a few in half is fine, if necessary, but I prefer to leave them whole – they look prettier, and I think the texture is better, especially if you’re going to boil them.)The preparationView image in fullscreenDavid Tanis bakes his new potatoes in a greaseproof paper parcel, which turns them ‘deliciously soft and rich in flavour’.Most recipes I try call for the potatoes to be pre-cooked to some degree, much as one would for ordinary roast potatoes.J Kenji López-Alt,Mary Cadoganand Nigel Slater all boil theirs: López-Alt for five minutes (but from cold) until “the exteriors are tender”, Cadogan for 10, which counts as a kind of par-boil, and Slater “until tender” all the way through. López-Alt writes on Serious Eats: “Papery crusts occur when the layer of gelatinised starches that crisp up on the exterior of the potato isn’t thick enough. As the potato comes out of the oven and sits, steam from its core penetrates the crust, softening it from the inside out. Parboiling the potatoes will help build up this layer of starch.”Nigella Lawsonsteams hers until tender instead, which she suggests should take 20-30 minutes, though I find the baby new potatoes she specifies are done in half that time. They also taste more satisfyingly potatoey than the boiled versions, something I put down to the fact that they’re lost none of their flavour to the water.Delia SmithandDavid Tanis, meanwhile, both roast their potatoes from raw, though Smith marinates them in oil, vinegar and aromatics for a couple of hours beforehand. On balance, I agree with Slater that “they need a few minutes in boiling water before they hit the oven if they are not to toughen as they roast” – my testers and I find Smith’s spuds chewy rather than crisp (no good can surely come of contradicting two of my culinary heroes in one column, but I’m duty bound to report my findings). Tanis’s are much better, for reasons I shall go into later, but for a simple roast spud, pre-cooking seems the safest bet.View image in fullscreenNigel Slater’s roast new potatoes are ‘bashed around a bit’.López-Alt, like Smith, adds vinegar, in his case to the water when boiling, to “allow the starch to gelatinise while keeping the potatoes relatively firm and intact”, on the basis that “pectin, the glue that holds vegetable cells together, doesn’t break down very readily in acidic environments”. While I’m sure he’s right, the likelihood of potatoes breaking down after five minutes in boiling water feels vanishingly slim – and, in any case, I’m going to steam mine. (If this is impractical, put them in a pan of cold, salted water and boil until just tender instead.)To smash or bash?López-Alt adopts a technique familiar to me from standard roast potatoes, treating the parboiled spuds a bit rough by “bashing them around a bit until their exteriors are coated in a film of bashed-up potato bits [which] allows you to crisp up not just the cut surfaces, but the skins as well”. Leaving aside the fact that after just five minutes of boiling, I have to shake that pan like a woman possessed to have any effect on its occupants, I find a simpler, and more effective, method is simply to crush each potato lightly, as Cadogan, Lawson and Slater recommend, “to break the skin and flesh a little in order to allow the oil to penetrate and the potato to crisp”,to quote the last in Tender. Because they all react slightly differently to being squashed, this produces a pleasing variety of shapes to crisp up in as many different ways, from crunchy crags of flesh to thin, almost potato crisp-like shards of skin. Plus, tiny squashed potatoes also look rather comical to my mind.View image in fullscreenJ Kenji López-Alt takes a typically scientific approach to his roast new potatoes.The temperatureCadogan roasts the potatoes at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20 minutes, and Slater for twice that time, while Lawson cranks up the oven by fully 20 degrees and sits them in the middle for half an hour. López-Alt and Smith, mavericks both, turn up the oven to 260C, or “the highest setting” (which, coincidentally, is 260C), and bake them, in Lopez-Alt’s case, for 55 minutes, though I have to whip mine out after half an hour, because they’re already bordering on the burnt. They have a decent crunchy crust, as promised, but for me it’s too thick and dominant in flavour, in marked contrast with those baked at a lower temperature, which have a more delicate, shattering crispness and still taste predominantly of potato flesh, rather than its sweet, browned skin. A more moderate heat allows them time to acquire a rich, golden tan without drying out.View image in fullscreenDelia Smith’s roast new potatoes turn out ‘chewy rather than crisp’.Tanis isn’t seeking crispness with his “steam-roasted” new potatoes for the New York Times, which are baked in a greaseproof paper parcel with aromatics, making them deliciously soft and rich in flavour – a slightly more luxe take on the standard steamed spud that would be perfect for a dinner party, perhaps paired with poached fish or asparagus.The extrasI’ve eschewed any extras that might overpower the subtle flavour of the main ingredient, but as well as using different fats for different effects, you might like to bake your potatoes with chopped rosemary (Slater), smoked paprika (Cadogan for BBC Good Food) or garlic, rosemary, sage and thyme (Smith and Tanis). López-Alt adds shallots towards the end of the cooking, then, after they come out of the oven, sloshes it all with oil, garlic, chives, parsley and lemon zest. Meanwhile, Lawson finishes hers with a “wincing hit” of vinegar, which cuts through the creamy texture of the potatoes and oil beautifully. Personally, however, I think they’re delicious just as they are – these are lucky to make it to the table in my house.View image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect roast new potatoes are very much like Nigella’s, with just the odd tweak here and there.(The problem with very simple recipes such as this is that there often aren’t many variables, so I must acknowledge that my perfect version is very similar to Nigella Lawson’s version in At My Table, but with a slightly shorter cooking time. After all, if it ain’t broke …)Prep5 minCook45 minServes2-4500g small new potatoes1-2 tbsp olive oil, or neutral oil or animal fatSaltTry to find potatoes that are all roughly the same size, so you can keep all their skins intact while steaming; if any really are whoppers, though, then cut them in half.View image in fullscreenSteam until just tender all the way through, or about 15 minutes for baby potatoes. (Alternatively, put the potatoes in a pan just large enough to hold them all, cover with cold water, salt well, bring to a boil, then simmer until just cooked through. Drain and return to the hot pan to steam-dry before roasting.)Meanwhile, heat the oven and a roasting tin, filled with only just enough oil to coat the base (how much will, of course, depend on the size of your tin), to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.View image in fullscreenPut the steamed potatoes on a board and lightly crush each one with a fork, spoon or potato masher, but only just so you hear the skins split, and not so hard that they break apart (though, if a few do, such is life).View image in fullscreenRemove the hot tin from the oven. If you can, set it on a low heat on the hob to keep the fat warm while you roll each potato in turn in the hot oil to coat. Spread out the potatoes as much as possible, then season generously with salt.View image in fullscreenRoast for 20 minutes, or until richly golden brown underneath (larger potatoes may take longer), then flip and bake for another 10 minutes.

The catcalls were rising; the baying, cackling audience of under-11s intoxicated by a combination of ice-cream sugar rushes and my obvious, clammy fear. It was day 14 of a two-week summer holiday, and our final afternoon in blissful 30C Corsican sunshine. I just needed one more chapter, lounging with my book, soaking in the last of the bone-warming sun slowly edging down towards the island’s dramatic mountainous spine.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But my calculating offspring had not forgotten ill-fated promises made on a previous evening, probably a little too deep into the second carafe. I was probably caught off-guard atBarny’s, a sensational sushi restaurant in the town of Ghisonaccia, enjoying our best meal of the holiday. They know when my defences are down; when I’m fully relaxed into holiday “yes” mode, and prime for being taken advantage of.So, here we are. I’d avoided going down the thrilling water slide at the Eurocamp Arinella Bianca’s family pool for as long as I could, and had nowhere left to run.View image in fullscreenArinella Bianca campsiteIt was my husband’s turn to disappear into the sanctuary of the adult-only pool in the wellness suite – complete with a whirlpool area, lazy river and priceless peace and quiet – so all other sacrificial options were gone.I gave in, launched myself down, followed by child one and child two. Screams, splashing, laughing, coughing. I might have quickly had my fill of the water slide, but I could have stayed on the island for a whole lot longer. The campsite is located just outside the town of Ghisonaccia, on the east coast, a smart choice if you want to be as well-positioned as you possibly can on an island with a huge mountain range running down the middle. It is less known than the ports of Bastia, Calvi and the capital, Ajaccio, as well as the more glamorous Porto-Vecchio and photogenic Bonifacio. But you pay less for accommodation and, with a hire car allowing us to explore, we planned day trips to the southern tip of the island too.The children played on the sand while we shared a delicious cuttlefish and octopus dish with a bottle of chilled white wineGhisonaccia felt up-and-coming, with restaurants, independent shops, stalls, supermarkets and a weekend street fair with live music. The crowning glory for a tourist information enthusiast like myself was a supremely helpful, well-stocked and multilingual office in the centre of town, which helped us discover family-friendly river walks farther inland, as well as the nature reserve Etang D’Urbino, just 10 minutes north.We’d chosen Corsica as our latest Mediterranean island holiday after a string of successes over the years with Sicily, Mallorca, the more rural Elba, and hopping about on ferries between Croatia’s Hvar, Korčula and Vis.View image in fullscreenPlage de l’Ostriconi.Photograph: Daniel Schoenen/Getty ImagesCorsica lies between the south-east of France and the west of Italy, accessible by ferry from Marseille, Nice and Toulon in France, or Savona, Livorno and Genoa in Italy. We arrived in Bastia via Savona and used Corsica Ferries there and back. Manage your expectations, especially in peak holiday season; the prices are reasonable for an overnight cabin, which we chose to limit the time wasted travelling, but we failed to anticipate stuffy rooms and 7am arrival times leaving us tired and irritable. Next time, I’d opt for the shorter, half-day journeys to spend as little time as possible inside the ship.Although it is close to Sardinia and has a long, complex and turbulent history of invasion and ownership, Corsica is definitely French, but with a unique feel. It was the birthplace of Napoleon, and its economy relies on tourism as well as healthy subsidies from Paris. Profiles of the island say it is one of the most underdeveloped parts of France and its proud inhabitants want to keep it that way.We walked by the lagoon, foraged samphire to have with our barbecue-baked sea bass, and went for refreshing swims in the riverThere is a banquet of beaches to choose from. You could come every year for a decade and still find new favourites. Some, like Plage de Santa Giulia, are vast, popular and easily accessible, signposted off the main roads; while others, like Plage de l’Ostriconi, are more rural and worth the pilgrimage on paths through shrubland and Corsican pines. We spent a few days trying various beaches along the east coast from the port of Bastia in the north, through Solenzara and the upmarket towns of Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio. In the end, though, our favourite was actually our very own beach, just a few steps from our chalet, Plage de Ghisonaccia, a beautiful sweep of white sand where you could eat in one of the beachside restaurants, play volleyball, get involved in water sports or just find a secluded spot. It’s where we discoveredGhiso Beach restauranta few minutes’ walk up from Arinella Bianca.

Our smart, clean and modern three-bedroom chalet had formidable air conditioning, two shower rooms, loads of storage and great indoor and outdoor spaces for cooking and eating.For many years now​, parts of Corsica have suffered from overtourism, which has affected the fragile ecosystem and local resources, leading to visitor quotas and demarketing campaigns. For our visit, we decided we would tread the less-beaten track. Even though we chose a resort campsite, it’s on the Côte Orientale, an agricultural area that is still relatively unknown but is slowly becoming the island’s top camping holiday destination.So pick an area and stay local, as we mostly did. With its winding roads and traffic jams, getting anywhere in Corsica by car can be an ordeal, especially in mountainous areas. Plage de Ghisonaccia became our favourite beach partly because it didn’t involve a stressful car journey, and we spent our days exploring the Pinia forest, one of the last maritime pine forests left in Europe, which bordered the beach. We walked the shores of the Urbino coastal lagoon, foraged samphire to have with our barbecue-baked sea bass, and went for refreshing swims in Fium’Orbu river, just a few minutes inland from the campsite.

Some of the best and most traditional ones are cooked over charcoal and palm wood in deep underground fire pits, so the smokiness takes over every grain. That isn’t practical in most homes, but I like to think we can still produce the most wonderful rice dishes with just simple ingredients and a lot of love.Fega’ata, or bottom-of-the-pot chicken and rice (pictured top)The name of this uniquely Bahraini dish means “bottom of the pot”, which is where all the good stuff happens. The meat (or fish or vegetables) is left to steam and cook gently without any liquid, and the rice is piled on top. Don’t skimp on the onions, because their moisture is what helps move things along. The chicken skin doesn’t go crisp here; instead, it acts as a shield, keeping the meat nice and tender.Prep20 minSoak1 hr+Cook2 hr 30 minServes6–8½ tsploosely packedsaffron threads2 tsp rosewater2 tsp cumin seeds, finely crushed in a mortar2 tsp coriander seeds, finely crushed in a mortar1 tsp mild curry powder1 tsp ground turmeric1 tsp paprika½ tsp ground cinnamon2black limes, 1 finely ground to yield 1 tsp, the other broken in half and pips removed1kgbone-in skin-on chicken thighs(about 8), patted dryFine sea salt andblack pepper100g yellow split peas, soaked in boiling water for at least 1 hour3 onions, peeled, halved and each half cut into 4 wedges (540g)400gfloury potatoes(such as maris piper), peeled and cut into 5cm chunks1 large plum tomato(130g), cut into 83 whole green chillies35gfresh ginger, peeled and finely grated5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated4 tbsp melted ghee4 cloves3 fresh bay leaves6 cardamom pods375gbasmati rice, washed until the water runs clear, soaked for at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours, then drained2 tbspfreshcoriander leaves, roughly chopped, to servePut the saffron, rosewater and a tablespoon and a half of hot water in a small bowl.

Top with the rice and aromatics, without compressing the mix, and spread it out carefully so as not to break apart the rice grains. Pour over the remaining saffron water and the last tablespoon of ghee, cover with a clean tea towel and the lid, then bring the ends of the towel up and over the lid and secure with a rubber band or by tying them together.Put the pan on a medium-high heat for exactly 15 minutes, rotating it once halfway, then turn down the heat to low and leave to cook undisturbed for an hour and 45 minutes.Take off the lid and towel, and leave to settle for 10 minutes. Put a large platter on top of the pan and, in one swift movement, invert the rice mix on to the platter. Lift off the pan and shake the platter a little to distribute everything nicely; don’t worry if a few bits stick to the pan – just spoon them on to the rice. Sprinkle with the coriander and serve.Tomato, potato and saffron riceView image in fullscreenNoor Murad’s tomato, potato and saffron rice.This can be a side or a main dish – I like to eat it with fried fish, chopped salad and a spicy pickle.Prep20 minSoak20 min+Cook1 hr 50 minServes4-6⅓ tsploosely packedsaffron threads, finely crushed1 tsp rosewater4 tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced (220g)Fine sea salt andblack pepper400g floury potatoes, such as maris pipers (about 2 medium ones), peeled and cut into rough 2½cm cubes350gbasmati rice, washed until the water runs clear, soaked for at least 20 minutes, then drained3 fresh bay leaves5 cloves5 cardamom pods50g unsalted butter, cut into small cubes4 large ripe plum tomatoes, halved lengthways (600g)2 whole green chillies1½ tbsp picked flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped (optional)Put the saffron, a tablespoon and a half of hot water and the rosewater in a small bowl and leave to infuse for at least 20 minutes (or up to overnight).Put two tablespoons of the oil, the onion and a half-teaspoon of salt in a nonstick saute pan for which you have a lid, then cook, stirring occasionally, on a medium-high heat for 10 minutes, until the onions are nicely golden.Stir in the potatoes, two tablespoons of water and another quarter-teaspoon of salt, give everything a good stir, then cover with the lid and turn down the heat to medium-low. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring once halfway, until the potatoes are cooked through and have taken on some colour.Meanwhile, fill a 26cm nonstick saucepan for which you have a lid with water. Add two teaspoons of salt, bring to a boil, then add the rice, bay leaves and spices, and boil for five minutes, until the rice is half cooked. Strain through a sieve set over the sink, then rinse out and dry the pan.Put the last two tablespoons of oil and half the butter in the clean pan. Sprinkle the cut sides of the tomatoes with three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt in total and a good grind of pepper, then arrange them cut side down in the pan with the chillies. Top evenly with half the rice, including the aromatics, spoon over half the saffron water, top with half the potatoes, then repeat with the remaining rice, saffron water and potatoes .Poke three or four holes in the rice with the handle of a wooden spoon, then dot with the remaining butter.

For the last few years of her service, she worked as a cyberdefense operator in the intelligence squadron. But the work, which involved overseeing computers operating drone surveillance, eventually took a toll on her mental health.“If I had to watch any more of this, I was going to not be alive anymore,” Blake said, who says she experienced suicidal ideations. “I just felt like the bad guy. I felt evil.”View image in fullscreenSavannah Blake.Photograph: Courtesy of Savannah BlakeAfter seven years of service, Blake, who is trans, left the air force with PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression. But she also left with the hope she could finally live as herself without fear of harassment from fellow service members. Last year, she began receiving estrogen through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Now she fears for the future of that care.“Every day, I wake up and I don’t know what the rules are anymore in the country I live in,” said Blake. “It’s becoming increasingly hard to see a future where we’re OK.”Blake is one of about 134,000 transgender veterans living in the US. It’s an alarming time to be someone like her. Onhis first day in office, Donald Trump issued anexecutive order recognizing only two sexes, stamping out gender identity in federal documents and public spaces. A series of other orders have attempted to restrict trans rights, includingparticipation in sports, access togender-affirming care for youth,educational materials in schoolsandmilitary service.The crackdown has sent shock waves through the VA, which functions as one of the US’s largest healthcare providers, offering free or low-cost care to more than 9 million veterans. After Trump’s inauguration, some VA health centers began removing LGBTQ+ affiliated objects, including pride flags, rainbow magnets, stickers and posters.When Mary Brinkmeyer’s medical center ordered the removal of LGBTQ+ patient flyers and other affirming material days after Trump’s executive orders, she refused, and ultimately resigned. For nearly three years, she had worked as a psychologist and LGBTQ+ veteran care coordinator at the VA facility in Hampton, Virginia. Hospital leadership ordered her to stop LGBTQ+ outreach, advocacy and gender-affirming training to departments because it could be considered “gender ideology”.View image in fullscreenAn email ordering Mary Brinkmeyer to stop LGBTQ+ employeeprograms, to comply with Trump’s executive orders.Photograph: Courtesy of Mary Brinkmeyer“We all have ethics codes in our professions that say that you’re supposed to do no harm, and that if you’re caught between institutional pressure and the ethics code, you’re supposed to resolve it in a way that’s consistent with the ethics code,” Brinkmeyer said.Brinkmeyer fears for the mental health of trans veterans, whom she saw experience “really intense suicidal crises” after Trump announced a ban on trans people enlisting in the military in 2017. After the election last November, some of her patients requested the removal of trans identifiers in medical records, and others withdrew from coverage over fears of being targeted and losing access to care. For many, those fears have become a reality.Rollbacks became official in March when the VArescinded directive 1341, a policy that ensured “the respectful delivery of health care to transgender and intersex Veterans”, and announced the phasing out of gender-affirming medical care. The agency had been providing gender-affirming treatment including hormone therapy, prosthetics, hair removal, voice coachingand pre-surgical evaluation including letters of support for more than a decade. While cisgender veterans will still be able to access these treatments, veterans diagnosed with gender dysphoria are now excluded. Mental health services for trans patients and existing VA and military coverage for hormone therapy won’t be affected, according to the memo, which also formalizes banning trans patients from using facilities that align with their gender identity.View image in fullscreenMary Brinkmeyer and colleagues performing outreach for LGBTQ+ veterans and employees.Photograph: Courtesy of Mary Brinkmeyer“I am scared for the huge amount of people that are about to be forcibly separated, because the VA is not there to actually catch these people,” Blake said, referring to an influx of trans service members who could be forced out of the military under Trump’s transgender military ban. “I hate that the ladder was pulled up behind me.”‘A death sentence’The changes have put trans veterans seeking gender-affirming care in limbo. It has also created a climate of fear for the trans veterans already receiving hormone therapy, who worry it could be pulled at any time.View image in fullscreenMilitary veteran Kaydi Rogers, in Vietnam.Photograph: Courtesy of Kaydi RogersThat’s the reality for Kaydi Rogers. While at the moment her hormone therapy will not be disrupted, she is terrified of losing access to estrogen if the VA continues its crackdown.Rogers spent about five decades acquiring estrogen pills through pharmacies in Mexico or friends with prescriptions.“I was desperate,” Rogers said. “I didn’t know any way of doing anything about what was going on with me. It was not a common thing back in the 70s and 80s to come out trans.”She finally switched to VA coverage because of the potential health risks of taking unregulated pills. But Rogers said if the VA ever stopped prescribing her estrogen, the desperation would return and she would again rely on self-medication for survival.Beyond her concerns about continued access to care, Rogers feels the loss of welcoming and safe spaces inside VA clinics. She says she tries to avoid drawing attention to herself during appointments, fearful of being harassed or attacked.“Before last year, every time I went to the VA, I went dressed as Kaydi and no one seemed to bother me or care,” Rogers said. “Now, not so much.”Other veterans share these safety concerns, including Lindsay Church, the executive director and co-founder of Minority Veterans of America. Church, who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, has experienced harassment and discrimination inside VA clinics in the past, and began carrying a printed copy of directive 1341 to prove they were entitled to treatment that respected their gender identity. With that directive rescinded and no guarantee of protection, they’ve canceled VA appointments and sought care elsewhere.View image in fullscreenKaydi Rogers says she now fears harassment at VA clinics.Photograph: Courtesy of Kaydi RogersThe veterans affairs secretary, Doug Collins, stated that trans veterans “will always be welcome at VA and will always receive the benefits and services they’ve earned under the law”. In response to questions about the new policy, the VA press secretary, Peter Kasperowicz, directed the Guardian tothe press releasefrom 17 March.Church said the discriminatory climate is having a chilling effect on trans veterans, regardless of whether their care plans have been discontinued under the VA’s new policy. “If I can’t use [my healthcare plan] because I’m scared of being harassed and intimidated, and experiencing physical violence in a bathroom, I can’t use the system,” they said.They called the policy reversal a “death sentence”.View image in fullscreenLindsay Church of Minority Veterans of America testifying before Congress on 26 February 2025.Photograph: Courtesy of Lindsay Church‘We tell them we will take care of you, and that’s a lie’Trans veterans face higher rates ofhomelessness, unemployment,PTSDandmilitary sexual traumacompared with cisgender veterans. They are alsotwiceas likely to die by suicide compared with cisgender veterans, and almost six times more likely than the general US population. Advocates and providers say these psychiatric and socioeconomic risk factors, when combined with the loss of an affirming medical environment, places an already vulnerable population even more at risk.One VA clinical social worker, who requested anonymity, said his LGBTQ+ patients don’t feel safe and are experiencing more suicidal ideations than before Trump took office.“I have seen an increase in suicide risk evaluations,” he said. “I’ve done more of those in the last two months than I’ve done the last two years.”View image in fullscreenA letter from the HamptonVA healthcare system obtained by the Guardian.Photograph: GuardianAnother LGBTQ+ veteran care coordinator said a trans patient attempted suicide at her facility after Trump’s inauguration, and she fears there could be more people who attempt the same. She said notifying trans patients of the policy change has been heartbreaking.“I’ve worked for the past two and a half years to gain people’s trust, and now all of a sudden, I’m pulling out the rug from under them,” she said. “It feels terrible.”She had to tell one patient wanting to start hormone therapy that the VA could no longer help them, and is preparing the same message for trans patients on a months-long waitlist to begin treatment. While she has been looking for ways to provide alternatives, many of her trans patients live in rural areas where accessing gender-affirming care is difficult.Other VA employees see cutting trans healthcare as a betrayal of the benefits promised to service members when they enlist.“We’re asking these 17-year-olds to give their entire bodies to the US government,” said one VA nurse, who requested anonymity over fear of losing her job. “And they’re given one promise, which is that we will care for them. And this is part of care, whether you like it or not.”Gender-affirming medical care has been endorsed by every major medical association in the US, and medical providers say that politicians shouldn’t be allowed to decide how they care for their patients.“You’re giving so much to the military. You give your whole life, you have no say over where you live,” the nurse said. “Then we tell them we will take care of you, and that’s a lie. We’re lying to people – and not just trans veterans, all veterans.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryTransgenderTrump administrationLGBTQ+ rightsUS politicsHealthMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He provided no information on whether the woman was also killed, or any mention of efforts to mitigate civilian harm.JD Vance, the vice-president, responded by saying “excellent”, and Waltz replied later with emojis of a clenched fist, a US flag and a blazing flame.Strikes have targeted Sana’a, Yemen’s capital, as well as the port city of Hodeidah and the Houthi stronghold of Sa’ada. The targets include densely populated areas, but assessing the impact on civilians of the strikes – which are coordinated with and supported by UK armed forces – is difficult.MapNiku Jafarnia, a Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the Houthis had blocked off “any and all access” to bomb sites and hospitals as part of a crackdown on civil society and the media. But she added: “There is no question there are civilian casualties. Residential areas are being hit in the middle of the night, which is a sure-fire way to kill civilians.”The Houthi-run Saba news agency has said the US hastwice bombed a cancer hospitalin the country’s north and accused the US of “full-fledged war crimes by targeting civilians and civilian objects, resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries in several governorates”. Independent groups have also suggested a high degree of civilian harm.In a post on X, the Yemen Data Project, which monitors attacks in the country, said that the first week of attacks had killed at least 25 civilians, including four children. About half of the strikes had hit civilian sites, including a school, a wedding hall, residential areas and Bedouin tents, it said.Thegroup added: “The very first US strike in Yemen under the new Trump administration, carried out on the evening of 15 March (and the subject ofthatSignal group chat), hit al-Jaraf in the north of the capital, killing at least 13 civilians and injuring nine.”View image in fullscreenThe US aerial attacks on 20 March 2025 brought further destruction to Sana’a.Photograph: Mohammed Hamoud/Getty ImagesAnother monitoring group, Airwars, which tracks and analyses open-source information, hasdocumented women and children being killed and injured. TheUN says it has verifiedthat at least two boys, aged six and eight, were killed in strikes in northern Sa’ada, with a third missing.Photos of the aftermath show destroyed residential buildings, with water tanks and shredded clothes within the rubble. A​ US defence official said “battle damage assessments” were being conducted and “do not indicate civilian casualties”​. They added​: “We likely won’t have any updates until after the conclusion of operations.”A decade of violence has shattered Yemen’s already weak economy and left millions of people unable to find decent livelihoods to support their families. As a result, out of a population of roughly 36 million,about 19 million people require aid– 15 million of whom are women and children. Half of all children under five in Yemen are malnourished, according to Unicef. An aid plan for 2025 is only 6.5% funded so far.Khan, from Islamic Relief, said the recent bombings were adding pressure on to an aid sector that was already collapsing under other Trump measures. Two of the biggest factors have been thehuge cuts to USAidand the designation of the Houthisas a “foreign terrorist organisation”, which puts aid groups working in the vast Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at legal risk in the US.Humanitarian organisations are now scrambling to work out how to operate in the country without being in breach of US law and with much less funding, all in addition to an intense bombing campaign.“Overall, there has been a gradual but then sharp kind of decline in humanitarian aid to Yemen,” he said. “Obviously, many organisations are kind of downsizing and some have closed as well.“The bombings have further scared the organisations here about whether this will be the right place to stay and work. So overall, there’s a huge vacuum … taking over the humanitarian sector here,” he added. “I see a real catastrophe coming Yemen’s way.”Another aid worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said their staff were “dealing with really, so many things at the same time, which is compounding our ability to access people right now”.The Houthis, which are backed by Iran, have alreadyrestricted access and detained aid workersover the past year, creating a climate of fear among the aid community.“So all of this really impacts the way our staff feel comfortable and safe to provide services to the communities,” said the aid worker. “Yet at the same time, they are very determined to provide as many services as possible to the communities.”Washington is one of several belligerent actors in Yemen, which has suffered a decade of civil war, with several states, including neighbouring Saudi Arabia, conducting bombing campaigns.The effectiveness of strikes on the Houthis, without troops on the ground, has beenrepeatedly questionedas the group has already managed to survive years of attacks.Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisMiddle East and north AfricaUSAIDDonald TrumpJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

But first, there are more pressing challenges to address ...David ShariatmadariWed 2 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTShareEzra Klein, the New York Times podcast host and progressive media’s undisputed nerd king, starts his new book with something of a palate cleanser for our troubled times. For a few paragraphs, he and his co-author, the Atlantic journalist Derek Thompson, whisk us out of the grim reality of contemporary politics to a world ofAbundance(the word they picked as their title).“You open your eyes at dawn and turn in the cool bedsheets,” they purr, before conjuring a near-future utopia where the cost of living crisis is a distant memory. “You live in a cocoon of energy so clean it barely leaves a carbon trace and so cheap you can scarcely find it on your monthly bill.” The fridge is full of fresh fruit and vegetables from skyscraper farms that sit amid rewilded landscapes. This is what we can look forward to, they say, if we sweep away the bureaucratic cobwebs that mean government too often gets in the way of innovation, rather than leading it.This 2050 sure looks great from the vantage point of 2025, where, Klein tells me, “it feels like we are in one of the darkest imaginable timelines”. He lives in New York, but is speaking to me now from a nondescript hotel bedroom in the Bay Area, at the beginning of a busy day of book promotion. It’s hot and the curtains are drawn, his neat beard, charcoal sweater and grey-framed glasses adding to a weirdly monochrome effect. Somewhat reassuringly, his delivery is a bit more hesitant than on his podcast, theEzra Kleinshow, in which he holds forth in perfectly formed sentences.“I said, prior to the election, that this is going to be much worse than the first term,” he continues. “Donald Trump’s fundamental strength as a human being is disinhibition, for better and for worse. In his first term, he was surrounded by inhibitors, the people who staffed his White House, a Republican party he did not fully control. [For] the second term, all of the planning [was] for him to be surrounded by enablers and accelerators. Even with that, I think it’s been worse than I would have predicted.”View image in fullscreenInfluential commentators of the left … with Seth Meyers in 2017.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesIt’s a terrifying picture, and deliberately so, he says. “If you look throughout the administration, what they are doing is breaking the government over their knee so it can be put into the control of Trump and the people around him. I think almost everything else going on is noise … There is a dimension of this that is about intimidation, and Russ Vought [the head of the Office of Management and Budget] has said this. He said: You have totraumatisethe civil servants. That was the word he used: traumatise.”These are indeed extraordinary times, but the vandalism going on at a federal level must feel particularly bizarre for a journalist who has been observing and writing earnestly about policy and politics since he was a teenager. He turns 41 in May, so can no longer be described as a “wunderkind”, but he remains one of America’s most influential commentators. Plucked from the leftwing blogosphere by The American Prospect and then the Washington Post (where, by 25, he had his own assistant and was posting20 stories a dayto the paper’s Wonkblog), in 2014 he left to co-found Vox news.In 2020, he joined the New York Times, and since then has performed a sort of sense-making service for disturbed liberals, deploying a formidable ability to synthesise and clarify. But his journalism is also designed to influence the debate – something that became especially clear in the run-up to the 2024 election, when he led the drumbeat for Biden toabandon his bidfor a second term. That happened – but too late, he argues, for the vice-president to have been in with a fighting chance.Now, a book that – under a Harris administration – might have been “a friendly critique with some ideas for trying to make government in blue states and at the federal level a bit faster and more responsive” has emerged into a world that looks very different. Arguably, it has a much tougher job on its hands. Klein and Thompson’s core thesis is that government is so hamstrung by regulation, legal challenge and nimbyism that it isn’t able to make good on its promises – and that this is lethal to liberals, whose raison d’etre is to use the state to improve people’s lives.It’s the reason there’s a housing crisis in places such as New York and San Francisco (and why theprojected costof building a public toilet in the latter city hit $1.7m); why there’s still no high-speed rail in California despite the political will (and money) having been there for decades; why Biden’s $42bn for rural broadband, approved in 2021, wasbarely spentby the time he left office. There are jaw-dropping examples of sclerosis and wrong-headedness: the failure of rail to meet stringent environmental conditions, effectively forcing Californians to use a more polluting alternative, cars; public grants for housing construction with so many strings attached they can end up inflating the cost by more than the subsidy itself. There are similar problems in other advanced economies, especially Britain, which has its own recent history of 44,000-pageimpact assessmentsholding up green energy projects, and more.It adds up to a powerful case for stripping back bureaucracy – particularly given the need to rapidly roll out renewable energy infrastructure. But with the notion of tackling government inefficiency so heavily associated with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), will this agenda now be seen as toxic by the left? Is it, in fact, precisely the worst time to be making these arguments?“People keep telling me this,” Klein says, with bemused frustration. He believes the opposite is true. “[Our] central question has been filed to a razor-sharp edge by this exact moment: can liberal democracy deliver? Or is it going to be handed over to privatisers and kleptocrats?”View image in fullscreenHacking and slashing … Elon Musk wields his Doge chainsaw at CPAC.Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersActual reform – rather than wanton destruction – is all the more urgent now that we’ve seen what happens when the state fails to effect positive change. “Look, the fact that the Biden administration was not able, despite passing all this historic legislation, to deliver government improvements on a timeline people could feel, and that that helped open the door to the return of Donald Trump, who is now running a hack and slash operation to destroy government under the guise of efficiency – that isexactlywhy it is really important liberals make government work.“If you want to marginalise the most dangerous political movements, the strongmen who will come in and tell you: ‘I alone can fix it, by ignoring the laws and privatising the state’ – then you need to offer people the fruits of effective government.”It’s not like the left doesn’t have a tradition of radical action. “I think a lot about how when Medicare passed in ’65 it delivered its health insurance cards a year later. When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, it delivered health insurance four years later. This is a problem for democracy.”What if this is democracy functioning as it’s supposed to, though: preventing hasty action; stopping developers running roughshod over the views of local people; making sure power isn’t abused? The Chinese Communist party builds a lot of high-speed rail and solar farms, but is that the system we want to emulate? “I don’t want less democracy,” Klein says. “I want lessvetocracy.” He points out that the people who show up at planning meetings to protest against new affordable housing on their street aren’t the ones who will benefit from it, they’re the incumbents protecting a status quo they like. That’s fine; they should have a voice, but not the ability to wreck a project. And as for excessive caution, the pace at which challenges are developing, from climate to AI, means we may no longer have that luxury.We should elect people, they should be able to do what they promised to do, and the electorate should judge what got doneAs Klein sees it, we’ve moved from a model in whichwhatgovernments did was the thing that gave them legitimacy – the sweeping reforms of the New Deal era, for example – to a situation where we believe thathowthings are done is what makes them legitimate. In other words, we’ve become obsessed with process, rather than results. That needs to change: “I believe the way it should work is we should elect people, they should be able to do something more or less like what they promised to do, and then the electorate should be able to judge whether or not it likes the results of what got done. [If] the process is such that the thing doesn’t get done or gets done on such a long timeline that nobody can judge it, it’s actually a deformation of democracy.”Are the Democrats listening? He tells me that Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, said that “everybody needs to read Abundance”. He’s just been on Gavin Newsom’s podcast, where the California governor agreed it was the right prescription. The fact that he’s been in charge of the state since 2019 kind of suggests that he’s either just being polite, or that change is easier to talk about than to implement. But if Doge has shown us anything, it is that dramatic action, for good or ill, is indeed possible.What does the Trump succession look like, I ask. Will JD Vance cruise to the Republican nomination in 2028? “I think we’re too early to say anything serious about that. The actual condition of the country is going to really matter here, and we’re two months into this. What is it going to be like at two years, what is it going to be like in four years? I find the future very foggy.”And the Democrats? After the debacle of the Biden succession, can they get their act together and choose an effective leader? “I mean, I can tell you who looks to me like they are preparing to run, and is, you know, top tier. But again, it’s very early … Kamala Harris might run again, but my gut is she won’t. Pete Buttigieg, I think, is a very likely contender. Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Wes Moore of Maryland. Maybe Jared Polis of Colorado, maybe Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, maybe [California representative] Ro Khanna, maybe [entrepreneur] Mark Cuban.” The roll call may be long, but who will shine in a competitive primary is anyone’s guess. “Who would fit the moment if we’re in a bunch of foreign wars? Who would fit the moment if we’re in a terrible recession? Who would fit the moment if a series of disasters have happened because risk management functions the government once carried out have been so degraded that you have planes crashing and crises emerging? It’s hard to say.”One thing is clear: Klein’s job isn’t going to get any easier – or less busy – over the next four years. Does he ever get sick of talking about politics? “All the time,” he says immediately. “When I’m off the clock, I’m much more resistant than the average person is to talking about politics. I do it all day, is part of the reason. It’s exhausting. And lately politics is very dark. It takes up enough of my mental share.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PRHow does he switch off? “I mean, mostly it’s that I have very, very deep friendships and a wonderful family, and I spend time with [them]. The more intense break from the world is that I go see a fair amount of different kinds of electronic and experimental music in New York, which brings me no end of delight.” Any recommendations? He lights up a bit now, and tells me “this is all I really want to offer in interviews”. Right now he’s listening to Raven by Kelela, Rival Consoles, Max Cooper. A bit less esoterically, he reveals the top song on his “on repeat” Spotify playlist is Bon Iver’s remix of Charli xcx’s I Think About It All the Time.Given the Trump administration’s relentless attacks on the “mainstream media”, and exclusion of certain journalists from press briefings, is he worried about his own freedom of expression? I’m expecting a “no”, to be honest. This is, after all, a guy with the most comfortable berth imaginable, and a huge audience of loyal subscribers. Isn’t it alarmist to imagine a future in whichhisability to say what he wants might be shut down?“No, I think it’s something that we’re all worried about. So much as it claims to be one that prizes free speech, this is an administration that prizes the ability to enforce its own boundaries on speech, and it’s doing that in [what is] functionally a campaign of terror against immigrants and green-card holders. It sues media companies. Elon Muskcensorsthings he doesn’t like on Twitter andsayscisgender is a form of hate speech … what they care about is not freedom of speech, it’s what I callbossspeech. You can say what the boss allows you to say. God forbid you use the word ‘diversity’. God forbid you use the word ‘equity’.“I am very worried about this: a government that has this little in terms of guardrails on it, and has appointed this many people who are manifestly unqualified – except that they’re loyalists to Donald Trump – to positions like the FBI. I don’t think you have to have a particularly active historical imagination to think that that can go very badly.” I get the feeling Klein is a natural optimist, and a future of Abundance may still await us – but we certainly haven’t escaped from the darkest timeline yet.Abundance, by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, is published in the UK by Profile (£16.99) and in the US by Simon & Schuster.

Hegseth had only just left Asia, where he promised “credible deterrence” efforts by the US against China in the Indo-Pacific.Japan unveils first plan to evacuate 100,000 civilians from islands near Taiwan in event of conflictRead more“The publicity around the exercise likely also has the US in mind – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker andto deter the US from maintaining high levelsof support to Taiwan,” said Amanda Hsiao, a director in Eurasia Group’s China practice.That maintenance has been less than assured since Donald Trump took office for the second time – upending the global order and withdrawing the US from much of its role as a superpower highly involved in geopolitics.Trump’s public questioning of Taiwan’s worth, his accusations of industrial theft, and his dramatic abandonment of Ukraine had left many on the island wondering ifits most important partner might not be so reliable any more.But recent days have seen the clearest signs yet that, at least for now, the US plans to keep up its support of Taiwan’s freedom.On Sunday in Tokyo, Hegseth met his Japanese counterpart, Gen Nakatani, and declared the US was “re-establishing deterrence”, (claiming it had waned under Joe Biden – an assessment several analyst told the Guardian they disagreed with).“America is committed to sustaining robust, ready and credible deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait,” Hegseth said.It followed comments in the Philippines, where he met President Ferdinand Marcos, that the two countriesshould stand “shoulder to shoulder” to deter conflict. China is also engaged in escalating hostilities with the Philippines over disputed territory in the South China Sea.While Hegseth was still in Asia, the Washington Postreportedon a leaked internal Pentagon memo, directing the prioritisation of deterring a Chinese annexation of Taiwan, while pulling back from other regions including the Middle East and Europe, where Russia continues to wage war on Ukraine.“China is the department’s sole pacing threat, and denial of a Chinese fait accompli seizure of Taiwan – while simultaneously defending the US homeland is the department’s sole pacing scenario,” the memo reportedly said.Hegseth’s comments and the memo have provided some reassurance in Taiwan.“[They] give strong assurances to US allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific that the US will continue to be a strong military presence in the region,” said Bethany Allen, head of China investigations and analysis at ASPI, adding that the memo’s “sole pacing scenario” language about Taiwan went beyond previous US statements from any administration.“What we’re not seeing from this administration compared to previous ones, is the invocation of solidarity among democracies as a reason for US military assurances in the region,” Allen said.A Taiwanese official told the Guardian that Taiwan was deeply appreciative of Hegseth’s remarks, which the official said remained consistent with longstanding US policy on bolstering Taiwan’s military deterrence capabilities.The official also said the remarks fit with the existing trajectory of “an increasingly robust US commitment to the region”, and that Taiwan maintains “frequent and very positive” communications with the many different levels of theTrump administration. There are other signs of US support – including a recent visit to Taiwan from the Alaska governor for talks on gas sales, increases in US military training of Taiwanese soldiers, and fast-tracked deliveries of major weapons orders to Taiwan.Taiwan’s presidential office declined to comment on the reported memo. But publicly and privately the Taiwan government has stressed it has not had concerns about the US’s commitment, even if analysts say Taipei’s actions – which have included delegations sent to Washington, pledges to increase spending, andmajor new semiconductor deals– have suggested differently.Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Taiwan would have to tread carefully “not to be seen as putting the US at risk” of entering a costly war. As president, Lai has taken a more confrontational approach to cross-strait tensions than his predecessor. “Whether the Trump administration sees Taipei’s actions as escalatory matters a great deal in how it would respond to a contingency,” Daniels said.Analysts said Hegseth’s comments, while a good sign for Taiwan, should still be taken with a grain of salt. Some pointed to widespread warnings that there is some space between what US officials say and do, and what Trump says.“There’s a concern with the Trump administration that its attention shifts around, and what is promised now may not come through,” said Ja-Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore.Raymond Kuo, a political scientist at the Rand Corporation, said the comments from Hegseth reflected both a continuation and intensification of the “pivot” to Asia driven by successive administrations, but there were factional considerations.“The China hawks in the administration generally have not been the main drivers in recent foreign policy discussions, including Greenland, the Panama canal, and Canada.”Kuo warned that Trump has the final decision-making power and he has proved to be both highly transactional and to hold negative opinions of Taiwan.There is also a credibility issue. The world has seen how Trump treated Ukraine, and the global recipients of USAid assistance. Hegseth, a former national guard major and Fox News host, is also battling calls for his resignation after he shared sensitive military information to a Signal group that had mistakenly included a journalist. In messages subsequently published from the group, Hegseth accused Europe of being “pathetic” and “freeloading”.Chong said the Trump team’s treatment of partners raised questions about “how well, willing and able they are to work with allies in the region”.Beijing is of course watching. There are talks of a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping being arranged.“It will be important for Trump to deliver a clear signal of resolve to uphold the status quo when he meets with Xi,” said Ryan Hass, director of the China Center at the Brookings Institute, saying deterrence depends on capabilities and resolve.“Secretary Hegseth’s comments and reported directives are additive and helpful in this regard, but ultimately, Beijing will take the measure of President Trump.”Explore more on these topicsTaiwanAsia PacificPete HegsethTrump administrationChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Photograph: William Richards/The GuardianAmid the site in rural Jamaica that once belonged to a Guardian financier may lie a treasure trove of artefacts that tell the story of Britain’s history of colonisation and enslavementByNatricia DuncanCaribbean correspondent in Hanover, Jamaica; photographs by William RichardsWed 2 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 10.07 EDTShareStanding amid the ruins of Success, a former sugar plantation in Hanover, ruralJamaica, there is a muted silence, interrupted by the occasional rumble of a vehicle passing, overripe cocoa pods falling to the ground and green iguanas scuttling across dying leaves on the estate floor.Hidden from the lively community just outside its boundaries, the overgrown site today is a stark contrast to what would have existed there more than a century ago. One of more than800 sugar plantationsacross the island,Success was once co-owned by Sir George Philips, one of the 11 men who financed the launch of the Manchester Guardian in 1821.View image in fullscreenA brick likely to have been used in the construction of a building on the sprawling estateThe evidence of the plantation’s existence is slowly fading. And with it, memory of the horrors experienced by the enslaved Africans who were held there, toiling under the threat of unimaginable brutality to enrich individual enslavers, and the coffers of theBritish empire.All that remains are crumbling structures, potentially hiding what the Jamaican archaeologist Dr Ivor Conolley believes may be a treasure trove of artefacts and monuments that could tell a story about Jamaica and Britain’s history of colonisation and enslavement.View image in fullscreenLascelles Bailey, a local custodian of oral tradition, at the Success plantation siteView image in fullscreenDr Ivor Conolley, archaeologistDuring a visit with the Guardian, Conolley and Lascelles Bailey, a local custodian of oral tradition, identify what could be the remnants of a windmill, a sprawling and lavishly decorated great house, a septic tank and two huge water tanks.Conolley points out some extraordinary features of what might have been the plantation great house, which may indicate the wealth of the owners. “It was quite a massive house. It’s built along the hillside, which means that it’s a split-level building. Of course, it’s bushed up here now, so it’s hard to see all the features, but it’s certainly a huge building, and attractive as well, because you have … circular pillars made from stone that measure a good 3ft in diameter,” he says.Theconnections between Success and the Guardian, uncovered by independent researchers from the Wilberforce Institute at the University of Hull, also showed that the Guardian had several other links to slavery through Manchester’s cotton industry, which relied on raw cotton produced by enslaved people in the Americas.View image in fullscreenIllustration of George PhilipsIn response, theLegacies of Enslavement Programmewas launched in 2023. It has been working with people in Hanover to understand the lingering impacts of slavery and determine what an effective restorative justice programme should look like.The initiative has been welcomed by some local people such as Bailey, who has always felt a strong connection to his enslaved ancestors. The Success plantation site, he believes, is a sacred space that is still alive with an oppressive trauma that continues to torment the spirits of the enslaved.“This is not a site you should take lightly; it is not a normal place,” he says, describing how visitors have fled after being affected by the spirits and how he has had visions of the enslaved people.“I used to be down there late at night, raising cows … and find myself in a different world. If you’re afraid, you can’t stay there. I’ve seen what the slaves were doing … grinding the sugarcane. I saw thebackramaster [plantation owner] with his helmet on … This was a real thing.”For Bailey, who has been trying to protect the oral history passed down by his foreparents, the stark reminders of enslavement persist. The area where he lives, near the estate, is called Village, a name Conolley believes derives from “slave village”, where enslaved people would reside on a plantation.One form of respite from plantation life was church, and research has uncovered that some of those enslaved on Success formed part of a congregation at Gurney’s Mount.About 3 miles from the plantation, in Cold Spring (the name of another former plantation), Gurney’s Mount Baptist church is perched on the mountain overlooking lush, green valleys dotted with houses, schools and shops.View image in fullscreenGurney’s Mount Baptist churchView image in fullscreenSamuel Sharpe, a Baptist deacon and leader of a rebellion by enslaved people in 1831-32According to the researcherDr Cassandra Gooptar, the church was involved in the pivotal 1831 revolt led by the Black Baptist deacon Samuel Sharpe, described as the largest revolt by enslaved people in the British Caribbean. Popularly known as the Christmas uprising or Baptist war, it has also been touted as a catalyst for the abolition of slavery across the British empire.“What led me to Gurney’s Mount Baptist church was research on the enslaved people of Success estate. Its congregation members in the 1800s consisted of some people from the estate, with historical accounts of the Christmas uprising suggesting that a man namedGranville, who was enslaved on Success plantation and a member of that very church, was a freedom fighter who was likely executed for his role in the uprising,” Gooptar says.The church is a “poignant example that slavery is not an abstract thought dominated by dry statistics, but rather a living memory with legacies that can be seen everywhere in the Caribbean”, she adds.For Deacon Beryl Brown, a former teacher and church leader, Gurney’s Mount is still a monument of the resistance and resilience that led to the abolition of slavery, and protecting historical elements – such as the “freedom stone” that was built into its structure to commemorate the end of slavery – is important. She wants to restore the stone’s fading inscription, an important reminder, she says, of what Jamaica’s Emancipation Day on 1 August 1838 signifies.Success plantation site and Gurney's Mount Baptist church locatorBrown believes it is important to remember what happened to enslaved people who were kidnapped, shackled, dehumanised, and bullied into silence and submission. Even in the years after the trade was abolished, there were generations of people born into slavery, arriving into the world as someone else’s so-called property. “We want to know where we are coming from, so we can take a stock of where we are now and decide where we want to go,” she says.Community engagement in Jamaica, including in Village and the church, has been critical tothe Guardian’s Legacies of Enslavement Programme, according to its programme director, Ebony Riddell Bamber.“Building relationships here and understanding local people’s priorities is integral to the work. From the conversations we’ve had so far, I would say there is a general sense that people feel left behind. This probably isn’t unique to this area, but probably a common issue faced by remote, rural communities across the island,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘We want to know where we are coming from,’ says Deacon Beryl Brown, the leader of Gurney’s Mount church in Hanover“People want to see better-equipped schools, improved roads, better internet connectivity, access to an adequate supply of safe water, job opportunities – basic requirements for people to live decent lives and provide for the health and wellbeing of their families.“Even though we can’t deal with all of those things, the programme coming into the community and showing an interest – talking about the research we have uncovered into people’s forebears and asking about what priorities people have for restorative justice – is welcome.”For Sonjah Stanley Niaah, the director of the University of the West Indies’ Centre for Reparations Research, the legacies of three centuries of enslavement in Jamaica is particularly apparent in small rural communities.“Kinship and association denied, entrepreneurial endeavours denied, education denied, developmental progress denied – whether personal, collective, spiritual or cultural, economic or social, these challenges remain for descendants of former enslaved [people], and thus the reparations movement is interested in a development plan that is multigenerational,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe ‘freedom stone’ was built into the structure of Gurney’s Mount Baptist church in Hanover to mark Emancipation Day in Jamaica, 1838According to Stanley Niaah, the movement for repair must include “intergenerational development planning”. She says this should be targeted at the “superficial transformation in communities from the days of the plantation to now”, noting the lack of access to reliable running water and high-quality education in some areas.For the congregation in Gurney’s Mount church, however, it has been empowering to learn more about their history and the ancestors who fought for their freedom.Dawnette Grinion Grant says it has helped her feel more connected with ancestors who were fighting for a better life and who set the foundation for people in their community to excel.Another congregation member, DeAngelo Scott, agrees: “The new generation needs to know about their past and to be inspired by it. They could see that our ancestors went through some serious challenges and they pushed through. It tells us that we can push through too.”Younger members of the congregation, such as 10-year-old Kara Warburton, are also keen to know more about their history. “I want to know about my past and my ancestors. It’s good to know about what happened before you came and why you are here,” she says.Explore more on these topicsCotton Capital: ongoing seriesReparations and reparative justiceJamaicaAmericasSlaveryAfricaBritish empirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She invoked parliamentary privilege during the debate on the legislation, to reveal the use of NDAs at ITN to cover up cases of workplace harassment.Haigh is campaigning for the government’s policy on NDAs to be changed so it aligns with existing protections those employed in higher education institutions receive.She noted the Higher Education Act 2023 prevented universities from entering into NDAs with staff, students or visiting speakers in regards to complaints of sexual misconduct or harassment.Haigh was due to share chilling testimonies from low-paid workers who have been affected by the practice.She would discuss: “The woman who was raped by a colleague at work but had signed a confidentiality clause that prevented her from discussing the issue even with medical professionals made it impossible to recover from her trauma.“The employee who signed an NDA on leaving her workplace and has since been effectively blacklisted as her former employer is undermining her to prospective employers whilst she cannot tell her side of the story.“Or the woman who told about the mental health charity she works for, which has discriminated on disability grounds against at least four people in the last year that she is personally aware of. Three of them have signed an NDA, she is bravely pursuing them through the courts because she believes it’s the only way to get justice.”Statistics from the Can’t Buy My Silence campaign found 100% of NDAs or confidentiality clauses were written broadly. It means workers who may not think twice about signing their contracts may unwittingly overlook the broadly drafted confidentiality clauses that Haigh says “go far further than is require to protect commercial confidentiality or trade secrets”.Haigh is due to say: “Let’s not let this opportunity pass us by. Let this Labour government lead the way on protecting victims and survivors in the workplace and finally bring an end to legalised abuse.”The co-founder of Can’t Buy My Silence Zelda Perkins said: “The government has an opportunity to put Labour values into practice by legislating to protect workers’ rights and remove barriers to work by taking action on abusive NDAs. The current two-tiered situation, where only workers in higher education are protected from abusive NDAs is untenable – all workers deserve protection from being silenced in the workplace.”Explore more on these topicsEmployment lawLouise HaighHigher educationLabournewsShareReuse this content"

What he found shocked him – a rusty patched bumblebee nest. The discovery was so rare it made thelocal news.Once widespreadacross the midwest and eastern US, the rusty patched bumblebee has seen its population plungeby nearly 90%, prompting its listing in 2017 as the first federally endangered bumblebee in the US.Each spring, a solitary rusty patched bumblebee queen emerges from hibernation and starts a colony – often in anabandoned rodent burrow. She raises workers through summer, then shifts to producing males and new queens, or ‘gynes’. After mating, the gynes burrow into the soil to overwinter, while the rest of the colony dies off.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenMain image: Two rusty patched bumblebee gynes in the nest discovered by Dave Giordano in August 2023. Below: Jay Watson, a conservation biologist, observes a nest (marked with orange flags) found in a rodent burrowSince the species was listed, only a dozen nests have been documented – leaving big gaps in understanding, says Jay Watson, a conservation biologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Most bee conservation work has been focused on planting flowers, but nesting habitat is just as important, adds Amy Toth, an entomologist at Iowa State University. “If they don’t find a good location to nest, the entire colony can fail.”Finding those nests has proved exceptionally difficult, however. Scientists are spending a significant amount of time searching, and not finding any, says Watson. To improve their odds, researchers have turned to conservation detection dogs.View image in fullscreenConservation detection dog Betty White searches for bumblebee nests in the dense grass of a prairie in Waukesha, WisconsinLaura Holder, co-founder ofConservation Dogs Collective, began using labrador retrievers Ernie and Betty White to sniff out bumblebee nests four years ago. Since then, they’ve located 18 nests, though none have belonged to the rusty patched bumblebee. “Bee nests are really hard to find,” says Holder, but “the smell is always there, so the dogs can use their noses to find things we just can’t see.”View image in fullscreenLaura Holder, co-founder of Conservation Dogs Collective, and trained detection dog Ernie locate a potential bumblebee nestDespite years of searching, most nests have been found by chance – often by trained volunteers like Giordano. As part of theWisconsin Bumble Bee Brigade, a community science programme that trains people to identify and report bumblebee sightings, he recognised the nest’s significance and quickly alerted officials. “They were pretty excited when they got the video and photos,” he recalls.Time is critical when a nest is found. Researchers often have just a week or two before a colony dies back at summer’s end and is consumed by wax moths, says Watson. After the nest in Giordano’s yard expired, Watson and others carefully excavated it, tracing an extensive network of rodent tunnels. The football-sized nest – filled with spent cocoons, pollen, and dead bees – was sent for analysis.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: Volunteers watch a rusty patched bumblebee in Owen conservation park. A search was organised after several worker bees were spotted. Below: A gyne flies towards a nest created in an abandoned rodent burrow under the grassScientists estimate the nest produced as many as 1,000 bees, including up to 50 gynes –new queens that, with luck, would go on to establish colonies the following spring. “By all measures, this is what we want to see happen,” says Judy Cardin, an educator with the Wisconsin Bumblebee Brigade who helped excavate the nest.Giordano’s back yard may not have been a random choice. As executive director ofRoot-Pike Watershed Initiative Network, a nonprofit focused on restoring local habitats, he had spent years improving his land – removing invasive buckthorn and planting native wildflowers. His discovery underscores the value of back yards in bumblebee conservation.View image in fullscreenPlanting native wildflowers and avoiding the use of harmful chemicals helps to encourage the beesRecognising this, Cardin encourages homeowners to plant native wildflowers, allow natural habitat for nesting and hibernation sites and avoid applying harmful chemicals. “We might not be able to help the endangered rhinoceros,” she says, “but this is something we can do.”Toth emphasises the important role volunteers play in tracking rusty patched bumblebees and urges people to log sightings on platforms like the Wisconsin Bumblebee Brigade,Bumblebee Watch, andiNaturalist. “Your observations matter,” she says. “We’re in a cool period of time where you can just sit in your yard and participate in the conservation of endangered species.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenJade Kochanski, a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison nets a bumblebee as it feeds.

Watson and co-authors recentlypublisheda framework to help researchers quickly and consistently collect data when a nest is found. “Instead of the crazy mess that has been happening in that two-week window or so, we’re trying to get people to think about it ahead of time,” says Watson.Toth, who was not involved in the paper, welcomes the effort, calling it a much-needed roadmap for future discoveries that will help researchers better understand the species’ nesting needs as more data is collected.Whether the species can be saved remains uncertain, but researchers are cautiously optimistic.Insectscan rebound quickly, says Watson, though threats like pesticides and extreme weather are difficult to control. Toth adds that the rusty patched bumblebee has become a poster child for pollinator conservation – galvanising awareness and action. “When we get a critical mass all moving toward the same common goal,” she says, “that’s when I feel like there is hope.”View image in fullscreenResearchers are cautiously optimistic that the species can be savedBetween 24 March and 2 April, we will be profiling ashortlist of 10 of the invertebrateschosen by readers and selected by our wildlife writers from more than 2,500 nominations.

It also helped me understand, more broadly, what I really want from lifeGeorgie WedgeWed 2 Apr 2025 01.55 EDTShareI’ve never been a good liar. I can trace it back to my early school days, where my excuses for unfinished homework were never convincing, or I’d guiltily double back on even the smallest of fibs. With a knowing look, my mother would say: “Georgina …” She instilled a reverence for the truth, which was bound to the idea of doing the right thing. She wasn’t wrong: building trust is crucial in forming strong bonds in any relationship dynamic.But, like most teenagers, I gently smudged the boundaries of truth, from concealing my bellybutton piercing, to “borrowing” my brother’s car to meet a boy I fancied. Notably, my untruths were told in the knowledge that they would probably later be discovered (although I hadn’t banked on the flat tyre) and, looking back, they were often linked with an early exploration of my sexual identity.After the pandemic, and the end of a long-term relationship, I returned to the flat I shared with a friend and signed up to a dating app – using a fake name. I have always been a sucker for disguise – give me a themed party and I’m there in a wig, a cowboy hat and a fake moustache – and the app I’d chosen, Feeld,allows users to pick an alternative name, or an alter ego.Feeld promises a slightly spicier variation on online dating than usual. You can match with people looking for monogamous relationships, but also myriad other dynamics: open relationships, parties, couples looking for a third person (or “unicorn”) to join them, for example. It aims to be inclusive of all genders, sexualities and kinks in a consensual, safe setting. The pseudonyms are not intended to be duplicitous, but to create space to explore a new persona. Sign me up, I thought. Enter “Anna”.Dipping my toe in this brave new world felt like walking barefoot and drunk at Disneyland. I was greeted by people using the names of film characters, innuendoes, random objects, initials. Most had a “normal” first name – some their real name, but more often than not their middle name or, like Anna, one chosen at random. For me, dating had always been a strange liminal space between my private and public self, but this was another level.There is something joyful in becoming a different person for a small window of time. I learned a whole new language, filled with acronyms and displayed in Technicolor. As Anna, I had the armour to reveal for the first time – publicly, but also to myself – what I wanted to explore romantically, including dating men and women. It felt overwhelming, but also thrilling.Under the “wig” of Anna, I could feel myself being more relaxed with my matches. Disguise is sexy and inherently comical, so it helped bring humour to my connections. The quality of conversation was much better than I’d had on more “traditional” dating apps, which sometimes seem set up to regurgitate a CV in place of a profile. I knew my matches and I wouldn’t easily be able to look up each other on social media and I found I made fewer assumptions based on information such as job titles, which were not shared as a matter of course.I should caveat that, as with any dating app, having a different name didn’t make me immune from the many pitfalls of modern dating. Anna certainly wasn’t a one-stop solution to avoiding the shame or scrutiny that women, in particular, can often encounter within a romantic or sexual context. But using a fake name felt like a communal entry point; after I’d clicked with someone, I would always reveal my real name and they would reveal theirs. I enjoyed the ceremony of this moment – it felt like cracking open a Terry’s chocolate orange at Christmas.“Anna” was hungry for adventure and keen to chase the fun of dating; she became the Trojan horse in some of my most ridiculous quests. It was a mindset that seemed to stick, even once my real name had been disclosed. I discovered many interesting, funny people operating under pseudonyms, including doctors, lawyers, TV writers and comedians who wanted, perhaps, some detachment from their professional selves.For now, I’m lying dormant in the app, satisfied with a change of hair colour as my latest reinvention. I still believe there is value in seeing yourself through someone else’s eyes – and that can be hard to do when using a birth name, which tends to be tightly intertwined with your identity and experiences. Using a pseudonym may have started as a way for me to embrace my sexuality and discover alternative relationships, but it helped to sharpen my focus on what I want from life more broadly. It gave me a renewed confidence, which, in itself, feels like the kind of romance that is rare to find on the apps.Per-Verse, written and performed by Georgie Wedge, is at Riverside Studios, London, 3-19 AprilExplore more on these topicsLife and styleA moment that changed meDatingSexualityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week, Marine Le Pen, the parliamentary leader of theNational Rally(RN), the largest opposition party in the French parliament, was banned for five years from public office for embezzlement. Along with more than 20 others, she was found to have used money for European parliament assistants to pay party workers.The shock sentence could end Le Pen’s hopes of running for president in 2027. She is now appealing and has hit back furiously, as have her supporters and allies. Some of her support could hurt her more than it helps, however. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in response that “more and more European capitals are going down the path of violating democratic norms”. While Donald Trump and Viktor Orbán have also weighed in.Angelique Chrisafis, the Guardian’s Paris correspondent, tellsHelen Piddhow this could play out. RN has tried hard to detoxify itself and distance itself from its antisemitic past under the leadership of Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, she says, and has also positioned itself as an anti-corruption party.But will supporters think this reputation is now in tatters – or could it lead to conspiracy theories? Chrisafis says it is hard to say whether the court case will hinder or help the far right inFrance. “I think this is an absolutely historic moment for France,” she says, “and it’s not quite clear where that’s going to lead”.Photograph: Jumeau Alexis/ABACA/REX/ShutterstockExplore more on these topicsMarine Le PenToday in FocusFranceThe far rightEuropeNational Rally"

It’s essential to act with purpose and with force and that’s what we’ll do.”Already, Canada had put a 25% tax on C$30bn ($21bn) worth of US goods in response to Trump’s tariffs. Among the products targeted are spirits, wine and orange juice – items meant to inflict targeted economic pain. The federal government has repeatedly pledged to keep its retaliatory measures until the US lifts all levies on Canadian products.Carney warned that while Trump had preserved key elements of the bilateral relationship, the global tariffs announced earlier in the day “fundamentally change the international trading system”.The prime minister is expected to outline the next stages of Canada’s response on Thursday. According to the prime minister’s office, a meeting of Carney’s cabinet will follow. The Liberal leader is also expected to meet virtually with Canada’s premiers.Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association posted on social media the result was “like dodging a bullet into the path of a tank”.“The. Auto. Tariff. Package. Will. Shut. Down. The. Auto. Sector. In. The. USA. And. In. Canada,” he wrote. “Don’t be distracted. 25% tariffs are 4 times the 6/7% profit margins of all the companies. Math, not art.”Liberation from what? Trump promised lower prices – his tariffs risk the oppositeRead moreCandace Laing, head of Canada’s Chamber of Commerce said in a statement the world was “waking up today to a reality that Canada has been living with for months” and that the tariffs mean businesses around the world “have had their uncertainty expanded … chain reaction of tariffs and counter-tariffs will have a real and distressing economic impact on Americans, Canadians and the global economy.”It is unclear the extent to which an“extremely productive” telephone callbetween Trump and Carney last week influenced the decision to grant a reprieve to Canada. The call, requested by the White House, was the first time the two leaders have spoken since Carney became prime minister on 14 March.Carney had previously said he would not speak to the president until Trump showed respect for Canada’s independence. “I’m available for a call, but we’re going to talk on our terms. As a sovereign country – not as what he pretends we are – and on a comprehensive deal.”The sprawling tariffs, some of which apply toremote and uninhabited islands, have rattled markets and Canadian officials were planning for levies that could devastate manufacturing hubs and resource-based economies.“The positive thing that I saw was we weren’t on that list,” Ontario premier Doug Ford told reporters at Queen’s Park. “Let’s hope that there’s some positive news coming.”The much-hyped announcement from the White House has alreadythrown a wrench in the federal election campaign. Carney flew from Winnipeg back to Ottawa on Tuesday night in order to convene a virtual meeting of business and union leaders who are part of the Canada-US Relations Council.In a handout, the White House said the president’s use of the international emergency economic powers act remained in effect – a declaration made in reference to the alleged movement of both migrants and fentanyl over the border.None of the items that comply with the continental free trade agreement will be taxed, the White House said, but “non-compliant goods” will have a 25% levy and energy and potash products will have a 10% tariff imposed. If the emergency order was rescinded, all “non-compliant” goods would face a 12% tax.The news pushed Canada’s dollar up, a currency that has over the last few months been depressed by the ongoing trade war.Canada has repeatedly argued a minuscule amount of the fentanyl in the US from the north. In new figures published by the Globe and Mail, the US border agency attributed less than one pound of seized fentanyl to Canada, or 0.13% of all seizures.Canada’s efforts to reach key voices in the US has met some success. On Wednesday evening, a bipartisan group of senators passed a resolution to end the national fentanyl emergency the president invoked earlier this year in order to justify the 25% tax on Canadian imports.The move, which attracted Republican senators Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Rand Paul to across the political aisle, is seen as a strong rebuke to Trump. But the vote is likely to be largely symbolic. House speaker Mike Johnson is unlikely to bring the measure to a vote.Explore more on these topicsCanadaTrump tariffsAmericasInternational tradeGlobal economyMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

For decades America had been “looted, pillaged and raped” by its trading partners, he said. “In many cases, the friend is worse than the foe.”Over the past few months, Trump has rattled global stock markets, alarmed corporate executives and economists, and triggered heated rows with the US’s largest trading partners by announcing and delaying plans to impose tariffs on foreign imports several times since taking office.But for the start of what appears to be a dramatic shift in American trade policy, one that could cause ricochets in the global economy, Trump tried to sell the tariffs with a celebratory tone.Nine giant US flags flanked Trump on stage in the Rose Garden, as the president spoke in front of his cabinet and a crowd of union workers wearing hard hats and fluorescent construction worker vests. Before Trump came on stage, a marine band played celebratory music to excite the crowd.At one point, Trump paused his speech to throw a Maga hat into the crowd. In the next breath, he announced the 10% universal baseline tariff.In the middle of his hour-long speech, the president displayed a chart that showed the “unfair” fees that countries placed on the US, alongside the new “USA Discounted Reciprocal Tariffs”. China charged the US 67% in “unfair” fees, and said the US would now levy a 34% fee. The EU charges 39% on imports, according to the White House, and will now be levied at 20%. Trump said the UK would be charged 10% – the baseline tariff – equal to the Trump administration’s calculations of the UK’s fees on US imports.Special exceptions were made for Canada andMexico, though the countries were previously targets of proposed broad tariffs. The White House said that goods covered by an existing trade deal with Canada and Mexico will continue to see no tariffs.Trump said the tariff calculations also include “currency manipulation and trade barriers”, though the White House has not elaborated on how it calculated the new tariffs.It appears Trump has zeroed in on the industry-specific tariffs the countries have placed on American exports. In his speech, Trump criticized policies like the EU’s ban on imported chicken, Canadian tariffs on dairy and Japan’s levies on rice.Trump said the US would charge half of the fees he feels trading partners unfairly impose on the US because the US people are “very kind”. The countries have “placed massive tariffs on [US] products and created non-monetary tariffs to decimate our industries”, Trump said, calling them “common sense reciprocal tariffs”.“Reciprocal: that means they do it to us and we do it to them. Very simple, can’t get any more simple than that,” he said. “This indeed will be the golden age of America,” he said.Trump was ultimately following through with a promise he made during the election: on the campaign trail, Trump floated the idea of a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods.The new tariffs come on top of a lineup of levies that Trump has already implemented: an additional 20% tariff on all Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. There is also a 10% tariff on energy imports fromCanada.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the implementation of his tariffs has so far been haphazard, with multiple rollbacks and delays, and vague promises that have yet to come to fruition.But the threats have soured US relations with its largest trading partners. Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, has called them“unjustified”and pledged to retaliate. The European Union has said it has a“strong plan” to retaliate. Other retaliatory tariffs could eventually lead to higher prices that would hurt American exporters.The US stock market closed slightly up on Wednesday, ahead of Trump’s announcement, with a slight boost from news that Elon Musk may step away from his role in the White House soon to focus on his businesses.Even with the slight upswing, two of the three major stock exchanges saw theirworst quarterin more than two years after Monday marked the end of the first quarter.In March, consumer confidenceplungedto its lowest level in over four years.Pollshave shown that tariffs are unpopular with Americans, including Republicans. Only 28% of people in apollfrom Marquette Law School released Wednesday said that tariffs help the economy.The uncertainty around Trump’s tariff policies have increased the likelihood of arecession, according to recent forecasts from economists at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and other banks.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsCanadaMexiconewsShareReuse this content"

These incidents have been credited to vague or unspecified visa issues, but have frequently affected individuals who have criticised the Trump administration either publicly or in messages on their phone read by immigration officers.French scientist denied US entry after phone messages critical of Trump foundRead more“When I go to play music in Europe, if I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,” Young wrote. “That is happening all the time now. Countries have new advice for those returning to America.”Young will tour across Europe in June and July – his first shows on the continent in six years – before returning to the US in August.“If I come back from Europe and am barred, can’t play my USA tour, all of the folks who bought tickets will not be able to come to a concert by me,” he wrote. “That’s right folks. If you say anything bad about Trump or his administration, you may be barred from re-entering USA if you are Canadian. If you are a dual citizen like me, who knows? We’ll all find that out together.”Young has a long history of protesting against Trump. In 2015, he said the then-presidential candidate was “not authorised” to use his track Rockin’ In the Free World during a campaign launch – and laterfiled a lawsuitto prevent Trump from using his music.“Imagine what it feels like to hear Rockin’ in the Free World after this president speaks, like it is his theme song,” he wrote at the time. “I did not write it for that.”After Young became a US citizen in 2020, during Trump’s first term, he penned an open letter calling the president “a disgrace to my country”.He doubled down on his website, writing: “If the fact that I think Donald Trump is the worst president in the history of our great country could stop me from coming back, what does that say for Freedom? … Remember Freedom of Speech?”In recent weeks, theBritish punk band UK Subsand aFrench scientisthave been detained and denied entry to the US; both parties had previously expressed criticism of the Trump administration. The government has also taken actionagainst foreign student activists.I’m the Canadian who was detained by Ice for two weeks.

Denmark and Finland have urged cautionto trans and non-binary travellers, Germany has emphasised that a visa or entry waiver does not guarantee entry to the US, andthe UKappears to have revisited their US travel advisory, advising that anyone found breaking US entry rules could face arrest or detention.On Tuesday, Young rallied against what he saw as “spineless” acts of enforcement.“It seems that those who speak out freely with their own opinions are now vulnerable to a non-existent Trump law,” he wrote, “that makes it possible for you to go to jail or be detained, punished in some way for not showing allegiance to what?”Young concluded by invoking the pledge of allegiance. “One country, indivisible, with Liberty and Freedom for all,” he said. “Remember that?

The tourism sector has been heavily affected and only major resorts have back up generators. Hospitals, schools and households have also struggled with regular interruptions to power supplies..Explainer: what will the withdrawal of USAid mean for the Pacific?Read moreOn Monday, Fiame warned the crisis could wipe off about 16% off the national economy this year due to “severe disruptions” to public services and economic activity.Business owner Filisitia Fa’alogo, who runs a small shop on the southern side of Upolu, is among those to suffer heavy losses. Fa’alogo told theGuardian she had just bought over US$500 worth of frozen goods when the power outages began more than two weeks ago.“Initially the ice was able to hold up the goods, but after the second day, I literally had to give the meat away to save it from spoiling,” Fa’alogo said.The loss meant she could not make a profit for the month, as she only sells basics to the local villages, such as milk, bread, butter and canned goods.“This is just outrageous, this is a bare necessity I need to run my village store,” she said.Fa’alogo is just one of many business owners who have suffered as a result of the failure of the power sector. More than 90% of businesses have experienced frequent outages, with 70% facing disruptions multiple times per week, according to a survey by the Samoa Chamber of Commerce and Industry conducted in mid-March. Firms reported equipment damage and significant revenue losses. More than half of the businesses reported losses exceeding $1,000 tala ($350) per incident.Power outages are not unusual in Samoa, but they are usually associated with cyclones. It is rare for them to occur island-wide and drag on for such a long period of time.The crisis has been caused by multiple technical issues, including the breakdown of key generators at the Fiaga power station on Upolu island, and a fault in a crucial underground transmission cableThese problems, compounded by ageing infrastructure and delays in acquiring replacement parts, led to widespread electricity outages across Upolu. At one point, the entire island was without power.The state of emergency declared on Monday will run for 30 days. Authorities have begun efforts to urgently restore power supplies and support affected homes and businesses. Full power restoration across Upolu is expected before the end of April. Permanent generators aren’t due to be ready for use until August.Pacific business sustainability expert Tupa’imatuna FotuoSamoa said the persistent power failures have harmed Samoa’s economy.“There is significant impact on business … continued disruptions can have long-term impacts for many in our community.”“While it’s welcome news that there is consideration for relief, such as importing generators, you need to think broader, not just relying on hydropower but incentivising other means of power generation nationally.”Explore more on these topicsSamoaPacific islandsAsia PacificEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Humanitarian agencies urged other countries to increase aid before the monsoon rains.Close to the epicentre, in thedevastated cities of Mandalayand Sagaing, traumatised survivors slept in the street, with the stench of corpses trapped under the rubble permeating the disaster zone. Water, food and medicine are in short supply, and the monsoon could hit in May.View image in fullscreenA woman resting at a temporary roadside shelter in Mandalay.Photograph: Nyein Chan Naing/EPA“The devastating impact of Friday’s earthquake is becoming clearer by the hour – this is a crisis on top of a crisis for Myanmar, where the humanitarian situation is already dire,” said Arif Noor, the Myanmar country director for the humanitarian agency Care.“Rescue teams are still recoveringthose trapped under the rubble, and hospitals are overwhelmed. The physical and mental scars of this catastrophe will last for decades.”Friday’s powerful quake is the latest in a succession of blows for the impoverished country of 53 million, which has been plagued by a civil war since the military seized power in a 2021 coup.‘It’s beyond description’: Bodies pile up in mass graves as Myanmar grapples with quake tollRead moreThe junta said on Wednesday that it was declaring a temporary ceasefire until 22 April to facilitate relief efforts, a day after armed resistance groups opposed to military rule declared unilateral temporary ceasefires.In its nightly news bulletin on Tuesday, the state-controlled MRTV quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying the military had halted its offensives but that unspecified minority ethnic armies were planning to exploit the disaster. “The military is aware they are gathering, training and preparing to attack,” it said, quoting the general as saying at an event to raise funds for quake victims: “We consider it as attacking us and will respond accordingly.”View image in fullscreenPeople bathing in the Irrawaddy River in front of a collapsed bridge in Sagaing.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesThe UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said: “We must act swiftly to provide relief before the upcoming monsoon season, which, of course, will even worsen this horrendous crisis.”In addition to those killed, more than 4,500 people were injured and 441 remained missing, according to Min Aung Hlaing. “Among the missing, most are assumed to be dead. There is a narrow chance for them to remain alive,” he said in a speech.Some agencies say the unofficial death toll could be as high as 10,000.Aftermath of the Myanmar earthquake – a visual guideRead moreUN agencies said hospitals were overwhelmed and rescue efforts hindered by infrastructure damage and the civil war.Julie Bishop, the UN special envoy for Myanmar, urged all sides to immediately cease fire, permit humanitarian access and ensure aid workers are safe. “Continuing military operations in disaster-affected areas risks further loss of life,” she said in a statement.Residents and representatives of Myanmar’s exiled opposition National Unity Government (NUG) have accused the junta of continuing to drop bombs in the wake of the disaster, and ofblocking emergency aidto areas that are beyond the military government’s control.1:32'We have to go on': Bangkok pushes on with quake rescue despite 'no signs of life' – video“[On Monday], five bombs were dropped around Nwe Khwe village. Although there were no casualties from that, the public is already traumatised by the earthquake,” said Ye Lay, 21, from Chaung-U, a town in the region of Sagaing.“Because of the earthquake damage people are staying outside their homes, and when bombs are dropped, they have to take shelter in trenches,” she said. “If an earthquake strikes, we can’t run away, so people are experiencing a profound sense of insecurity.”Amnesty International said it had received testimony corroborating reports of airstrikes near areas where quake recovery efforts were focused. “You cannot ask for aid with one hand and bomb with the other,” said Amnesty’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.The junta has declared a week of national mourning, with flags to fly at half mast on official buildings until 6 April “in sympathy for the loss of life and damages”.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarEarthquakesAsia PacificNatural disastersSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

In contrast to Tuesday’s drills, the PLA said it would use live fire on Wednesday but Taiwan’s defence ministry said it did not detect any near its territory.Hegseth indicates US backing for Taiwan – but it is transactional Trump who has the final wordRead more“The exercises focus on subjects of identification and verification, warning and expulsion, and interception and detention so as to test the troops’ capabilities of area regulation and control, joint blockade and control, and precision strikes on key targets,” it said in a statement.On Wednesday the US state department saidit remained committed to Taiwanand other allies and partners “in the face of China’s intimidation tactics and destabilising behaviour”.“Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk,” it said. “The United States supports peace and stability across the Taiwan strait and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo, including through force or coercion.”Japan and the European Union also expressed concern.“The EU has a direct interest in the preservation of the status quo in the Taiwan strait. We oppose any unilateral actions that change the status quo by force or coercion,” an EU spokesperson said.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China “firmly opposed” such comments, and that Taiwan was an “internal” Chinese matter.China’s maritime safety administration announced late on Tuesday a closed zone for shipping due to military drills until Thursday night in an area off the north part of the eastern province of Zhejiang, more than 310 miles (500 km) from Taiwan.A senior Taiwanese defence official said that was outside Taiwan’s “response zone”.A statement from the Chinese military later on Wednesday said it had completed its exercises. Taiwan’s defence department said it had detected 23 navy and coastguard vessels, and 36 war planes around the island that day.China’s Communist party (CCP) claims Taiwan is a province which must be “reunified” with the mainland, and has not ruled out using force to do so. Analysts believe the PLA is not yet capable of the required full-scale invasion, but in the meantime it routinely launches grey zone tactics, military drills, economic, legal and cyberwarfare, and disinformation campaigns.In a series of statements, Chinese government officials have said the drills were targeted at “separatist” activity by Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, who last month designated China a “hostile foreign force” and announced 17 measures to counter its influence and espionage operations.It also announced a codename for the drills, “Strait Thunder-2025A”, in line with previous drills which contained suffixes suggesting they planned to hold more this year. On Tuesday China’s nationalistic tabloid the Global Times had said these drills were deliberately not named in order to show that such exercises were entirely normalised.Maj Gen Meng Xiangqing, professor at the PLA National Defence University, told the state broadcaster CCTV: “As long as Taiwan independence separatists dare to cross the line, the PLA will definitely act.”The drills have been accompanied by widely distributed propaganda materials, including videos depicting an attack on Taiwan, and a cartoon depicting Lai as a bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. A propaganda poster on Tuesday was titled “closing in”. On Wednesday a second one was released titled “paralysis”.In the face of growing CCP aggression, Lai has been more assertive in his approach to cross-strait tensions than his predecessor. His party – the pro-sovereignty DPP – and the opposition KMT are opposed to CCP rule over Taiwan, although they differ in opinion on how to maintain peace. Taiwan’s public is also overwhelmingly opposed to CCP rule. The CCP, however, claims it has historical sovereignty over Taiwan and that the majority of people – counting the 1.4 billion in China – support “reunification”.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But it is necessary to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”The New Zealand prime minister,Christopher Luxon, launched an investigation last week when the incident came to light.“That is incredibly distressing and incredibly concerning,” he said.“As a parent you identify with what is a horrific set of circumstances.

It claimed Australia imposed a 10% tariff on US goods, “including currency manipulation and other trade barriers”.He said America would impose a broad 10% reciprocal tariff in return.The US and Australia have a free-trade agreement, signed in 2005. Australian goods go into the US without tariffs and American goods come into Australia without tariffs.Australia was not singled out for particular tariff treatment: the 10% tariff is a baseline global tariff that will be imposed on all foreign imports from one minute after midnight on Saturday morning, the White House said in a statement.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterTrump did, however, in his speech single out Australia’s ban on the import of US beef – imposed in 2003 after the US had cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.“Australia bans – and they’re wonderful people – but they ban American beef,” Trump said.“Yet we imported $3bn of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won’t take any of our beef. They don’t want it because they don’t want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don’t blame them, but we’re doing the same thing right now, starting at midnight tonight.”Beef is a significant Australian export to the US – Australian lean beef is added to fatty American meat to make hamburgers. United Nations Comtrade data shows meat products were Australia’s largest export to the US in 2024, worth more than $4.03bn.Australian leaders respondAnthony Albanese, said Australia had made “strong representations” to the US in an attempt to dissuade Trump’s administration from imposing tariffs on Australia and it had not been specifically targeted as other nations were.“No one has got a better deal. That doesn’t mean it’s a good thing [but] it’s very clear that president Trump was determined to go down this road,” the prime minister said.Albanese called Trump’s new regime illogical and self-harming, but confirmed his government would not respond with reciprocal tariffs.Trump’s wall of tariffs is likely to raise prices and cause chaos for businessRead more“President Trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. A reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10%,” Albanese said.“The administration’s tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations’ partnership. This is not the act of a friend.”Albanese said the US announcement would add to uncertainty in the global economy.“It will push up costs for American households,” he said. “This is why our government will not be seeking to impose reciprocal tariffs. We will not join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth. We will stand up for Australia.”The prime minister said Australia would not weaken its biosecurity regime in response to tariffs or a potential ban on Australian beef imports to the US.“We have made it very clear to the United States that we will not compromise on biosecurity,” Albanese said. “We will not weaken the measures that protect our farmers and producers from the risks of disease or contamination.”The opposition leader,Peter Dutton, said Australia’s relationship with the US “hasn’t been treated with respect” by Trump and his administration, but couldn’t immediately say specifically what he would do differently or how he’d secure a better outcome if he won the election.He repeated Labor’s lines that the tariffs would hurt American consumers and businesses, particularly singling out beef due to low production in the United States. He also claimed Australia had “leverage” in negotiations due to the Aukus deal, American troops being stationed in northern Australia, and our deposits of critical minerals.But the Liberal leader said “we’re not trading anything away” when asked if he would put the American troops or Aukus deal on the table in negotiations. The Labor government says it already did offer a critical minerals arrangement in negotiations, which was not successful.Instead Dutton said more broadly that Australia could be “providing assurances” to American navy assets, including in defence industry production, and had “capacity to contribute” to US defence. Dutton later denied this would be “kowtowing” to American pressure.Dutton also said the news media bargaining code and the ban on under-16s using social media, two key Australian initiatives which big tech companies have complained to Trump about, were “non-negotiable”.Trump rebuffs calls for exemptionsAustralia appears to be one of the least-affected countries under Trump’s new global tariff regime. Countries such as China (34%), India (26%) and Vietnam (46%) were specifically singled out. The EU was hit with a 20% tariff rate.Australia had made consistent entreaties to be exempted from the tariff regime, arguing it was an ally which runs a trade deficit with the US and which has had a signed and ratified free-trade agreement for two decades.These have been rebuffed by Trump’s hardline second administration, which says the president regrets the exemptions he gave to Australia in his first term, particularly for the precedent they set for other countries claiming similar carve-outs.Trump said the US would demand foreign tariffs and trade barriers be dropped before he would consider amending or removing the US’s tariffs.“To all of the foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors and everyone else who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs, I say – terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers, don’t manipulate your currencies … and start buying tens of billions of dollars of American goods.”He urged companies to move plants and factories to the US.“If you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product in America.”In his wide-ranging address from the White House, Trump declared the tariffs would spark a “golden age” for America.“My fellow Americans, this is liberation day: April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again, going to make it wealthy, good and wealthy.“For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike.”He said jobs and factories would “come roaring back into our country”.Concern over any penalty for Australian beefThe singling out by Trump of Australia’s ban on US beef imports has raised concerns in the Australian industry. It follows theUS trade representativethis week identifying Australia’s beef import ban as an unjustified trade barrier.The US has long regarded American beef as safe and has argued that Australia’s continuing ban on US imports is a protectionist measure, rather than a legitimate biosecurity concern.Guardian Australia understands US officials have confirmed to Australia’s embassy in Washington that there will be no ban on Australian beef.Rednote used to spread false claims about ‘wicked’ policy on Chinese Australians and citizenshipRead moreSimon Stahl, the chief executive of the Northern Co-operative Meat Company based in northern New South Wales, told the ABC he supported lifting the ban on US beef imports if it was deemed safe.“If the science says that it’s safe to eat American beef, I think we should allow US beef into our market … the impact on our market would be very minor. Australian beef is obviously preferred, so I think it would be very minor.”But Stahl said any US move to ban, restrict or impose tariffs on Australian beef into the US would be significant for Australian producers.“It’s our largest market at present and we’ll continue to be for some time. The US herds are at probably 70-year lows, so demand for Australian beef is at a record.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsEconomic policyAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseLabor partyCoalitionAustralian election 2025newsShareReuse this content"

It found that the babies directly treated with antibiotics at birth had less of a group of beneficial gut bacteria known asBifidobacterium.The reduction inBifidobacteriumwas linked to lower antibody levels against multiple components of the pneumococcal vaccine, as well asHaemophilus influenzaetype b, at both seven and 15 months.Prof David Lynn, a program director at the South AustralianHealthand Medical Research Institute, who co-led the research, saidBifidobacteriumwas commonly found in the healthy infant gut in the first weeks of life.“They are particularly well adapted to metabolising human milk oligosaccharides [a type of carbohydrate] in breast milk, and so you’ll see high rates of those bacteria in infants that are breastfed,” he said.Lynn, also a professor of systems immunology at Flinders University, said the bacteria gave the immune system “an extra kick”, priming it for an optimal antibody response to vaccines.“What we think is probably most important is the composition of the microbiome around the time of vaccination,” he said. “Antibiotics can disrupt the normal colonisation by bifidobacteria and allow other types of bacteria to colonise the intestine instead.”The research also studied immunity in germ-free mice, finding that antibody responses to the pneumococcal vaccine strongly depended on the presence ofBifidobacteriumand improved when the mice were given a probiotic containing the bacteria.Study casts doubt on gluten as cause of gut ailments among non-coeliacsRead moreThe study, involving researchers from 12 institutions across Australia, did not find reduced vaccine responses in babies whose mothers received antibiotics during labour, suggesting direct antibiotic treatment in newborns had a more persistent impact on the gut microbiome.Lynn said the study results should not “unduly worry” parents of newborns treated with antibiotics. “There’s usually very good reason for giving the neonates those antibiotics, given that infections and sepsis in that critical early life period can be very serious.”The antibiotic-treated newborns still mounted “pretty decent responses to all of the vaccines,” he said. “Around that seven-month time point, most of the infants are above what’s called the seroprotective threshold, so they will be expected to be protected against infection.“What does seem to happen is that, over time, those responses wane a bit quicker in the infants that directly have antibiotics.”The study had a “relatively modest” sample size, the authors noted, and did not include babies who had been born via caesarean section.In the coming months, the researchers will commence a clinical trial to test whether giving antibiotic-treated newborns a probiotic containingBifidobacteriumwould improve antibody responses to routine vaccinations.The probiotic is safe and already widely used in hospitals to protect preterm infants against a condition called necrotising enterocolitis.Explore more on these topicsScienceHealth (Australia news)Health (Society)newsShareReuse this content"

It also handles the majority of court notices in the state, such as family violence intervention orders.More than 12,000 family violence intervention orders issued in Victoria with crucial words missingRead moreOne former senior courts employee, who was not authorised to speak publicly, said the changes would unwind progress made to reduce the backlog in cases since the Covid-19 pandemic.There will almost certainly be an influx in more cases given the Allan government has cracked down on bail, the former staffer said.“That’s where I go ‘Oh oh, this is kinda crazy’, given where we’re at with a youth crime wave,” they said.“I appreciate this is a difficult decision to make, given the budget situation in Victoria … we’re at a stage where it’s like ‘What is the best bad decision’.”But the former insider saidthe recent issue with family violence notices uncovered last monthshowed the importance of the work court staff were expected to do and the cost associated with getting it wrong.Documents regarding the redundancies show that five legal policy staff positions will be made redundant and that there will also be cuts to the Family Violence Detail Strategy, Evidence & Reporting team.“As the implementation of the Family Violence reforms and most of the reporting driven by the Royal Commission have now concluded, there would be a reduction in resourcing for this team,” the document said.The cuts underline a fundamental challenge for the Victorian government: how to respond to constant clamouring about public safety while crippled by state debt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Keir Starmer’s more conciliatory approach to the Trump administrationappeared to have paid off.However, the UK’s growth forecasts are likely to be downgraded as a result, and the tariffs could cost thousands of jobs and force the government to implement further spending cuts or tax rises in autumn.UK ministers have ruled out imposing retaliatory barriers while talks on an economic deal with the US continue, and are hoping for further carve-outs for UK companies, which export more than £60bn worth of goods to the US each year.Trump’s wall of tariffs is likely to raise prices and cause chaos for businessRead moreIn a watershed announcement for global trade, Trump announced that he was setting a universal “baseline” 10% tariff on imports into the US, while hitting dozens of trading partners with higher levies of up to 50%.He also hit out at “exorbitant” VAT rates, which he viewed as a barrier to US firms seeking to sell into markets such as the UK where the taxes apply.At a press conference in the White House Rose Garden, he said: “For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike … our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen any more.“This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our declaration of economic independence. For years, hard-working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, but now it’s our turn to prosper.”Addressing a crowd including his vice-president, JD Vance, the cabinet, White House aides and US workers, Trump added: “This will be, indeed, the golden age of America. It’s coming back, and we’re going to come back very strongly.”After the announcement, Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, said: “The US is our closest ally, so our approach is to remain calm and committed to doing this deal, which we hope will mitigate the impact of what has been announced today.Perilous and chaotic, Trump’s ‘liberation day’ imperils the world’s broken economy – and him | Martin KettleRead more“We have a range of tools at our disposal and we will not hesitate to act … nobody wants a trade war and our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table and the government will do everything necessary to defend the UK’s national interest.”A No 10 source said: “We don’t want any tariffs at all, but a lower levy than others vindicates our approach. It matters because the difference between 10% and 20% is thousands of jobs.”Earlier, Starmer had told MPs the government was“prepared for all eventualities”and while all options were on the table he would avoid any kneejerk response.UK officials are understood to have reached broad agreement with US counterparts on a trade deal, focusing on technology but including other sectors, which they hope will eventually reduce tariffs. However, they acknowledged getting a trade deal over the line could take weeks or months.There is also a risk of the UK being flooded by cheap goods from countries such as China as trade is diverted from the US to other markets, and the government is drawing up plans to protect key industries such as pharmaceuticals, cars, food and drink.“A trade war is in nobody’s interest, and the country deserves, and we will take, a calm, pragmatic approach,” Starmer told MPs at prime minister’s questions.“That is why constructive talks are progressing to agree a wider economic prosperity deal with the US. That is why we are working with all industries and sectors likely to be impacted.“Our decision will always be guided by our national interests, and that’s why we have prepared for all eventualities, and we will rule nothing out.”He added: “It is important at moments like this that we don’t have kneejerk reactions, that we are cool-headed about this.”However, Rachel Reeves revealed the UK was in talks with trading partners about how to respond, and had spoken to the European trade commissioner, Valdis Dombrovskis, about the EU’s plans to retaliate with their own tariffs.The chancellor insisted the UK would not jeopardise the possibility of its own economic deal with the US by “posturing” in response to tariffs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prize on offer is a good economic agreement between us and the United States. We are not going to do anything to put that in jeopardy,” she told the Treasury select committee.But she warned that the UK would not be “out of the woods” even if it secured a deal, as the main impact on the British economy would be from global tariffs rather than UK-specific ones, thanks to depressed demand and higher inflation in other countries.Business groups and unions reacted with dismay to the announcement. The Institute of Directors’ Emma Rowland said: “The implementation of these ‘liberation day’ tariffs will be a blow to British businesses, eliminating any hopes that the UK would be able to avoid the crosshairs of the global trade war.“The UK government has so far sought to pursue constructive engagement with the US administration and with other trading partners. We are supportive of this pragmatic and level-headed approach.”Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “Donald Trump has just made the strongest possible argument for the UK to positively reset its economic relationship with the EU, our largest market. In the face of punitive and arbitrary tariffs, the government must do everything it can to protect British jobs and industry.”In its economic forecast last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that the most “severe” scenario, in which the UK and other nations retaliated to US tariffs, would result in GDP being 0.6% lower than expected this year and 1% lower next year.An alternative scenario, in which the UK did not retaliate, would mean a smaller reduction in growth, with GDP 0.4% lower than expected this year and 0.6% lower next year.Despite repeated criticism of Canada and Mexico, the US’s two closest trading partners,Donald Trumpdid not announce any “reciprocal tariffs” on the two North American countries.The US dollar was falling sharply against key currencies on Wednesday evening. The dollar had dropped about 0.7% against the pound, at 0.768, shortly after the speech began.Trump confirmed a previously announced 25% tariff on cars imported into the US, set to come into effect early on Thursday, hitting a UK export market to the US worth £6.4bn, which includes luxury car manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin.The US president has already imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and industry bosses have warned that customers were already looking for alternative suppliers and in some cases cancelling orders.The White House’s tariff wars also risk reopening simmering Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland, which has continued to apply EU customs laws since Brexit, meaning splits between London and Brussels over the response to US tariffs could drive a wedge between it and the rest of the UK.EU retaliatory tariffs on US imports would need to be paid by Northern Irish importers, even if Starmer secured a carve-out for the UK or chose not to immediately respond. Businesses can claim back the tax through a reimbursement scheme but trade experts said the issue could reopen old political sores.The EU said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, would set out its response on Thursday morning.The shadow trade secretary, Andrew Griffith, described Trump’s tariff announcement as “disappointing news” but suggested that Brexit had spared the UK from higher import taxes.He said: “The silver lining is that Brexit, which Labour ministers voted against no less than 48 times, means that we face far lower tariffs than the EU: a Brexit dividend that will have protected thousands of British jobs and businesses.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrade policyDonald TrumpInternational tradeKeir StarmerGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

His office had earlier said he was “troubled” by the sentence. He also appeared open to the idea of a bill to change the way such sentences were handed down.Xavier Bertrand, the rightwing head of the Hauts-de-France region, said Bayrou should never have said he was “troubled” by Le Pen’s sentence. He told RTL radio that the prime minister and other politicians were “falling into a trap by Marine Le Pen: the trap of victimisation.Marine Le Penis not a victim of miscarriage of justice.

This message was reaffirmed by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, this week: “If it is necessary we have a strong planto retaliate and we will use it.” EU officials hope for a negotiated settlement, but previous offers to buy more US liquified fossil gas – a trend already happening since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – appear to have fallen on stony ground.The EU approach contrasts with the UK, which is preparing toreduce the headline rate of its digital services taxin an attempt to placate Trump. But vowing retaliation is only the start. The questions are about what response the EU will have, how quickly it can be marshalled and whether divisions between member states will undermine the tough talk.The bourbon and blue jeans planImposing levies on emblematic US goods is the tried and tested European response to Trump tariffs. After Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminium last month, the EU said it was preparingretaliatory duties targeting up to €26bn of US goods, such as bourbon, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and a wide array of farm produce and industrial goods.The bloc has yet to retaliate against Trump’s levies on cars and car parts that are due to take effect on 3 April. In theory, the EU could levy more tariffs over these plans, as well as the latest “liberation day” duties. But EU officials will try to avoid hefty duties on goods that the bloc needs. Ignacio García Bercero, a former senior EU trade negotiator, said: “What matters is that you maximise the political impact and you limit to the maximum the economic impact [on the EU].”Hit US banks and tech companiesIn theory the EU has a long list of options to hit back at US economic interests: restrict JP Morgan’s business in Europe, tax Facebook and Meta, stop US companies bidding for European government contracts or limit their intellectual property rights. US services may be a tempting target, as the US runs a €109bn ($117bn) surplus in services with the EU, according to EU figures – although Trump is fixated on the US goods deficit with the EU, which is $236bn (€218bn), according to American data.One senior EU official, speaking after the steel and aluminium tariffs in March, said the bloc was certainly not excluding a bigger, better and “even more creative” response, citing intellectual property rights and investment measures.The long-range economic strikeThe scale of Trump’s tariffs, which could return US duties to levels not seen since the 19th century, is intensifying calls to retaliate against US services. A former adviser to the French government, Shahin Vallée, and the French national assembly deputy David Amiel have said the EU needs “to becapable of launching long-range economic strikes against American economic interests, going beyond ‘simple’ trade tariff responses”.Their wide-ranging recommendations include the possible use – for the first time – of the EU’s anti-coercion instrument. This is a potentially powerful regulation that gives the EU leeway to impose trade and investment restrictions on any government that appears to be using trade as weapon to browbeat a country into changing unrelated policies.If Trump framed his tariffs asa grievance with EU VAT ratesor tech regulation, said García Bercero, “this could be characterised fairly as being coercive action from the United States, which is basically seeking to get the European Union and the member states to change their policies on matters which they have the sovereign right to decide”.Make new friendsTrump’s return to the White House has accelerated EU efforts to strike new trade deals and deepen existing ties with the rest of the world. Since his election, theEU has concluded 25 years of on-off trade talks with Mercosur; finalised or upgraded deals with Mexico, South Africa and Switzerland; revived talks with Malaysia and expressed hope of signing a free trade agreement with India in 2025. While success with Delhi and theratification of Mercosurare far from done deals, the flurry of activity underscores the desire to shore up the traditional trade and diplomatic order.(Try to) stick togetherThe EU response will depend on how tightly its 27 member states line up behind a common strategy in a trade war that could trigger economic turmoil and job losses in Europe. An early indication should come on Monday when EU trade ministers meet to discuss the retaliation planned for this month and other measures.Nerves are building. France is worried about the fallout on its wines and spirits industry; Dublin fears an exodus of US multinationals headquartered in Ireland; and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has said the blocshould not act on impulsewhile the national industry group Confindustria has called for negotiations with the White House. Forging a common line will be critical to new forms of trade retaliation: for example, only a weighted majority of EU countries can decide whether the bloc is facing coercion from the US. That would be an outcome almost no one imagined a decade ago.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropeUS politicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

They are seeking a jail term of four years and nine months and a fine of €3.2m.Bernabéu erupts as Rüdiger’s late show seals Copa del Rey final spot for MadridRead moreGiving evidence on Wednesday, the first morning of the two-day trial in Madrid, Ancelotti said he had focused on his salary and had left other financial matters in the hands of his advisers. “I’ve never been bothered about image rights,” he told the court. “Coaches aren’t that important – it’s the players who sell shirts. I was only bothered about getting the €6m net for three years and I never realised that something wasn’t right and I didn’t receive any notification that I was under investigation by tax prosecutors.”The manager said that whenReal Madridhad proposed a payment scheme under which 15% of his salary would be paid from his image rights, he had said yes and had referred the matter to his British adviser. “I thought it was quite normal,” he said, adding that all the players and the previous coach had done the same thing.“I got in touch with my British adviser and I didn’t think any more about it because it all seemed right,” he said. “I never thought a fraud could have been committed. But, given that I’m here, I guess things weren’t done that right.”Prosecutors allege that, despite his status as a Spanish resident for tax purposes, Ancelotti declared only his personal earnings from the club and omitted the income he received from the sale of his image rights. The prosecutors allege that he failed to pay a total of €1,062,079 in tax on the sale of those rights, which amounted to €1.24m in 2014 and €2.96m the following year.View image in fullscreenAncelotti (centre) arrives at court to stand trial.Photograph: Jj Guillen/EPAAncelotti, the most successful manager in Champions League history, denies the charges. “I have total confidence in the law and in justice,” he said on Friday. “I’m not worried but I am obviously annoyed if they say that I’ve committed fraud, but, once again, I have total confidence in justice.”The Italian is the latest high-profile football figure to find himself pursued by Spain’s tax authorities in recent years. In July 2016, Lionel Messi and his father, Jorge, weresentenced to 21 months in prisonfor evading tax on Lionel’s image rights during his time at Barcelona, with more than €4m owed in back payments.

The [Israeli army] is seizing territory, hitting the terrorists and destroying the infrastructure,” the prime minister said in a video statement on Wednesday evening.“We are also doing another thing – seizing the ‘Morag route’. This will be the second Philadelphi route, another Philadelphi route,” he said, referring to an Israeli-held corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border.“Because we are currently dividing up the strip, we are adding pressure step by step, so that our hostages will be given to us,” Netanyahu added.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have seized buffer zones around Gaza’s edges totalling 62 sq km, or 17% of the strip, since the war began in October 2023, according to the Israeli human rights group Gisha.The Netzarim corridor, named for a defunct Israeli settlement, now cuts off Gaza City from the south of the strip.Morag was a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, so the use of the name suggests the new corridor is designed to separate the two southern cities.The Israeli prime minister’s announcement follows remarks on Wednesday from his defence minister, Israel Katz, who said the Israeli army would “seize large areas” of Gaza, necessitating large-scale civilian evacuations.Neither Netanyahu nor Katz elaborated on how much Palestinian land Israel intended to capture in the renewed offensive, but the move is likely to complicate ceasefire talks and inflame fears that Israel intends to take permanent control of the strip when the war ends.Israel announces plan to seize ‘large areas’ in Gaza – latest updatesRead moreIsrael’s newly stated intentions to establish another military corridor followed a night of intense airstrikes on Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza, which hospital officials said had killed at least 21 people.An airstrike on Wednesday afternoon on a Jabaliya health clinic housing displaced people killed at least 19 people, including nine children, according to the civil defence agency.The IDF said in a statement it had taken precautions to avoid civilian casualties in the bombing of what it said was a Hamas control centre in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north of the strip. It later said it was aware the target was located in the same building as the clinic.Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said in a statement that the strike hit “two rooms on the first floor of an Unrwa destroyed health centre” that had been used as a shelter for 160 displaced families.“Many displaced families have not left the site, simply because they have absolutely nowhere else to go,” the statement said. The agency had shared the building’s coordinates with the IDF, it added.In Khan Younis, the bodies of five women, one of them pregnant, two children and three men from the same family were brought to Nasser hospital on Wednesday morning, medics said. The IDF said it was examining the reports of civilian deaths.Palestinian media reported bombing and shelling along the Egyptian border, at least two airstrikes on Gaza City, and Israeli troop movement in the Rafah area. The IDF said it had deployed an extra division to southern Gaza early on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenChildren push carts loaded with belongings as people flee Rafah on Wednesday.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Israeli military issued sweeping evacuation orders last week telling people in Rafah and a swath of land stretching northwards towards Khan Younis to move to al-Mawasi, an area on the shore that Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone but hasrepeatedly bombed.Israel renewed intensive bombing across Gaza on 18 March, followed by the redeployment of ground troops, abruptly ending the two-month ceasefire and exchanges of Israeli hostages held by Palestinian militant groups and Palestinians in Israeli jails.According to the terms of the truce, the sides were supposed to negotiate implementing further phases of the deal during the first 42-day stage, but the Israeli government repeatedly postponed the talks.The latest UN estimate, from 23 March, suggested approximately 140,000 people had been displaced since the end of the ceasefire. More than 90% of the strip’s population of 2.3 million have been forced to flee their homes during the conflict, many of them multiple times.Hundreds of people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since it ended the ceasefire. Israel has also cut off humanitarian aid, food and fuel to the strip in an effort to pressure Hamas. The month-long blockade is now the longest in the war to date.Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to resume talks aimed at ending the war have not yet led to a breakthrough. The resumption of fighting in Gaza has also fuelled protests in Israel against the government from supporters of the remaining hostages and their loved ones.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents most captives’ relatives, said it was “horrified to wake up this morning to the defence minister’s announcement about expanding military operations in Gaza”.The group said: “Our highest priority must be an immediate deal to bring ALL hostages back home – the living for rehabilitation and those killed for proper burial – and end this war.”The 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, in which Israel says 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken captive, was the trigger for the conflict in Gaza, the worst war between Israel and the Palestinians in more than 70 years of fighting.Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 50,357 people, the majority of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, saidGazawas the deadliest place on Earth for humanitarian workers.“Recent aid worker deaths are a stark reminder. Those responsible must be held accountable,”Lammy said.Ahmad Dhaher, a forensic consultant who examined five of the dead at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis after they had been exhumed, said all of them had died from bullet wounds. “All cases had been shot with multiple bullets, except for one, which could not be determined due to the body being mutilated by animals like dogs, leaving it almost as just a skeleton,” Dhaher told the Guardian.“Preliminary analysis suggests they were executed, not from a distant range, since the locations of the bullet wounds were specific and intentional,” he said. “One observation is that the bullets were aimed at one person’s head, another at their heart, and a third person had been shot with six or seven bullets in the torso.”He emphasised that there was room for uncertainty due to the decomposition of the remains, and that in other cases he reviewed “most of the bullets targeted the joints, such as the shoulder, elbow, ankle, or wrist”.Two witnesses to the recovery of the bodies told the Guardian on Tuesday thatthey had seen bodies the hands and legs of which had been tied, suggesting they had been detained before their deaths. A Red Crescent spokesperson, Nebal Farsakh, said on Wednesday that one of the paramedics “had his hands tied together with his legs to his body”.1:23Bodies of Palestinian rescue workers recovered from mass grave – videoDhaher said there was no clear evidence of restraints on the five bodies he examined. “I could not recognise any tying marks on their hands due to the state of decomposition of the five cases I checked, so I can’t be sure of it,” he said.The Israel Defense Forces and Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have said IDF soldiers opened fire on the ambulances and rescue vehicles because they were “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”. Government officials claimed to have killed a Hamas military operative they named as Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, and “eight other terrorists” from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, in the attack on 23 March.However, Shubaki was not among the bodies recovered from the mass grave outside Rafah on Saturday and Sunday, eight of which were identified as Red Crescent ambulance workers, six as civil defence rescue workers, and one as an employee of the UN relief agency Unrwa. The IDF has not responded to questions about why the dead were buried with their vehicles or to reports that some showed signs of having been tied up.The sole survivor from the shootings on 23 March, Munther Abed, a Red Crescent volunteer, contradicted the official Israeli account, saying the ambulances had been observing safety protocols when they were attacked.“During day and at night, it’s the same: external and internal lights are on. Everything tells you it’s an ambulance that belongs to the Palestinian Red Crescent. All the lights were on until we came under direct fire,” Abed toldThe World at Oneon BBC Radio 4. He denied that anyone from a militant group was in the ambulance.Abed, who was in the first ambulance to come under fire in the early morning of 23 March, said he survived because he threw himself to the floor at the back of the vehicle when the shooting started. The two paramedics in the front seats of the ambulance were killed in the hail of Israeli gunfire. Abed was detained and interrogated by Israeli soldiers before being released.The other 13 victims were all in a five-vehicle convoy dispatched some hours later to recover the bodies of the two dead ambulance workers. All of them were shot dead and buried in the same grave.AGuardian investigation published in Februaryfound that more than 1,000 medical staff had been killed across Gaza from the beginning of the conflict on 7 October 2023 – triggered by a Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 Israelis – until the beginning of a temporary ceasefire in January. Many hospitals have been reduced to ruins in attacks that a UN Human Rights Council commissionconcluded amounted to war crimes.Since ending the two-month ceasefire last month, Israel has vowed to step up its military campaign against Hamas. On Wednesday the defence minister, Israel Katz, said that campaign was expanding to “seize extensive territory” in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu said Israel intended to build a new security corridor as it was “dividing up the Strip”.Hospital officials in the occupied Palestinian territory said Israeli strikes overnight and on Wednesday had killed at least 40 people, nearly a dozen of them children.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelGazaBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "07.28 EDTToday so farHere’s a recap of the day so far.Israel’smilitary operation in theGaza Stripis expanding to seize “large areas,” according to defence ministerIsrael Katz. Officials at hospitals inside the Palestinian territory said Israeli strikes overnight and into Wednesday had killed more than 30 people, nearly a dozen of them children.Israelsays it is expanding its offensive in the Palestinian territory “to crush and clean the area” of militants and to seize “large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel”.The Israeli government has long maintained a buffer zone just inside Gaza along its security fence and has greatly expanded since the war began in 2023. Israel says the buffer zone is needed for its security, while Palestinians view it as a land grab.Katz didn’t specify which areas of Gaza would be seized in the expanded operation, which he said includes the “extensive evacuation” of the population from fighting areas. His statement came after Israel ordered the full evacuation of the southern city of Rafah and nearby areas.TheHostage Families Forum, which represents most captives’ families, said that it was “horrified to wake up this morning to the defense minister’s announcement about expanding military operations inGaza.” The group said the Israeli government “has an obligation to free all 59 hostages from Hamas captivity — to pursue every possible channel to advance a deal for their release.”Israelcontinued to target theGaza Strip, with airstrikes overnight killing 17 people in the southern city ofKhan Younis. Another 15 people were killed in a strike in the north of the strip Wednesday, according to officials at hospitals where the bodies were taken.Officials at theNasser Hospitalsaid the bodies of 12 people killed in an overnight airstrike that were brought to the hospital included five women, one of them pregnant, and two children. Officials at theGaza European Hospitalsaid they received five bodies of people killed in two separate airstrikes.Officials at theIndonesian Hospitalsaid an Israeli strike on a building of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, in theJabaliyarefugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip killed 15 people, including nine children and two women. The Palestinian Civil Defense said the building had been an UNRWA clinic that was now being used to house displaced people.Benjamin Netanyahuis expected to visitHungarylater today, despite an arrest warrant from the international criminal court (ICC) putting him at risk while visiting states that are signatories to the court. It is unclear what this means for Hungary’s membership of the ICC.Share"

He provided no information on whether the woman was also killed, or any mention of efforts to mitigate civilian harm.JD Vance, the vice-president, responded by saying “excellent”, and Waltz replied later with emojis of a clenched fist, a US flag and a blazing flame.Strikes have targeted Sana’a, Yemen’s capital, as well as the port city of Hodeidah and the Houthi stronghold of Sa’ada. The targets include densely populated areas, but assessing the impact on civilians of the strikes – which are coordinated with and supported by UK armed forces – is difficult.MapNiku Jafarnia, a Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the Houthis had blocked off “any and all access” to bomb sites and hospitals as part of a crackdown on civil society and the media. But she added: “There is no question there are civilian casualties. Residential areas are being hit in the middle of the night, which is a sure-fire way to kill civilians.”The Houthi-run Saba news agency has said the US hastwice bombed a cancer hospitalin the country’s north and accused the US of “full-fledged war crimes by targeting civilians and civilian objects, resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries in several governorates”. Independent groups have also suggested a high degree of civilian harm.In a post on X, the Yemen Data Project, which monitors attacks in the country, said that the first week of attacks had killed at least 25 civilians, including four children. About half of the strikes had hit civilian sites, including a school, a wedding hall, residential areas and Bedouin tents, it said.Thegroup added: “The very first US strike in Yemen under the new Trump administration, carried out on the evening of 15 March (and the subject ofthatSignal group chat), hit al-Jaraf in the north of the capital, killing at least 13 civilians and injuring nine.”View image in fullscreenThe US aerial attacks on 20 March 2025 brought further destruction to Sana’a.Photograph: Mohammed Hamoud/Getty ImagesAnother monitoring group, Airwars, which tracks and analyses open-source information, hasdocumented women and children being killed and injured. TheUN says it has verifiedthat at least two boys, aged six and eight, were killed in strikes in northern Sa’ada, with a third missing.Photos of the aftermath show destroyed residential buildings, with water tanks and shredded clothes within the rubble. A​ US defence official said “battle damage assessments” were being conducted and “do not indicate civilian casualties”​. They added​: “We likely won’t have any updates until after the conclusion of operations.”A decade of violence has shattered Yemen’s already weak economy and left millions of people unable to find decent livelihoods to support their families. As a result, out of a population of roughly 36 million,about 19 million people require aid– 15 million of whom are women and children. Half of all children under five in Yemen are malnourished, according to Unicef. An aid plan for 2025 is only 6.5% funded so far.Khan, from Islamic Relief, said the recent bombings were adding pressure on to an aid sector that was already collapsing under other Trump measures. Two of the biggest factors have been thehuge cuts to USAidand the designation of the Houthisas a “foreign terrorist organisation”, which puts aid groups working in the vast Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at legal risk in the US.Humanitarian organisations are now scrambling to work out how to operate in the country without being in breach of US law and with much less funding, all in addition to an intense bombing campaign.“Overall, there has been a gradual but then sharp kind of decline in humanitarian aid to Yemen,” he said. “Obviously, many organisations are kind of downsizing and some have closed as well.“The bombings have further scared the organisations here about whether this will be the right place to stay and work. So overall, there’s a huge vacuum … taking over the humanitarian sector here,” he added. “I see a real catastrophe coming Yemen’s way.”Another aid worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said their staff were “dealing with really, so many things at the same time, which is compounding our ability to access people right now”.The Houthis, which are backed by Iran, have alreadyrestricted access and detained aid workersover the past year, creating a climate of fear among the aid community.“So all of this really impacts the way our staff feel comfortable and safe to provide services to the communities,” said the aid worker. “Yet at the same time, they are very determined to provide as many services as possible to the communities.”Washington is one of several belligerent actors in Yemen, which has suffered a decade of civil war, with several states, including neighbouring Saudi Arabia, conducting bombing campaigns.The effectiveness of strikes on the Houthis, without troops on the ground, has beenrepeatedly questionedas the group has already managed to survive years of attacks.Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisMiddle East and north AfricaUSAIDDonald TrumpJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

He said the Indian courts havenot granted his brother bail, despite the prosecutor’s failure to produce any credible evidence or witnesses in the Punjab court.Gurpreet said UK consular staff met his brother in jail on Tuesday and were told he had been put into solitary confinement with a 24-hour guard, adding no explanation had been given.He said: “I fear for his physical and mental welfare since he is being excluded from contact with all other prisoners. He has been in jail for seven years, acquitted and now he is being further punished. He is being mentally tortured and I am concerned something is going to happen to him. The aim is to break him.”Gurpreet added that a critical window of opportunity existed after the Punjab acquittal, in which the judge was damning about the quality of evidence assembled by the Indian prosecutors, to secure his brother’s release.He said the Foreign Office had to realise his brother was not being held to secure his conviction but to keep him in detention. “What is missing from the British government is political will. I am told the prime minister raised the case when he met the Indian external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, but I do not know what exactly they are raising, or how central it is to the conversations ministers are having.”‘It’s about political will’: is the Foreign Office failing Britons detained abroad?Read moreGurpreet said that what the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Patten had dismissed as “by the way diplomacy” was not enough to make India sense there would be consequences for the mistreatment of British nationals.He added: “The current prime minister is an ex-prosecutor, the current foreign secretary is an ex-lawyer and both should be well apprised of what double jeopardy means and how this can be applied.”Dan Dolan, the deputy executive director of the legal NGO Reprieve, said double jeopardy protected people from being put on trial twice for the same crime and was enshrined in international law and India’s constitution.Reprieve and Johal claim the eight other cases brought by the Indian National Investigation Agency are essentially duplicate cases, with no additional evidence provided, and all the evidence is based on torture.The Indian government denies torture has been used. The central allegation in all nine cases is that Johal transferred money to supposed co-conspirators, and that this was used to fund a series of attacks in Punjab between 2016 and 2017. The Indian authorities do not claim Johal was directly involved in any of these attacks.David Lammy, the foreign secretary, who met Gurpreet in November, has said he is willing to meet again but not for a further seven weeks, a timetable that Gurpreet says fails to understand the urgency of the crisis. “The window of opportunity is narrow, and he needs to meet a lot sooner. It is urgent,” Gurpreet said.Explore more on these topicsLawDavid LammyIndiaSouth and central AsiaSikhismReligionForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

We think that was the right priority.”If she had not raised taxes, Reeves said, it would have meant “further increases in NHS hospital waiting lists”, instead of which they have declined for the past five months.Asked by the Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin about the impact of her policies, Reeves added: “Other people would say, ‘no, don’t put more money into the NHS,’ and it is absolutely their right to say that … but you have to be honest, because if you want that extra money, you have to support the taxes to pay for it”.New research by the Resolution Foundation suggests that households will be on average £400 worse off in the coming tax year as a result of higher taxes and bills, including freezes to income tax thresholds, which drag more people into paying a higher rate.Adam Corlett, the thinktank’s principal economist, said: “The new tax year has arrived, and brings with it higher taxes, even larger bill increases, and benefits that aren’t keeping pace with the rising cost of living.”The Resolution Foundation is calling on the government to bring forward a planned 2% increase in the basic universal credit payment by six months, to this October, to help ease the burden.Business groups have warned about the risk of job losses caused by the NICs increase coming alongside the 6.7% increase to the national living wage for people aged 21 and over from this week.But the chancellor said there was little evidence so far of a significant downturn in the jobs market.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It means one in six people have taken out a membership.Younger adults are the key demographic behind the boom, according to the report’s authors, UKActive, the trade body that represents most of Britain’s fitness operators.The growth is particularly evident among generation Z – people born between 1997 and 2012, who are between 13 and 28 – who already have a reputation as the healthiest generation ever.“[This] is a significant moment as it shows that more people are making a conscious decision to get active in order to improve their physical and often also their mental health,” said Huw Edwards, UKActive’s chief executive.“We are witnessing strong demand among all age groups and increasing popularity among gen Z, with health and fitness clubs experiencing growing demand for services such as group exercise, strength training and cardio workouts.“Young people are seeing health and fitness as part of their identity and a non-negotiable when it comes to their personal priorities. Many of them are telling us they prefer going to the gym rather than more traditional venues for socialising such as the pub.“With the right support, this could become the most health-aware generation ever.”The findings tally with previous reports by Sport England and its “moving communities” research into physical activity that growing numbers of teenagers are taking part in fitness activities.A “generational shift” in gym visiting has been taking place in recent years, states the report, which is UKActive’s first in-depth analysis of membership of health and fitness clubs across the UK.“Younger generations are demonstrating higher levels of physical activity and gym membership, indicating a shift in societal priorities towards health and wellbeing, and suggesting that for younger people, gym membership is essential.”Older people are the most likely to avoid joining up because they believe they do not need to, “indicating that the positive shift in mindset towards fitness is more prevalent among younger age groups”, the report adds.The findings appear to embellish gen Z’s reputation as having healthier habits and lifestyles than previous generations.David Minton, the founder of Leisure Database, a specialist fitness market analysis firm, said: “The younger generation are also the healthier generation because they are drinking less alcohol than their predecessors and are much more conscious about what they eat, as evidenced by the increase in veganism, low-sugar diets and consumption of sourdough breads.”But young people may be going for reasons not connected to their health, Minton suggested. “Gen Z are also going to the gym in order to meet a romantic partner and to increase their network of friends because, while they spend a lot of time on social media, the gym offers an in-person experience rather than a virtual experience.“For them, gym-going is all about the social element. It’s not about losing weight, because most of them don’t need to.”The value of the UK health and fitness market grew to £5.7bn by last year, while the number of clubs stood at 5,607, which between them saw 616m visits.An increase in lower-cost gyms and those offering access on a pay-as-you-go basis has also helped to increase participation, the report says.When gym members were asked what motivated them to join, 83% cited improving their physical strength and fitness and 76% said boosting their mental wellbeing, including tackling anxiety and depression. But 75% wanted to improve their confidence and appearance, and 68% to sleep better.The proportion of people in the UK who belong to a gym has risen to 16.9%, one of the highest figures in Europe.Explore more on these topicsHealthFitnessYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Another said they were seeing more people “with poor nutritional status due to poverty”, eventually leading to “prolonged and impaired recovery from acute illnesses”.Scabies is a highly contagious condition caused by mites, resulting in an itchy rash. It is spread through close skin contact and should be treated quickly to stop it spreading.Several patients had contracted hypothermia. One doctor said it was due to the patient not being able to afford heating at home.The Royal College of Physicians has called on the government to set out how its health mission will address these illnesses.Dr Ash Bassi, a consultant gastroenterologist based in Prescot, Merseyside, said doctors have been seeing patients whose health conditions “are worsened by damp and cold housing, where respiratory illnesses become chronic conditions”.Bassi added: “We see the impact of food insecurity, where poor nutrition contributes to long-term health complications. Poor uptake of screening programmes further exacerbates health inequalities. Patients struggling with unstable employment or financial hardship often delay seeking medical help, leading to more severe illness by the time they reach us.”Dr John Dean, the clinical vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: “The UK government came into office promising bold action on the things that make us ill in the first place. Now it must set out the detail of its health mission and how the mission delivery board will tackle the root causes of ill-health such as poor housing, employment, tobacco, obesity and air quality.“With over 2.5 million more people in England projected to be living with a major illness by 2040, there is no time to waste. We need assurances that improving health and tackling health inequalities remain a priority.“Everything from the places we live to the food we eat affects our health. Government must use its health mission delivery board to deliver a cross-government strategy to reduce health inequalities and address the social determinants of health.”A spokesperson for the Department ofHealthand Social Care said: “Through our plan for change, this government will tackle head on the appalling healthcare inequalities that exist within our systems.“One of our core priorities is to halve the gap in healthy life expectancy between the richest and poorest regions in England.“Our fundamental shift from sickness to prevention will play a vital role in tackling inequalities, making people healthier and reducing pressure on the NHS.”Explore more on these topicsHealthDoctorsInfectious diseasesMedical researchMicrobiologyInequalityPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer thinks the answer is totread softly, softly– while engaging in intensive negotiations behind the scenes.There are signs that this strategy is bearing fruit. On Wednesday night, the president announced “reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world” including a 10% import tax on UK exports to the US – crucially, lower than the 20% imposed on the EU. The 10% rate was the lowest rate Trump announced and applied to several other countries including Australia, Singapore and Brazil.It is a sign that the prime minister’s lovebombing campaign – including an invitation to Trump to meet King Charles in June – has put the UK in good stead. There will be no great sigh of relief inside government, however. The 10% tariff is bad news for the UK economy (as are the US tariffs more broadly) and Starmer’s priority will be to negotiate itsreduction or withdrawal.Ministers have been unsuccessful so far in their efforts to sign an economic deal with the US by offering concessions on taxes for big tech firms and lower taxes on meat and fish imports. By Wednesday morning, No 10 had conceded that the UK would not be exempt from the wave of tariffs, which Trump later announced in the White House Rose Garden in an act of political theatre and unabashed projection of his power on the world stage.There are reasons for Starmer to be optimistic as his focus shifts to signing an economic deal within weeks or even days. Leslie Vinjamuri, the director of the US and Americas programme at Chatham House, said that the UK had “played its hand extremely well” and that “one can imagine a scenario where that US-UK deal is announced pretty quickly”.Vinjamuri said Trump had “boxed himself into a corner” where he had to announce universal tariffs before negotiating country by country but that there were signs the UK would be at “the front of the queue” for a deal.“If the UK decides to roll back the tax on America’s tech firms that will be a huge win and, for the president, far better to announce that after he’s levied a punishment,” she said, adding that ministers could “lace it up with a visit to Scotland by Trump to meet the king”.Others argue that Starmer’s approach is fraught with risk by unnecessarily drawing Trump’s attention to the UK – which could lead him to exact concessions that wouldn’t otherwise have needed to be made.David Henig of the European Centre for International Political Economy said Starmer’s approach was “in one sense softly-softly not threatening, in another quite aggressive in seeking a deal, when that could cast a spotlight on perceived UK faults when we weren’t otherwise in the firing line”. He said the risk was that the US administration could target areas such asthe UK’s digital safety laws, food standards or VAT.Government officials said an economic deal with the US was broadly ready and could even be completed within days. The success of Starmer’s approach will be judged by how quickly that happens – South Korea, Japan, India and Australia have all been trying to strike similar deals.Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, said the government’s approach would be “to remain calm and committed to doing this deal, which we hope will mitigate the impact of what has been announced”.The EU, meanwhile, hasvowed to respondwith “robust” retaliatory tariffs against the US. Starmer has come under pressure from some quarters to harden his own approach. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, called for the UK to form an “economic coalition of the willing” with the EU and Canada to counter Trump’s “divide and rule” tactics.For the prime minister and his team,including the foreign secretary, David Lammy, the settled strategy is to follow the approach set by the former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe. Abe established agood rapport with Trumpduring his first term thanks to some carefully choreographed flattery and behind-the-scenes diplomacy.“The hard-edged singular focus on retaliation is misplaced. It assumes that by retaliating you win but everybody loses,” Vinjamuri said. “One doesn’t want to be prescribing that America’s allies and partners become overly sycophantic, but there is a lot to play for and there is a lot to win.”100 days of Trump’s presidency, with Jonathan Freedland and guestsOn 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as they look at Trump’s presidency on his 100th day in office, live at Conway Hall, London, and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrade policyDonald TrumpKeir StarmerKing Charles IIIDavid LammyInternational tradeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Williams suggested she was wearing a minidress at the time.“I don’t think it made any difference whether she’s wearing a minidress or not,” said Osborne. “The allegation is that Mr Clarke took a picture of her that had her underwear on, [and] it was fairly close up.”When Williams raised it, Osborne also said that whether Evelyn was drunk or not was irrelevant to her allegations against Clarke.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

The big prize? A global trade warDavid Smithin WashingtonWed 2 Apr 2025 19.35 EDTFirst published on Wed 2 Apr 2025 19.29 EDTShareIt was Jeopardy!, or The Price Is Right, come to Washington.On an unseasonably chilly day in the White House Rose Garden,Donald Trumpstood with a giant chart listing which reciprocal tariffs he would impose on China, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other hapless contestants.The winner?Trump, of course, the maestro of fake populism, watched by a crowd that included men in hard hats and fluorescent construction worker vests.The losers?Everybody else.Sensing a bad headline, Trump hadn’t wanted his “liberation day” to coincide with April Fools’ Day, so he waited until 2 April to enter his fool’s paradise. It turned out to be liberation for his decades-old grievances about the US getting ripped off as Trump stuck two fingers up at the world.“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far – both friend and foe alike,” the president said against a backdrop of nine giant US flags on the White House colonnade. “Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.”He nodded to American steelworkers, car-workers, farmers and craftspeople in the audience. These blue-collar workers have been central to Trump’s political rise. Their industrial towns in the midwest and elsewhere were hollowed out by the trade policies of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, which sent thousands of jobs abroad where labour was cheaper.Trump couldn’t quite bring himself to say that “liberation day” represents a final repudiation of Reagan, still a god in Republican circles. But he did drive a stake through the heart of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, describing it as “the worst trade deal ever made”.In 2016’s great revolt against globalization, the forgotten workers could have voted for the leftwing populism of Bernie Sanders, but he lost the Democratic party nomination to Hillary Clinton.Instead, enough went for Trump to make him president, believing his promises that he alone could fix it, end American carnage and get the factories throbbing again. As it turned out, he delivered a $1.5tn bill that slashed taxes for corporations and the wealthy.Many workers duly switched back to the Democrats, with Joe Biden in 2020. He did pour money into manufacturing – for example, with the Chips and Science Act, a bipartisan bill investing $52bn to revitalize the semiconductor industry.Yet in 2024 the pendulum swung again.Somehow a Manhattan billionaire with a criminal record again persuaded blue-collar workers that he was on their side. He claimed he could wave tariffs (taxes on foreign imports), which he has described as the most beautiful word in the English language, like a magic wand.In reality, experts say, it will result in higher prices and slower growth. The Ontario premier Doug Ford called this not liberation day but termination day because of all the jobs that will be lost. Trump playing with tariffs is like a child playing with matches.As he prepared to sign an executive order imposing reciprocal tariffs on about 60 countries, he mused that it was payback time: “Reciprocal: that means they do it to us and we do it to them. Very simple. Can’t get any simpler than that. This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our declaration of economic independence.”It was a strange message to hear from the leader of the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world as he slapped tariffs on the likes of Ethiopia, Haiti and Lesotho.“For years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now it’s our turn to prosper … Today we’re standing up for the American worker and we are finally putting America first,” he said.View image in fullscreenTrump in the White House Rose Garden.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersEven then, Trump claimed he was being kind by not going “full reciprocal”. He summoned his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, to bring the chart to the podium and, as if it were a gameshow, began running through the scores on the doors:“China, first row. China, 67%. That’s tariffs charged to the USA, including currency manipulation and trade barriers. So 67%, so we’re going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34%. I think in other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody be upset?“European Union, they’re very tough – very, very tough traders. You know, you think of the European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It’s so sad to say, it’s so pathetic. Thirty-nine percent. We’re going to charge them 20%, so we’re charging them essentially half.“Vietnam: great negotiators, great people, they like me. I like them. The problem is they charge us 90%. We’re going to charge them 46% tariff.”And so on to Taiwan, Japan (“very, very tough, great people”), Switzerland, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia: “United Kingdom, 10%, and we’ll go 10%, so we’ll do the same thing.”Once he’d gone through the figures, Trump rambled, as he tends to do, as if at a campaign rally: “The price of eggs dropped now 59%, and they’re going down more, and the availability is fantastic. They were saying that for Easter, please don’t use eggs. Could you use plastic eggs? I said, we don’t want to do that.”And: “It’s such an old-fashioned term but a beautiful term: groceries. It sort of says a bag with different things in it. Groceries went through the roof and I campaigned on that. I talked about the word ‘groceries’ for a lot, and energy costs now are down. Groceries are down.”In other words, everything is going great despiteSignalgate, despitedisappointing election results on Tuesday, despite afalling stock marketand sapping consumer confidence. Now, a global trade war, too. The US is about to discover the one thing more dangerous than a politician who believes in nothing is a politician who believes in something stupid.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsThe US politics sketchDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS economyEconomicsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Many in the US could be forgiven for wondering what exactly they’ve just been liberated from.After much hype, the president unveiled his plan for a new era in global trade: a blanket 10% tariff on goods imported into the US starting Saturday, and higher “reciprocal” tariffs (of up to 49%) on countries taxing US exports starting next Wednesday.Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, upending decades of US trade policyRead more“April 2nd 2025 will be forever remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” according to Trump.Historians will be the judge of that. But before anyone writes this chapter, millions of Americans need to navigate the present.Trump was re-elected last November after years of heightened inflation, and upward pressure on the cost of living. On the campaign trail he pledged, repeatedly and unambiguously, to rapidly liberate the nation from higher prices.But tariffs, his administration has conceded, risk doing the opposite. The treasury secretaryrecently dismissed cheap goods as “not the essence of the American dream”after acknowledging that costs may rise as a result of Trump’s aggressive trade strategy: music to the ears of anyone seeking liberation from lower prices.Anyone sitting in the White House Rose Garden might be reassured. “Prices are way down,” the president has claimed, since his return to office.Anyone who has visited a grocery store in that time might feel differently. Most prices have, in fact, not fallen since January;inflation is still risingwell above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2% per year.“Now it’s our turn to prosper,” he proclaimed. But many US firms are bracing for problematic, not prosperous, effects of this action: higher costs they warn will be passed on to their customers.“What we have heard from business of all sizes, across all industries, from around the country is that these broad tariffs are a tax increase that will raise prices for American consumers and hurt the economy,” said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, the corporate lobby group.Trump likes to present the world as black and white. The US is either winning or losing. A policy, deal or plan is the best or the worst. A person, country or company is supporting or screwing you.There is rarely space for nuance, time for complexity or tolerance for inconvenient facts. The simplicity of this narrative is its power.By Trump’s telling, the US is about to raise trillions of dollars for the federal government by taxing the world, not its citizens: a typically black-and-white choice.But reality is often more complex than rhetoric. There are myriad shades of grey.Import tariffs are not paid by other countries. They are paid by importers – in this case, US firms and consumers – buying goods from overseas. These costs often trickle down through the economy, raising prices at every clink in the chain.Trump promised lower prices. He is betting his tariffs won’t raise them too high, for too long.“This is going to be a big moment,” he said on Wednesday. “I think you’re going to remember today.”He may well be right.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

For decades America had been “looted, pillaged and raped” by its trading partners, he said. “In many cases, the friend is worse than the foe.”Over the past few months, Trump has rattled global stock markets, alarmed corporate executives and economists, and triggered heated rows with the US’s largest trading partners by announcing and delaying plans to impose tariffs on foreign imports several times since taking office.But for the start of what appears to be a dramatic shift in American trade policy, one that could cause ricochets in the global economy, Trump tried to sell the tariffs with a celebratory tone.Nine giant US flags flanked Trump on stage in the Rose Garden, as the president spoke in front of his cabinet and a crowd of union workers wearing hard hats and fluorescent construction worker vests. Before Trump came on stage, a marine band played celebratory music to excite the crowd.At one point, Trump paused his speech to throw a Maga hat into the crowd. In the next breath, he announced the 10% universal baseline tariff.In the middle of his hour-long speech, the president displayed a chart that showed the “unfair” fees that countries placed on the US, alongside the new “USA Discounted Reciprocal Tariffs”. China charged the US 67% in “unfair” fees, and said the US would now levy a 34% fee. The EU charges 39% on imports, according to the White House, and will now be levied at 20%. Trump said the UK would be charged 10% – the baseline tariff – equal to the Trump administration’s calculations of the UK’s fees on US imports.Special exceptions were made for Canada andMexico, though the countries were previously targets of proposed broad tariffs. The White House said that goods covered by an existing trade deal with Canada and Mexico will continue to see no tariffs.Trump said the tariff calculations also include “currency manipulation and trade barriers”, though the White House has not elaborated on how it calculated the new tariffs.It appears Trump has zeroed in on the industry-specific tariffs the countries have placed on American exports. In his speech, Trump criticized policies like the EU’s ban on imported chicken, Canadian tariffs on dairy and Japan’s levies on rice.Trump said the US would charge half of the fees he feels trading partners unfairly impose on the US because the US people are “very kind”. The countries have “placed massive tariffs on [US] products and created non-monetary tariffs to decimate our industries”, Trump said, calling them “common sense reciprocal tariffs”.“Reciprocal: that means they do it to us and we do it to them. Very simple, can’t get any more simple than that,” he said. “This indeed will be the golden age of America,” he said.Trump was ultimately following through with a promise he made during the election: on the campaign trail, Trump floated the idea of a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods.The new tariffs come on top of a lineup of levies that Trump has already implemented: an additional 20% tariff on all Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. There is also a 10% tariff on energy imports fromCanada.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the implementation of his tariffs has so far been haphazard, with multiple rollbacks and delays, and vague promises that have yet to come to fruition.But the threats have soured US relations with its largest trading partners. Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, has called them“unjustified”and pledged to retaliate. The European Union has said it has a“strong plan” to retaliate. Other retaliatory tariffs could eventually lead to higher prices that would hurt American exporters.The US stock market closed slightly up on Wednesday, ahead of Trump’s announcement, with a slight boost from news that Elon Musk may step away from his role in the White House soon to focus on his businesses.Even with the slight upswing, two of the three major stock exchanges saw theirworst quarterin more than two years after Monday marked the end of the first quarter.In March, consumer confidenceplungedto its lowest level in over four years.Pollshave shown that tariffs are unpopular with Americans, including Republicans.

For some, it is likely to be devastating.The UK will be relieved to be slapped with only the 10% minimum afterKeir Starmer’s charm offensive, and the EU may have feared worse than 20%. For some countries Trump outlined much higher rates: 46% for Vietnam, 49% for Cambodia and 29% for Pakistan, for example.The precise effects of sweeping tariffs on this historic scale are hard to predict. One factor is how rival economies will respond: retaliatory tariffs tend to make a bad situation worse, though they may make short-term political sense (seeMark Carney’s poll ratingsin Canada).Trump hits UK with 10% tariffs as he ignites global trade warRead moreAnother question is whether the dollar may appreciate, somewhat softening the blow for US importers. That may limit the effect on prices, which would otherwise be expected to rise as the cost of importing products and materials increases.The main challenge in assessing the exact impact of the plans, though, is that Trump’s statement did not mark the end of the period of profound economic uncertainty that began when he arrived in the White House – quite the opposite.Instead, he has fired the starting gun on a new and inherently unpredictable scramble, in which governments will fire back with their own punitive tariffs – at the same time as negotiating hard to try to secure exemptions.As in the UK, where ministers hope to secure an “economic agreement”, which appears to involvesweeteners for US big techand lower tariffs on food imports, these talks are likely to have economic consequences of their own.And it remains unclear how amenable Trump is likely to be to persuasion.On the one hand, he appears to enjoy the theatre of using tariffs to exact policy concessions, which he can then portray as a winning deal. Trump-watchers have sometimes argued that a dramatic slide in stock prices might lead the president to pull back from the harshest version of the policy. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, insisted on Tuesday that Wall Street “will be just fine” as a result of the tariff package.But in other moments, Trump has appeared to suggest a bit of market turbulence might be part of the plan. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,” he said in a recent Fox News interview – in which he also declined to rule out a recession.There is also the small matter of the revenues the administration hopes to raise from tariffs, which it wants to use to fund tax cuts. The White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has suggested the levies could raise an extraordinary $600bn (£460bn) a year: hardly consistent with offering carve-outs to every major economy that comes knocking.Caving in would also undermine another of Trump’s sometimes-contradictory aims: persuading firms to create new manufacturing jobs, inside the shelter of the tariff wall.As bewildered trade experts repeatedly said in the run-up to what Trump has called “liberation day”, and are likely to continue to say after Trump’s outing in the Rose Garden, guessing what happens next is all but impossible.All this makes for an alarming level of uncertainty – which consumers and businesses hate. Consumer confidence measures in the US have already been sliding sharply. Alongside weeks of headlines about the ambiguous tariff plans, the tens of thousands of abrupt government job losses made by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” seem unlikely to have helped the mood.And in boardrooms, baffled executives may be reluctant to press ahead with significant investments – bringing manufacturing back into the US as Trump hopes, for example – when it is unclear how long the tariffs will endure.Whatever the medium-term prospects of jobs and factories coming “roaring back” to the US, as Trump predicted, for now what some had already dubbed a “Trumpcession” appears significantly more likely to happen, than the “golden age” he has promised.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEconomic policyEconomicsUS economyUS marketsUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s another sign thatElon Musk’s once high-flying electric car company is struggling to attract buyers.The drop is probably due to a combination of factors, including its ageing lineup, competition from rivals and a backlash from Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics. It also is a warning that the company’s first-quarter earnings report later this month could disappoint investors.Tesla reported deliveries of 336,681 vehicles globally in the January-March quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet expected much higher deliveries of 408,000. The figure was down from sales of 387,000 in the same period a year ago. The decline came despite deep discounts, zero financing and other incentives.Tesla’s stock has plunged by roughly half since hitting a mid-December record as expectations of a lighter regulatory touch and big profits withDonald Trumpas president were replaced by fear that the boycott of Musk’s cars and other problems could hit the company hard. Teslas around the countrywere vandalizedin protest of Musk after he dismantled entire federal agencies in his role as the head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”.Musk also made a gesture at a rally that his estranged daughter called “definitely a Nazi salute”.How Tesla became a battleground for political protestRead moreDespiteDonald Trump’s attempts toshore up company saleswith a Tesla presentation in front of the White House and Musk’s assurances to employees that the company has a “bright and exciting” future, the drop in sales was striking.Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The scale is worse than many had expected.“There’s no way to sugarcoat it, Tesla’s first-quarter delivery numbers are a disappointment, though many investors were already preparing for a soft number,” Britzman said.Analysts are still not sure exactly how much the fall in sales is due to the protests or other factors. Electric car sales have been sluggish in general, and Tesla in particular is suffering as car buyers hold off from buying its bestselling Model Y because of plans for an updated version later this year. Even before Musk took up his role in government alongside Trump, Tesla had struggled with meeting its delivery targets. Earnings calls and delivery reportsfailed to match analysts’ expectationsthroughout 2024.“Headlines will point to branding issues, and it’d be naive to assume that’s not a factor here, but it misses the key point,” Britzman said. “Deliveries have been significantly impacted by downtime at factories as Tesla launched the long-awaited refreshed version of the Model Y, its bestselling car.”The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle maker has also lost market share to rivals in recent months as their offerings improve, including those of BYD.

This was, in part, to protect his career, she said.But there was also a “US litigation risk”, given Staley had been contacted by the American attorney Brad Edwards days after Epstein’s arrest over child-sex trafficking on 6 July 2019.Edwards emailed Staley’sBarclaysinbox on 12 July, saying: “I represent numerous of Mr Epstein’s victims. I need to speak with you urgently. Please email me a number to reach you on tomorrow and a time when you are available,” documents submitted to the court showed. Edwards chased up three weeks later: “This is an urgent personal matter. I would appreciate receiving a call from you or your attorney/representative today.”Epsteindied in a US prison on 10 August 2019while awaiting trial. The FCA contacted Barclays days later asking for further information about Staley’s ties to Epstein, as media scrutiny of their relationship intensified.“The reality is that Mr Staley faced an unpleasant dilemma: either he told Barclays the truth, most likely ending his career and giving rise to further investigation immediately, or he could take the chance of misleading the authority,” FCA documents submitted to the court said. “He chose the latter.”A letter sent by Barclays to the FCA in October 2019, said “Jes has confirmed to us that he did not have a close relationship with Mr Epstein” and that his “last contact with Mr Epstein was well before he joined Barclays in 2015”.The FCA says its evidence, which includes 1,200 emails from Staley’s former employer JP Morgan, proves the pair had a close personal relationship, were in direct contact until his appointment and stayed in touch through Staley’s daughter until at least 2017.“He hopes you are well and that after a year with b he wants to visit,” one email from Staley’s daughter to Epstein in September 2016 said. Mulcahy said this was inconsistent with suggestions that Staley wanted to “cut off contact for ever”.Staley argues he was transparent with Barclays that he had a “professionally close” relationship with Epstein. He also said he took Barclays’ legal guidance that “contact” was meant to refer to their last in-person meeting. Staley says he last visited Epstein on his private Caribbean island in April 2015.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Staley said he could not recall if the meeting took place.Mulcahy criticised Staley for failing to provide a consistent narrative about his relationship with Epstein and that his inability to recall certain exchanges – including a now infamous email chain referring to Disney princess characters – “lacks credibility”.At times it seemed he was arguing “black is white” and that his descriptions would go from “one extreme to another, with a lot of inconsistency,” she alleged.Closing statements will continue on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsJes StaleyJeffrey EpsteinFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsBarclaysBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

Many in the US could be forgiven for wondering what exactly they’ve just been liberated from.After much hype, the president unveiled his plan for a new era in global trade: a blanket 10% tariff on goods imported into the US starting Saturday, and higher “reciprocal” tariffs (of up to 49%) on countries taxing US exports starting next Wednesday.Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, upending decades of US trade policyRead more“April 2nd 2025 will be forever remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” according to Trump.Historians will be the judge of that. But before anyone writes this chapter, millions of Americans need to navigate the present.Trump was re-elected last November after years of heightened inflation, and upward pressure on the cost of living. On the campaign trail he pledged, repeatedly and unambiguously, to rapidly liberate the nation from higher prices.But tariffs, his administration has conceded, risk doing the opposite. The treasury secretaryrecently dismissed cheap goods as “not the essence of the American dream”after acknowledging that costs may rise as a result of Trump’s aggressive trade strategy: music to the ears of anyone seeking liberation from lower prices.Anyone sitting in the White House Rose Garden might be reassured. “Prices are way down,” the president has claimed, since his return to office.Anyone who has visited a grocery store in that time might feel differently. Most prices have, in fact, not fallen since January;inflation is still risingwell above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2% per year.“Now it’s our turn to prosper,” he proclaimed. But many US firms are bracing for problematic, not prosperous, effects of this action: higher costs they warn will be passed on to their customers.“What we have heard from business of all sizes, across all industries, from around the country is that these broad tariffs are a tax increase that will raise prices for American consumers and hurt the economy,” said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, the corporate lobby group.Trump likes to present the world as black and white. The US is either winning or losing. A policy, deal or plan is the best or the worst. A person, country or company is supporting or screwing you.There is rarely space for nuance, time for complexity or tolerance for inconvenient facts. The simplicity of this narrative is its power.By Trump’s telling, the US is about to raise trillions of dollars for the federal government by taxing the world, not its citizens: a typically black-and-white choice.But reality is often more complex than rhetoric. There are myriad shades of grey.Import tariffs are not paid by other countries. They are paid by importers – in this case, US firms and consumers – buying goods from overseas. These costs often trickle down through the economy, raising prices at every clink in the chain.Trump promised lower prices. He is betting his tariffs won’t raise them too high, for too long.“This is going to be a big moment,” he said on Wednesday. “I think you’re going to remember today.”He may well be right.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The 246th Merseyside derby proved not merely another step towards thePremier Leaguetitle for Liverpool but a cathartic release, and the reactions showed it.The league leaders cleansed themselves of recent torment againstEvertonand two deflating cup defeats in quick succession to secure a deserved derby win courtesy of Diogo Jota’s fine individual goal.Liverpool 1-0 Everton: Premier League – live reactionRead moreDavid Moyes felt the strike that ended Everton’s nine-match unbeaten run should have been disallowed with Luis Díaz offside in the build-up. He also conceded that James Tarkowski, Everton’s late hero when the local rivals met 49 days ago, was lucky not to see red with only 11 minutes on the clock. The customary Merseyside derby controversy.Of more importance toLiverpoolon this emotional occasion were the cold, hard facts of victory. It leaves Slot’s team needing a maximum of 13 points from the remaining eight games to have the Premier League trophy on display at Anfield once again, and to seal a record-equalling 20th league championship. Their performance against an obstinate and dangerous Everton side was hardly enthralling but underpinned by an impressive determination to recover from a painful Champions League exit and deserved Carabao Cup final defeat before the international break.A fixture that finished with a multitude of flashpoints last time around soon offered up another. Tarkowski was fortunate in the extreme not to be sent off and leave his team in a serious hole at Anfield with the contest in its infancy. Jota had just created Liverpool’s first opening, spinning away from Tarkowski and having a shot blocked by Jarrad Branthwaite. The loose ball spun between the Everton captain and Alexis Mac Allister. Tarkowski got there first but, having cleared out the ball, he followed through to catch the Liverpool midfielder with a dangerously high foot.The referee, Sam Barrott, showed a yellow card to the central defender for a reckless foul. The video assistant referee – Jürgen Klopp’s old friend Paul Tierney – surprisingly went with the referee’s initial call. Slot could only shake his head in disbelief on the sidelines while Mac Allister made a point of showing Barrott the stud marks in his shin. Mac Allister and Tarkowski appeared to bury the hatchet after the final whistle.For all their dominance of the ball and composure, Liverpool created few clear-cut openings before the interval. Mohamed Salah had the best, from a Díaz cross to the back post, but placed a header straight at Jordan Pickford. The visitors fashioned the better first-half openings against a Liverpool central defence that was unusually vulnerable to quick, direct balls in behind.View image in fullscreenJames Tarkowski flies into a challenge on Alexis Mac Allister, but escapes with a yellow card.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesBeto proved a tireless thorn in the side of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté. Everton’s lone centre forward had the ball in the Liverpool net when Van Dijk failed to deal with Tarkowski’s searching pass out of defence. Beto raced through to convert between the legs of Caoimhín Kelleher but was just offside. Kelleher again started in goal for Liverpool as Alisson was absent because of concussion protocols, having sustained a head injury while on international duty with Brazil.Beto found himself clean through on goal for a second time when Van Dijk swiped at an Abdoulaye Doucouré pass and missed his attempted clearance. This time the striker was onside but, having beaten the advancing Kelleher, his powerful finish struck the base of a post and cannoned clear. It was a huge let‑off for Liverpool, as was the final action of the first half when James Garner’s free-kick picked out the unmarked Carlos Alcaraz in front of Kelleher’s goal. The on-loan midfielder miscued his header badly wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool started the second half with renewed intent and aggression. Ryan Gravenberch began to exert more influence in central midfield and the pressure was mounting, the Kop expectant, before Jota finally produced an end product. Díaz was clearly offside when Gravenberch attempted to dissect the Everton defence. Crucially, according to the letter of a law that Slot professed to hate, the winger made no clear attempt to play the ball. Tarkowski was not to know that and made a weak interception. Díaz, back in an onside position, teed up Jota with a cute back-heel. The Portugal international swept past Idrissa Gueye into the box and away from Tarkowski before completing his run with a characteristically cool, measured shot beyond Pickford.Everton’s appeals for an offside against Díaz in the build-up were in vain. Their attempts to turn the tide of the derby or at least challenge Liverpool’s authority proved similarly fruitless.Moyes made five late changes in an attempt to salvage a point but Liverpool held firm and could have extended their lead through Díaz. Darwin Núñez, a replacement for Jota, was fouled inside the Everton area by Pickford in the closing minutes but play had already been halted for a foul by Tim Iroegbunam on Dominik Szoboszlai. That, however, was the only late pain that Everton inflicted in this derby.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The opponents aren’t an aloof, brutally effective Soviet Union team expected to steamroll their way to a gold medal just as their military were attempting to steamroll their way through Afghanistan.The Concacaf Nations League isn’t the Olympics, and there’ll be no film starring Kurt Russell as Panamanian coach Thomas Christiansen inspiring his team to ageopolitically charged winover the Goliaths of the competition. But like the Soviet hockey team in 1980, the US men’s soccer team in 2025 is an easy team to dislike. And with a World Cup on home soil rapidly approaching, that’s a heavy cross to bear.Nations League losses and sparse crowds have US momentum at low ebbRead moreTo use another analogy: In the 2026 World Cup, the US men might find themselves as disliked as Duke in men’s college basketball – if Duke had failed to get past the second round of the NCAA Tournament, lacked players as charismatic as Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg, but did have designs on annexing every part of North America that doesn’t speak Spanish.Teams attract support for a few different reasons, and the US men score poorly on all of them:Underdog status.The US men had this in the past. In the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, a bunch of college kids and semi-professional players challenged the seasoned pros. They continued punching above their weight in the 2000s,upsetting Portugal in the 2002 World Cup, upending the balance of power in the region by beating Mexico in that same World Cup and several other occasions, then ending Spain’s 35-match unbeaten streak in the 2009 Confederations Cup final. But now, with a so-called “Golden Generation” of talent spread among elite clubs in Europe, they’ve traded the “underdog” label for “underachiever” –eliminated in the group stageat last year’s Copa América, and losers of two underwhelming games at the Nations League finals.Brilliant play.We can, at least for now, rule this out.Provincial identity.Philadelphia roots for the Eagles – maybe a bit too much. Boston gets behind the Red Sox. But such loyalties are shallower if the ties are more transient. In Washington DC, where a lot of people from elsewhere descend on the nation’s capital and its suburbs, fans from the “road” team are often numerous and noisy for the local teams. What happens to a team representing the United States if immigrants are feeling less welcome in the country? Or if the intelligentsia are watching their work dismissed and dismantled while some of their colleagues are swept off the streets to be detained and deported?Personalities.US soccer players have long been marketable. In women’s soccer, from Mia Hamm’s heyday to that of Megan Rapinoe, players have been a constant presence in TV ads. Men’s soccer had its share of recognizable stars – Alexi Lalas had a goatee and a guitar, Landon Donovan projected California Zen and was even married to a TV star for a while. Today? The good news is that a lot of American kids are finally wearing soccer shirts. The bad news? They all say “Messi” on the back.To an extent, the US men’s image has never recovered from Lalas’s blistering“tattooed millionaires” rantwhen the team was on its way to World Cup qualification failure in 2017. Much of the team has retired since then, but Lalas also singled out “Wonderboy” Christian Pulisic, who should be in his prime.Lalas’s words resonated because the soccer community understood exactly what he was saying. In the past, US men had the excuse of being in a country that didn’t take the sport seriously and had scant opportunities for proper development outside the rough-and-tumble world of college soccer. By 2017, most of the US men’s team had experience in Europe, and many had been professionals since their mid-teens.“You are a soccer generation that has been given everything,” Lalas said at the time. “You are a soccer generation who’s on the verge of squandering everything.”Spending much of their careers in Europe adds to the perceived distance between players and supporters, especially because many of the players are breaking through in Italy’s Serie A, which has a tiny presence on US TV in comparison to the Premier League, which once boosted the image of players like Tim Howard, relentless target player Brian McBride and the preternaturally crafty Clint Dempsey.Most of these circumstances are beyond the players’ control. Milan and Juventus have been better fits for US players than Chelsea and Leeds. The US team isn’t responsible for the US government – and in any case, if geopolitics alone determined fan loyalty, Washington Capitals fans wouldn’t be unabashedly cheering for their Russian star, Alex Ovechkin, to wrest the NHL career goalscoring record from Wayne Gretzky.That said, the lack of an activist akin to Rapinoe or Julie Foudy hasn’t gone unnoticed. And the US fanbase isn’t shy about showing its disdain for players like Korbin Albert, whose negative attitude toward even the most performative LGBTQ allyship may find a sympathetic audience in parts of the White House but not down the street at Audi Field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnd US players today don’t exactly come across as supporters of the proletariat.In most countries whose players are well-compensated by professional clubs, national team pay is an afterthought. Kylian Mbappégave away his bonus moneyfor winning the 2018 World Cup. England players typically donate their international match fees, though the sums are not particularly significant in the first place.Three years ago, US soccer teams reached ahistoric equal pay agreementby making sure both the men and the women would make quite a lot of money – 80-90% of the Fifa prize money the men and women accumulate at upcoming World Cups. They announced that deal soon after US Soccer president Cindy Cone barely survived a grassroots revolt in which state youth and adult organizers perceived that the federation no longer cared about the game outside the professional ranks. And the players didn’t make any grand gestures to smooth over relations with those grassroots organizers, all of whom are smart enough to know that it’s not just their personal fiefdoms at stake but also the USA’s ability to compete with countries that funnel much of their prize money back into developing the next generations to win it all once again.US Soccer is only a generation and change removed from the days of their supporters being outnumbered at home matches. Games in California would draw massive support from Mexican fans. Games in Washington, where nearly every nation on the planet has some sort of diaspora, would often turn up crowds that were far from unanimous in supporting the home team. US Soccer wound up hosting World Cup qualifiers against Mexico in Columbus, Ohio, where the lower temperatures and lower diversity would give the USA a true “home” advantage.Since then, the crowds on US soil have embraced teams that mixed scrappiness and skill to supplant Mexico as the regional power. They found players with whom to identify – journeyman Jay DeMerit fought through non-league English football to reach the national team, Donovan and Jozy Altidore came across as typical US teenagers, and Herculez Gomez was at the vanguard of a group of Mexican-American players who opted to represent the red, white and blue.Today’s US players are commanding transfer fees and big salaries to move to Europe before anyone even knows who they are. Gomez is an ESPN commentatorripping the team’s lackof offensive effort.And if the US men and their marketers want the country to rally behind them next year in what should be a landmark moment for the sport in North America, they’ll need to do something to connect with their supporters. Or at least beat Panama.Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Afterwards on Instagram, Grealish said: “With me always, especially this day – that was for you Keelan.”Diogo Jota breaks down Everton’s blue wall as Liverpool move closer to titleRead moreHe told Sky: “My little brother passed away 25 years ago [aged just nine months]. This day is hard on the family but I was happy to score. My mum and dad were here. This day is always difficult in the family, so to score and to win was brilliant.”Grealish’s opener was his first in the league since he scored against Crystal Palace on 16 December 2023.“As soon as I scored I knew this would be what people say but listen, this season I’ve not been at my best – even last season,” he said. “I’ve not started in the Premier League since before Christmas. But I was happy I started tonight and to score.”Omar Marmoush was the player billed pre-game as the injured Erling Haaland’s capable stand-in; his response was to score City’s second. For Pep Guardiola, who adores the Champions League, the end result is business accomplished in the bid to seal a qualification berth: victory lifts City to fourth. Yet as is the story of an underwhelming campaign, the manager’s charges lacked sharpness and intensity and Guardiola will spend the close season addressing this as he targets a return to a high-octane game.Those who waited until nine minutes to take their seat in protest at City partnering with Viagogo, a ticket resale site, missed Grealish’s opener, which instantly made it feel like the Foxes would be lucky to depart without serious embarrassment. Guardiola, seated in the stands due to a one-game ban, swigged from a bottle of water and would be overjoyed at his choice of Grealish as the playmaker.Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side last scored on 7 February via Bobby De Cordova-Reid. So when finally planting a few boots in City territory you understood why Bilal El Khannouss tried to curl an equaliser past Ederson from long range.View image in fullscreenJack Grealish (centre) celebrates scoring Manchester City’s opening goal before protesting fans take their seats.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAHe missed, but more measured was a move down the right that ended when Patson Daka twisted away from Josko Gvardiol but ran the ball out. The Leicester advance pointed to City lacking the iron-fisted control of past seasons. Where once the ball was guarded, sloppiness informs the opponent they have a chance.Rúben Dias’s loose pass upfield was an example. So too was Savinho slipping over to allow El Khannouss to pilfer possession. After this show of City weakness, cue Leicester imploding, or rather Hermansen: another poorly aimed Dias ball went straight into the keeper, but he spilled and Marmoush steered home off an upright.Marmoush went close to netting a seventh since joining in January but a shot was blocked. Then Savinho drew a sharp Hermansen save after an Ilkay Gündogan cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moments later Grealish weaved into the area, Leicester parted like the proverbial, and the forward fell on his backside. A penalty was demanded but Darren England was not interested, nor did the VAR ask the referee to take a second look. Replays seemed to show a Grealish miskick only.In potent mood City know when to speed up the patient stuff, as Grealish did when pivoting infield and finding O’Reilly. Suddenly the local boy saw an opening and a smart outside-of-the-boot stab followed that might have been City’s third. Yet cleverness was absent from Marmoush’s wild blaze over following silken Savinho-Grealish-Jérémy Doku passes: the Egyptian should have made it 3-0 and put Leicester away.But no, and what ensued was tepid fare. City were at 70%-plus possession and the counter showed 14 shots to Leicester’s paltry one but the champions had settled into keep-ball mode, tapping it about in and around halfway.A Savinho pratfall summed this up. Sunday’s crosstown trip to Manchester United for the 196th derby will hopefully be more vibrant.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityLeicester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A piece of lettuce became caught in his throat and May sipped some water trying to clear it. He felt a painful sensation in his throat and stomach, and later learned the lettuce had perforated his esophageal tube.“It’s kind of one of those stories you just make up but it was actually true,” teammate Mookie Betts said. “God was just working his magic.”Torpedo bats: a destroyer of worlds or baseball’s long-awaited savior?Read moreMay underwent emergency surgery that same night.He later said he“probably wouldn’t have made it through the night if I didn’t have it”, with doctors later telling him he had sought medical attention just in time.“There wasn’t really a very bright light at the end of the tunnel at the time,” May said after Tuesday’s game. “I had to scratch and claw my way out and find my way back.”He added that his faith had made his recovery easier. “I was thanking the Lord for the opportunity to be back,” he said. “There’s been a lot of praying and a lot of devotion to him in the last two years of my life and I attribute all of my success to him.”With Tuesday’s 3-1 victory over the Atlanta Braves, the Dodgers are off to the club’s best start since moving to Los Angeles. The only better starts in franchise history came in 1955 (10-0) and 1940 (9-0) when the team was located in Brooklyn. The slumping Braves fell to 0-6 for the first time since opening 0-9 in 2016.May allowed just one hit and an unearned run after Betts’s throwing error at shortstop in the second inning led to Atlanta’s lone run. Betts made up for his error with a go-ahead home run in the sixth before Tommy Edman singled to complete the victory.May said cheating death has calmed him down. “Just being able to stay a little bit more level-headed throughout life in general has been one of my biggest things probably in the last six months,” he said.The Dodgers have endured a series of strange medical mishaps. Freddie Freeman missed the start of the Braves seriesafter slipping in the showerand hurting his surgically repaired right ankle. Betts, meanwhile,lost 15lbs after a stomach illness, describing how “my body’s just kind of eating itself”. Betts appears to have recovered well:he is batting .375and has hit three home runs already this season.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles DodgersMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

What’s the fix?Oren WeisfeldWed 2 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 05.02 EDTShareThe Toronto Raptors aren’t new to losing. But they are new to whatever this is.After taking over as the Raptors’ president of basketball operations in 2013, Masai Ujiri refused to embrace the blatant,in-your-face tankingthat Sam Hinkie and the “process” Philadelphia 76ers were busy popularizing during that same era, instead opting to build from the middle. “I’m not sure the karma is great when you do stuff like that,” Ujirisaidabout tanking. “We’re not doing that here,” he lateradded.The Raptors made history in 2019 by becoming the first team to win an NBA Championship without a single lottery pick. But after Toronto missed the playoffs in three of the last four seasons and were rewarded with just one top 10 draft pick, Ujiri finally decided to follow in a long line of teams who are taking advantage of the NBA’s incentive structure that meansbad teams have better oddsof landing a top pick in the draft.Now, the Raptors find themselves in the middle of an embarrassing and unwatchable multi-team tank-off that has come to define the 2024-25NBAseason.“As a purist of the league, a purist of basketball, we play every game to win,” 15-year veteran and vice-president of the NationalBasketballPlayers Association, Garrett Temple, tells the Guardian. “[But] the way the rules are set up, it’s advantageous to be the worst team in the league record-wise. I don’t think it’s a great look for the NBA.”And the Raptors have given bad looks this season. After leading playoff-bound Orlando Magic by double digits in the fourth quarter on 4 March, Raptors head coach Darko Rajakovic pulled the plug by sitting starters Immanuel Quickley, Scottie Barnes, Jakob Poeltl and RJ Barrett, leaving about $100m in salaries on the bench and less than $10m in rookies and two-way players on the floor. “All I could do was laugh,” Barrettsaid.‘The food is bad, everything is bad’: what it feels like to be on a hopeless NBA teamRead moreWhile Rajakovic explained that “for us, it’s very, very important now to take a look at different players and young guys and to develop those guys, to give them important minutes,” the reality was that the Raptors were as close to the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings as they were to a playoff spot. Even though about a third of the regular season was still to be played at that point, the team had already decided to prioritize managing its lottery odds over making a push for the playoffs.And they are not the only ones.“Right now there are nine teams tanking,” one league executive toldESPN. “And next year’s draft is going to have maybe more franchise players than this year’s draft. A year from now, you may still have nine teams tanking.”That’s almost one-third of the league that exists somewhere on a spectrum from being comfortable with mediocrity to coming up with increasingly creative ways to lose games. Teams are sitting their best players due to “rest” and quiet-quitting by pulling starters late in games, causing upwards of20 star playersto be in street clothes on any given night in March and April, making the quality of late-season basketball worse than ever.“Teams can put whatever they want on their injury report, and the league has not policed injury reports,” NBA writer Brian Windhorst said on the Hoop Collective podcast. “So you have situations where guys are truly injured, but listed as out. And other situations where stars are not really injured, but they’re listed as out. And so the credibility is all over the place, and the league has let that go down the block and around the corner … it’s just a mess.”While it makes sense for teams to take advantage of the NBA’s incentive structure so long as they can get away with it, the popularization of tanking has created a lose-lose situation for the league, the fans who pay large sums to attend games or watch on TV, the players who are missing out on crucial developmental reps and, most importantly, the NBA’s TV partners, who recentlysignedan 11-year agreement worth $76bn.People have been trying to come up withcreative solutions to solve the NBA’s tanking problemfor more than a decade, ranging from flattening the draft lottery odds so that every non-playoff team has an equal chance of getting the No 1 overall pick, to creating a “play-out” tournament where the worst teams compete for better draft odds at the end of the season, to replacing the draft with rookie free agency.But each so-called solution comes with unintended consequences, such as teams on the playoff bubble tanking to get in the lottery if the odds are flat or if there is a play-out tournament, and the best rookies hurting parity by signing in big markets in free agency.We know that the NBA doesn’t approve of tanking because it has a long history of railing against it. The league pressured the 76ers to get rid of Hinkie in 2016, and fined Dallas Mavericks ownerMark Cuban $600,000for admitting to tanking in 2018.The question, then, is how does the NBA keep a similar incentive structure but discourage the blatant, unethical tanking that has become popular in recent years? The obvious answer is to start by seriously penalizing anything that goes against the integrity of the game.After all, we usually have a pretty good idea about who the worst teams are by the 50-game mark, with the league sorting itself into tiers of contenders, playoff teams and bottom-dwellers. But at a certain point, some teams rest veterans or quiet-quit to increase their lottery odds. The rest of the bottom-dwellers have no choice but to follow suit, and bam! Unmitigated, unethical tanking ensues.“When I first came in the league, I don’t remember this happening as much,” Temple, who has been around the NBA since 2009, says. “People are trying to take advantage of situations and have their team be the best team they can be. At the end of the day, no team is doing this in order to have a bad team. They’re trying to make their team better.”But what if there was a way to pressure teams to play out the entire season the way they play the first 50 games? That way, the lottery order would sort itself out naturally, and the worst teams would get the best odds without the need to ever lose on purpose.It may sound extreme, but that’s exactly what happens in the NHL, where a culture of competitiveness and power at the hands of head coaches keeps teams from resting players in order to lose on purpose. Instead, the NHL employs a different, more ethical form of tanking where the worst teams choose to offload veteran players at the trade deadline and naturally lose out as a result.The NBA can’t expect the culture to change naturally given that teams have learned how to exploit the system, but the league can make it a significantly harder system to game. This would require the NBA to get serious about discouraging tanking, penalizing teams who are found guilty of resting healthy players with significant fines or the removal of future draft picks in order to get the best players to play all season.In March, the NBA fined the Utah Jazz$100,000 for violating the league’s player participation policyfor sitting star Lauri Markkanen for nine straight games when he appeared to be free of significant injury. But the standard $100,000 fine that the league levied against the Jazz this year, the 76ers last year, and Mavericks the year before is a drop in the bucket for team owners like Ryan Smith, who has an estimated net worth of $2.6bn. And when Markkanen did return the following game, he played just 19 minutes and sat the entire second half, showing how seriously the organization took the penalty.“These next few weeks,” one NBA executive toldESPN. “Could be the worst tanking stretch we’ve ever seen.”What the NBA needs is a new set of rules specifically designed to discourage tanking – a “Shame Doctrine” that clearly lays out a set of increasingly significant penalties that will be levied against teams for tanking, with each infraction setting them back millions of dollars and future draft picks.Of course, it can be complicated to police injuries when almost every player is banged up by the end of the season. But the league already has its own doctors to determine whether a player is healthy enough to play, and enforcing it would besimilar to what the NFL doesin order to satisfy football’s integrity (and the NFL’s betting partners).Plus, common sense should apply here. If a team pulls its starters in the fourth quarter as the Raptors did, they should be penalized. If the Jazz refuse to spread out Markkanen’s minutes so that he only plays in the first half, so should they.The solution isn’t to come up with a different incentive structure besides the lottery because they all have flaws. Instead, it’s time for the NBA to be proactive and get serious about penalizing tanking violations. Otherwise, teams will continue to find creative ways to game the system, and the product will continue to suffer.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the moment,Nikola Jokićis just super tired.The Denver Nuggets star mustered a career-best 61-point performance in which he played nearly 53 minutes. He didn’t leave the court after halftime ofa 140-139 double-overtime lossto the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night.His scoring spree was the most by a player in theNBAthis season. Jokić also had 10 rebounds and 10 assists, notching just the third 60-point triple-double in NBA history. The others to do so were Luka Dončić in December 2022 and James Harden in January 2018.“The guy’s Superman,” Nuggets coach Malone said. “He’s on a whole other level, man. People say he’s not athletic, but not many guys can do what he does.”On Tuesday, Jokić attempted 24 free throws – making 19 – to match the team mark held by Carmelo Anthony. For all his exploits, Jokic had just one over-riding emotion: “Tired,” he said. “It was an exhausting game.”Anthony Edwards gave the three-time NBA MVP major props.Jokić is in a heated MVP racewith Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Jokić won the award last season.Nikola Jokić is putting up record numbers. So why is he unlikely to be NBA MVP?Read more“Nikola Jokić, he might be the best basketball player that I have ever seen close up, besides myself,” joked Edwards, who had 34 points and 10 rebounds. “He is incredible. The MVP race is tough. I don’t know. He had 60. That is crazy.”This game – a sixth straight loss for Denver to Minnesota, including playoffs – will be remembered by Nuggets fans for Jokić’s exploits on the court. But it will also be remembered for a wild finish.Leading 139-138 with around 14 seconds left, Russell Westbrook stole the ball and dished it over to Christian Braun who then sent it back to Westbrook for a layup. But Westbrook’s layup clanked off the rim and started a break the other way. Westbrook ran down the court and fouled Nickeil Alexander-Walker in the corner with 0.1 seconds remaining. The Timberwolves guard hit two of three free throws to steal the victory.“Obviously, I feel awful for Russ,” Malone said. “That last play we get the turnover, we don’t convert, and then the foul. It was not from a lack of effort or care. Sometimes it goes like that, and that’s why we’ve just got to be strong. We’ve got to be resilient.”The big question: Should the Nuggets have pulled the ball back out to run down the clock instead of attempting the layup?“It’s tough. You’ve got a two-on-one break,” Malone said. “As a coach, am I up on the sideline yelling, ‘Don’t go?’ We’ve got a layup. But it’s easy to say that [pull the ball out] in hindsight, because we missed a layup. ... [Westbrook] is a tough kid, and I think he knows that everybody in that locker room’s got his back.”For Jokić, there’s not much time for rest. The Nuggets play on Wednesday night against San Antonio.“I think we’re so used to this,” Jokić said. “Tomorrow, I’m not going to remember I played so many minutes.”Jokić was not the only MVP to put in an impressive performance on Tuesday night. Stephen Curry scored 52 points, including 12 three-pointers, as the Golden State Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 134-125.Explore more on these topicsNikola JokićDenver NuggetsMinnesota TimberwolvesNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

After beingdumped out of the FA Cup quarter-finalshere on Saturday by Nottingham Forest in a penalty shootout, there was more heartache for the Brighton manager as Marcus Rashford’s third goal in his past two games, yet another for Marco Asensio, and Donyell Malen’s first for the club gave Aston Villa a crucial win in the battle for a top‑five finish.It meant Unai Emery’s side moved above Brighton and vastly improved their chances of matching their achievement last season of qualifying for the Champions League. They still have to play the fourth- and fifth-placed Manchester City and Newcastle in the run-in after hosting Forest on Saturday. Yet after making some shrewd acquisitions in January including Rashford and Asensio – who now has eight goals for Villa since joining on loan from Paris Saint-Germain – you wouldn’t bet against them doing it.Manchester City 2-0 Leicester, Brighton 0-3 Aston Villa and more: Premier League – liveRead more“The most important thing is how he is feeling – how he is recovering confidence in himself and concentrating on playing football,” Emery said of Rashford’s impact. “But everything with him is getting progressively better and it’s the same with Marco [Asensio]. We signed these players because we knew they could help us.”Hürzeler criticised his team for “playing soft” against Forest but they were again outfought by a well‑drilled Villa outfit. There was frustration when Simon Adingra’s equaliser was disallowed for handball just after Rashford’s opener but more than a smattering of boos greeted the third from Malen – who joined Villa from Borussia Dortmund in January – in the 10th minute of stoppage time.“It’s not easy when all the little things go against you, you try to force it in some moments and we didn’t have the right answer,” said Hurzeler, whose team face a trip to play their arch-rivals Crystal Palace on Saturday. “We have a chance to make it better.”It took Villa’s fans less than five minutes to remind their hosts that they are heading to Wembley this month to face Palace with a chorus of “Que Sera”. With the first leg of their Champions League quarter‑final against PSG to look forward to as well next week, Emery was delighted that Ollie Watkins was able to return from injury as a second-half substitute alongside Asensio and Malen.It was Villa’s bench that made the difference, although the option to make Rashford’s move permanent from Manchester United in the summer for £40m is looking more and more attractive by the day.View image in fullscreenMarco Asensio celebrates his eighth goal for Aston Villa since joining on loan in January.Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesThe referee, Stuart Attwell, waved away appeals for a first-half penalty after Kaoru Mitoma went down rather easily under pressure from Matty Cash inside the area. Emery could not resist offering his own opinion that the Japan forward had dived as he and Hürzeler had to be separated by the fourth official Simon Hooper.Villa had their own appeals for a penalty turned down despite the video assistant referee taking a long look at Jack Hinshelwood’s challenge on Jacob Ramsey. Brighton felt they had another shout for a penalty when Yasin Ayari’s free-kick cannoned back off the post and struck Ramsey on the arm but again Attwell said no.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jan Paul van Hecke’s header from a corner was straight at Emi Martínez and the Villa goalkeeper wasted no time finding Morgan Rogers with a quick throw. His pass over the top was perfect for Rashford to race on to and he squeezed the ball past Bart Verbruggen via a deflection.Brighton thought they had found the perfect riposte when Adingra swept home from close range but VAR correctly ruled out the goal after replays showed Mitoma had used his arm to control the ball in the buildup.Rashford’s night came to an end midway through the second half as Emery attempted to close out the victory with a triple substitution that included Asensio. Not to be outdone, Hurzeler made a quadruple change for Brighton. But it was Asensio who made the difference when he finished off a lightning quick break before Malan rounded off the scoring in injury-time to give Villa’s Champions League hopes a shot in the arm.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

First Barcelona played, then they resisted, expertly suppressing Atlético Madrid’s brief rebellion at the Metropolitano, and together those two halves, those two faces, took them through. A wild and open first leg,4-4 at Montjuic, gave way to a tighter second won by a single Ferran Torres goal. Seville awaits football’s greatest rivals, both of them still chasing a treble. “Dreaming is allowed,” Hansi Flick said, “but we will have to work hard. At the club they have a lot of space for more titles.”For Diego Simeone’s side, meanwhile, this was The End. In the five weeks since the first leg of this semi-final, a season that had set up to be superb instead escaped Atlético, all three major competitions gone. They have won just one of five games since then, and that was the Champions League second leg in whichMadrid knocked them out on penalties. They also slipped nine points off the top in La Liga and now their cup run is over. They had taken their opponents to the line but could not get over it themselves. “There’s nothing to reproach,” the coach said.Bernabéu erupts as Rüdiger’s late show seals Copa del Rey final spot for MadridRead moreHere, perhaps, there could have been. Afterwards José María Giménez apologised for how Atlético had played in the first half. His manager said there was no need to say sorry and rightly insisted that they had “competed” after the break. But while the substitute Alex Sørloth had a potential equaliser ruled out for offside, and while they sent the goalkeeper Juan Musso up for a corner in the 94th minute, some hope still there at the very end, ultimately they had not managed a shot on target.Apart from a brief storm,Barcelonahad controlled this, and in two different ways. “You also have to defend and we did it great,” Flick said. “Not only with the ball, but also against the ball – and this is team work.”The start suggested another wild, open game, Lamine Yamal escaping up the right at one end and Marcos Llorente doing likewise at the other. A couple fierce early challenges gave it an edge too. The game though soon settled into a pattern imposed by Barcelona, the ball theirs, played with patience but insistence.As Barcelona moved it swiftly through midfield, Pedri was at the heart of it all, his movement smooth and precise. Alongside him, Frenkie de Jong excelled. The third midfielder, Fermín impressed again, all sharp, incisive runs just ahead of them. But when the moves quickened and the threat became more real, they tended to do so at the feet of Lamine Yamal.View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Iñigo Martínez celebrates at the full-time whistle.Photograph: Ángel Martínez/Getty ImagesNot so much because he ran at people this time, although he did, and a shift of his hips is often enough to send opponents off the other way. Not because he was there to finish moves either, although on 11 minutes another quick exchange saw him bend a shot just past the far post. But more because of his eye for a pass and his ability to execute it, an awareness of everything happening around him, his decision-making always impeccable.Bit by bit, Barcelona pushed Atlético deeper; bit by bit, they picked their way round them too. A lovely exchange between Torres, Pedri and Raphinha left Torres free until Robin Le Normand stepped in to stop him. A scooped pass from Lamine Yamal then sent Jules Koundé into the area. Fermín was the next player to see a final pass fall a fraction short. And then Barcelona took the lead, Lamine Yamal delivering an angled ball into the area where Torres slipped in and beat Musso.Barcelona were entirely in control now, Raphinha seeing one free-kick curl over and another effort blocked by Musso.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Simeone introduced Clément Lenglet, Javi Galán and Alex Sørloth at the break, the second half beginning with an Antoine Griezmann volley wide. This felt different now, and the fans felt it too, the noise rising. The roof almost came off when Rodrigo De Paul slotted in Sørloth. One on one against Wojciech Szczesny, the goal opening, the Norwegian’s shot struck the side netting.Atlético were up and running now. And, although a superb surge from Lamine Yamal and Fermín’s awareness opened a chance for Raphinha which might have ended it but for a save from Musso, Flick reacted to close off the spaces, his team dropping deeper, the substitutes Eric García and Ronald Araújo destined to play key roles. The foul count rose too, Barcelona committing more than in any game this season. The score did not change, Sørloth running on to Julián Alvarez’s flick to smash home with 20 minutes to go, only to see the flag raised.And that, it turned out, was that. The margin remained fine, hope held until the last, but triumph once again remained out of reach for Atlético.

Europe beckons, tantalisingly, for the newly minted Carabao Cup winners.Howe’s Wembley history-makers may be in the words of their captain, Bruno Guimarães, “legends” on Tyneside now, but they were up against opponents aiming to extend a run of five straight away wins.“We were always in the game,” said the visiting manager, whose players remained unfazed as Newcastle initially stretched them down the flanks, nearly taking an early lead when Alexander Isak headed narrowly wide. “Tonali’s goal was one in a million.”While Isak menaced before his eventual withdrawal with a tight groin, Brentford came alive on the break. It was easy to appreciate why Frank’s right winger, Bryan Mbeumo, ranks so highly on Howe’s summer shopping list.Mbeumo’s amalgam of outstanding movement and laser-like accuracy of delivery dictated that, on the left of the home defence, Tino Livramento and Dan Burn could never relax. Neither could Tonali. Howe had his Italy midfielder to thank for intercepting a series of counterattacks as his intelligent interpretation of the No 6 role once again underlined his importance.As the dangerous Kevin Schade, deployed nominally on the left wing, and the rest of Frank’s front line interchanged positions with a dizzying rapidity, Newcastle looked more leggy than legends.They are nothing if not resilient though and they do possess Isak. Sure enough, with half-time approaching, the Sweden striker conjured the opening that prefaced a narrowly offside Harvey Barnes turning the ball into an empty net.Undeterred by the decision to disallow that goal, Isak swiftly connected with Jacob Murphy’s superb cross and, capitalising on Mbeumo’s unfortunate stumble, volleyed his 20thPremier Leaguegoal of the season beyond Mark Flekken’s reach from close range.View image in fullscreenTonali’s effort flies past Mark Flekken.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersNot that Mbeumo is too shabby in front of goal either. He duly equalised with his 16th goal of a tremendous campaign following Nick Pope’s foul on Yoane Wissa, punishing the goalkeeper from the penalty spot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The moment had arrived for Tonali to reassert himself and he did not disappoint. Given that he struck his goal from a classic crossing position near a corner flag it was also one of the most impudent finishes imaginable.Whether it was really supposed to be a cross or not, the former Milan playmaker had spotted Flekken off his line and reacted instinctively. It proved the cue for the Tonali song – “drinks Moretti, eats spaghetti”, to tumble, gratefully, down from the stands.Afterwards Frank, smiling ruefully, asked the man of the moment: “Did you mean that?” Tonali grinned broadly. As he later reflected: “It was hard for the goalkeeper and hard for me but there was also a little bit of luck.”Howe, winking, joked that Tonali practised the manoeuvre every day in training.“I was mightily relieved when it hit the back of the net,” said Newcastle’s manager.“We weren’t at our finest.

Winless since mid-February, cherry-flavoured European dreams are fading fast; a home defeat by struggling visitors following the weekend’sexit from the FA Cup.Now nine points shy of safety, Kieran McKenna’s team’s survival chances remain remote but alive. The only certainty is that Liam Delap, scorer of their brilliant second goal, will be playingPremier Leaguefootball next season but with eight games to play, after a first league win in 2025, a small chance is better than no chance at all.Premier League top scorers 2024-25: who is leading race for Golden Boot?Read more“You need the wins across the season,” said McKenna. “You do need them, as fantastic as this group is. You need the validation they give you.”Revivals from Everton, West Ham and, crucially, Wolves, have been trampling on any seeds of a comeback.Wolves’ win against the Hammerson Tuesday had been another dagger to the heart. Ipswich host Wolves on Saturday, the gap can be closed to six points.“We know what the challenge is,” said McKenna, downbeat but finding the positive. “We can only control ourselves. It’s going to take something extra special.”Winter has seen harsh lessons learned, and at the Vitality Stadium, they were acted on. In December at Portman Road, Ipswich took the game to Bournemouth only tolose at the last. Come spring they set up with far greater pragmatism.Six changes from their4-2 home defeat by Nottingham Forestsuggested McKenna had done plenty of thinking. Too late? Very possibly, though beating Andoni Iraola’s team represents a significant coup for a coach whose reputation has taken a jolt after the heroics of hauling Ipswich up the divisions.View image in fullscreenEvanilson pulls a goal back for Bournemouth.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesBournemouth dominated the early proceedings but the snap and swing of their best football was lacking, and remained so throughout, particularly when chasing the game late on. “Everything is costing us,” said Iraola. “It’s not the clarity we have shown in other parts of the season.”After Bournemouth’s Alex Scott twice went close, Ipswich’s Julio Enciso set off on a solo run and, having drawn defenders to him, played in Nathan Broadhead, whose finish was ice cool for someone scoring their first ever Premier League goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Without him, a cutting edge was scratched around for but never found.Delap’s goal, his 11th of the season, after an exchange with the overlapping Conor Townsend, showed how it was done.“Fantastic execution,” said McKenna of the striker. “His performance tonight was better than in recent weeks.

The wait to consign such petty, but not insignificant matters, goes on.Free-flowing Delap nets winner for Ipswich but survival hopes still faintRead moreAfter a nine-game league losing run at home, Paul Onuachu’s early goal at least ended the rot. A spirited performance could well have yielded more.Alas, victories are in short supply this season, and they maintained their unwanted record of dropping more points after leading than any other Premier League club this season.“I’m very proud with the way we played today and very disappointed that we didn’t win because I think we did almost everything good,” Juric said. “I’m really sorry for the fans and the guys because I think we deserved it.”Juric’s challenge this week for his players to prove they are not “the worst team in the history of the Premier League” remains. Relegation could be confirmed as soon as this weekend.França’s late nod spared Palace’s blushes against a team they would have hoped to breeze past. With a host of top-half opponents still to face, recent utterances of potentially mounting a European challenge through the league might have been premature. The FA Cup provides their best route, having booked a semi‑final spot last weekend.“It’s a very good point, especially how the game was,” Oliver Glasner said. “It was tough, everybody could see it and feel it.

We can’t take it for granted that we go everywhere and win.”There was a familiar sense of resignation, among the lowest St Mary’s league attendance this campaign, when Jean-Philippe Mateta almost gave Palace the lead after 90 seconds when crashing a shot against the crossbar from range.From then on, something rather strange happened: Southampton dominated. It was at the end of one of the hosts’ numerous slick flowing moves that the eye-catching Mateus Fernandes delivered a peach of a cross for Onuachu’s header to squirm its way in via Dean Henderson’s palm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Andrea Berta has held talks with the Spain forward’s representatives in one of his first actsas the club’s sporting director.It is understood Berta, who was confirmed in his post last Sunday and attended Tuesday’s2-1 win over Fulham, has met the 22-year-old’s agent, Félix Tainta.Ange Postecoglou admits ‘outstanding candidates’ waiting if Spurs replace himRead moreArsenal have heavily scouted Williams for the past two years and are believed to have considered a move for him last summer, only to be informed that he wanted to remain at Athletic for another season.Williams, having starred for Spain at Euro 2024 and helped his boyhood club reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League, where they will face Rangers next week, is expected to push for a move this summer. Barcelona, who also tried to sign Williams last summer, Bayern Munich and Chelsea are also believed to be in the race, with his release clause thought to be set at €58m (£48.4m). Arsenal’s long-term interest and the role of Berta, formerly sporting director at Atlético Madrid, could persuade him to move to north London.Arsenalare also in the market for a strikerand have identified Sporting Lisbon’s Viktor Gyökeres as a more realistic target than his Sweden teammate Alexander Isak. They have also heavily scouted Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig. The Real Sociedad midfielder Martín Zubimendi is expected to complete a £50.2m move, with Thomas Partey and Jorginho likely to depart when their contracts expire.It is unclear what budget Berta will have, but there are likely to be more departures as Mikel Arteta attempts to refresh his squad. The manager said on Monday he was looking forward to a “big summer” working with Berta. Extending the contracts of Bukayo Saka, William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães, whose deals expire in 2027, is also a priority.Meanwhile, there are fears Gabriel could be out for a significant spell after coming off against Fulham with a hamstring injury. The problem was exacerbated by the Brazilian playing on for more than a minute as Fulham had the ball, with the 27-year-old hobbling badly as he tried to stay on his feet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and Brentford’s Thomas Frank expected to be in the running if Spurs move in a different direction, Postecoglou finds himself under growing pressure as a defining point in the season approaches.Although the former Celtic manager’s job is likely to be on the line if his team lose their Europa League quarter-final to Eintracht Frankfurt this month, he said he was relaxed about the speculation over his position. Postecoglou denied having any issue with Mauricio Pochettino’s remarks about wanting to return to Spurs one day and dismissed suggestions that talk over his future was a distraction before Thursday’s trip to Chelsea in the Premier League.‘Can’t spend what we don’t have’: Levy defends approach before Spurs protestRead more“I know what my responsibilities are and I am sure if the club decide to go in a different direction there are some outstanding candidates for it,” he said. “And you know what, maybe someone will think: ‘Ange Postecoglou is not a bad coach, maybe we’ll take a punt on him.’“It doesn’t rock my world. It doesn’t consume me. I am here, I am passionate about what we’re doing. I was brought in to change the way the club plays, rejuvenate the squad and bring success. I am focused on that.”Postecoglou, who said Dejan Kulusevski and Kevin Danso would miss the game, gave short shrift to the idea that Pochettino’scomments about managing Spurs againwere disrespectful.“If he wants to come back one day I hope it happens for him,” Postecoglou said. “We all have dreams and aspirations. You’re suggesting he is trying to put pressure on me? I don’t feel disrespected. I think if you ask Mauricio that question directly, you’d get a pretty clear answer as to what his intent was. I’m more focused on trying to make sure we win tomorrow night.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For just over an hour later, following her consummate first triumph as an Australian player, Kasatkina was soaking up the cheers of the US crowd amid the strains of “I come from a land Down Under”, while beaming a smile of relief mixed with joy.From Russia with love: Daria Kasatkina switches tennis allegiance to AustraliaRead more“A new stage for me. So going on court today as an Aussie, this time was stressful, honestly,” said the 27-year-old, after her 6-1, 6-1 demolition of American Lauren Davis demonstrated just what a class act Australia has been gifted in the world No 12.“I just couldn’t keep my smile from breaking through,” she said after hearing the announcer say “...from Australia”.“So it’s really special moment for me to win a first match as an Australian player. I’m just really happy, and couldn’t believe one day something like that would happen to me.”Kasatkina’s switch of allegiance from her native Russia to Australia has been the talk of world tennis. But it has proved hugely stressful too for an athlete who, being openly gay and having been so outspoken against the invasion of Ukraine, felt she had no choice but to abandon Russia so “I could be myself”.“This week was a bit stressful, with all the changes and all the feedback,” she said. “When the tennis player steps on court, all the stress she’s living through explodes. That’s how it works. And I’m really happy how I handled that situation today, because it was not easy, honestly.”Yet Kasatkina made it look simple against the world No 211, demonstrating why she’s the best female player to represent Australia since Ash Barty retired.She swept into a 5-0 lead for the loss of just nine points on her preferred clay surface, and despite an early second-set blip when she got broken after serving three-straight double faults – a weakness that’s long bugged her game – she was in a different league to former Hobart winner Davis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Díaz came from an offside position to regain possession from a James Tarkowski attempted clearance to set up Jota for the winner. According to the rulebook, however, the Colombian had to be “clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent” to be adjudged offside. He did not.Diogo Jota breaks down Everton’s blue wall as Liverpool move closer to titleRead moreWhile grateful for the decision, theLiverpoolhead coach admitted the rule is counterproductive. Slot said: “Do I like the rule? No, I don’t like the rule. It’s a rule that is not helping the team that wants to attack. Normally we go to the halfway line, they [the opposition] kick the ball long to a player who is in an offside position, and my centre-backs feel like they have to head the ball away.“I always ask the linesman: ‘Was he offside?’ And they say: ‘No, he was not interfering.’ I hate that rule. But the execution of the rule was fortunately for us today, well done in that situation.”Moyes insisted Liverpool’s winner should have been disallowed. TheEvertonmanager said: “Liverpool were the better team, no complaints with that. We had some opportunities and we did a great job, we were resilient. But it is disappointing to lose to a goal that is clearly offside. It is quite an easy one to give.”Moyes conceded that Tarkowski was lucky to avoid an 11th-minute red card for a dangerous challenge on Alexis Mac Allister. The Everton captain was only booked. “I thought at the time it was a brilliant tackle,” the Everton manager said. “But since I have seen it again, we could have been lucky we didn’t get a red. It was a high one. I think it was the follow through that looked worse.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “I don’t want to comment about that situation because so many people have already commented on it.

But I wouldn’t have taken on this role if I didn’t think that in six months’ time we could win a World Cup in India, because I think we’ve got the playing group to do that. We’ve got a lot of hard work [to do] and a lot of honesty but I’m really confident that we can turn things around very quickly.“I’m under no illusions, coming into this role, it’s about winning. I think coaches are sometimes too scared to say we want to win. That’s our job. My job is to win games of cricket and it’s how we go and do that now.”One of Edwards’s first tasks will be appointing a new captain to replace Heather Knight,who left the role in Marchafter nine years, as the team starts to build towards the white-ball series against West Indies that begins next month. “I’m pretty clear on where I want to take the team and who I want to be involved,” Edwards said. “I think it’s important that we get that person announced sooner rather than later.”View image in fullscreenEdwards feels many of England’s young players ‘haven’t played enough cricket’.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAThe ECB is to start the process of recruiting a national selector, for the first time since the professionalisation of the women’s game, later this month, with Connor saying that “bringing in additional outside perspectives is important”. They plan to increase focus on county performances and all England players, injury permitting, will be available for the first seven rounds of the Metro Bank One-Day Cup which starts on 19 April.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you think about all the Australians and New Zealanders in Japan, we’re pretty excited about filling out that team.”Folau was a shining light for the Wallabies during the 2013 Lions series but wassacked by Rugby Australia in 2019after homophobic posts on social media. He switched allegiances to Tonga, making his debut in 2022, and is now in Japan. Folau recently expressed a desire to be considered for the Anzac match before Waugh shut down his potential return on the basis that he had played for Tonga. Folau has since reacted angrily, suggesting that he was indirectly encouraged to express an interest by Rugby Australia.After an autumn revival under Joe Schmidt when the Wallabies beat England and Wales, hopes are high they will be competitive against the Lions. Schmidt is set to leave his role after the series and while the former England head coach Stuart Lancaster has been linked with the job, Waugh strongly suggested Rugby Australia would be turning elsewhere, with Les Kiss the clear favourite.“We’ve been pretty disciplined about not talking about candidates,” said Waugh. “We want to make sure it’s the right cultural fit and the right capability. Our biggest focus is continuity and stability.“We don’t want to have a complete reset and be starting again, given where we were in 2023 and where we are now. We want progression rather than disrupting things by starting again. It’s not just about the head coach, it’s about the management team and Super Rugby.”Meanwhile, the Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney has broken his silence since facing down a grassroots rebellion last week, writing in a letter to the organisation’s members that “it has not been an easy time for me personally”.Last week Sweeney comfortably won a vote of no confidence at an RFU Special General Meeting – triggered after it was revealed he received a £358,000 bonus last year, taking his overall remuneration to £1.1m – before the union’s interim chairman Bill Beaumont promised “meaningful change”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The division sowed by those who brought forward the original SGM motion has played out aggressively in the media and it would be remiss of me not to admit that it has not been an easy time for me personally.“Ultimately this process will help us to re-engage our membership and push forward changes we have long wanted to implement and our members delivered a clear message that they wanted the leadership team we have here to get on with the job and make improvements.”Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsRugby unionAustralia sportAustralia rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Drone images showed a row of the burnt-out remains of the vehicles in a parking area of the dealership. Using his social media platform, X, Musk referred to it as “terrorism”.There are 13Tesladealerships in Italy, all managed by the parent company, the majority of them in Rome, but also in other cities including Florence and Milan.An interior ministry source said the circular was aimed at “raising awareness” of possible anti-Tesla protesters amid a global wave of vandalism in response to Musk’s political activities in the US.

Seven vehicles were set alight at a dealership in Ottersberg, Germany, on Saturday, and two Tesla stores in Sweden, one in the capital, Stockholm, and the other in the coastal city of Malmö, were vandalised with orange paint on Monday.Musk has nurtured close relations with European far-right party leaders including the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who in an interview in early January described him as “a brilliant man”.Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right League, a member of Meloni’s ruling coalition, expressed solidarity with Musk after the Rome incident.“Too much unjustified hatred against the Tesla car company,” Salvini wrote on X. “The season of hate and conflict must come to an end as soon as possible.

TheNintendo Switch2 will launch on 5 June at a retail price of £395.99 for the basic package and £429.99 bundled with Mario Kart World.As expected, the screen is now larger, measuring 7.9 inches and offers double the pixels of the previous display, in 1080p resolution. It also supports up to 120 frames per second for smooth animation, as well as high dynamic range lighting for better colour contrast, while the console remains the same thickness as its predecessor. The dock allows connection to a TV with up to 4K resolution supported.The redesigned Joy-Con 2 controllers now connect to the console magnetically. The SL and SR buttons are larger to make it more comfortable to use the Joy-Cons as indepedent controllers. Each one can also be used as a mouse, with a rollerball for precise movement. This feature was illustrated with a wheelchair basketball game, Drag X Drive, in which the two Joy-Cons are used to push and steer the wheels.The announcement live stream began with a trailer for launch title Mario Kart World, a new entry in the karting series featuring stunningly detailed circuits and an open world map. Races take place in different regions around the planet, while players are free to go off-road while racing.View image in fullscreenNintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoAlso announced was Legend of Zelda Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, a prequel to Tears of the Kingdom coming this winter. Aerial racer Kirby Air Riders and a new Donkey Kong adventure, Donkey Kong Bananza, were also revealed, the latter arriving on 17 July.Several third-party titles were introduced throughout the hour-long stream. These included a new title from Dark Souls creator, From Software – The DuskBloods – a dark adventure filled with spectral warriors and ferocious dinosaurs; it’s out in 2026. Expected for launch or shortly after are Elden Ring Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Street Fighter 6 and Hitman World of Assassination. Hitman developer Io Interactive also revealed the development of a new James Bond game for the console.Other technical details were also discussed. Switch 2’s built-in speakers have been improved, with 3D audio supported. The new stand offers more sturdy support with a variety of viewing angles. Nintendo’s online network,NintendoSwitch Online, will offer a range of new downloadable retro games from GameCube and other systems, including Legend of Zelda Wind Waker and Soulcalibur II. A reproduction GameCube controller will be available to purchase alongside the Switch 2 launch.Like its predecessor, Switch 2 is a hybrid system, allowing users to play games on its built-in screen or on a TV, and users will be able to alternate between the two. The machine also offers full backwards compatibility with most original Switch games. Switch 2 updated games will also offer upgraded visuals. Launching soon after the console, the party game Super Mario Jamboree: Nintendo Switch 2 edition offers mouse controls, audio recognition, camera support and better rumble effects. Legend of Zelda Breath of The Wild: Nintendo Switch 2 edition features higher resolution visuals and new gameplay features, including an in-game smartphone-style map app. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Pokémon Legends and Kirby and the Forgotten Land will also get Switch 2 editions.

The right Joy-Con has a new C button, which gives access to GameChat and an in-game communication feature which lets users chat to friends while playing. The mic in the console recognises your voice, filtering out ambient sounds for clear comms. Players can share their game screens with others in the chat even if everyone is playing different games. A Nintendo Switch 2 camera, available from launch, connects to the console allowing video chat while playing. A new GameShare feature will allow users to share a single game with up to three other players who can take part using their own Switch 2 machines.The original Switch was launched in March 2017 and went on to become the company’s most successful home console, selling more than 150m units including its later Switch Lite and Switch OLED editions. While Switch 2 remains technically behind the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, Nintendo has long competed on innovation and game quality rather than specifications. With a broader games lineup than the original machine, more advanced visuals and a more intuitive design for its Joy-Con controllers, this was a strong introduction.“You’ll have to wait just a little bit longer for launch,” said Switch 2 design director Takuhiro Dohta at the close of the live stream. For avid Nintendo fans that will feel like an eternity.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendoNintendo SwitchGames consolesnewsShareReuse this content"

Even Amazon hasthrown in a last-minute bidto buy the popular social media app, according to multiple reports.TikTok’s parent, the Beijing-based ByteDance, has until 5 April to sell the app’s US unit or be banned in the country, under an executive order signed by the US president.The potential transaction, which is reportedly a “final proposal”, will involve new investors such as Blackstone joining existing non-Chinese shareholders in ByteDance in providing fresh capital to bid for the business, Reuters reported.The US vice-president, JD Vance, the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday to discuss the issue, Reuters reported.In the closely watched sale of TikTok, the White House is playing the role of an investment bank, with Vance running the auction.ByteDance’s existing non-Chinese shareholders are led by the US trading firm Susquehanna International Group and the private equity firm General Atlantic.On Sunday, Trump said a deal with ByteDance to sell the short-video app used by 170 million Americans would be struck before Saturday’s deadline. “We have a lot of potential buyers,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “There’s tremendous interest in TikTok.” He added: “I’d like to see TikTok remain alive.”Trump is preparing to announce global tariffs on what he has called“liberation day” on Wednesday. Last week, he said he would bewilling to reduce tariffs on Chinato get a TikTok deal done.Trump set the deadline in January for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a US ban on national security grounds, due to have taken effect that month under a 2024 law.The US venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is also in discussions to invest in TikTok as part of the deal, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. While Amazon has reportedly added its name to the potential list of buyers, via an offer letter it sent to Vance and Lutnick, the New York Times reports that people involved in the negotiations do not seem to be taking the bid seriously.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The friend management tool means they can block anyone on their child’s friends list, preventing their child from exchanging direct messages with that account, and report people they believe are violating Roblox policies.They can also review and change the content maturity level for their child’s account, determining which games their child can access, and obtain detailed screen-time insights.Under the Online Safety Act, which came into force this year, tech companies must tackle harmful content on their platforms or face fines of up to £18m or 10% of global revenue.There have beenreports of bullying and groomingon Roblox and fears that children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content on the site, which is the most popular platform in the UK among gamers aged eight to 12.Roblox’s chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman, said safety was at the company’s core and its mission was to be “the safest and most civil online platform in the world”.The US-based company is one of the world’s largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024, the site averaged more than 80 million players a day, and roughly 40% of those were under 13.Roblox introduced 40 safety updates last year, including preventing users under 13 from sending direct messages. Roblox has also updated its voice safety technology, which uses a machine-learning model to moderate chat between players more accurately than human moderators.Andy Burrows, the chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation, said he welcomed the safety improvements but that “Roblox still needs to get to grips with substantial problems with harmful and age-inappropriate content”.He added: “Extensive research has shown Roblox is awash with age-inappropriate games and communities, including depression rooms that can compound misery and offer no support to vulnerable children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s another sign thatElon Musk’s once high-flying electric car company is struggling to attract buyers.The drop is probably due to a combination of factors, including its ageing lineup, competition from rivals and a backlash from Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics. It also is a warning that the company’s first-quarter earnings report later this month could disappoint investors.Tesla reported deliveries of 336,681 vehicles globally in the January-March quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet expected much higher deliveries of 408,000. The figure was down from sales of 387,000 in the same period a year ago. The decline came despite deep discounts, zero financing and other incentives.Tesla’s stock has plunged by roughly half since hitting a mid-December record as expectations of a lighter regulatory touch and big profits withDonald Trumpas president were replaced by fear that the boycott of Musk’s cars and other problems could hit the company hard. Teslas around the countrywere vandalizedin protest of Musk after he dismantled entire federal agencies in his role as the head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”.Musk also made a gesture at a rally that his estranged daughter called “definitely a Nazi salute”.How Tesla became a battleground for political protestRead moreDespiteDonald Trump’s attempts toshore up company saleswith a Tesla presentation in front of the White House and Musk’s assurances to employees that the company has a “bright and exciting” future, the drop in sales was striking.Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The scale is worse than many had expected.“There’s no way to sugarcoat it, Tesla’s first-quarter delivery numbers are a disappointment, though many investors were already preparing for a soft number,” Britzman said.Analysts are still not sure exactly how much the fall in sales is due to the protests or other factors. Electric car sales have been sluggish in general, and Tesla in particular is suffering as car buyers hold off from buying its bestselling Model Y because of plans for an updated version later this year. Even before Musk took up his role in government alongside Trump, Tesla had struggled with meeting its delivery targets. Earnings calls and delivery reportsfailed to match analysts’ expectationsthroughout 2024.“Headlines will point to branding issues, and it’d be naive to assume that’s not a factor here, but it misses the key point,” Britzman said. “Deliveries have been significantly impacted by downtime at factories as Tesla launched the long-awaited refreshed version of the Model Y, its bestselling car.”The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle maker has also lost market share to rivals in recent months as their offerings improve, including those of BYD.

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt called the Politico story “garbage” in a post on X. Musk was granted a “special government employee” status for 130 days, which would end in late May, though previous reports indicated White House insiders expected Trump to attempt to extend Musk’s position beyond that time limit.The “brand is under pressure”, Britzman said. “It’s rare to see sentiment toward a company so closely tied to a polarising White House, and until Musk pulls his focus back to Tesla, shares will remain volatile.”Explore more on these topicsTeslaQuarterly resultsElon MuskElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

German and British citizens have alsoencountered problems at US airports, according to reports.Here’s what you need to know and what you can do if you are heading to the US.Can immigration search my phone when I enter the US?The US government has the power to search your devices on entry into the US, and saying you do not consent to the search likely won’t change the situation,the American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU) says.If you don’t hand over your device password, and are visiting on a visa and are not a citizen or permanent US resident, you risk being denied entry. Even if you are allowed entry, they may keep your device for months if you refuse to unlock it for them.What can they look at on my device?Immigration officers can do a basic on-the-spot search of devices, the ACLU says. They can download the full contents of your device, including data – meaning they effectively get access to everything.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterOfficials can keep the device for longer – from days to months – if there are “extenuating circumstances”.What should I do to prepare before going to the US?Take steps to protect your devices, or find alternatives.If you’re travelling for work, consider taking a laptop that has no confidential information, is shut down on entry and is not automatically connected to any cloud services or email accounts that may store confidential information.For mobile phones, if you have the means, consider setting up a second device (sometimes referred to as a burner phone) to travel with.

It was the Nintendo livestream we’ve been waiting for:a deep dive into the new consoleafter so much speculation. Sure, the Switch 2 is the company’s first real hardware sequel – an updated and spruced-up version of its predecessor rather than a radical new piece of kit. But the updates are the intriguing part.Naturally, we’re getting a larger (7.9-inch, to be precise) screen that displays in full HD at 1080p; but we’re also getting re-thought Joy-Con controllers that now click to the console via strong magnets rather than those fiddly sliders we all put on the wrong way. The buttons are larger, too, so adults will be able to play Mario Kart with some semblance of skill. But the main new feature for the controllers is a new rollerball that enables each one to operate as a mouse. This will allow for new point-and-click features and some interesting control options. I like that they showed this off with a wheelchair basketball game, where you slide the controllers a long a surface to mimic pushing the wheels.View image in fullscreenThe Nintendo Switch 2.The new Mario Kart game, Mario Kart World, looks rather nice. Perhaps taking inspiration from the likes of Forza Horizon and Test Drive Unlimited, it offers an open world to drive around, and, as well as circuit races, there will be endurance competitions where you drive from one side of the map to the other. According to the trailer shown during the livestream, 24 drivers can take part in each race, the most in the history of the series. There’s even a free-roam mode that lets you explore wherever you like, and take scenic drives with friends.“With friends” was definitely the theme of the stream. A new C button on the Joy-Con opens up the GameChat facility, which lets you start a group discussion with friends and family who also own Switch 2 consoles; it even has a video chat option if you also buy the Switch 2 camera. Like a sort of candy-coloured version of Zoom, your pals appear along the bottom of the screen as you play a game and you can all chat, even if you’re playing different things. Several of the trailers shown during the presentation suggested that video footage of your friends would even be incorporated into the game itself. This is whereNintendoalways does best: finding new ways for you to embarrass yourself and/or confuse and delight elderly relatives.View image in fullscreenDonkey Kong: Bananza on the Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoWas this a knockout victory for Nintendo? Well, there were alotof game announcements, but we didn’t get a big new 3D Mario adventure – although those do sometimes come a little while after launch. Also, fans are already tutting about game prices. While the machine is launching at an acceptable £395.99 (or £429.99 bundled with Mario Kart World), it looks like Mario Kart World will retail for £75. It’s a lot, but then Mario Kart 8 lasted for the entire lifespan of the Switch and most owners got hundreds of hours of entertainment out of it.The pre-order process, which opens on 8 April, is going to be interesting. Scalpers turned the launches of the Xbox Series X and PS5 into an ugly and expensive drama, with Sony’s machineturning up for sale at $2,000at one point thanks to limited availability.Nintendo is good at joy, and this looks like a truly lovely machine. But in an economic climate far from joyful, fans (and their parents) will be watching pre-order and sales figures very closely over the next few long weeks.What to playView image in fullscreenTough cerebral challenges … Rosewater.Photograph: Grundislav GamesI’ve been a sucker for western adventure games ever since I played Accolade’s classic Law of the West for the Commodore 64, so it’s lovely to see a newcomer in town.Rosewateris a steam punk-infused point-and-click puzzler following would-be journalist Harley Leger, who arrives in the titular frontier town for a job at the local newspaper but instead gets embroiled in a treasure hunt.Created by GrundislavGames, it’s a spiritual successor to the studio’s 2018 title Lamplight City, but you can come to this one fresh. It’s filled with interesting characters and tough cerebral challenges, and the crisp pixel art is a rootin’, tootin’ treat.

A lot of people have forgotten it did actually get a Wii-U release, though, and it was … OK? An interesting read, though.The new industry site Games Businesshas an interviewwith Alain Tascan, the head ofNetflix games. He sees Wii-style family TV games as the future for the platform: “For party games, I believe we can give instant fun, using the phone as a very innovative controller. On every phone you have a gyroscope, you have a microphone, you have a speaker, you have a touchscreen … if you give that to creative people, what do they do? Whether you’re alone, or with two people, or 20 people, why not? Can we do something really engaging?” Um, yes you can – as Sony showed several years ago with its PlayLink technology for PlayStation 4. Sadly, that initiative was undersupported, despite having some brilliant games. Maybe Netflix will hang in there a little longer.As a fan of weird mid-1990s horror games, I was very pleased to see Christian Donlanwriting for Eurogamerabout Harlan Ellison’s twisted terror adventure,IHave No Mouth and I Must Scream.

Does it exist?”My equally concise answer is: It’s complicated. It depends on how we interpret the term.My copy of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines counterculture as: “A way of life opposed to that usually considered normal.” That could almost embrace the entire independent game development community, but we can get more specific.Perhaps the hyper-challenging games of Bennett Foddy are countercultural because they are deliberately not intuitive to control. Or perhaps theFlatgame scene, in which developers create deliberately simple games with limited interactivity, is countercultural because it challenges the ideas that video games need cutting-edge visuals and a strong challenge component.MaybeRobert Yang’s gamessuch as The Tearoom and Hurt Me Plenty are counter-cultural because they challenge the heteronormative orthodoxy of the mainstream industry. As ever with this subject, I defer to the developer and writer Anna Anthropy, whose brilliant bookRise of the Videogame Zinestersmakes a compelling and detailed case for the existence of a global video game counterculture, existing happily for years on the periphery.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterNintendoNintendo SwitchGames consolesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We go from light to dark and back again, from room to room, and constant shifts in tempo and register, swerving from one medium to another. Along the way, we keep meeting the artist. Atkins drawn in coloured pencil, pensive in profile. Atkins as half-man, half-spider, splayed across the paper. Here’s his naked foot, drawn monstrously huge, and a hand clenching. He’s the author of his own descriptive wall texts, a collector of lists and, most pungently of all, the digitally tweaked persona who appears and reappears in the various guises of his CGI-avatar. One of which, early on in the exhibition, is swallowed by a sinkhole, along with his Ikea-filled apartment, but not before we have discovered rather too much about the state of his mind and the grim things people get up to in the privacy of their homes.‘My brain reaches for morbidity’: inside the unsettling world (and 700 Post-it notes) of artist Ed AtkinsRead moreThere’s so muchstuffin Atkins’s art, so much weirdness and generosity, so much bleakness and humour. A curtain opens on an empty stage and things begin to fall from above. A bed, stepladders, books, cardboard boxes, an anchor on its chain, bricks, several large tuna, bones, scatter cushions, skulls. Things pile up, they bounce, they get crushed; other things twirl in freefall, freeze mid-air or swipe into digital oblivion. Even gravity has glitches. But the cartoon rain, the flashes of lightning and the fall of pixelated snow keep the action moving. As I watch, I hear a spooky voice say: “My proper name is death.”Where did that come from? I never did find out, in the hours and hours I spent here, among all the sound leakage, drifting from room to room. A lot gets subsumed along the way through Atkins’ exhibition. The pleading, reproachful eyes of a borzoi sighthound; the plaintive unaccompanied renditions of Randy Newman songs, and all that kerfuffling and crashing, the film about the sandwiches, and the quiet, nearly blank fields of the embroideries, with their tiny sewn words. And what of the young lad who runs endless circuits through a bucolic landscape, as though he’s trapped in an animated medieval manuscript? And now the 468 repetitions of the same note that Atkins plays on an upright piano, in his performance of Swiss composer Jürg Frey’s 2001 composition Klavierstück 2. It all adds up, but to what?Pungent … Ed Atkins at Tate BritainEncumbered by a Lycra motion-capture suit and gloves, and with an iPhone braced to his head to record and track his face and hands, Atkins sat at the piano to perform Frey’s spare, exacting composition. The version of Atkins on the screen, performing, is a largely faithful, nearly seemless digital representation of the artist. Homing in on his face, on fingers playing and lingering above the keyboard, on feet at the pedal, on his expression and his concentration, we see none of the gubbins that were used to record him. We hear his breaths and snufflings and quiet groans along with the music, and think we perceive the turbulence of the player’s emotions, and catch him counting time, although the being at the piano is a digital model, a not-quite-real apparition, in whose expression I imagine I see feeling. As the end credits scroll, we read that Atkins finished making this video “in great sadness”. His expression, in the small photograph that slides down the screen beneath the text seems to confirm this. But where and to whom or to what does that sadness belong, and is my own sadness, as a response to the music, or at least to the video, appropriate?View image in fullscreenIt all adds up … Pianowork 2 by Ed Atkins.Photograph: Ed Atkins/Cabinet Gallery, London; dépendance, Brussels; Galerie Isabella Bortolozzi, Berlin and Gladstone Gallery, New YorkHere he is again, talking to his mother on the phone. Their conversation is real enough, intimate and warm, though at odds with the slightly soiled, avuncular gameshow host appearance of the Ed Atkins projected before us (note the grubby spectacles, and the meaty hand that raises a glass that isn’t there to his lips). The scene is projected on to the exterior back wall of a cavernous and empty plywood box that fills most of the gallery. This guy’s an off-the-shelf digital stand-in for Atkins. Only his voice seems real. Another of the models for this scene, and for the entirely digital set (including the cigarette smouldering in an ashtray), is the famous last television interview with screenwriter and playwright Dennis Potter, recorded in 1994,two months before Potter’s death.If we get snagged up on all the references and the details – the wall texts, the embroideries, the posters and the postcards, the live TV giving us the news on Sky (luckily it is streaming on mute), we’ll never get to the end of it. You could spend days in here, lingering, moving on, backtracking, getting cloistered among the racks of opera-house costumes. I keep trying to find the thread, then losing it again. Which is all part of the pleasure of Atkins’ work. He also has a great capacity to surprise, to enmesh us and keep us rooted, even on a tiny scrap of silent film, a sequence from Dimitri Kirsanoff’s 1926 Ménilmontant, that Atkins has had colourised and added Foley sound to, so that we can finally hear the old man in the film chewing on his bit of bread, and the sausage he is paring with his knife, wordlessly passing scraps to the young, starving mother who has found herself beside him on the park bench. What a tender, almost real moment this is. For all its artifice, it is like touching a wound.View image in fullscreenLight to dark and back again … Children by Ed Atkins, 2020-ongoing.Photograph: Ed Atkins/Cabinet Gallery, London.Coming towards the end of the exhibition, Atkins’ most recent work, made with writer Steven Zultanski, jettisons the use of digital beings entirely. The video Nurses Come and Go, But None for Me is over two hours long. ActorsToby Jonesand Saskia Reeves play couple Peter and Claire. Claire ushers an audience of young people (these too may be actors) into a large, comfortable room where Peter reads Sick Notes, a diary kept by Atkins’s father, Philip, during the six months between his diagnosis with kidney cancer and his death in 2009. Enormously affecting, spirited, candid, a sometimes funny and frequently harrowing account of physical deterioration, Philip Atkins’ diary is leavened by his mental fortitude and stoicism. As we listen and watch, the camera drifts and alights too. Claire – whom I take as a surrogate for Atkins’ mother – sits apart, smoking in the corner. There’s Peter’s clumpy shoes, and his troubled expression as he turns the loose-leaf pages. The diary is upsetting for some members of the on-screen audience, and all the more affecting for being read aloud by Jones. Towards the end, following the text, his measured tones break into expletives and yelps and broken words. It is as if we have come to the limit of language.Note perfect: Ed Atkins’s daily Post-it drawings – in picturesRead moreJones the actor, playing Peter, also fully inhabits the role of Philip. After the reading is finished Peter and Claire play a game devised by Ed Atkins’ young daughter Hollis Pinky. Peter has now adopted a further persona, and lies on the floor, and Claire, taking the role Ed Atkins used to play in this once-private game, first pretends to be an ambulance, then some sort of doctor, who attempts miracle, fantasy cures for imaginary ills, games of coping and resuscitation, of childhood fears being allayed through play. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing. “I want everything I make to corpse,” writes the artist. Where is the real Ed Atkins? Where is the real anybody? We’re all corpsing all the time, for all the time we have.At Tate Britain, London, until 25 AugustExplore more on these topicsVideo artArtArtificial intelligence (AI)Toby JonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Well, we shall see. Yet even if one puts the noise and nastiness that accompany a Donald Trump announcement to one side – in this case tonight’s pronouncement that there will be an executive order announcing “reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world”, a 10% tariff on the UK and 20% on the EU – the significance of the theatre is hard to miss. Whether they presage the US’s liberation, or instead the disintegration of theglobal trading order, Trump’s tariffs add up to an attempt to transform a badly broken economic model. And that is something that affects us all.Trump’s announcement was awash with insult and rambling nonsense. The rest of the world had looted, raped and pillaged, had scavenged and ransacked America – shocking claims if they had come from any other US president, yet water off a duck’s back today. But the hard core was there all the same: tariffs on the whole of the rest of the world. The shutters were up.Thisthreatened trade warwill appear to supporters – of whom there were rather fewer this week in some important USelectoral contests– exactly like the Maga big bazooka he promised in his inaugural speech in January. “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,” he said back then. The new tariffs turn those words into realities.Even to Trump’s opponents, though, the tariffs should be seen as the most important piece of evidence so far that he has American workers on his agenda. Where Joe Biden tried major tax, borrow and spend programmes to combat post-Covid economic precarity, Trump is deploying tariffs, ostensibly to the same purpose. There has been speculation that this will be merely tactical, to be quickly lifted or adjusted. Right now, that looks a long way off. For Trump, tariffs are not so much a negotiating tactic as a policy, a new revenue stream and a “made in the USA” commitment.Before the announcement, markets and foreign governmentswere jittery. But the uncertainties have not disappeared. Listening to Keir Starmer continue to advocate a “calm pragmatic approach” does not disguise the fact that he knows, as we do, that Trump’s approach is the exact reverse. We are in a trade war now, whether we like it or not, and Trump, as the leader of the strongest economy in the world, likes it a lot because he thinks the US will win.Things may not look so benign, however, when the rubber hits the road. It is inevitable that enthusiasm will be dulled – either among the public or in markets – when the inevitable price hikes are passed on to consumers, when inflation and the cost of mortgages begin to rise, when real wages remain flat, or when investment stalls and theUS economystarts to experience a Trump slump.All this, though, is speculation about the future, and a lot of it is for the fairly long-term future at that. It takes time for the real economic effects to be felt from a tariff wall of the kind Trump is planning. It is true that the tariffs have to be charged immediately, and that retaliatory tariffs are likely to kick in fast too. Nevertheless it will be months, if not years, before many US companies or sectors have the confidence and the cash to invest in the way “fortress America” supporters hope. Longer still, maybe, before US car workers or farmers feel truly confident about paying down their debts and spending again.It makes perfect sense, therefore, to emphasise the uncertainties that Trump has just unleashed. All the more so because of the man himself, as well as the policy. It is hard not to feel, yet again, that part of what drove Trump’s decision was the sheer thrill he gets from his power. He glories in the way the world hangs on his every move, as the world must when its largest economy is controlled by a grudge-bearing manchild with guns who governs by decree.Yet step back a little and it is also apparent that Trump is acting more logically than that. He is acting, albeit in a wilful and perverse manner, because the international economic model has been broken. He is responding to something real, namely a global recession that stems most immediately from the combined impact of the banking crisis of 2008-9 and the Covid pandemic of 2020. This was not something fake or imagined. Nor was it – or is it still – something felt in the US alone, but elsewhere, certainly including Europe and Britain.The common root of today’s economic burden was the overload of debt and credit that caused the banking crash of 2008. That crash was principally confronted by spending massive amounts of public money on quantitative easing. But, just as before the crash, this was money based on credit more than on production or goods. This triggered attempts to square the circle – tax cuts in the US, austerity in Britain, pension cuts in France – which in turn provoked so-called populist responses, such as Trump’s election win in 2016, Brexit in the UK, thegilets jaunesin France. But before any of these national responses could resolve, Covid arrived, causing recessions all round, stock-market collapses and a rise in inflation.Faced with these continuing problems, Trump’s response takes the form of tariffs. It is very uncertain whether they will work, even for the US itself. They may also trigger recessions, and the resultant tax and spend policy dilemmas elsewhere, in places such as the EU, Britain, Canada and Japan. In addition, they are likely to widen the gulf between the US and its postwar allies. While Trump talks of liberation, Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, talks of “independence from the USA”.Trump and Musk have ushered in a terrible era of cataclysm capitalism. But I have a plan to counter it | Julia SteinbergerRead moreIn his tariffs, Trump is clutching at straws. He may divert the US’s tariff income into orthodox neoliberal tax cuts for corporations and the rich, like him. But his approach can also be seen as an illustration of the limited strategic options that today’s democratic political leaders have at their command when faced with economic recession or, worse, depression.In arecent articlein the London Review of Books, Perry Anderson has drawn an illuminating historical contrast with the post-depression 1930s. In the early 1930s, he writes, governments also followed economic orthodoxy with disastrous consequences. Back then, their failure forced the public works programmes of the New Deal (and of the Nazis) and then, after emerging from the abyss of war, the postwar establishment of Keynesianism. John Maynard Keynes himself, it is worth noting, was no dogmatic free-trader and was sometimes an advocate of tariffs.In the 2020s, governments face a comparable dilemma. They, too, have been constrained by an economic orthodoxy that is increasingly difficult to sustain. They, too, have occasionally been forced into interventionist measures such as the Covid furlough scheme.But beyond that? Trump is no New Dealer; he is the New Deal’s sworn enemy. At least he sees the need to do things differently. But his tariffs are the opposite to the new paradigm of political economy that the democratic capitalist world so obviously and urgently craves.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A century later, when noxious fog choked the capital, parliament passed the firstClean Air Act, limiting coal fire emissions.When a dangerous toxin assails the senses, polluting public space to the detriment of all that use it, the case for legislation is self-evident. The argument is more complex when the poison has no chemical properties; when it exists in a virtual realm. This is the conceptual challenge for regulation of digital content. It is made all the more complex by conflation with arguments about free speech and censorship.The UK has a law that grapples with these questions. The 2023Online Safety Actmakes social media companies, websites and search engines responsible for harmful content published via their services. Offending material named in the statute is uncontroversially horrible – violent pornography, incitement to violence and terrorism. Such things are commonly proscribed even in very liberal jurisdictions on the basis that, with some types of communication, the state’s duty of public protection is paramount. No one argues that child abuse images, for example, are a legitimate expression of free speech.Yet implementation of the Online Safety Act is now in question because Donald Trump’s government has identified it as a symptom of wider European infringement of free expression. As theGuardian revealedthis week, US state department officials expressed their concern in a meeting with Ofcom, the regulator responsible for enforcing new digital regulations.That intervention should be seen in the context of an aggressive trade policy that cannot tolerate any foreign restriction on the extension of American economic interests overseas. Thatexplicitly includesregulation that “incentivises US companies to develop or use products and technology in ways that undermine free speech or foster censorship”.The invocation of liberal principle here is cynical and ideological. TheTrump administrationdefines freedom of speech as the right to propagandise for the president. Any effort to correct wilful misinformation or conduct public discourse on a foundation of verifiable fact is liable to be denounced as censorship.Mr Trump’s power is bolstered by alliance withtech industry oligarchs. The unwritten deal is that the president’s cause is boosted on social media and the platforms’ commercial interests are driven by the president. That is why US trade policy is being deployed against European regulators that have tried to make the internet – or the part of it over which they have legal jurisdiction – less lawless.Yielding to that pressure would cede control of the digital information space to people who actively subvert it for the cause of American ultranationalism. It would mean accepting that a vital part of the digital infrastructure for a free society operates according to rules set by companies that are poisoning the wells of public discourse.There is a legitimate debate to be had about the boundary between safety online and censorship. The two issues are entangled because regulation of information space involves a distinction between permitted and intolerable content. But no European democracy can conduct that debate on terms dictated by a US administration that sees all digital space as its sovereign domain, and that holds tenets of liberal democracy in contempt.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On Tuesday, voters inFloridaandWisconsinsignaled dissatisfaction withElon Musk, the GOP and the president. On the surface, the results spelled political equipoise. No seats changed hands.A closer look, however, reveals possible headaches forDonald Trumpand his party.In a special election in Florida’s sixth congressional district to fill the vacancy left by Mike Waltz, Trump’s beleaguered national security adviser, voters elected Randy Fine, a Republican state senator, as Waltz’s replacement. Last November, Trump won the district by a whopping 30 points. By contrast, Fine’s margin wasabout 14 points.Beyond that, voter turnout was markedly lower than a half-year ago. Talk about underperforming.After months of surrender, the Democrats have finally stood up to Trump – thank you, Cory Booker | Emma BrockesRead moreThen again, the closeness of the contest came as no surprise to the White House. A poll conducted by Tony Fabrizio, a pollster to the president, actually showed Fine down by four points less than two weeks before the election. Those figures gave Trump and Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, plenty to worry about.Fabrizio’s survey also triggered Trump’s decision to pull the nomination of Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the UN. Although she represented a so-called safe GOP district in upstate New York – “Mississippi with icicles”, in the words of one observer – the president was not prepared to take unnecessary chances.He made the right call, politically speaking. Turns out, Florida’s sixth congressional district was not the only storm cloud in the Sunshine state.The results out of Florida are a warning that Mike Johnson’s tenure is in jeopardy come January 2027The election to fill the seat vacated by Matt Gaetz, Trump’s first pick for attorney general, in the first congressional district experienced an even larger drop in GOP support. Back in November, Trump garnered a 37-point margin. On Tuesday, Republican Jimmy Patronis carried the district by about13 points, a 24-point decline.In hindsight, Trump was right to end Stefanik’s dreams. The GOP dropoffs in Florida’s first and sixth congressional districts signaled that the battle to replace her would have been a nailbiter.Every vote counts, the saying goes. Quite possibly doubly so in the House. Mike Johnson maintains control by the thinnest of margins. On a good day, theRepublicanswill now hold 220 seats in the 435-member chamber. The results out of Florida are a warning that his tenure is in jeopardy come January 2027.Earlier on Tuesday, the House rejected an attempt to thwart an effort to enable new parents to vote remotely. Nine Republicans joined the Democrats to hand the speaker a humiliating loss. Johnson labeled the result “disappointing”. Theheadline at Axios blared: “Mike Johnson scraps his whole week after brutal defeat”. Apparently, being the party of “traditional family values” doesn’t necessarily translate into support for newborn babies and their moms.The results of the Tuesday’s House races also bear strong similarities to the special elections of 2017 and 2018.Back then, Democrats ran about 15 points ahead of Hillary Clinton’s performance on election day 2016.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I have a plan to counter it | Julia SteinbergerRead moreIn the run-up to the election, Musk handed out$1m checks to voters. In the face of a legal challenge, Musk prevailed, claiming that efforts to restrain his expenditures constituted a violation of his rights under the first amendment.Just days before the election, Musk also appeared onstagewearing a giant yellow cheese hat. His nod to Wisconsin’s dairy industry and the state’s beloved Green Bay Packers amused the crowd and the denizens of X, the Musk-owned social media platform. Actual voters, however, not as much.Whether Musk steps back from the spotlight or whether Trump reels him in remains to be seen.

You canparade outside a Tesla showroom. You can hold up dumblittle signsduring Trump’s address to Congress inscribed with slogans such as “This is not normal” and “Musk steals”. You can, as Democrats appear to have been doing since the election, play dead.Alternatively, you can go for the ostentatious, performative gesture. On Monday evening, Cory Booker, the Democratic senator for New Jersey who carries himself like someone who’d have been happier in an era when men wore capes, startedspeaking on the floor of the Senateand carried on for 25 hours and five minutes, breaking the chamber’s record by almost 50 minutes and delivering – finally – a solid, usable symbol of rebellion.This wasn’t a filibuster per se; no legislation was being passed. Booker decided to speak for “as long as I am physically able”, he said, in general protest against Trump and in what he described as a “moral moment” – a claim that, when he ended his speech on Tuesday evening, hoarse of voice and teary-eyed, didn’t seem to me an exaggeration.The power of the filibuster is vested in the iron-man stamina required to perform it: in Booker’s case, standing for longer than a direct flight between Washington DC and Sydney, without food, rest or toilet breaks. It puts him in a category of protest that floats somewhere between a sit-in and a hunger strike, a measure of commitment that demands a kind of default respect, as does the technical challenge of filling the airtime. A few hours into his speech, Booker asked a Senate page to remove his chair and with it the temptation to sit down. Democratic senators were permitted to ask him questions or make short remarks to give him brief respite from speaking. Mostly, however, it was on Booker to keep talking and talking, which he did – it should be noted, quite easily – by enumerating all the terrible things Trump has done in his first three months in office.View image in fullscreenA supporter outside the US Capitol holds up a sign in support of Cory Booker after his speech.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty ImagesThere was something immensely satisfying – cathartic, even – in watching Booker protest against Trump via a form of dissent that, while radical and pushed to its absolute limit, still fell within congressional norms. Part of the fallout from Trump and his cohorts’ behaviour has been the shocking realisation that you can ditch standards and protocols, ignore judges and bin entire social and scientific programmes created by Congress, and, at least in the immediate term, nothing will happen. (In the medium to long term, of course,people will die.)It could be argued that Trump’s extraordinary, norm-busting behaviour requires protest that meets it in the extra-political realm. Democrats aren’t going to storm the Capitol, but I have friends who have talked about withholding their federal taxes this tax season. Teslas aren’t only being boycotted butset on fire. Beyond the US, Europe is targeting Republican states in particular withreciprocal tariffs– Alabama beef and soybeans fromLouisiana– to inflict personal economic pain on Trump and his supporters.Still, it is the direct political victories that matter the most. In a ringing blow to Trump this week, theelection of judge Susan Crawfordover her Musk-backed rival for the Wisconsin supreme court – in a race that garnered a huge turnout from voters – highlights the power of boring, process-observant political pushback over more flamboyant gestures. This race was critical in determining the state’s congressional lines, gerrymandered by the Republican-controlled state Senate to favour Republican outcomes. But it also sent a more broadly cheering message: that the involvement of Elon Musk – who, along with affiliated groups, ploughedmore than $20minto trying to get Brad Schimel elected – ended up motivating the Democratic vote more emphatically than the Republican.Meanwhile, Booker kept talking. It was telling that, during and after his marathon speech, neither Musk nor Trump acknowledged him on their various social media platforms, although a White House spokesman did derisively refer to Booker’s performance as a “Spartacus” moment. Over the course of the 25 hours, people drifted in and out to watch his feat of endurance, while his staff kept his face wipes replenished and placed folders of material before him to read from. To date, the art of the political spectacle has been almost exclusively Trump’s for the taking. It was a relief, finally, to see a Democrat seize and hang on to the mic.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Cruel immigration policies won’t fix the crisisKarie FugettI desperately want to find a solution to the fentanyl crisis. Unfortunately, all Trump’s talk about fixing it is smoke and mirrorsWed 2 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareMy husband died of a fentanyl overdose.Leading up to his death, Cleve had been prescribed all sorts of pain medications. He was a war-wounded Marine who had been sent to Iraq twice. During his second deployment, an improvised explosive device detonated next to the Humvee he was driving. The military shipped him back to the States with TBI, PTSD and a leg so severely maimed it would eventually be amputated just below the knee. For the next four years, Cleve took opioids every day, multiple times a day.Inevitably, he became dependent on them. When he would notice signs of addiction to whatever he was prescribed at the moment, his doctors would switch him to something new – Dilaudid to Percocet to methadone to Oxycontin, and finally, fentanyl. He was 25 years old when his body was found in a hotel room next to a homemade aluminum foil pipe.As someone who was widowed at 24 years old, I am all too familiar with the cost of the opioid crisis in the United States. At its peak, between 2022 and 2023, drug overdoses tookmore than 111,000lives. Opioid overdoses are theleading cause of death for Americansbetween the ages of 18 and 45. In 2022, just over72,000 of those deathswere from fentanyl overdoses. Between 2022 and 2023, US border control fentanyl seizuresnearly doubled from 14,700 to 27,023lbs, making it what some have dubbed“the single deadliest drug threatour country has ever encountered”.I desperately want to find a solution to the fentanyl crisis. Unfortunately, all Trump’s talk about fixing it is smoke and mirrors. Rather than look to research and to other countries that have addressed the issue, the Trump administration is using the opioid crisis andfamilies like minewho have lost loved ones to justify ridiculous tariffs, a useless wall and cruel immigration policies when data clearly shows that immigration has very little to do with drug trafficking or drug use. Meanwhile, thousands of Americans – our family, our friends and our neighbors – continue to die every week.Fentanyl deaths doubled between 2019 and 2021. It has only gotten worse sinceTrump wants us to believe the Biden administration is at fault for the growing fentanyl problem. He wants us to believe the ones trafficking the drug across our borders are Canadian and Mexican immigrants. None of this is true.Here are the facts.Nearly 97% of all fentanyl seizures occurred at the Mexico border, while only .2% happened at the border with Canada. To put that in context, in 2024,21,889lbs of fentanyl were seizedby US border authorities; only 43lbs of that came from Canada. And people aren’t necessarily smuggling fentanyl in from China at all. Rather,Chinese manufacturers sell legal chemicalsused to make fentanyl to criminals in both the US and Mexico.What many people misunderstand is that99% of those funding fentanyl smugglingare US citizens; in 2022, 89% of those convicted for trafficking fentanylwere US citizens. And90%of those drugs are seized at legal border crossings or border checkpoints along major highways. Despite Trump’s rhetoric, of all the folks who were arrested for crossing the border illegally,only .0009% were foundwith any fentanyl on them at all.And perhaps one of the most important things to note when considering how we got here is thatfentanyl seizures quadrupledbetween 2019 and 2021, a consequence of Trump’s Covid-era border restrictions. The reason? Fentanyl is50 times more potentper pound than heroin; traffickers could smuggle less product and still get the same return. So when Trump restricted our borders, traffickers switched to fentanyl. As a result, fentanyl deaths doubled between 2019 and 2021. It has only gotten worse since.When considering the opioid crisis in the United States, I believe we too often make the mistake of getting caught up in the perceived immorality of drug use so that we lose sight of the real goal here: to save lives. The number of drug-related deathsis higher in the United Statesthan any other high-income country.In countries like France and Norway, which have significantly lower rates of opioid overdose,medicated-assisted treatment programsare common. More than 86% of adults with opioid-use disorder in those countries receive treatments from such programs compared with only 11% in the United States. Why is that? Why are we wasting time and resources on strategies with no data to back them up rather than doing what has already proven to work?What I want to see, as someone who has lost so much already, is for us to collectively stop asking “How do we keep the drugs out of our country?” and start asking “How do we keep more of our people alive?” Because the answers to those two questions are very different, and had we asked the latter sooner, my husband might still be alive.Karie Fugett is an author living in Dothan, Alabama.

But that’s exactly what they are.”Leavitt’s answer delighted Maga media and went viral in conservative circles, with afire emojifrom a Daily Wire reporter, abullseye emojifrom the Heritage Foundation, and amic drop emojifrom the Republican Study Committee.It was also completely, utterly, totally,wrong. Factually inaccurate. A brazen lie.In the eyes of this administration, immigrants who are undocumented are all “illegal immigrants” and these “illegal immigrants”, ergo, are all “criminals”.But, on so many levels, it’s just not true. It’s a popular myth pushed by the right that needs urgent debunking.First, people are not, arenever, illegal. It was the Nobel laureate and former Auschwitz prisoner Elie Wiesel whopointed outhow “no human being is ‘illegal’” because it is “a contradiction in terms. People can be beautiful or less beautiful, they can be just or unjust, but illegal? How can a human being be illegal?”An act can be illegal; people cannot inherently be illegal.Second, the anti-immigrant right has not only gotten the language wrong but the law wrong, too. Under the US criminal code, as the ACLU hasnoted: “The act of being present in the United States in violation of the immigration laws is not, standing alone, a crime.” Why? Because illegal entry is considered a misdemeanor not a felony, under8 US Code § 1325, and is subject to civil, and not criminal, penalties. It is the “reentry of removed aliens”, under8 US Code § 1326, that is considered a felony and subject to criminal punishment.Meanwhile,almost halfof undocumented immigrants in the United States did not even enter the country illegally to begin with; many of them are “overstays” who arrived with a legal work, student, or travel visa but failed to leave the US, for a multiplicity of reasons, before their visas expired.The inconvenient truth for the anti-immigrant right is that it is not a crime for immigrants simply to be present in the United States without proper documentation. They are not “illegals”. Don’t take my word for it. Or the ACLU’s. Take the word – the 5-3 majority ruling! – of the supreme court of the United States. In 2012, inArizona v United States, the highest court in the land ruled that “as a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain in the United States”.Got that? Not. A. Crime.Third, the anti-immigrant right wants to conflate immigrants, especially of the undocumented variety, with criminals – but the evidence is beyond flimsy. Remember in February when the Trump administrationclaimedthat “Guantánamo Bay will hold the worst of the worst” migrants? When the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem,insistedthat “criminal alien murderers, rapists, child predators and gangsters” were being shipped to Gitmo? It turned out that around one in three of those migrants “had no criminal records”.Remember in March when the Trump administration sent nearly 300 immigrants to El Salvador because they were, allegedly, “illegal foreign terrorists” and “bad people” who commited the most “heinous crimes”? Ice officials lateradmittedin court that “many” of the people packed off to El Salvador had no criminal records.Moreandmorereports suggest the apparent justification for sending these immigrants to a foreign labor camp was their possession not of criminal records but of … tattoos. On Monday, the Trump administrationadmittedin a court filing that it had detained a Maryland father with protected legal status and deported him to El Salvador “because of an administrative error”.It isn’t surprising that this far-right nativist administration, its mendacious press secretary, and its Ice thugs have failed to identify actual criminals, whether violent or otherwise, among the many immigrants they have rounded up, detained, and tried to deport in recent weeks. Despite Maga’s obsession with immigrant criminals (Laken Riley’s killer!),studyafterstudyafterstudyafterstudyconfirms that higher immigration does not lead to higher crime rates and, in fact, immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than the native-born population. “Statistically speaking,” the immigration expert Aaron Reichlin-Melnick hasobserved, “you’re measurably safer living in a town filled with average undocumented immigrants than a town filled with average native-born citizens.”So why can’t liberals more broadly, and elected Democrats in particular, say this? And say it loudly and repeatedly? Why can’t they reject both the butchering of the English language and the misrepresentation of US criminal law by rejecting the entire “illegal immigrant” framing of the nativist right? And if not now – when a far-right administration is grabbinginnocent peopleoff the streets and sending them to betorturedin a foreign gulag – thenwhen? It’s past time for liberals and Democrats to make clear to conservatives and Republicans that the facts don’t care about their feelings. There is no such thing as an illegal immigrant; undocumented immigrants aren’t ipso facto criminals; and higher immigration doesn’t lead to higher crime.Mehdi Hasan is a broadcaster and author, and a former host on MSNBC.

Then he got seriousMoira DoneganThe US president made himself explicit this week by saying: ‘I’m not joking’ when asked about his ambitions to stay in officeWed 2 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 13.47 EDTShareJokes have a specific relation to Trumpianpolitics: they are the tip of the spear for introducing illegal or once-unacceptable ideas to the public, under a thick gloss of irony or plausible deniability, to advance a far-right agenda.In 2016,Donald Trump’s support from the young, online “alt-right” was underestimated in part because so much of the profession of love for Trump, and for his racist and authoritarian ambitions, came in the form of supposed jokes. Trump himself, meanwhile, uses humor to charm and titillate, making jokes to demean adversaries, get audiences on his side and hint, with winking coyness, about his next move. This has been his strategy for years.So when analysts have asked, over the years he has been floating the possibility, whether Trump is joking or serious when he has said that he will seek a third term in office, in defiance of the constitution, the answer was never an either-or. The answer was “yes”: he was both joking, of course, and he was also entirely serious.For those who still had not caught on to this game, Trump made himself helpfully explicit this week, in an interview with NBC News. “I’m not joking,” he said, when asked to clarify his ambitions to continue in office in violation of the 22nd amendment. “There are methods which you could do it [sic].” He acknowledged that he could possibly run as a vice-presidential candidate – in potential violation of the 12th amendment – and assume office once the presidential candidate on his ticket stepped aside, as one possible way to hold onto power. “But there are others, too,” he said. He refused to elaborate on what those other methods might be.Constitutional lawyers – a group of people who seemingly cannot help but indulge in clever games of wordplay even when the republic is at stake – seemed to take up Trump’s anti-constitutional authoritarian ambitions as something like a fun intellectual challenge.“Anyone discounting a 3d Trump term per the 22d am + the 12th am is thinking magically,” wrote Larry Tribe, of Harvard Law, on Bluesky. “The 22nd dsn’t bar *serving* a 3d term, only being *elected* 3 times. The 12th dsn’t bar running for VP unless ‘ineligible to serve as Pres, but Trump isn’t ineligible. QED! [sic.]’” This is more or less what the Trump supporters seem to be saying: that somehow, the plain meaning of the 22nd amendment – to prevent a dictator from seizing permanent control of the presidency – is not in effect – at least, not if Trump performs a sufficiently clever formal trick, something like the legal equivalent of a drunken dancer bending over backwards while proceeding underneath a limbo stick. In the event that that doesn’t work, Andy Ogles, a Republican representative from Tennessee, has introduced a bill that would nullify the 22nd amendment for Trump’s purposes – just in case.But the wordplay and logical twisting that is taking place should be understood as pretextual, and completely irrelevant to what Trump is actually doing by declaring his intention to stay in office. Trump does not care about meeting the requirements – technical or substantive – of the 22nd amendment. That is because he does not care very much about the constitutional limits on his authority and will at all. Trump already considers himself a dictator. What he is saying, when he declares his intention to illegally run again, is not that he could find a way to do it that is plausibly legal. He is saying, instead, that the law does not apply to him. Trump is declaring that wherever the constitution contradicts his desires, the constitution is moot.The Trump era has already been one of dramatic constitutional disintegration – one that his own accumulation of power and disregard for the law has accelerated but did not incite. The principle of popular sovereignty has been eroded by the US supreme court’s systematic gutting of the 1965 Voting Rights Act – which has made voting more onerous, particularly for racial minorities and groups that tend to vote Democratic – and by their 2010 decision in Citizens United v FEC, which opened a floodgate of money into politics and allowed billionaires and other monied interests to manipulate the political process to their benefit.Congress’s scleroticism and stagnation have made the legislative body into little more than a media platform: Senators and representatives can use their notoriety and sometimes their subpoena power to make a point, but they are rarely in a position of making policy. Instead, much of the work that would have once been called legislating is now done by the federal courts, and by the executive. And that executive’s power and prerogatives have expanded far beyond what is imagined by the drafters of article II – now carrying sweeping powers to pursue military acts of aggression abroad and a novel new impunity from prosecution for illegal deeds committed at home. The president – at least withDonald Trump– now looks like something much closer to a king, with the supreme court serving as something like a counsel of scheming viziers or gossiping court eunuchs.Donald Trump is eyeing up a third term – and no one is opposing him | Arwa MahdawiRead moreUnder such conditions of constitutional rot, it seems almost inevitable, in retrospect, that a failure to grasp the failures of the American political system would lead to the emergence of a strongman dictator. But one need not take such a long view of history to see the obvious truth that Donald Trump does not think that he should have to leave office just because the law says so.One can look, instead, to recent history. After all, we already know what happens when Trump is supposed to leave the presidency: he holds onto it, refusing to go and encourages violence to try to get his way. Just because the attempted putsch did not work on January 6 does not mean that it did not signal a core feature of his theory of his own power: that any attempt to take it from him, be it by law or by custom or by the ballot box, is illegitimate. The 22nd amendment is hardly the first law that Trump has ignored in pursuit of this principle. He has never been a law-abiding man before.

The first is Peter Thiel: the tech billionairewho bankrolledVance’s political pivot. The second is Kevin D Roberts, head of the Heritage Foundation and mastermind of Project 2025, who has been anenergetic Vance advocate.And the third is Usha Chilukuri Vance, JD’s wife. While Usha kept a low profile during the Trump-Vance campaign, trailing after her other half with a smile on her face anda copy of The Iliadin her hand, JD has made her influence clear. In his memoir Hillbilly Elegy, for example, he wrote that Usha helped him navigate Yale and “always encouraged me to seek opportunities that I didn’t know existed”.Usha has also always sought out opportunities for herself. The 39-year-old has the sort of CV ChatGPT might conjure up if you put “overachiever with political ambitions” as a prompt: Yale, then Cambridge, then back to Yale for law school, where she was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. From there she clerked for high-powered judges including supreme court chief justice John Roberts when he wrote a 5-4 rulingupholding Trump’s so-called Muslim ban.Despite her own ambitions, Usha left her corporate law job when JD got a shot at DC. “She actually quit her job the day that Donald Trump asked me to become the VP nominee because she wants to be on the road with me,” JD Vance said in aninterview last August. “That means we got to win, right? She’s gonna be mad at me if she quit her job and we don’t win.”They won all right, but pretty much everyone in the US now thinks JD is a loser. He has historically badfavourability ratingsand there are memes of him everywhere. I have absolutely no sympathy for Usha – who is far from a victim – but I have to wonder if she is starting to feel a little sorry for herself. As she and JD wandered aroundfreezing coldGreenlandover the weekend, unwelcomed by angry local people who didn’t want to be photographed anywhere near them, did she start to suspect that aligning herself with Trump – a man her own husbandonce called “America’s Hitler”– might not have been the wisest choice? If not, then perhaps Usha, who has beendescribed as a “bookworm”, needs to put down The Iliad and read the room.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fifteen times over.Dr Bashar Murad, the director of health programs at the Palestine Red Crescent, told reporters that one of the men who was executed by the Israelis was on the phone with colleagues. The victim had been injured and was requesting help.“A few minutes later, during the call, we heard the sound of Israeli soldiers arriving at the location, speaking in Hebrew. The conversation was about gathering the team, with statements like: ‘Gather them at the wall and bring some restraints to tie them.’ This indicated that a large number of the medical staff were still alive.”The Israeli army, for its part, claimed that the area was “an active combat zone”. Soldiers fired on the ambulances because they were “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”.For Palestinians, this was never a ceasefire | Dalia HartuqaRead moreNo one believes the army’s lies at this point. They serve a purpose; like all shoddy propaganda or misinformation, they work to obscure what is heartrendingly clear: the destruction of all Palestinian life is a matter of policy for Israel’s army. The genocide is a policy matter in that country.Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president,explainedhis country’s logic early on: “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved. It is absolutely not true.”For those who support its actions – most of the Israeli public, ifpollsare to be believed – the army misinformation is a signal that the leadership regards the executions as a non-issue. Carry on – Eurovision is just around the corner.News of the executions come after an anonymous Israeli soldier wrote a column in the Israeli paperHaaretzentitled, “In Gaza, Almost Every IDF Platoon Keeps a Human Shield, a Sub-army of Palestinian Slaves.”In it, he describes how widespread the practice of utilizing human shields is in the Israeli army:“Today, almost every platoon keeps a [human shield] and no infantry force enters a house before a [human shield] clears it. This means there are four [human shields] in a company, twelve in a battalion, and at least 36 in a brigade. We operate a sub-army of slaves.”I was born in Tal al-Sultan, where the Israeli troops executed the paramedics. I know how far the neighborhood is from the beach, and what the offshore wind feels like in the spring. I remember what the Philadelphi route – the barrier between Gaza and Egypt – looked like the last time the Israelis occupied it. Now, Tal al-Sultan is hell on earth, which is what an Israeli military leaderpromisedto make it at the start of the genocide, 18 months ago.When I first learned that Israeli men had zip-tied the paramedics before executing them, I thought of their terror – how I would feel in their place. I imagined them in constraints and lined up, facing the unbridled malice of their executioners. Did they think of their wives and children – the pain of being separated from them forever? Did they still their hearts – or find peace in their final moments?Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif, Mohammed Bahloul, Mohammed Hilieh, Mustafa Khafaja, Saleh Muammar, Rifaat Radwan and Ezzedine Shaat, and their colleagues whose names I haven’t been able to find were heroes. They spent their last hours on earth on a mission to render aid, to save people. Instead, we learn that they were in a race to the grave. And for what?Imagine if all those who are silent about the terrible evil being committed in Gaza spoke up | Owen JonesRead moreThe murderers’ state of mind is hinted at by the aftermath of the crime. The Israeli soldiers dug a mass grave to hide their victims’ bodies. They crushed an ambulance under a bulldozer and attempted to bury that too. I wondered briefly if their crimes would haunt them, before I realized it didn’t matter.The Israeli men who executed 15 unarmed paramedics got away with it. Whether the Israelis enjoyed themselves as they murdered their victims, or whether they will blitz their brains with drugs to forget doesn’t matter. Just as with the men whoexecutedHind Rajab, a five-year-old child, individually, they will have got away with it because their society offers them safe haven. All of Europe and the US is their playground.Nor will global leaders intervene to end the mass murder which has been punctuated by this latest obscenity. Some of them – such as Emmanuel Macron, whocalled for a ceasefire, might appear to want to end the slaughter. After all, dead babies in incubators and paramedics in a mass grave are unpleasant garlands to wear. But 18 months in, they are too deeply implicated. Who can forget Ursula von der Leyen’sembraceof Netanyahu? Or Keir Starmer’s affirmation of Israel’s “right” to starve Palestinians in Gaza?Today, those who are tasked with upholding international law have been co-opted by the Israeli leadership, whether they like it or not. The logic of gangland drug dealers and criminals – new members commit crimes to join, and are locked in – prevails.So far from being complicit, US and European leaders are the authors of this latest atrocity by their Israeli colleagues inGaza.As for the rest of us, we can take note, and we can remember. There will be no Nuremberg for the Palestinians, but we can honor the memory of all those who fought to live.

But I have a plan to counter itJulia SteinbergerThe speed with which US democracy is being dismantled is dizzying, but if we organise resistance now we can stop thisWed 2 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 13.46 EDTShareEverything is moving too fast. The Trump-Musk administration is tearing through US government, universities and health organisations,firing tens of thousands of employees, eliminating billons in funding. The scope and speed of the attack is dizzying. It is almost impossible to keep up with the ongoing destruction, let alone to organise the resistance. None of this is accidental.We need to understand the origins of the Trump blitzkrieg to counter it in the US and prevent it from spreading abroad. The speed of the attack can be traced to Trump strategist and “accelerationist” Steve Bannon, and aligns with his information warfare tactic to “flood the zone” to confuse, disengage and disorient. Whether on climate or Covid, rumours, lies and conspiracy theories create a chaotic cacophony, leaving the public disoriented, fearful and prey to oversimple Trumpist messages: blame the woke, migrants, transgender people, Muslims, doctors, scientists. Musk’s purchase of Twitter/X supports Bannon’s agenda.What we are seeing is the coming together of two major forces of the Trump world: thefossil fuel-fundedHeritage Foundation and the world of tech. The former authored Project 2025, a plan for Trump’s first year in office. Curtis Yarvin, PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel’s favoured theorist, has expressed the desire to “reboot” a whole country, substituting theoutmoded democracysoftware with something far less accountable and more business-friendly. Together,bothindustriespoured hundreds of millions into Trump’s campaign.So far,regulatory positions have been eliminated,cryptocurrencywill be able to bypass democratic oversight, budgets have been cut to allow Musk to cash in withSpaceX and Starlink contracts, andfired government employeesare to be replaced with AI products.Many industries sense the winds of change and no longer even bother with greenwashing or climate commitments, as they drop all pretence of responsibility for a livable world. The climate and ecological implications of this shift are as disastrous as they are deliberate. We need an appropriate name for this new era of fossil and tech bros accelerating attacks on democracy and the planet: cataclysm capitalism.Cataclysm capitalism is the worthy heir to neoliberalism and its disaster capitalism. As Naomi Klein described in her bookThe Shock Doctrine, neoliberal economic ideology took advantage of crises to deregulate and privatise public services, hobble trade unions and civil society, and generally create conditions ideal for private wealth accumulation and disastrous for equality, work and welfare. Cataclysm capitalism does all this, and goes further. The pace of change is accelerated, the dismantling of public institutions more complete, the attack on democracy more overt. Perhaps the most frightening aspect is that the industries laughing in the face of planetary and social destruction have made a clear calculus: they don’t need prosperous economies to profit. Neoliberalism at least claimed to be serving a form of greater good via winner-takes-all market competition. Cataclysm capitalism dispenses with this illusion altogether.The fossil fuel companies, the rightwing tech magnates and the financial companies hurrying in their wake have somehow convinced themselves that they don’t need prosperous economies to prosper themselves. They have learned to profit from disruption and destruction. They know from experience that immiserated populations will endure exploitative working conditions and go deep into debt to keep themselves and their families alive.Paradoxically, the creation of vast economic insecurity favours far-right politics. Voters in a constant state of fear and stress, without a clear understanding of the system creating hardships, are an easy prey for far-right rhetoric blaming migrants, woke and trans people. Sadly, since neoliberal ideology has devoured previously centre-left parties (UK Labour and US Democrats), we are left with much less of an organised opposition, and much more of a pipeline to accelerating disaster.The picture is grim. We are faced with an organised hostile takeover of democracy, coupled with a dismantling of the economy in favour of the sectors and industries most beneficial to the fossil-fuel and tech magnates, to our detriment and the detriment of all life on Earth. What can we do? I propose a three-pronged plan, short and schematic – enough to get started.First, understanding is power. We need to learn more about the devourers of our world, from the fossil fuel thinktanks to the far-right tech accelerationists. We need to explain to our fellow citizens who we are facing, and what their ultimate plan is. Replace helpless fear with knowledgable anger.Our research shows: the resistance is alive and well | Erica Chenoweth, Jeremy Pressman and Soha HammamRead moreSecond, we need to organise, come together, in trade unions, in neighbourhood groups, in any collectives we can form. At this point, we were all raised in neoliberal cultures of individualism and isolation. Organising sounds foreign and difficult. Indeed, our learned organisational helplessness is integral to the endeavour of disaster capitalism.However, as an exceptionally cooperative species, in reality, we all have impressive innate capacity. Quite literally, organising is what we, as social animals, were born to do. At its most basic forms, organising consists of gathering people, raising awareness of the causes of our common problems, discussing possible avenues of action, putting them into operation. Rinse, repeat; make it part of your life’s hobbies and work.Third, we need to respond to the Trump-Musk project at the strategic level, not blow by blow. We know we can expect nothing but destruction and corruption from them: we have to put forward a positive vision, worth fighting for. From my research, I would describe it as scientifically informed democratic decision-making for the common good. This also means creating our own organisations for mutual aid and protection of vulnerable people. We have everything to lose if we don’t act, and everything to gain if we do.Julia Steinberger is professor of societal challenges of climate change at the University of LausanneExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionProject 2025US politicsProtestDonald TrumpElon MuskSteve BannoncommentShareReuse this content"

The opponents aren’t an aloof, brutally effective Soviet Union team expected to steamroll their way to a gold medal just as their military were attempting to steamroll their way through Afghanistan.The Concacaf Nations League isn’t the Olympics, and there’ll be no film starring Kurt Russell as Panamanian coach Thomas Christiansen inspiring his team to ageopolitically charged winover the Goliaths of the competition. But like the Soviet hockey team in 1980, the US men’s soccer team in 2025 is an easy team to dislike. And with a World Cup on home soil rapidly approaching, that’s a heavy cross to bear.Nations League losses and sparse crowds have US momentum at low ebbRead moreTo use another analogy: In the 2026 World Cup, the US men might find themselves as disliked as Duke in men’s college basketball – if Duke had failed to get past the second round of the NCAA Tournament, lacked players as charismatic as Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg, but did have designs on annexing every part of North America that doesn’t speak Spanish.Teams attract support for a few different reasons, and the US men score poorly on all of them:Underdog status.The US men had this in the past. In the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, a bunch of college kids and semi-professional players challenged the seasoned pros. They continued punching above their weight in the 2000s,upsetting Portugal in the 2002 World Cup, upending the balance of power in the region by beating Mexico in that same World Cup and several other occasions, then ending Spain’s 35-match unbeaten streak in the 2009 Confederations Cup final. But now, with a so-called “Golden Generation” of talent spread among elite clubs in Europe, they’ve traded the “underdog” label for “underachiever” –eliminated in the group stageat last year’s Copa América, and losers of two underwhelming games at the Nations League finals.Brilliant play.We can, at least for now, rule this out.Provincial identity.Philadelphia roots for the Eagles – maybe a bit too much. Boston gets behind the Red Sox. But such loyalties are shallower if the ties are more transient. In Washington DC, where a lot of people from elsewhere descend on the nation’s capital and its suburbs, fans from the “road” team are often numerous and noisy for the local teams. What happens to a team representing the United States if immigrants are feeling less welcome in the country? Or if the intelligentsia are watching their work dismissed and dismantled while some of their colleagues are swept off the streets to be detained and deported?Personalities.US soccer players have long been marketable. In women’s soccer, from Mia Hamm’s heyday to that of Megan Rapinoe, players have been a constant presence in TV ads. Men’s soccer had its share of recognizable stars – Alexi Lalas had a goatee and a guitar, Landon Donovan projected California Zen and was even married to a TV star for a while. Today? The good news is that a lot of American kids are finally wearing soccer shirts. The bad news? They all say “Messi” on the back.To an extent, the US men’s image has never recovered from Lalas’s blistering“tattooed millionaires” rantwhen the team was on its way to World Cup qualification failure in 2017. Much of the team has retired since then, but Lalas also singled out “Wonderboy” Christian Pulisic, who should be in his prime.Lalas’s words resonated because the soccer community understood exactly what he was saying. In the past, US men had the excuse of being in a country that didn’t take the sport seriously and had scant opportunities for proper development outside the rough-and-tumble world of college soccer. By 2017, most of the US men’s team had experience in Europe, and many had been professionals since their mid-teens.“You are a soccer generation that has been given everything,” Lalas said at the time. “You are a soccer generation who’s on the verge of squandering everything.”Spending much of their careers in Europe adds to the perceived distance between players and supporters, especially because many of the players are breaking through in Italy’s Serie A, which has a tiny presence on US TV in comparison to the Premier League, which once boosted the image of players like Tim Howard, relentless target player Brian McBride and the preternaturally crafty Clint Dempsey.Most of these circumstances are beyond the players’ control. Milan and Juventus have been better fits for US players than Chelsea and Leeds. The US team isn’t responsible for the US government – and in any case, if geopolitics alone determined fan loyalty, Washington Capitals fans wouldn’t be unabashedly cheering for their Russian star, Alex Ovechkin, to wrest the NHL career goalscoring record from Wayne Gretzky.That said, the lack of an activist akin to Rapinoe or Julie Foudy hasn’t gone unnoticed. And the US fanbase isn’t shy about showing its disdain for players like Korbin Albert, whose negative attitude toward even the most performative LGBTQ allyship may find a sympathetic audience in parts of the White House but not down the street at Audi Field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kylian Mbappégave away his bonus moneyfor winning the 2018 World Cup. England players typically donate their international match fees, though the sums are not particularly significant in the first place.Three years ago, US soccer teams reached ahistoric equal pay agreementby making sure both the men and the women would make quite a lot of money – 80-90% of the Fifa prize money the men and women accumulate at upcoming World Cups. They announced that deal soon after US Soccer president Cindy Cone barely survived a grassroots revolt in which state youth and adult organizers perceived that the federation no longer cared about the game outside the professional ranks. And the players didn’t make any grand gestures to smooth over relations with those grassroots organizers, all of whom are smart enough to know that it’s not just their personal fiefdoms at stake but also the USA’s ability to compete with countries that funnel much of their prize money back into developing the next generations to win it all once again.US Soccer is only a generation and change removed from the days of their supporters being outnumbered at home matches. Games in California would draw massive support from Mexican fans. Games in Washington, where nearly every nation on the planet has some sort of diaspora, would often turn up crowds that were far from unanimous in supporting the home team. US Soccer wound up hosting World Cup qualifiers against Mexico in Columbus, Ohio, where the lower temperatures and lower diversity would give the USA a true “home” advantage.Since then, the crowds on US soil have embraced teams that mixed scrappiness and skill to supplant Mexico as the regional power. They found players with whom to identify – journeyman Jay DeMerit fought through non-league English football to reach the national team, Donovan and Jozy Altidore came across as typical US teenagers, and Herculez Gomez was at the vanguard of a group of Mexican-American players who opted to represent the red, white and blue.Today’s US players are commanding transfer fees and big salaries to move to Europe before anyone even knows who they are. Gomez is an ESPN commentatorripping the team’s lackof offensive effort.And if the US men and their marketers want the country to rally behind them next year in what should be a landmark moment for the sport in North America, they’ll need to do something to connect with their supporters. Or at least beat Panama.Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

It is estimated that the use of antibioticsadds about 20 yearsof life expectancy for every person worldwide (on average). As the King’s Fund put it, if we lose antibiotics, “we would lose modern medicine as we know it”. Doctors, public health experts and governments take the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) very seriously, yet the problem appears to be getting worse.A report from theNational Audit Officein February finds that out of five domestic targets set in 2019 to tackle AMR, only one has been met – to reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals. Others, such as the target to reduce drug-resistant infections in humans by 10%, haven’t made much progress; in fact, these infections have actually increased by 13% since 2018.AMR is often misunderstood. I have often heard people say “I’m afraid of taking antibiotics and becoming resistant to them.” But AMR isn’t about individuals becoming resistant to antibiotics. It’s about pathogens – most often bacterial infections but also viruses, fungi and parasites – evolving to become resistant to our current drugs, so that the infections they cause become untreatable. Think of ear, urinary tract and chest infections, or procedures such as C-sections and other routine surgeries, becoming life threatening because the drugs we use to treat infections or to prevent them after medical procedures don’t work.However, I despair at Britain beating itself with yet another stick. The country has actually been fairly good at tackling AMR. In 2023, our research team led byJay Patelpublished an analysis in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal measuring the global response to AMR in 114 countries. The UK made the top three “best performing” countries with only the US and Norway ahead, followed by Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Japan. The credit in the UK largely sits withDame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England from 2011 to 2019, who made it a priority during her tenure and continues to lead as the UK special envoy on AMR. The UK government has led on national guidelines and oversight in human and animal health in conjunction with the EU.We may worry about doctors overprescribing antibiotics in the NHS, needlessly exposing pathogens to these drugs and allowing them to evolve resistance. But having worked onAMR governancebefore, my take is that the biggest threat is the rise of resistant pathogens emerging in countries using huge amounts of antibioticsin their animalsfor growth and cheap meat. Think of pigs, chickens and cattle in China, Brazil, India and, evenuntil recently, the US. Livestock alone is estimated toconsume 50% to 80%of the antibiotics produced in high- and middle-income countries. These resistant pathogens develop in animals, which are given antibiotics as a prophylactic even when they’re healthy. They then infect a human, who may travel and spread it to other humans. It is a straightforward formula. Antibiotics in animals plus farm workers plus air travel equals drug-resistant infections in the UK, and elsewhere.It is not just theoretical. In 2018, astudy in Naturefound that widespread colistin-resistant bacteria, including in hospitals in London, could be traced to a single event in 2006 in China when a bacteria jumped from pigs into humans. Colistin is a last-line antibiotic for certain infections, meaning it is given after other drugs have failed, yet it was used heavily for growth promotion in pig farming in China. Since these findings, the Chinese government, as well as India and Japan,banned colistinin animal feed. This probably will have a larger impact on reducing AMR than anything being done in UK clinics and with human prescribing practices.AI may help us cure countless diseases – and usher in a new golden age of medicine | Samuel HumeRead moreThe UK is best protected from drug-resistant infections by working with other countries to regulate the use of antibiotics, especially in animals. Davies has tried hard to push this agenda globally, bringing together human health, agricultural and vet experts to agree on standards and regulations that are a universal good. However, there is a clear conflict with those who argue that boosting animal production, including of cheap and available meat, is the priority, especially in middle-income countries with large populations.Why can’t we just develop new antibiotics if our current ones become ineffective? Simple question and tough answer. These are technically difficult drugs to develop and we have made very slow progress. Developing similar versions to existing antibiotics isn’t enough because they won’t be as effective against pathogens that have developed resistance: we need totally new classes of drugs. And a recentWorld Health Organization reportnoted that since 2017, while 13 new antibiotics have obtained authorisation, only two represent a new chemical class.Our best to shot to tackle AMR is to protect our current arsenal of drugs and make sure they remain effective. This means working with other countries on a shared approach to how and when drugs are used in humans and animals. This is an ongoing challenge, especially in a world where cooperation is breaking down and isolationist approaches are on the rise. Yes, we can blame the UK government for many things, but on the issue of AMR it is a standout country and a global leader.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author ofHow Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsAntibioticsOpinionHealthFarm animalsFarmingAgriculturecommentShareReuse this content"

Watching Eid live on the BBC was a huge momentNadeine AsbaliBritish Muslims are too often acceptable only when they bake cakes or win medals. Now the nation has had a true insight into our faithWed 2 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 07.17 EDTShareIf anything is going to get me to turn on BBC One early on Eid morning, it’s Eid prayer being televised on a UK terrestrial channel for the first time in British broadcasting history. Held at Bradford Central Mosque, thegroundbreaking coverageon Monday followed the entirety of the Eid prayer – starting with Qur’anic recitation, then a sermon in both English and Arabic and the congregational prayer itself, culminating in the customary eid mubarak embraces.For Muslims like me, these scenes are part and parcel of every Eid. The keffiyeh-draped uncles sporting orange beards dyed with henna, some to emulate the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and some simply to hide their grey hairs; the children using the congregation as an assault course and scouting out the auntie who is handing out the best sweets; fancy clothes, henna-patterned palms and smiling faces; people high on both the spirituality of the just-passed holy month and probably too much sugar. This is the stuffEid is made of, but watching it unfold on the nation’s main TV channel was a refreshing novelty – and I found it strangely affirming, as well as a little emotional, to witness.Don’t get me wrong, I’m not the kind of person who keels over in gratitude every time anyone vaguely resembling a Muslim is shown on television. In fact, I am a tough critic of the type of representation we normally see. Typically, Muslims are portrayed positively in the media only if we make ourselves suitably palatable. We must humanise ourselves by baking cakes, winning medals or poking fun at who we are for cheap laughs. When I’ve seen Ramadan and Eid on TV in the past, it’s usually been in the harmless, sanitised realms of cookery shows where you would be forgiven for thinking that the most spiritual time in the Muslim calendar is actually all about samosas and biryani.That is exactly what made this year’sEid Livescreening so special. Though we are followers of an Abrahamic faith, the way we pray as Muslims sets us apart as unique. Personally, I find the prescription to pray five times a day offers a much needed spirituality break during the hustle and bustle of modern life. The ritual of resting our forehead on the ground to physically humble ourselves before God is a reminder of my own insignificance in front of my creator, and repeating short verses of the Qur’an in each cycle of prayer helps me to ensure that my holy book is a living, breathing part of my existence rather than a tome gathering dust on the shelf. In a world that seems to encourage worship of the self, I think the Islamic prayer pushes back against that and demands that we set aside whatever we are doing solely to dedicate a few minutes to worship.Yet Muslim prayer is an act that is vilified, criminalised and maligned – consider theprayer ban debatein schools for example. Many, including me, have sometimes felt scrutinised or even unsafe when praying in public. So it feels significant that it was the Eid prayer specifically that was televised. The show could have replicated what has been done countless times, focusing on superficial and innocuous things such asEid clothes and food. But broadcasting Qur’anic recitation and showcasing the way we pray to the entire nation, I hope, normalises something that is so often seen as foreign and threatening.In the 15 years or so that I have been visibly Muslim, I have learned to stop apologising for my existence and to stop slotting myself into the mould of what an acceptable Muslim looks like to a society that is still sosteeped in Islamophobia. I am no longer self-conscious about my hijab or praying in public – even in highly securitised locations such as airports – because my faith means more to me than proving I belong in the country I was born in. So, watching people who share my faith do what we always do on Eid without apology and hearing the words of the book that Muslims believe to be the word of God broadcast live to the nation have proved to me that it is not in blanket assimilation that we find belonging. It’s in staying true to who we really are.As the imam said during the sermon in Bradford, Eid is about carrying forward the spiritual growth we have gained in Ramadan. Our faith teaches us to be active participants in our communities, and tells us that we aren’t true believers if our neighbours go hungry. Ramadan is a spiritual bootcamp for us Muslims, and I pray that a short insight into our beliefs on the BBC will expose the rest of the nation to the true meaning of a faith that remains heavily vilified.Of course, I’m not naive enough to think that this solves everything or that deeply embedded Islamophobia is somehow suddenly solved. But the childhood version of myself who was scared of my friends seeing me pray could never have imagined that one day that very act would be shown live onBBC One. And it may not be a cure, but it’s certainly a start.Nadeine Asbali is the author of Veiled Threat: On Being Visibly Muslim in Britain, and a secondary school teacher in LondonExplore more on these topicsEid al-FitrOpinionIslamReligionBBC OnecommentShareReuse this content"

Five years on, neither they nor voters really know him or his planWed 2 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 06.41 EDTShareUpsetting backbench MPs is an occupational hazard for prime ministers. Government is an endless sequence of messy compromises. Incumbency is a drag on popularity. Poll ratings sink and nerves fray. Careers are thwarted. There are fewer ministerial jobs than ambitious candidates.This is normal party discontentment. It grows over the course of a parliament, becoming critical at the point when rebel numbers threaten the leader’s majority. By that metric, Keir Starmer can afford to provoke a lot of dissatisfaction in the ranks. And, together withRachel Reeves, he has.The Labour mood in the aftermath of last week’s spring statement is bleak.Shrinking benefitsin the name of fiscal rectitude was never going to go down well with MPs who spent years in opposition denouncing the Tories for that sort of thing. But the demoralising effect is greater for being cumulative. It is just over a month since Starmerraided the overseas aid budgetto fund higher defence spending. Weeks earlier, Reeves landed Heathrow airport expansion on a party that would rather be striving for net zero.Each time,LabourMPs are presented with a plausibleforce majeurejustification – economic growth is the precondition for revenue to fund good causes; Vladimir Putin makes rearmament urgent; a welfare system marked by perverse incentives that steer people away from work needs reform. In isolation, any single unpalatable choice would be easier to swallow. As a multi-course meal, it turns the stomachs of MPs who feel they weren’t consulted on the menu.Open defiance is still rare. Ruthless whipping encourages discipline. MPs newly elected in 2024 are reminded that they owe their seats to Starmer, although that line is wearing thin. Submissive gratitude isn’t what motivates people to enter parliament. Some with slim majorities, eyeing opinion polls gloomily, are already thinking about life post-politics.Anxiety, tending towards despair, swells largely under the surface. It isn’t confined to any one faction. Downing Street would like to imagine that dissent springs only from a recalcitrant left, fomented by people who will never forgive Starmer for not being Jeremy Corbyn and then parlaying that distinction into a massive election victory.That is one source of dissatisfaction, but far from the only one. The malaise afflicts young MPs who were handpicked for loyalty to Starmer, grandees of New Labour vintage and every flavour of soft-left social democrat in the middle.It is hard to get the full measure of a syndrome that is expressed in exasperated whispers through gritted teeth and pained rolling of eyes. There are plenty of Labour MPs, including cabinet ministers, who dutifully cheer the prime minister in the Commons, then seethe with frustration in the adjoining corridors.Different wings of the party have rival policy prescriptions, but the core complaint is the same. It is the lack of discernible strategic purpose. There are “milestones”, but on the road to where? There are “missions”, but how will Britain be different,feelbetter, once they are accomplished?Loyal defenders of the government point out, fairly, that these are still early days in an exceptionally tough climate. There were no shortcuts back to prosperity, given the abject state of things left by the Tories. The performance of a new administration in its first year is not a reliable guide to its future prospects. In early 1981, for example, it looked feasible that mass unemployment and social unrest wouldsink Margaret Thatcher. She stayed comfortably afloat through two subsequent elections.One elaboration of that comparison configures Donald Trump’s upending of the global order, and Starmer’s seizure of the diplomatic initiative in support of Ukraine, as a pivotal moment in the prime minister’s national standing; a boost in stature much as Thatcher’s prestige soared after the Falklands war.That is a stretch. Still, there is somepolling evidencethat the Labour leader’s sure-footedness on the international stage has helped his domestic reputation. And, come the next general election, Starmer doesn’t have to be cherished as a visionary prime minister if enough voters continue to think that he is the safer choice than any of the alternatives.That doesn’t reassure MPs who crave a nobler purpose, and a less shrivelled message, than just keeping the Tories out. Also, that imperative has dwindling purchase on the growing cohort of voters who see Labour and Tories as interchangeable and equally contemptible.Starmer’s struggle for definition predates his arrival in No 10. This week he will mark his fifth anniversary as party leader, and throughout that time his successes have been a function more of the people he wasn’t than by things he wanted to achieve. He wasn’t Corbyn, for a start. He was the antithesis to Boris Johnson; the antidote to Liz Truss; the available alternative to Rishi Sunak. Now he is good at being unlike Trump – a positive attribute but a passive one.A leader whose outline can only be drawn with reference to other, worse politicians ends up appearing to voters only in silhouette, without colour or humanising contour.The government’s agenda is also circumscribed by decisions made in opposition, defining the project by things it was not. Labour’s pre-election fiscal policy was drafted in fear of being cast by the Tories as profligate with public money and wedded to high taxes.As a result, while Reeves is the nominal author of her budget and forthcoming spending review, she has to fit them in impossibly narrow margins. The lines on the page were ruled for her by Jeremy Hunt as a deliberate act of sabotage when he knew he would soon be vacating the chancellor’s desk.Even if current growth-boosting policies work, the benefits won’t accrue fast enough to compensate for deteriorating services. Budget cuts also save less money than advertised when they exacerbate social deprivation, increasing pressure on other services.Absent some unforeseen cash windfall, a revision of tax policy is inevitable if the government is serious about rehabilitating the public realm. Abler communicators than Reeves and Starmer would have started narrating their way out of that particular corner already. Trump’s tsunami of tariffs would be a valid reason to declare previous commitments void.It is especially unfortunate that the prime minister and the chancellor share the same deficiency in this regard. They speak as if every phrase has been scanned for originality, frisked for authenticity and prevented from carrying any unprocessed feelings from the heart through the maximum security gates of their mouths. They are both politicians who reached the top by winning internal battles, not public arguments.This is something even their close allies concede is a problem, although they are obliged to downplay its significance. It isn’t going to change. It didn’t stop Labour winning before and, less than a year since the election, it is far too early to know whether it will win again.But when, after five years, the leader is still defined by things he is not, Labour MPs are justified in worrying that their time in government is being squandered and they will end up being remembered for all the things they failed to do.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

It is vital that the National Rally leader isn’t able to capitalise on this verdictWed 2 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 03.46 EDTShareThe verdict is in: the National Rally (NR) and its leader, Marine Le Pen, have been found to have employed fictitious European parliament assistants between 2004 and 2016. The fraudulent scheme enabled the misappropriation of around €2.9m in European funds, and Le Pen has now beenbarred from holding public officefor five years. Could this mark the end for the National Rally? Highly unlikely – and the reason lies in the party’s strategy.During the trial, Le Pen deliberatelymaintained silencein response to the allegations – a tactic some outlets dismissed as evidence of a weak defence, even questioning her credibility. Yet this quiet is far from a sign of weakness; it reflects a long-established approach that consistently shuns conventional manoeuvres in favour of an intentionally unpredictable stance.The origins of this strategy date back to 2011, when she set in motion the “de-demonisation” of the NR. This was not just an exercise in recalibrating the party’s image and rhetoric; it was a move to sever ties with the extremist legacy that had long marred her family’s name. Her rebranding transformed the Front National into the National Rally and charted a new course for the party.This process also involved a purge of party members who openly endorsed the Vichy regime – a purge so uncompromising that it resulted in the banishment of her own father,Jean-Marie Le Pen. By casting him aside as a cornerstone of her de-demonisation campaign, she demonstrated a readiness to make brutal sacrifices. Now, she may well have to repeat this tactic, sacrificing herself to clear the path for the rise ofthe NR’s prodigy, Jordan Bardella.At just 29 years old, Bardella embodies a generational shift that encapsulates the perils of a re-energised far right. His narrative infuses the party’s appeal with a contemporary flavour, resonating particularly withyoung men. His proficient use of social media platformssuch as TikTokhas not only mobilised the party’s base but also illustrated the evolving tactics of far-right organising in the digital age.Currentopinion pollsreveal that the NR is enjoying a notable surge in support. Now, with Marine Le Pen’s conviction, Bardella may well be holding a winning hand – includingthestrategic weaponisationof his mentor’s legal setback.This playbook has become alarmingly predictable. After the 6 January Capitol attack, Donald Trump dismissed his legal challenges as politically motivated witch-hunts, orchestrating a maddening comeback. (Asked on Mondayabout Le Pen’s conviction, Trump said it was a “very big deal” and “very much like” what had happened in his own country.) The same drama unfolds in Europe. In Romania, far-right populistCălin Georgescu’s futile appealagainst a ruling barring him from the presidential race barely dampened his supporters’ fervour; instead, they surged behind another far-right figure, George Simion, who nowleads in the polls.Of course, both cases are dwarfed by the exploits of Silvio Berlusconi, the maestro of political comebacks. The late Italian former prime minister faced a barrage of charges – from abuse of office and bribery to extortion andpaying for sex with an underage girl– yet in 2014 he managed tooverturn his conviction, casting his legal battles as nothing more than politically motivated persecution.Yesterday,Marine Le Pen followed suit, insisting that her prosecution is a “political decision” and “a denial of democracy”. This is how the far right operates: when courts deliver unfavourable verdicts, these outcomes are reframed as proof of an orchestrated conspiracy, while any favourable decision is lionised as an indisputable victory for democracy.How should we deal with this playbook? First, we must not reproduce Le Pen’s argument that her conviction was a political attack – especially notwithin the left, which should stand for dignity in these challenging democratic times. Defending her is indefensible; the courts exist to deliver justice, and no one is above the law.Second, Bardella’s meteoric rise in the polls demands a swift response from the French left – the only political force capable of mounting a robust ideological counterargument against hate, economic isolation and the promotion of white supremacy. NR clearly has a long-term plan centred on Bardella, and there’s little doubt that this strategy will resonate with voters in the wake of Le Pen’s conviction.This is a call to arms for the leftwing France Unbowed and its leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon. It must renew the party, diversify its ranks and invest in emerging talent that resonates with younger voters – mirroringthe approach of Die Linkein Germany – if it is to prevent the far right from advancing into Europe’s centre for the first time since the second world war.Given that Elon Muskhas tweetedseveral times in support of Le Pen, it is also crucial to recognise that the boundaries between global far-right movements are increasingly blurred, with their mobilisation tactics evolving rapidly. Democracies must confront this challenge head on and urgently unite against the far-right threat before it is too late.Georgios Samaras is assistant professor of public policy at the Policy Institute, King’s College LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We would not tolerate these conditions in other workplacesTue 1 Apr 2025 20.33 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 02.35 EDTShareI’ve been lucky. I’ve enjoyed a rewarding career in education, including almost 15 years as a principal in the Northern Territory and the ACT. I’ve worked with wonderful teachers and administrative staff, and shared in the successes of hundreds of young people and their families as they grow and graduate high school, going on to further study, employment and life adventures.I’ve also experienced verbal and physical abuse, aggression and violence from students and their carers, directed at me and my colleagues in the course of my work as a school leader. I once regarded these occasional events as part of the job, normal in our frontline occupation. I now think we have grown complacent about the levels of violence toward a predominantly female workforce that we would not tolerate in other workplaces. As the latest data from the Australian Catholic University’s (ACU) annual Principal Health, Safety and Wellbeing report, released this week, shows,things are getting worse for my profession.Labor accuses Dutton of copying Trump with suggestion children being ‘indoctrinated’ at schoolRead moreOur children and young people are learning to understand themselves and their place in the world, sometimes leading to conflict and inappropriate behaviour. Some students have needs that our schools are not set up to support. I’ve been sworn at and called all manner of offensive names, punched while breaking up a fight that would have endangered other students and staff had I not intervened, and assaulted with a paver by an ice-affected 16-year-old.Principals are responsible under various national, state and territory legislation for the safety of staff and students. To fulfil that responsibility, we have to make quick decisions at times that can put us in harm’s way. It can happen suddenly, for example, in the form of a two metre-tall tower of a truck driver dad who bursts into the school’s front office demanding access to his child’s classroom so that he can “kill” the child’s teacher. This occurred in one of my schools and, fortunately, I could confront and calm the man. He sat and cried in my office because he felt he was spending too much time away from home and couldn’t sufficiently support his daughter.I left my last school 18 months ago to become president of the Australian Secondary Principals’ Association, the national peak body representing all Australian public secondary school leaders. I spend much of my time listening to the experiences of my colleagues around the country and what I hear is both reassuring and depressing. Our principals are resilient and love the job but in an alarming number of cases it harms them.I am often asked what the causes of this growing violence in our schools might be. I can speculate about the influence of social media, of rising socioeconomic stress and the increase in mental health conditions in our community. Other factors may be an increasing expectation that schools can provide a highly personalised program for every child, though we are not realistically resourced to do it, or that our duty of care is endless, and we can solve society’s problems.Whatever the reasons, we need practical action as quickly as possible or we will lose principals, the teacher shortage will increase and our kids’ education will suffer. We need stronger reassurances from Peter Dutton of his commitment to maintaining full funding for the federal department of education that is now leading the necessary reform agenda through the hard-won Better FairerSchoolsAgreement. Resourcing, collaboration and continuity are key to avoid making things even worse for teachers and principals.The growing workload, stress and occupational violence facing principals are not limited to public schools; the ACU survey reports similar accounts from the independent and Catholic sectors. In April last year, my colleague Angela Falkenberg from the Australian Primary Principals Association and I highlighted the urgent need to address the wellbeing of school principals in a presentation to the Education Ministers Meeting in Perth.The western Melbourne teacher: ‘Hecs debt, that’s a big problem’Read moreWe proposed establishing an EMM-sponsored working group to develop effective strategies to address these challenges. Possible solutions include public media campaigns focused on respect and legislative measures to address inappropriate behaviour from parents and carers such as the Victorian School Community Safety Order. We should consider new, more flexible learning pathways and schooling structures, and provide support and resourcing for schools to employ psychologists, youth workers, occupational therapists and community liaison officers.No EMM working group has yet been established and now we have 14 years of worsening data from the ACU. To his credit, the federal education minister, Jason Clare, established the National Principals’ Reference Group after our presentation, representing principals and school leaders across all school sectors and levels of education in Australia. My colleagues and I are eager to see ongoing bipartisan support for this forum and a coordinated national approach to resume in earnest after the federal election.I loved being a principal and am proud to advocate for my colleagues who line up daily to serve their communities nationwide. Managing conflict and keeping our people safe may be part of the job. But if we are serious about our education system and the future of our country, we need practical help, support and genuine partnership from governments and our community to address rising violence against school leaders.Andy Mison is the president of the Australian Secondary Principals’ AssociationExplore more on these topicsAustralian educationOpinionSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

Why has he decided to make a musical of seedy, gutter-life classic Midnight Cowboy, a film he can’t bear?Wed 2 Apr 2025 10.44 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 12.24 EDTShareTroop into Eg White’s living room, past the bright, spacious kitchen and the yapping terriers (“Meet the unwelcoming committee!”), then descend into the snug basement studio with its underfloor heating and you will have reached the place where pop bangers are born: hits for Adele (Chasing Pavements),Will Young(Leave Right Now), Duffy (Warwick Avenue) and countless others. The Ivor Novello award-winning songwriter, born Francis White, sits in front of a desk cluttered with screens and consoles and thingamajigs. In T-shirt, jeans and trainers, he looks as lean as the neck of a Stratocaster. When he is in quizzical mode, as he very often is, four deep grooves appear on his forehead like the strings on a bass guitar.White’s newest project is the music for a stage version of Midnight Cowboy, the Oscar-winning 1969 buddy movie with Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman as deluded outsiders adrift in New York, adapted now byBryony Lavery. Most of its 15 songs – from sanguine ballads to Latin-tinged stompers – were composed not here in White’s west London home but on a family holiday to Colombia. For two hours each morning, while his wife and children were still in bed, he wrote on a cheap baritone ukulele, which he plucks off the wall from between rows of guitars to show me. “You can take it in the hand luggage,” he says cheerfully. “If your kid sits on it, which happened a few times, it lives.” Presumably he means the ukulele, not the kid.He finds the film too depressing – but wrote the songs as a favour for his wife’s sister’s husband’s cousin’s builderI had arrived expecting to hear tales of adolescent identification with Voight’s naive gigolo, or Hoffman’s grungy conman, but White turns out to have no affection for the film whatsoever. “Too depressing. Couldn’t bear it.” Many of his compositions for the show temper the dourness that put him off the film. New York Bus, a hymn to the Big Apple that features the line “I hear they’ve got a weakness for a refugee”, suggests Simon & Garfunkel at their antsiest.Listen to Eg White’s Don’t Give Up On Me Now, from Midnight Cowboy.“Interesting,” he says, in a way that suggests he disagrees entirely. “If there’s a smell to the thing, Brown Eyed Girl is where I was heading. The cast did it in rehearsal and I suddenly thought, ‘Christ, if we’re not careful, this is going to turn into Hair!’ So I’m going, ‘No, no – you need to be bad-tempered.’ Think Van Morrison. Think grumpy old cunt.”The commission came to White, somewhat implausibly, via his wife’s sister’s husband’s cousin’s builder, who decided after 50 years in construction that he wanted to produce a musical and ended up with the rights to Midnight Cowboy. Soon, White was sitting by the pool in Cartagena, on Colombia’s Caribbean coast, trying to evoke life in the gutters of late-1960s Manhattan. He arrived home with a suntan and a completed score. It all sounds remarkably … “Easy? We can go with easy. Absolutely free of trauma. Because you have the structure already. You’re moving the story forward.”Writing in character, too. That must be close to impossible when working with a pop star who has a persona to maintain: listeners might get the singer muddled up with the song? “Oh yeah. You’ll write some horrible, ugly character stuff and they’ll go, ‘I can’t sing this. I’m just not that much of a …’”View image in fullscreen‘Touched by God’ … Adele circa Chasing Pavements,  co-written by White.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAOlder musicians like character songs, he says, “whereas I work with young people.”Adelewas 17 when White first wrote with her. “I met her before she was the queen of the world. Before anyone. Her demo was touched by God. You don’t hear that every day: the playfulness, the accuracy, the language.”He plays down his own contribution. “If I’m feeling too full of myself, then I’ve probably stolen from the other person. Ultimately, they’re the one who’ll be sitting on top of the missile. All I know with Adele is it didn’t feel like being in the room with a 17-year-old. I’d try something and she’d say, ‘You might want to reconsider that.’ And she’d be right.” Chasing Pavements came about after White strummed “some very boring chords” while Adele sang over them. “Once she lit the fuse, it got explosive. Then it got good.”What would once have been a four-minute song has to fly in seven seconds on TikTokWhite had his own short-lived ride on the missile in the late 1980s, when he and his brother David were in the boyband Brother Beyond, fronted by heart-throb Nathan Moore. “Brother Beyond was good until it wasn’t,” he says. “Without being rude – no, I have to be rude – Nathan was a brilliant pop star but a terrible singer. Stock, Aitken and Waterman were famously brutal with him. I’d written a song called Here Come the Rockets, which I gave Nathan to sing. It was clear it wasn’t going to work. That’s when I went, ‘I’m out.’”He recorded the song himself in the early 1990s with Alice Temple, as the duo Eg and Alice. Around the same time, he began his producing career with two albums for indie rockers Kinky Machine. He was working so hard he neglected to have a debauched rock’n’roll lifestyle. “I’m old now,” he says. In fact, he is 58, but you take the point. “I write songs about having a spankingly amazing night out that ends in near-death by the side of the M25 at six in the morning. Things I never did and would love to have done. I was too busy making a living to sleep with millions of people.”View image in fullscreenGutter life … rehearsals for the Midnight Cowboy musical.Photograph: Pamela RaithHe grew up in London, the son of classical musicians. “BBC orchestras were being made redundant in the early 1980s. My dad was like, ‘Kids, this is dying. Run for the hills.’” A childhood pianist, violinist, flautist and double bass player, White had always been averse to pop music. But hearing Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now at the age of 11 was life-changing. Is it possible to say what struck him about it?“It’s more than possible,” he says, springing to his feet and cueing up the track. All at once, a cobwebbed anthem is re-invigorated by his running commentary. “The second chord’s unusual … This is a bit of timing fuckery here … Then a flat seven … His melody is great … Oh, statisticallythisnever happens … Double-fast … Wait …Wait… There’s no chorus on this song.” His jaw drops. The bass strings reappear on his forehead. “It’s got no chorus! It’s just three verses one after another!”That sort of commercial perversity is his sweet spot. It’s what he strives for. “You need it, otherwise you die creatively,” he says once the song ends. What’s perverse about Chasing Pavements? “Normally, when you’ve got a good chorus melody, you repeat it. And Adelechangesthe melody. Big fail.” What was his reaction when she did it? “‘Nooo!’” he shrieks, hands outstretched as if he is the passenger in a crashing car. “And the timings are all over the place. It goes three bars, not four. None of it is even slightly geometrical.” He gives a rueful sigh. “I should be doing more of that kind of thing. Less safer work. I could use more bravery.”View image in fullscreen‘It was good until it wasn’t’ … White, crouching in front, in the boyband Brother Beyond in 1989.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyLike his father, he is prone to talk as if he should run for the hills. “There was a five-year period from 2003 where I was writing what people wanted to release: slower songs which take longer to unfold and have more real instruments and aren’t about tightly controlled phrases and beautifully clean productions. There was a brief moment when that shit was flying, and thank God I made some money then. With the financial crash in 2008 came a fear about radio advertising. Tempos go up because you don’t want to lose workplace listenership. The sort of stuff I write is in abeyance now. What was once a four-minute song has to fly as a seven-second clip on TikTok.”I have the sensation of eavesdropping on an argument that has been raging in White’s head since long before I rang his doorbell today. “I think I’m blaming external stuff,” he decides finally. “When in fact I would do well to have more nerve, ‘Where are your guts, boy?’”Homophobic? Maybe. But at least Midnight Cowboy showed me gay men on screen | Ryan GilbeyRead moreAI is nipping at his heels, and it may be this that forces him to take the risks to which he is alluding. “AI is built on human output, and most human output in this area is not perverse. So I’m determined to head to the edges because that will be less vulnerable to attack.”Riding the missile, lighting the fuse, vulnerable to attack: White makes pop music sound like a health and safety nightmare. He makes it sound like war.Midnight Cowboy is atSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, London, from 4 April to 17 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreAdeleWill YoungMusicalsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Monaka runs a cafe in Tokyo called Monster Party, where people go dressed as characters from a subculture known astanganmen. Her brother is holding a picture of their mum’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 2 Apr 2025 10.09 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTShareMy personal projects have often focused on the topic of identity, so the world of cosplay immediately appealed to me. I knew nothing about it until I saw some photographs on Instagram and became interested in these people who spend their free time turning themselves into characters from manga, anime, movies and video games – or even into creations they’ve come up with by themselves.Italy’s biggest annual cosplay event is held in the region where I live, Tuscany. I started going and taking pictures, just on my phone at first, and that’s where I first approached cosplayers to ask if they’d like to help me with a project I had in mind. In the 1970s, John Olson took someportraits for Life magazineof musicians such as Frank Zappa and Elton John at home with their parents. They contrasted the individual identity of the rock stars and the social identity represented by their parents, and that seemed the right way to photograph cosplayers, too. I thought it was far more interesting to show them in a domestic setting, alongside people in everyday clothes, than in the environment of a fantasy-themed event.If you ask a cosplayer to make a picture, they’re happy. The problem was convincing the parentsIf you ask a cosplayer if you can take a picture, they’re always really happy. The problem is convincing their parents, a lot of whom think the hobby is a waste of time and money. Of the 200 or so cosplayers I’ve approached so far, at least half were unable to participate because their parents said no. But others recognised the passion their children have for this pursuit, and the artistry involved in making the costumes.Initially my plan was to take all the photographs with parents, but as the project went on I sometimes included different family members, depending on the cosplayer’s circumstances. For example, the photograph I took in Livorno, Tuscany, ofManuel posing as Spider-Manin his grandparents’ bedroom: his grandfather sits on the bed beside him while his grandmother uses her exercise bike in the background.C-3POs, Wonder Women and a trio of Alices: the stars of cosplay – in picturesRead moreJapan is the mecca of cosplay. It was born there at comic conventions in the 70s and 80s. That’s where I photographed Monaka, who you see here. The cyclops character she’s dressed as is part of a subculture calledtanganmen, which I think only started five or six years ago. A designer came up with this one-eyed mask which quickly spread in Tokyo, where Monaka runs a cafe called Monster Party. Customers dressed intanganmenmasks gather there – this costume is what she wears to work.The guy next to her is her brother, and the portrait he’s holding is of their mother, who died 12 years ago. I found it on a table in the house while we were setting up and, when I asked about it, Monaka told me her mother was the first person to take her to a cosplay event, when she was 20 years old.Another photograph I took in Tokyo shows Monaka’s close friendPitan in the bedroom of her tiny apartmentwith the three cats she describes as her family – her parents no longer live in the city. Pitan’s costume is a character she invented herself, a sort of doll with the face of a cat.Because the practice has been established for so long in Japan, many of the cosplayers I photographed were in their 30s, 40s and 50s. There were better costume-making materials available in Japan and Europe too, whereas a lot of the outfits I saw when I took the project to Kenya had more of a homemade feel. For example, a young woman called Brenda had created afemale version of the manga character Chainsaw Man, and I much preferred her cardboard chainsaws to the plastic, 3D-printed versions I saw Italian cosplayers wearing.Everyone involved in this series, which I calledThey Don’t Look Like Me, seemed to enjoy the process and it has been very satisfying to see both generations responding positively to the finished pictures. It’s an ongoing project reflecting a global phenomenon – next I want to move on to Latin America.View image in fullscreenNiccolò Rastrelli’s CVBorn:1977, FlorenceTrained:Fondazione Studio Marangoni, FlorenceInfluences:“Many sources, from fashion and documentary photographers to films and books.

That tune looks set to changeWed 2 Apr 2025 07.52 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Apr 2025 09.44 EDTShareHollywood’s musical biopic fever is, once again, in full swing. Buzz has never been louder for Sam Mendes’s ambitiousFab Four biopic– a quartet of films from the perspective of each Beatle – even with the release date still being three years away. Meanwhile, although Timothée Chalamet might not have taken home the Oscar for his lauded performance as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, pundits are already tipping The Bear’s Jeremy Allen White for next year’s prize forhis turn as Bruce Springsteenin the forthcoming Deliver Me From Nowhere.But amid thediscoursearound how much Paul Mescal may or may not look like McCartney and whether White can nail those gravelly vocals, two other recent biopic announcements – among the slate’s most exciting yet – risk being drowned out despite their considerable cultural significance.View image in fullscreen‘Godmother’ … Sister Rosetta Tharpe circa 1944.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesLast week,it was confirmedthat Zendaya will star as Ronnie Spector, the iconic lead singer of 60s girl group The Ronettes in the long-awaited biopic Be My Baby for A24, where she’ll also take on a producer role. “Ronnie, being able to know you is one of the greatest honors of my life” wrote Zendaya inan Instagram tributeafter the singer’s death in 2022. “Thank you for sharing your life with me … I hope to make you proud.” Barry Jenkins will direct the film, based on Spector’s 1990 memoir, in which her troubled relationship with the producer Phil Spector looms large.Also revealed is thatLizzo is set to playthe trailblazing gospel and blues musician Sister Rosetta Tharpe in a biopic for Amazon – finally bringing to the screen a pioneer as cinematically unsung as she has been in history. Tharpe’s innovative, electric guitar-strapped style was instrumental in defining the sound of American rock and influenced a generation of stars including Elvis, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Keith Richards and Johnny Cash. Lizzo will also produce the film which promises to give Tharpe’s legacy as the “godmother of Rock n Roll” its rightful due.“There were no auditions for Sister Rosetta Tharpe,” wrote Lizzo inan impassioned Instagram post. “Because this is a film I’ve been producing for years, fighting for her story to get told … This is my baby, my passion – because Rosetta deserves. The Godmother of Rock n Roll is in good hands.”Sure, these films finally getting the greenlight may be part of Hollywood’s ongoing obsession with the stories of musical titans. But they could deliver an overdue celebration of groundbreaking Black female artists who changed music profoundly, something beyond what Hollywood has offered up recently. It heralds a powerful and much-needed turn amid a parade of biopics dominated by widely celebrated white male artists whose legacies continue to endure.Explore more on these topicsBiopicsZendayaLizzoThe BeatlescommentShareReuse this content"

We go from light to dark and back again, from room to room, and constant shifts in tempo and register, swerving from one medium to another. Along the way, we keep meeting the artist. Atkins drawn in coloured pencil, pensive in profile. Atkins as half-man, half-spider, splayed across the paper. Here’s his naked foot, drawn monstrously huge, and a hand clenching. He’s the author of his own descriptive wall texts, a collector of lists and, most pungently of all, the digitally tweaked persona who appears and reappears in the various guises of his CGI-avatar. One of which, early on in the exhibition, is swallowed by a sinkhole, along with his Ikea-filled apartment, but not before we have discovered rather too much about the state of his mind and the grim things people get up to in the privacy of their homes.‘My brain reaches for morbidity’: inside the unsettling world (and 700 Post-it notes) of artist Ed AtkinsRead moreThere’s so muchstuffin Atkins’s art, so much weirdness and generosity, so much bleakness and humour. A curtain opens on an empty stage and things begin to fall from above. A bed, stepladders, books, cardboard boxes, an anchor on its chain, bricks, several large tuna, bones, scatter cushions, skulls. Things pile up, they bounce, they get crushed; other things twirl in freefall, freeze mid-air or swipe into digital oblivion. Even gravity has glitches. But the cartoon rain, the flashes of lightning and the fall of pixelated snow keep the action moving. As I watch, I hear a spooky voice say: “My proper name is death.”Where did that come from? I never did find out, in the hours and hours I spent here, among all the sound leakage, drifting from room to room. A lot gets subsumed along the way through Atkins’ exhibition. The pleading, reproachful eyes of a borzoi sighthound; the plaintive unaccompanied renditions of Randy Newman songs, and all that kerfuffling and crashing, the film about the sandwiches, and the quiet, nearly blank fields of the embroideries, with their tiny sewn words. And what of the young lad who runs endless circuits through a bucolic landscape, as though he’s trapped in an animated medieval manuscript? And now the 468 repetitions of the same note that Atkins plays on an upright piano, in his performance of Swiss composer Jürg Frey’s 2001 composition Klavierstück 2. It all adds up, but to what?Pungent … Ed Atkins at Tate BritainEncumbered by a Lycra motion-capture suit and gloves, and with an iPhone braced to his head to record and track his face and hands, Atkins sat at the piano to perform Frey’s spare, exacting composition. The version of Atkins on the screen, performing, is a largely faithful, nearly seemless digital representation of the artist. Homing in on his face, on fingers playing and lingering above the keyboard, on feet at the pedal, on his expression and his concentration, we see none of the gubbins that were used to record him. We hear his breaths and snufflings and quiet groans along with the music, and think we perceive the turbulence of the player’s emotions, and catch him counting time, although the being at the piano is a digital model, a not-quite-real apparition, in whose expression I imagine I see feeling. As the end credits scroll, we read that Atkins finished making this video “in great sadness”. His expression, in the small photograph that slides down the screen beneath the text seems to confirm this. But where and to whom or to what does that sadness belong, and is my own sadness, as a response to the music, or at least to the video, appropriate?View image in fullscreenIt all adds up … Pianowork 2 by Ed Atkins.Photograph: Ed Atkins/Cabinet Gallery, London; dépendance, Brussels; Galerie Isabella Bortolozzi, Berlin and Gladstone Gallery, New YorkHere he is again, talking to his mother on the phone. Their conversation is real enough, intimate and warm, though at odds with the slightly soiled, avuncular gameshow host appearance of the Ed Atkins projected before us (note the grubby spectacles, and the meaty hand that raises a glass that isn’t there to his lips). The scene is projected on to the exterior back wall of a cavernous and empty plywood box that fills most of the gallery. This guy’s an off-the-shelf digital stand-in for Atkins. Only his voice seems real. Another of the models for this scene, and for the entirely digital set (including the cigarette smouldering in an ashtray), is the famous last television interview with screenwriter and playwright Dennis Potter, recorded in 1994,two months before Potter’s death.If we get snagged up on all the references and the details – the wall texts, the embroideries, the posters and the postcards, the live TV giving us the news on Sky (luckily it is streaming on mute), we’ll never get to the end of it. You could spend days in here, lingering, moving on, backtracking, getting cloistered among the racks of opera-house costumes. I keep trying to find the thread, then losing it again. Which is all part of the pleasure of Atkins’ work. He also has a great capacity to surprise, to enmesh us and keep us rooted, even on a tiny scrap of silent film, a sequence from Dimitri Kirsanoff’s 1926 Ménilmontant, that Atkins has had colourised and added Foley sound to, so that we can finally hear the old man in the film chewing on his bit of bread, and the sausage he is paring with his knife, wordlessly passing scraps to the young, starving mother who has found herself beside him on the park bench. What a tender, almost real moment this is. For all its artifice, it is like touching a wound.View image in fullscreenLight to dark and back again … Children by Ed Atkins, 2020-ongoing.Photograph: Ed Atkins/Cabinet Gallery, London.Coming towards the end of the exhibition, Atkins’ most recent work, made with writer Steven Zultanski, jettisons the use of digital beings entirely. The video Nurses Come and Go, But None for Me is over two hours long. ActorsToby Jonesand Saskia Reeves play couple Peter and Claire. Claire ushers an audience of young people (these too may be actors) into a large, comfortable room where Peter reads Sick Notes, a diary kept by Atkins’s father, Philip, during the six months between his diagnosis with kidney cancer and his death in 2009. Enormously affecting, spirited, candid, a sometimes funny and frequently harrowing account of physical deterioration, Philip Atkins’ diary is leavened by his mental fortitude and stoicism. As we listen and watch, the camera drifts and alights too. Claire – whom I take as a surrogate for Atkins’ mother – sits apart, smoking in the corner. There’s Peter’s clumpy shoes, and his troubled expression as he turns the loose-leaf pages. The diary is upsetting for some members of the on-screen audience, and all the more affecting for being read aloud by Jones. Towards the end, following the text, his measured tones break into expletives and yelps and broken words. It is as if we have come to the limit of language.Note perfect: Ed Atkins’s daily Post-it drawings – in picturesRead moreJones the actor, playing Peter, also fully inhabits the role of Philip. After the reading is finished Peter and Claire play a game devised by Ed Atkins’ young daughter Hollis Pinky. Peter has now adopted a further persona, and lies on the floor, and Claire, taking the role Ed Atkins used to play in this once-private game, first pretends to be an ambulance, then some sort of doctor, who attempts miracle, fantasy cures for imaginary ills, games of coping and resuscitation, of childhood fears being allayed through play. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing. “I want everything I make to corpse,” writes the artist. Where is the real Ed Atkins? Where is the real anybody?

Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 and later recovered, after treatment with chemotherapy and trachea surgery that had reduced his ability to speak and breathe.Val Kilmer: an ethereally handsome actor who evolved into droll self-awareness | Peter BradshawRead moreKilmer died on Tuesday night in Los Angeles, surrounded by family and friends, Mercedes confirmed in an email to the Associated Press. He had been scheduled to appear on the red carpet at the Beverley Hills film festival that evening.The president of that film festival, Nino Simone, spoke of their shock at the news, particularly as Kilmer had only been confirmed to attend last weekend.Numerous actors and directors paid tribute to Kilmer on Wednesday. Writing on X, Cher said she would miss her “great friend”, who she called “funny, crazy and a pain in the ass”. Last year she told Howard Stern’s SiriusXM show she had been “madly in love” with him when they were romantically involved in the 1980s.Ron Howard said he was incredibly fortunate to collaborate with Kilmer, praising his “awesome range”, a sentiment echoed by Heat director Michael Mann. “I always marvelled at the range,” he said, “the brilliant variability within the powerful current of Val’s possessing and expressing character. After so many years of Val battling disease and maintaining his spirit, this is tremendously sad news.”Said Francis Ford Coppola on Instagram: “Val Kilmer was the most talented actor when in his High School, and that talent only grew greater throughout his life. He was a wonderful person to work with and a joy to know — I will always remember him.”“I thought he was a genius actor,” added his Bad Lieutenant co-star Nicolas Cage, “and I admired his commitment and sense of humour. He should have won the Oscar for The Doors.”Meanwhile te actorJosh Brolin wrote: “See ya, pal. I’m going to miss you. You were a smart, challenging, brave, uber-creative firecracker. There’s not a lot left of those. I hope to see you up there in the heavens when I eventually get there. Until then, amazing memories, lovely thoughts.”Born in Los Angeles in 1959, Kilmer was one of the youngest students ever admitted to the acting programme at the Juilliard School, aged 17. He started out as a stage actor and rose to prominence in the 1980s with his roles in movie comedies Top Secret! and Real Genius, before landing a role as Iceman in the 1986 box office smashTop Gun.With his star ascendant, he took the lead role in Ron Howard and George Lucas’s 1988 fantasy epic Willow, where he met his future wife – his co-star, Joanne Whalley, with whom he would have two children. The pair divorced in 1996.View image in fullscreenKilmer in The Doors.Photograph: Cinetext/Tristar/AllstarOliver Stone cast him as Jim Morrison in his biopic The Doors, and Kilmer also landed roles as Elvis Presley in True Romance and Doc Holliday in the western Tombstone. It was this performance that landed Kilmer the biggest role of his career, that of Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Forever. The film received mixed reviews but was a box office hit, and Kilmer became a huge star, able to demand millions of dollars for his roles.He did not return as the caped crusader for the next film in the series, Batman and Robin, and instead took roles as Simon Templar in a reboot of The Saint and oppositeMarlon Brandoin the poorly received The Island of Dr Moreau.After another box office disaster in 2000, Red Planet, Kilmer took roles in smaller films with a lower profile. In 2005 he was cast opposite Robert Downey Jr in Shane Black’s directorial debut, the crime comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang; in 2012 he starred ina one-man show Citizen Twain, in which he played the writer Mark Twain; and in 2017 he appeared briefly in Terrence Malick’s music-industry drama Song to Song. He returned to the Iceman role in 2022’s Top Gun: Maverick, in which his character has become the commander of the US Pacific fleet, with most of his lines delivered by being typed out on a phone.2:09A look back at some of Val Kilmer's most prominent roles – videoKilmer was well known for falling out with his directors and castmates on set.Joel Schumacher, who directed him in Batman Forever, said: “I pray I don’t work with [Kilmer] again … we had two weeks where he did not speak to me, but it was bliss.” Marlon Brando, his co-star in The Island of Dr Moreau, reportedly told him:“You are confusing your talent with the size of your paycheck”, while that film’s director, John Frankenheimer,was quoted as saying: “I don’t like Val Kilmer, I don’t like his work ethic and I don’t want to be associated with him ever again.”However, despite the feuds, his ability was respected. Even Schumacherlater said he considered Kilmer to have been the best Batman, while Irwin Winkler – Kilmer’s director on At First Sight – described working with him as a “wonderful experience”. “Some people expect an actor to be like a wooden Indian, to do what he’s told and never open his mouth,”Winkler added. “But Val has lots of great ideas and he should be listened to.”View image in fullscreenKilmer and Cruise in the original Top Gun.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyKilmer took part in Suzuki Method training; while filming Tombstone, he filled his bed with ice to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis, and while playing The Doors frontman, he wore leather pants all the time and asked his castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison.“I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed,” Kilmer said in Val, the 2021 documentary about his life and career. “And I am blessed.”View image in fullscreenKilmer and Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick (2022)Photograph: ParamountIn his later years, Kilmer became more engaged in politics, and said in 2009 thathe was considering running to be governor of New Mexico, where he lived.

The yellow alien from Alexis Deacon’s popular picture book now crash-lands in a comical show for children aged three to seven. Director Debbie Hannan’s adaptation often forgoes the contemplative grace of the original and whips the audience into chants for the befuddled, far-from-home heroine. Bee-gu! Bee-gu!The themes of curiosity, care and found family remain intact. A cuddly looking Beegu (movement and puppetry direction from Laura Cubitt) is principally controlled by Emma MacLennan, who also voices the alien’s inquisitive chatter. During her odyssey on Earth, Beegu is ignored and insulted by busy grownups (“bit early for a Halloween costume,” sneers one) but warmly welcomed by some friendly schoolchildren. On the Unicorn’s main stage you might think this would lead to some extravagant circus skills but their games, rendered in slow motion, instead have a simplicity that young audiences will recognise from their own playground. The same goes for the cheerleading routine that involves a litter of fluffy puppies whizzing through the air.View image in fullscreenPuppy love … Beegu at the Unicorn theatre, London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThere is amiable audience interaction from three other performers, Lucy Havard, Lawrence Hodgson-Mullings and Aryana Ramkhalawon, who rattle through a range of supporting roles. The use of Teletubbies-style sun and moon characters, with projected faces, emphasises the message about looking out for one another but their rather solemn narrative is often superfluous. With a skyline of swerving apartment blocks on wheels, Jean Chan’s designs honour the spareness of the book. Chan and lighting designer Will Monks deliver a luminous scene in which Beegu plays music on the playground’s railings, wonderfully accompanied by Deanna H Choi’s compositions. The withering teacher wearing cat-eye glasses becomes a 10ft tall terror.Beegu is principally an observer (despite all that chatter, she has no visible mouth) and puppet designer Jonathan Saville has done well to make her this sympathetic. At 50 minutes, the story never feels drawn out and Beegu’s meet and greet session with the audience proves the book’s point that children have a gift for forming friendships.At theUnicorn theatre, London, until 4 May.Explore more on these topicsTheatreChildren's theatreChildren's books: 7 and underUnicorn theatreChildren and teenagersreviewsShareReuse this content"

TheNintendo Switch2 will launch on 5 June at a retail price of £395.99 for the basic package and £429.99 bundled with Mario Kart World.As expected, the screen is now larger, measuring 7.9 inches and offers double the pixels of the previous display, in 1080p resolution. It also supports up to 120 frames per second for smooth animation, as well as high dynamic range lighting for better colour contrast, while the console remains the same thickness as its predecessor. The dock allows connection to a TV with up to 4K resolution supported.The redesigned Joy-Con 2 controllers now connect to the console magnetically. The SL and SR buttons are larger to make it more comfortable to use the Joy-Cons as indepedent controllers. Each one can also be used as a mouse, with a rollerball for precise movement. This feature was illustrated with a wheelchair basketball game, Drag X Drive, in which the two Joy-Cons are used to push and steer the wheels.The announcement live stream began with a trailer for launch title Mario Kart World, a new entry in the karting series featuring stunningly detailed circuits and an open world map. Races take place in different regions around the planet, while players are free to go off-road while racing.View image in fullscreenNintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoAlso announced was Legend of Zelda Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, a prequel to Tears of the Kingdom coming this winter. Aerial racer Kirby Air Riders and a new Donkey Kong adventure, Donkey Kong Bananza, were also revealed, the latter arriving on 17 July.Several third-party titles were introduced throughout the hour-long stream. These included a new title from Dark Souls creator, From Software – The DuskBloods – a dark adventure filled with spectral warriors and ferocious dinosaurs; it’s out in 2026. Expected for launch or shortly after are Elden Ring Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Street Fighter 6 and Hitman World of Assassination. Hitman developer Io Interactive also revealed the development of a new James Bond game for the console.Other technical details were also discussed. Switch 2’s built-in speakers have been improved, with 3D audio supported. The new stand offers more sturdy support with a variety of viewing angles. Nintendo’s online network,NintendoSwitch Online, will offer a range of new downloadable retro games from GameCube and other systems, including Legend of Zelda Wind Waker and Soulcalibur II. A reproduction GameCube controller will be available to purchase alongside the Switch 2 launch.Like its predecessor, Switch 2 is a hybrid system, allowing users to play games on its built-in screen or on a TV, and users will be able to alternate between the two. The machine also offers full backwards compatibility with most original Switch games. Switch 2 updated games will also offer upgraded visuals. Launching soon after the console, the party game Super Mario Jamboree: Nintendo Switch 2 edition offers mouse controls, audio recognition, camera support and better rumble effects. Legend of Zelda Breath of The Wild: Nintendo Switch 2 edition features higher resolution visuals and new gameplay features, including an in-game smartphone-style map app. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Pokémon Legends and Kirby and the Forgotten Land will also get Switch 2 editions.

The mic in the console recognises your voice, filtering out ambient sounds for clear comms. Players can share their game screens with others in the chat even if everyone is playing different games. A Nintendo Switch 2 camera, available from launch, connects to the console allowing video chat while playing. A new GameShare feature will allow users to share a single game with up to three other players who can take part using their own Switch 2 machines.The original Switch was launched in March 2017 and went on to become the company’s most successful home console, selling more than 150m units including its later Switch Lite and Switch OLED editions. While Switch 2 remains technically behind the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, Nintendo has long competed on innovation and game quality rather than specifications. With a broader games lineup than the original machine, more advanced visuals and a more intuitive design for its Joy-Con controllers, this was a strong introduction.“You’ll have to wait just a little bit longer for launch,” said Switch 2 design director Takuhiro Dohta at the close of the live stream.

But, having written the script, Tarantino will hand directing duties to David Fincher,according to a report in the Playlistand subsequentlyconfirmed by Deadline.In Tarantino’s 2019 alternative-history drama about the Manson “family” and Sharon Tate, Pitt starred as stunt performer Cliff Booth opposite Leonardo DiCaprio (as washed-up actor Rick Dalton) and Margot Robbie (as Tate). While no plot details of the new project have been officially announced,the Hollywood Reporter is sayingit will be “derivative” of the original, rather than a sequel. Tarantino published a “novelisation” of the film in 2021, which included further details of Booth’s backstory and life episodes.Tarantino is also believed to have decided against directing the film, and allowed Pitt to take the script to Fincher, with whom he has had a long working relationship, including starring in Fincher’s early films Seven, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. While Tarantino is now renowned as a director, he sold scripts earlier in his career, notably True Romance (directed by Tony Scott) and Natural Born Killers (directed by Oliver Stone).In another departure from the originalOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood, the project will not be produced by Sony Pictures but has been acquired by Netflix, with whom Fincher has made two feature films (Mank and The Killer) and several TV series (including House of Cards, Mindhunter and Voir).It is not clear whether the project is related to Tarantino’sscrapped “final” movie The Movie Critic, in which Booth’s character was rumoured to have appeared. It is also unclear if the new script makes room for appearances by DiCaprio and Robbie.Explore more on these topicsFilmBrad PittQuentin TarantinoDavid FincherOnce Upon a Time in HollywoodNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

I was in France at the weekend to check out theParis Noir exhibitionat the Pompidou Centre, an odyssey through the generations of Black artists from across the world who found a complicated sanctuary in the city. This was supplemented with a walking tour on the life of the artist Beauford Delaney, guided by the companyEntrée to Black Paris, and finished off with a mind-blowingly delicious Senegalese dinner. Yes, I’m trying to make you jealous.In depth: A voyage to Paris NoirView image in fullscreenParis Noir features the work of 150 artists of African heritage.Photograph: Luc Castel/Getty ImagesYou’re invited intoParis Noirby the frank, sobering gaze of its lead exhibition image: a self-portrait by the South African artistGerard Sekotocompleted in 1947. A modernist, expressionist work with bold, contrasting colours seeming to convey unease, reflection and solemnity, Sekoto painted it days before travelling to London as a self-imposed political exile from South Africa. That year, he would arrive in Paris where he faced difficult living conditions,finding employment as a jazz pianistand singer of South African melodies and Negro spirituals at the nightclub l’Échelle de Jacob (Jacob’s ladder).Of the 150 Black artists across 350 works exhibited, many of them have stories like Sekoto’s – coming from the US, Caribbean, South America andAfricato find an artistic refuge in Paris. The scope of the exhibition is expansive, an excavation of artistic movements from Afro-Atlantic surrealism to Parisian syncretism. There’s paraphernalia from Présence Africaine, the pan-African culture magazine founded by the Senegalese writer and editor Alioune Diop in the 1940s (to which Sekoto contributed), theological meditations in the Ivorian sculptor Christian Lattier’s 1957 work Le Christ, and subversions of US racial stereotypes in advertising and comics abstracted into a collage by the French-Haitian artist Hervé Télémaque.What emerges from this vast collection is a beautiful sense of the Black Atlantic. Of artists and writers and thinkers pouring in from across the globe, finding a haven in which aesthetic expressions, debates and dialogues were forged in a world contending with decolonisation through pro-independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean as well as western civil rights struggles. They often documented these times: Bob Thompson depicted US lynchings and the violent quashing of civil rights protests; Sekoto covered the tragic revolutionaries in Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia).View image in fullscreenA detail from The Struggle, 1963, by Bob Thompson.Photograph: Courtesy of the Michael Rosenfeld GalleryBut political art was not only of the world outside France. In May 1967, in response to a racist attack, riots broke out in Guadeloupe, a Caribbean island that morphed from a colony to an overseas department. Protesters wereviolently suppressed by French police, who opened fire on striking workers in the economic capital, Pointe-à-Pitre. In 1975, the French Guianese artist José Legrand painted a photorealistic diptych of a scene from the demonstrations.In this Parisian Black Atlantic, the refining of method and a collaborative, artistic corpus flourish. Networks and friendships are formed. Black artists enter one another’s orbits and are moved to create even greater works. In the 1990s, the Senegalese artist As M’Bengue created a visual language in his paintings, with its graffiti, graphic art and anti-capitalist social criticism, inspired by the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, whom he had met inParisin 1988. Equally, the abstract, impressionist works of Ed Clark, which includes an untitled painting of three bold strokes created by a “big sweep” technique, are inspired by the works of his friend Beauford Delaney.If Sekoto is the face of the Paris Noir exhibition, then Delaney is its beating heart. The first piece in your line of sight when you enter the show is his 1968 painting Street Scene (Paris), a sunny, hazy vision of the city through thick, swirling yellow brushstrokes applied using his signature impasto technique, reminiscent of the style of Vincent van Gogh. Tennessee-born Delaney features in all corners of the exhibition, his work relevant to discussions of abstraction, representation, political resistance and portraiture.View image in fullscreenStreet Scene (Paris), painted by Delaney in 1968, © Estate of Beauford Delaney.Photograph: Centre Pompidou/Joseph BanderetDelaney’s life was fascinating but tragic, as I learn from Monique Y Wells ofEntrée to Black Paris, which provides guided walking tours of Black Parisian history, culture and contemporary life (and which I cannot recommend enough). Wells takes me on a stroll through Montparnasse, a neighbourhood steeped in history.As Wells tells me, Henry Ossawa Tanner, often described as the first famous African American painter, came to live in Paris in the late 19th century, which became a draw for other African American artists to arrive. After the second world war, US legislation provided a package of benefits including education funding, low-interest loans and low-cost mortgages for returning veterans to readjust to civilian life and access opportunities. As such, Montparnasse received a wave of African Americans travelling to Paris to attend art schools. Though Delaney was not a veteran, it was this pre-established enclave that he was welcomed into when he moved to Paris on the invitation of his friend James Baldwin in 1953.Wells tells me that Montparnasse was “in effect a slum” with ramshackle properties – meaning that poor artists such as Delaney could afford to live and create there. There were a number ofbouillons, inexpensive restaurants, that Delaney would frequent, such as the Les Mille Colonnes. Wells also takes me to the site of La Bohème, a former club exclusively for white GIs who had imposed their racist attitudes on to post-second world war French proprietors. It was eventually taken over by Buttercup Powell, the girlfriend of the musician Bud Powell, who transformed the premises into Buttercup’s Chicken Shack - a space where musicians and artists could eat cheaply, and where the Trinidadian jazz pianist Hazel Scott played.In the Paris Noir exhibition, the affectionate relationship between Delaney and Baldwin is honoured. As Black gay men, with Delaneystruggling with acceptance of his sexuality, their friendship was especially important in light of the hardships and social pressures they faced. Next to a Delaney painting of Baldwin is a quote by the Giovanni’s Room author: “I learned about light from Beauford Delaney: the light contained in everything, in every surface, in every face.” Delaney created more than a dozen works featuring or inspired by Baldwin, presenting him in different modes – from the majestic intellectual thinker to the compassionate source of warmth and intimacy he had come to know so well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His textures seem to capture sound through image: he uses yellow impasto brushes to paint the contralto and civil rights figure Marian Anderson, reminiscent of Byzantine iconography. As the exhibition text reads, the portrait “vibrates like a strange music”.The tragic details of the artist’s life that I learned on the walking tour added a poignancy to his works. As Wells tells me, Delaney lived in poverty and struggled with mental illness for much of his life. He spent the final years before his death in 1975 in hospital “for the insane” .Much like Delaney is threaded throughout the exhibition, he is also felt everywhere in this corner of Paris. There are numerous plaques for residences and restaurants he frequented, and so many cafés he would sit outside for hours, people watching and doodling - Le Dôme, La Select, La Coupole. At the end of the weekend I’m left with a sense that Paris, as a crossroads for the meeting of Black artists and cultures, has a strong claim for being one of the great Black diasporic cities – something Monique Wells tells me is under-discovered, and continues to surprise people.I finished my time in the French capital with a visit toWaly-Fay restaurant, which serves traditional Senegalese cuisine, and ate one of the best meals of my life – fish pèpè soup, suya skewers breaded in cassava flour and chicken yassa, washed down with a hibiscus drink. I wondered about the Black artists of today who come through here, making plans for radical work and sharing ideas over incredible food.Paris Noiris at the Pompidou Centre until 30 June.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsParisThe Long WaveExhibitionsFranceArtPaintingAfricanewslettersShareReuse this content"

It began informally in 1999 before becoming a nonprofit in 2006. Each year, tens of thousands signed up to the organisation’s flagship programme.On Monday, NaNoWriMo announced its closure to community members via email. A 27-minuteYouTube videoposted the same day by the organisation’s interim executive director Kilby Blades explained that it had to close due to ongoing financial problems, which were compounded by reputational damage.In November 2023, several community members complained to the nonprofit’s board, Blades said. They believed that staff had mishandled accusations made in May 2023 that a NaNoWriMo forum moderator was grooming children on a different website.The moderator was eventually removed, though this was for unrelated code of conduct violations and occurred “many weeks” after the initial complaints. In the wake of this, community members came forward with other complaints related to child safety on the NaNoWriMo sites.‘Don’t start a sex scene when your mother-in-law is visiting’: how I wrote a novel in a monthRead moreThe organisation was also widely criticised last year over a statement on the use of artificial intelligence in creative writing. After stating that it did not support or explicitly condemn any approach to writing, including the use of AI, it said that the “categorical condemnation of artificial intelligencehas classist and ableist undertones”.It went on to say that “not all writers have the financial ability to hire humans to help at certain phases of their writing”, and that “not all brains have same abilities … There is a wealth of reasons why individuals can’t ‘see’ the issues in their writing without help.”Fantasy author CL Polksaid at the timethat “NaNo is basically asserting that disabled people don’t have what it takes to create art when they trot out the lie that scorning AI is ableist”.Though the AI controversy received widespread press coverage, Blades’ video primarily focused on the child safety concerns. She said that NaNoWriMo’s position on AI had been covered “frankly so inaccurately”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

NaNoWriMo will keep its websites live for “as long as possible” so that “people can take what they want from their accounts”, but did not specify a date when the sites would shut down.“We hold no belief that people will stop writing 50,000 words in November,” read Monday’s email. “Many alternatives to NaNoWriMo popped up this year, and people did find each other. In so many ways, it’s easier than it was when NaNoWriMo began in 1999 to find your writing tribe online.”Explore more on these topicsBooksCreative writingFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

When I first read it, I got to about five scenes in and thought, it can’t keep up like this but it does.”View image in fullscreenOwain & Henry will open in November next year.Photograph: Welsh National TheatreGlyndŵr led a rebellion against the English crown in the 15th century and remains a hugely revered figure inWales.Sheen said: “It’s not just a historical piece, it speaks to now, who we are, where we’ve come from, why we struggle. Why is Wales behind in so many things, why is it so easy to cut away at our culture? Did we never have the same aspiration to build our nations that other countries have? This play’s about that.”The issue of independence is bound to arise. Sheen said:“My position is that it’s really good to talk about it and explore it;my worry is that in Wales discussion about independence and related issues gets shut down. The platforms to discuss that at a national level are so meagre, so it’s great that in our first year we’re putting front and centre who we are and who we could have been.”The play is to open at theWales Millennium Centre in Cardiffin November next year . “Playing the Welsh prince on one of Europe’s biggest stages in our capital city will, I hope, be a defining moment for us as a people, and a culture,” said Sheen, whose famous roles have includedTony BlairandHenry V.Sheen will also take the lead in a second show from Welsh National Theatre, a version ofThornton Wilder’s play Our Town, which will be set in a small Welsh community rather than an American one.It will open in Swansea in January 2026 before heading to Llandudno and Mold in north Wales, then on to Kingston upon Thames, south-west London. The Doctor Who show runnerRussell T Davieswill be a creative associate on the play.TheWelsh National Theatrecame into being afterNational Theatre Wales announced it had “ceased to exist”following the loss of its Arts Council of Wales funding. It has evolved intoTeam(theatre, education, arts, music), focusing on grassroots work.Arts Council of Waleshas confirmed transition funding to help the new theatre develop its structures and vision.Owain and Henry is co-produced with Wales Millennium Centre and Our Town with the RoseTheatrein Kingston Upon Thames.As well as announcing the first new productions on Wednesday, the theatre announced it was commissioning plays from writers includingAzuka Oforka.It is looking at establishing “a creative engine room” in Wales and a scouting network that will search for new talent.Sheen said: “Growing up in Port Talbot, playing football on a pitch next to the A48, I always knew there was a chance that a scout might be watching. I want every youngster, amateur and professional performing or working behind the scenes in Wales to have that same potential pathway to the creative top flight.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreWalesMichael SheennewsShareReuse this content"

These incidents have been credited to vague or unspecified visa issues, but have frequently affected individuals who have criticised the Trump administration either publicly or in messages on their phone read by immigration officers.French scientist denied US entry after phone messages critical of Trump foundRead more“When I go to play music in Europe, if I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,” Young wrote. “That is happening all the time now. Countries have new advice for those returning to America.”Young will tour across Europe in June and July – his first shows on the continent in six years – before returning to the US in August.“If I come back from Europe and am barred, can’t play my USA tour, all of the folks who bought tickets will not be able to come to a concert by me,” he wrote. “That’s right folks. If you say anything bad about Trump or his administration, you may be barred from re-entering USA if you are Canadian. If you are a dual citizen like me, who knows? We’ll all find that out together.”Young has a long history of protesting against Trump. In 2015, he said the then-presidential candidate was “not authorised” to use his track Rockin’ In the Free World during a campaign launch – and laterfiled a lawsuitto prevent Trump from using his music.“Imagine what it feels like to hear Rockin’ in the Free World after this president speaks, like it is his theme song,” he wrote at the time. “I did not write it for that.”After Young became a US citizen in 2020, during Trump’s first term, he penned an open letter calling the president “a disgrace to my country”.He doubled down on his website, writing: “If the fact that I think Donald Trump is the worst president in the history of our great country could stop me from coming back, what does that say for Freedom? … Remember Freedom of Speech?”In recent weeks, theBritish punk band UK Subsand aFrench scientisthave been detained and denied entry to the US; both parties had previously expressed criticism of the Trump administration.

Denmark and Finland have urged cautionto trans and non-binary travellers, Germany has emphasised that a visa or entry waiver does not guarantee entry to the US, andthe UKappears to have revisited their US travel advisory, advising that anyone found breaking US entry rules could face arrest or detention.On Tuesday, Young rallied against what he saw as “spineless” acts of enforcement.“It seems that those who speak out freely with their own opinions are now vulnerable to a non-existent Trump law,” he wrote, “that makes it possible for you to go to jail or be detained, punished in some way for not showing allegiance to what?”Young concluded by invoking the pledge of allegiance. “One country, indivisible, with Liberty and Freedom for all,” he said. “Remember that?

They will be seen alongside the first commission for a UK company from choreographic duo Paul Lightfoot and Sol León, premieres from Wayne McGregor and Cathy Marston and a new ballet based on Christopher Isherwood’s A Single Man, with live music by John Grant.“It’s about working with new voices, looking for what we haven’t experienced and what’s important to see,” said artistic director Kevin O’Hare about what will be his 14th season in charge of the company.It will be the first time a UK company has performed the work of Justin Peck, the most significant choreographer to emerge in American ballet this century, and resident choreographer at New York City Ballet. O’Hare has chosen Peck’s 2014 piece Everywhere We Go, set to a full orchestral score by singer songwriterSufjan Stevens. “It’s big and bold, it’s got that New York energy,” said O’Hare. “The music’s great, it’s really cinematic. I can imagine it working really well in this house.”Acclaimed choreographer Khan, whose work blends contemporary and Indian classical dance, and who had a hit withhis version of Giselle for English National Ballet, will create a full-length ballet based on Alexander Pushkin’s novel Eugene Onegin, entitled Carnage and the Divine, reflecting on unrequited love. He is working with a small cast including principal dancer Francesca Hayward.Continuing the theme of bringing acclaimed and established artists to theRoyal Balletand Opera for the first time, there will be a debut from choreographic duo Paul Lightfoot and Sol Léon. Englishman Lightfoot trained at the Royal Ballet School but made his career at Nederlands Dans Theater in The Hague, where he and Léon created more than 50 works and led the company from 2011-2020. “It seems unbelievable that he’s never worked with any British company, someone of his standing and artistry,” said O’Hare. Lightfoot and Léon will remount Standby, turning a film made during the pandemic into a stage work for the Royal Ballet.Elsewhere in the season, there will be a new one-act work from Wayne McGregor, along with a 10th anniversary revival ofWoolf Works, based on the life and work of Virginia Woolf. Cathy Marston follows the success of her ballet The Cellist with a new abstract one-act ballet, set to Benjamin Britten’s Violin Concerto.Already announced as part of Manchester international festival, A Single Man will be performed at the Linbury theatre. Based on the Isherwood story that was turned into a film by Tom Ford (starring Colin Firth and Julianne Moore) the ballet is being made by former Royal Ballet dancer Jonathan Watkins, with much-loved ex-principalEdward Watsonreturning to the stage, alongside dancer Jonathan Goddard and singer-songwriter John Grant.A highlight for ballet geeks and fans of avant garde music alike is the revival ofGlen Tetley’s 1962 ballet Pierrot Lunaire, set to Arnold Schoenberg’s 1912 song cycle of the same name. Famously danced by Rudolf Nureyev in the 1970s, this revival marks the centenary of American choreographer Tetley’s birth in 1926.Alongside new works there will be the return of popular ballets old and new on the Royal Opera House main stage, includingChristopher Wheeldon’s Like Water for Chocolate. The Linbury theatre will host visiting companies includingJoburg Ballet, performing Salomé by Dada Masilo, the pioneering South African choreographer whodied last year aged 39.Explore more on these topicsRoyal BalletDanceBalletAkram KhanSufjan StevensWayne McGregorChristopher IsherwoodnewsShareReuse this content"

The director and translator stagedan impeccable revivalof Eugène Ionesco’s The Chairs three years ago at the Almeida, complete with the masterstroke casting of husband-and-wife duo Kathryn Hunter andthe late Marcello Magni.Now comes his version of Ionesco’s magnum opus about the dangers of conformity. This might or might not be set in Ionesco’s provincial French town in which Berenger (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) becomes the hapless witness of a malaise in which humans are turning into rhinoceroses. It is dismally timely in a world of rising rightwing authoritarianism, with its critique of passivity in the face of barbarism and herd-like conformity.But where The Chairs nailed Ionesco’s balance between meta-comedy and existentialist dread, this production is not as clever – or rather, it is too clever, teeming with good ideas, but slack in pace and tone.Its look suggests a laboratory experiment, perhaps sending up the logician of the play whose syllogistic reasoning is perversely employed to impede truth. Most of the cast emerge as a lineup of scientists, one of whom calls himself the “Provocateur” (Paul Hunter) and narrates stage instructions archly.View image in fullscreenTricky … Anoushka Lucas and Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù in Rhinoceros.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe production encapsulates the spirit of Ionesco’s avant-gardism: anti-theatrical, always aware of its construction, and enlisting audience participation from the off, but the mechanics of the storytelling distract from the story itself.Our world is tucked into Ionesco’s (with mentions of Gary Lineker, fomo and fake news) but the clinical white set designed by Ana Inés Jabares-Pita allows the audience to project meaning. The danger is that this results in vagueness or abstraction and the play becomes a showcase of form alone.The drama plays out like improv for a while, with actors sometimes raising eyebrows or performing narrated scenarios wryly. Berenger is the only straight man, bewildered but also emphatically playing a part, like the others. Dìrísù deliberately stays at a remove, a blank of a character, but the distancing is so great that you never feel the pervading menace and fear in this town.The audience becomes the animal herd outside; some are given kazoos and instructed to blow every time the rhinoceroses trumpet their growing presence. It is a pantomime sound, absurdist yet not unsettling.View image in fullscreenLab experiment … Rhinoceros at the Almeida, London.Photograph: Marc BrennerStill, there are delightful moments of silliness and some lovely clowning, with Hayley Carmichael and Hunter standing out in a cast that juggles multiple roles. Foley sounds are created along the sides of the stage to the miming of invisible props and furniture, which extend the idea of audience participation to actively imagining a scene. A superb touch comes with a cafe table built out of a tray and tablecloth held by character. An over-active photocopier in the newspaper office scene is superbly conjured with light, sound and mime.But the play is too stretched and the slowness undercuts the sense of stampeding alarm. The transformation of Berenger’s friend, Jean (Joshua McGuire, robust), into a rhinoceros brings high-pitched hysteria and comedy yet without ruffling enough feathers. The unravelling of Berenger’s office crush, Daisy (Anoushka Lucas), holds greater weight. But the switch to dread never comes, despite the projected close-ups and ominous music.It is a production that has all of Elerian’s signature intelligence and playful imagination but is ultimately a reminder of how tricky a play this is, and how form can so easily eclipse content.At theAlmeida, London, until 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreEugène IonescoAlmeida theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t that there was anything particularly original about the doctor’s motives or methods: in January 1910 he slipped poison into his wife’s bedtime drink so that he could marry his secretary instead. Rather, it was the way that Crippen was caught that turned this run-of-the-mill suburban love triangle into an international cause célèbre.Realising that it would only be a matter of time before his wife’s dismembered remains were discovered in the cellar of the marital home in north London, Crippen and his secretary Ethel Le Neve fled to Canada in disguise. Such was the media hoopla surrounding the case that the sharp-eyed captain of the SS Montrose quickly spotted the runaway lovers among his passengers. This was despite their unconvincing cover story of being “father and son” (the hand-holding and kissing gave the game away). Using the ship’s brand-new Marconi wireless, Capt Andrew Kendall alerted the British authorities that he had the infamous fugitives in his sight. Within hours, Insp Dew of Scotland Yard had boarded a faster ship from Liverpool with the intention of reaching Newfoundland first, so that he would be ready to arrest Dr Crippen and his companion when they made landfall. To a fascinated public, following the unfolding drama in the newspapers, it was as if time travel were being invented before their very eyes.Hallie Rubenhold has form when it comes to interrogating the cliches of “classic” true crime. Her previous book,The Five, dealt with the hoary old case of Jack the Ripper but told it from his victims’ point of view, transforming them into complex subjects with histories, hopes and frailties of their own. Here she does something similar with Cora Crippen, who has been repeatedly written off as a silly, slatternly floozy who harboured ambitions of being on the stage when she should have been busy at home getting the doctor his dinner. Even Capt Kendall, who can’t possibly have met her, described Cora Crippen confidently in his memoirs as “a flashy, faithless shrew, loud-voiced, vulgar and florid”.In the place of this preposterous caricature, Rubenhold shows us Cora, whose stage name was Belle Elmore, as an artist who loved both the creative and social aspects of stage performance. When her own singing career faltered, she threw herself into her role as treasurer of the Music Hall Ladies’ Guild, which campaigned vigorously for better working conditions and pensions for its members. After her disappearance, it was Cora’s guild sisters who went to the police with their suspicions. At the subsequent Old Bailey trial, these singers, dancers and mime artists were called to identify the bits of fabric and strands of hair that had been found mixed up with the putrid remains in the basement of 39 Hilldrop Crescent. Cora’s head was never discovered, probably because Crippen had dumped it in the nearby canal, which allowed the defence to suggest that it must be some other woman, or even man, who was in bits in his basement. Sensibly, the jury took only 27 minutes to find Crippen guilty. Le Neve, though tried as his accomplice, got off and spent the rest of her life in tight-lipped anonymity.The Crippen case has been written about countless times before, but Rubenhold’s intention here is to divert attention away from the doctor (who, strictly speaking, was less a bona fide doctor than a pedlar of quack nostrums masquerading as homeopathic remedies) and put Cora back at the centre of the story. It is no accident that she, bold and magnificent, rather than mild and mousy Crippen, looks out from the cover of this book. If you strip away the newfangled elements of the case – the Marconi radio, the high-speed chase across the Atlantic, the saturated media coverage – what you are left with is the story of a woman who lost her life for no other reason than a man wanted her out of the way. Femicide, in other words, and as old as time itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

These are groups of young men, as secretive and loyal to each other as Freemasons, who (illegally) build and release huge decorated balloons in cities, from where they can travel hundreds of miles. Why? As kind of graffiti, or a community self-expression, or situationist artform, or just a subversive gesture of pure joie de vivre that does not need or admit of any explanation.‘We love the adrenaline’: Brazil’s illegal hot-air ballooning sceneRead moreThebaloeirosare harassed by the police, on the ostensible grounds that they are part of gang culture, and the authorities encourage local people to inform on those they suspect of building and transporting a balloon. Butbaloeirosare cheerfully committed to their own kind of public-access artistry. The balloons show colossal images of Sly Stallone and Luciano Pavarotti – aspirational role models and pop culture icons. As Dargis says: “A flying balloon belongs to everyone, even the police.”Perhaps the authorities’ attitude is more irrational and dysfunctional than they will admit; when the police can’t catch the criminals, they criminalise the people they can catch. The Brazilian state could be just collectively and spitefully infuriated by a communal activity which exists outside their control and which consumes their attention while serious criminals continue to ply their trade. The ballooners themselves have something of the ethos of surfers and skateboarders – and even theflâneursof belle époque Paris. It’s a way of life, a cultivation of pure pleasure.Balomania is at Bertha DocHouse, London from 4 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBrazilAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is intensified here by the fact that the protagonist Max (Ruaridh Mollica), who mines his side-hustle escort work for material, is also a writer. But this uneasy, self-regarding sophomore effort by Finnish-British director Mikko Mäkelä, never fully distancing itself from the narcissistic prism of artistic creation, only fleetingly makes contact with flesh-and-blood human truths.By day, Max is a freelance hotshot for London’s trendy Wall magazine; he has just bagged himself a sweet assignment to interview Bret Easton Ellis. By night he is “Sebastian”, a hot commodity on an app called DreamyGuys. Typically servicing the older gentleman, he turns his experiences into bare-all prose he hopes to parlay into a bestselling novel. But it’s not clear what’s motivating him; perhaps it’s vanity, and his own professional advancement is the real story. Or, with his unreliability increasingly jeopardising his job, is there a deeper personal validation behind his secret app life?Mäkelä only seems half-interested in the realities and dangers of sex work, compared with something like the far rawer2018 French hustler drama Sauvage. Such things would presumably feature in Max’s writing, the particularities of which – only relayed in a few generic-sounding excerpts – don’t register significantly here. It’s more the larger struggle to transmute life into art that concerns the director, with Ellis as something of a touchstone (there’s a Patrick Bateman-referencing shot of Max checking out his own musculature).But Mäkelä is too in bed with his protagonist’s objectives to develop the kind of perspective that might yield richer insights into the life/art trade-off. Max’s epiphany, via a deepening relationship with timid academic Nicholas (Jonathan Hyde), is critiqued by his publisher as too pat an ending for his book. With the film partly caught in this self-referentiality, it doesn’t develop much beyond a vague treatise on the cost of pseudonymous exploitation. At least the director’s identification with his lead character results in a strong performance from Mollica; ever present in head-and-shoulders closeup and meticulously high-strung with an array of wary smiles, nervous swallows and evasive glances.Sebastian is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSex workLondonreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was day 14 of a two-week summer holiday, and our final afternoon in blissful 30C Corsican sunshine. I just needed one more chapter, lounging with my book, soaking in the last of the bone-warming sun slowly edging down towards the island’s dramatic mountainous spine.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But my calculating offspring had not forgotten ill-fated promises made on a previous evening, probably a little too deep into the second carafe. I was probably caught off-guard atBarny’s, a sensational sushi restaurant in the town of Ghisonaccia, enjoying our best meal of the holiday. They know when my defences are down; when I’m fully relaxed into holiday “yes” mode, and prime for being taken advantage of.So, here we are. I’d avoided going down the thrilling water slide at the Eurocamp Arinella Bianca’s family pool for as long as I could, and had nowhere left to run.View image in fullscreenArinella Bianca campsiteIt was my husband’s turn to disappear into the sanctuary of the adult-only pool in the wellness suite – complete with a whirlpool area, lazy river and priceless peace and quiet – so all other sacrificial options were gone.I gave in, launched myself down, followed by child one and child two. Screams, splashing, laughing, coughing. I might have quickly had my fill of the water slide, but I could have stayed on the island for a whole lot longer. The campsite is located just outside the town of Ghisonaccia, on the east coast, a smart choice if you want to be as well-positioned as you possibly can on an island with a huge mountain range running down the middle. It is less known than the ports of Bastia, Calvi and the capital, Ajaccio, as well as the more glamorous Porto-Vecchio and photogenic Bonifacio. But you pay less for accommodation and, with a hire car allowing us to explore, we planned day trips to the southern tip of the island too.The children played on the sand while we shared a delicious cuttlefish and octopus dish with a bottle of chilled white wineGhisonaccia felt up-and-coming, with restaurants, independent shops, stalls, supermarkets and a weekend street fair with live music. The crowning glory for a tourist information enthusiast like myself was a supremely helpful, well-stocked and multilingual office in the centre of town, which helped us discover family-friendly river walks farther inland, as well as the nature reserve Etang D’Urbino, just 10 minutes north.We’d chosen Corsica as our latest Mediterranean island holiday after a string of successes over the years with Sicily, Mallorca, the more rural Elba, and hopping about on ferries between Croatia’s Hvar, Korčula and Vis.View image in fullscreenPlage de l’Ostriconi.Photograph: Daniel Schoenen/Getty ImagesCorsica lies between the south-east of France and the west of Italy, accessible by ferry from Marseille, Nice and Toulon in France, or Savona, Livorno and Genoa in Italy. We arrived in Bastia via Savona and used Corsica Ferries there and back. Manage your expectations, especially in peak holiday season; the prices are reasonable for an overnight cabin, which we chose to limit the time wasted travelling, but we failed to anticipate stuffy rooms and 7am arrival times leaving us tired and irritable. Next time, I’d opt for the shorter, half-day journeys to spend as little time as possible inside the ship.Although it is close to Sardinia and has a long, complex and turbulent history of invasion and ownership, Corsica is definitely French, but with a unique feel. It was the birthplace of Napoleon, and its economy relies on tourism as well as healthy subsidies from Paris. Profiles of the island say it is one of the most underdeveloped parts of France and its proud inhabitants want to keep it that way.We walked by the lagoon, foraged samphire to have with our barbecue-baked sea bass, and went for refreshing swims in the riverThere is a banquet of beaches to choose from. You could come every year for a decade and still find new favourites. Some, like Plage de Santa Giulia, are vast, popular and easily accessible, signposted off the main roads; while others, like Plage de l’Ostriconi, are more rural and worth the pilgrimage on paths through shrubland and Corsican pines. We spent a few days trying various beaches along the east coast from the port of Bastia in the north, through Solenzara and the upmarket towns of Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio. In the end, though, our favourite was actually our very own beach, just a few steps from our chalet, Plage de Ghisonaccia, a beautiful sweep of white sand where you could eat in one of the beachside restaurants, play volleyball, get involved in water sports or just find a secluded spot.

Our smart, clean and modern three-bedroom chalet had formidable air conditioning, two shower rooms, loads of storage and great indoor and outdoor spaces for cooking and eating.For many years now​, parts of Corsica have suffered from overtourism, which has affected the fragile ecosystem and local resources, leading to visitor quotas and demarketing campaigns. For our visit, we decided we would tread the less-beaten track. Even though we chose a resort campsite, it’s on the Côte Orientale, an agricultural area that is still relatively unknown but is slowly becoming the island’s top camping holiday destination.So pick an area and stay local, as we mostly did. With its winding roads and traffic jams, getting anywhere in Corsica by car can be an ordeal, especially in mountainous areas. Plage de Ghisonaccia became our favourite beach partly because it didn’t involve a stressful car journey, and we spent our days exploring the Pinia forest, one of the last maritime pine forests left in Europe, which bordered the beach. We walked the shores of the Urbino coastal lagoon, foraged samphire to have with our barbecue-baked sea bass, and went for refreshing swims in Fium’Orbu river, just a few minutes inland from the campsite.

Often the simplest dishes feel in the least need of an actual recipe, yet surely I can’t be alone in thinking that the leathery, greasy roast new potatoes that turn up so often on tables at this time of year show some room for improvement.I used to be of Jane Grigson’s opinion that “new potatoes should either be steamed or put into boiling water with sprigs of mint” – after all,they’re so good, and their season so short, from April to August, why meddle with perfection? But, having recently enjoyed crisp-skinned, buttery- fleshed beauties from a restaurant oven, I’d like to add them to my repertoire, too. While anyone can roast a potato, doing it proper justice clearly requires a little more thought.The potatoesNew potatoes are, as the name suggests, the first of the early potatoes to crop each year – the ones with the thin, papery skins that can be rubbed off with a fingernail. The first and smallest of these are, I think, still better steamed and buttered or oiled; there’s not really enough skin on them to crisp, but the slightly larger, more robust ones that follow are admirably suited to this endeavour, which seems only to intensify their slightly nutty flavour.View image in fullscreenNigella Lawsonsteams her spuds first, which makes them taste ‘more satisfyingly potatoey’ than boiled versions.

Their dense, smooth flesh is ideal for salads and boiling, because it retains its shape after cooking, but they’re no good for fluffy mash or baked potatoes.Jersey royalstend to be the earliest in the shops each year, thanks to the island’s milder climate, but you can use anything that’s labelledsalad potatoes– anya, la ratte, charlotte, epicure – for the recipe below.Don’t bother to peel them (if they’re really fresh, they should come unwashed, and you can just rinse off the dirt and rub off any sorry-looking bits of skin); not only will the skin crisp up pleasingly, but I think it contains much of the tuber’s flavour (in this, and perhaps this only, I dare to disagree with the great Simon Hopkinson, who writes in Week In Week Out, “there truly is nothing worse than a new potato cooked with its skin intact. Just go away all of you who say: ‘but all the goodness and vitamins of a potato lie just beneath its skin!’ This does not mean you have to leave it there to get to it”). Do, however, make sure they’re all roughly the same size, because that will ensure they cook evenly. (Cutting a few in half is fine, if necessary, but I prefer to leave them whole – they look prettier, and I think the texture is better, especially if you’re going to boil them.)The preparationView image in fullscreenDavid Tanis bakes his new potatoes in a greaseproof paper parcel, which turns them ‘deliciously soft and rich in flavour’.Most recipes I try call for the potatoes to be pre-cooked to some degree, much as one would for ordinary roast potatoes.J Kenji López-Alt,Mary Cadoganand Nigel Slater all boil theirs: López-Alt for five minutes (but from cold) until “the exteriors are tender”, Cadogan for 10, which counts as a kind of par-boil, and Slater “until tender” all the way through. López-Alt writes on Serious Eats: “Papery crusts occur when the layer of gelatinised starches that crisp up on the exterior of the potato isn’t thick enough. As the potato comes out of the oven and sits, steam from its core penetrates the crust, softening it from the inside out. Parboiling the potatoes will help build up this layer of starch.”Nigella Lawsonsteams hers until tender instead, which she suggests should take 20-30 minutes, though I find the baby new potatoes she specifies are done in half that time. They also taste more satisfyingly potatoey than the boiled versions, something I put down to the fact that they’re lost none of their flavour to the water.Delia SmithandDavid Tanis, meanwhile, both roast their potatoes from raw, though Smith marinates them in oil, vinegar and aromatics for a couple of hours beforehand. On balance, I agree with Slater that “they need a few minutes in boiling water before they hit the oven if they are not to toughen as they roast” – my testers and I find Smith’s spuds chewy rather than crisp (no good can surely come of contradicting two of my culinary heroes in one column, but I’m duty bound to report my findings). Tanis’s are much better, for reasons I shall go into later, but for a simple roast spud, pre-cooking seems the safest bet.View image in fullscreenNigel Slater’s roast new potatoes are ‘bashed around a bit’.López-Alt, like Smith, adds vinegar, in his case to the water when boiling, to “allow the starch to gelatinise while keeping the potatoes relatively firm and intact”, on the basis that “pectin, the glue that holds vegetable cells together, doesn’t break down very readily in acidic environments”. While I’m sure he’s right, the likelihood of potatoes breaking down after five minutes in boiling water feels vanishingly slim – and, in any case, I’m going to steam mine. (If this is impractical, put them in a pan of cold, salted water and boil until just tender instead.)To smash or bash?López-Alt adopts a technique familiar to me from standard roast potatoes, treating the parboiled spuds a bit rough by “bashing them around a bit until their exteriors are coated in a film of bashed-up potato bits [which] allows you to crisp up not just the cut surfaces, but the skins as well”. Leaving aside the fact that after just five minutes of boiling, I have to shake that pan like a woman possessed to have any effect on its occupants, I find a simpler, and more effective, method is simply to crush each potato lightly, as Cadogan, Lawson and Slater recommend, “to break the skin and flesh a little in order to allow the oil to penetrate and the potato to crisp”,to quote the last in Tender. Because they all react slightly differently to being squashed, this produces a pleasing variety of shapes to crisp up in as many different ways, from crunchy crags of flesh to thin, almost potato crisp-like shards of skin. Plus, tiny squashed potatoes also look rather comical to my mind.View image in fullscreenJ Kenji López-Alt takes a typically scientific approach to his roast new potatoes.The temperatureCadogan roasts the potatoes at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20 minutes, and Slater for twice that time, while Lawson cranks up the oven by fully 20 degrees and sits them in the middle for half an hour. López-Alt and Smith, mavericks both, turn up the oven to 260C, or “the highest setting” (which, coincidentally, is 260C), and bake them, in Lopez-Alt’s case, for 55 minutes, though I have to whip mine out after half an hour, because they’re already bordering on the burnt. They have a decent crunchy crust, as promised, but for me it’s too thick and dominant in flavour, in marked contrast with those baked at a lower temperature, which have a more delicate, shattering crispness and still taste predominantly of potato flesh, rather than its sweet, browned skin. A more moderate heat allows them time to acquire a rich, golden tan without drying out.View image in fullscreenDelia Smith’s roast new potatoes turn out ‘chewy rather than crisp’.Tanis isn’t seeking crispness with his “steam-roasted” new potatoes for the New York Times, which are baked in a greaseproof paper parcel with aromatics, making them deliciously soft and rich in flavour – a slightly more luxe take on the standard steamed spud that would be perfect for a dinner party, perhaps paired with poached fish or asparagus.The extrasI’ve eschewed any extras that might overpower the subtle flavour of the main ingredient, but as well as using different fats for different effects, you might like to bake your potatoes with chopped rosemary (Slater), smoked paprika (Cadogan for BBC Good Food) or garlic, rosemary, sage and thyme (Smith and Tanis). López-Alt adds shallots towards the end of the cooking, then, after they come out of the oven, sloshes it all with oil, garlic, chives, parsley and lemon zest. Meanwhile, Lawson finishes hers with a “wincing hit” of vinegar, which cuts through the creamy texture of the potatoes and oil beautifully. Personally, however, I think they’re delicious just as they are – these are lucky to make it to the table in my house.View image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect roast new potatoes are very much like Nigella’s, with just the odd tweak here and there.(The problem with very simple recipes such as this is that there often aren’t many variables, so I must acknowledge that my perfect version is very similar to Nigella Lawson’s version in At My Table, but with a slightly shorter cooking time. After all, if it ain’t broke …)Prep5 minCook45 minServes2-4500g small new potatoes1-2 tbsp olive oil, or neutral oil or animal fatSaltTry to find potatoes that are all roughly the same size, so you can keep all their skins intact while steaming; if any really are whoppers, though, then cut them in half.View image in fullscreenSteam until just tender all the way through, or about 15 minutes for baby potatoes. (Alternatively, put the potatoes in a pan just large enough to hold them all, cover with cold water, salt well, bring to a boil, then simmer until just cooked through. Drain and return to the hot pan to steam-dry before roasting.)Meanwhile, heat the oven and a roasting tin, filled with only just enough oil to coat the base (how much will, of course, depend on the size of your tin), to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.View image in fullscreenPut the steamed potatoes on a board and lightly crush each one with a fork, spoon or potato masher, but only just so you hear the skins split, and not so hard that they break apart (though, if a few do, such is life).View image in fullscreenRemove the hot tin from the oven. If you can, set it on a low heat on the hob to keep the fat warm while you roll each potato in turn in the hot oil to coat. Spread out the potatoes as much as possible, then season generously with salt.View image in fullscreenRoast for 20 minutes, or until richly golden brown underneath (larger potatoes may take longer), then flip and bake for another 10 minutes.

Some of the best and most traditional ones are cooked over charcoal and palm wood in deep underground fire pits, so the smokiness takes over every grain. That isn’t practical in most homes, but I like to think we can still produce the most wonderful rice dishes with just simple ingredients and a lot of love.Fega’ata, or bottom-of-the-pot chicken and rice (pictured top)The name of this uniquely Bahraini dish means “bottom of the pot”, which is where all the good stuff happens. The meat (or fish or vegetables) is left to steam and cook gently without any liquid, and the rice is piled on top. Don’t skimp on the onions, because their moisture is what helps move things along. The chicken skin doesn’t go crisp here; instead, it acts as a shield, keeping the meat nice and tender.Prep20 minSoak1 hr+Cook2 hr 30 minServes6–8½ tsploosely packedsaffron threads2 tsp rosewater2 tsp cumin seeds, finely crushed in a mortar2 tsp coriander seeds, finely crushed in a mortar1 tsp mild curry powder1 tsp ground turmeric1 tsp paprika½ tsp ground cinnamon2black limes, 1 finely ground to yield 1 tsp, the other broken in half and pips removed1kgbone-in skin-on chicken thighs(about 8), patted dryFine sea salt andblack pepper100g yellow split peas, soaked in boiling water for at least 1 hour3 onions, peeled, halved and each half cut into 4 wedges (540g)400gfloury potatoes(such as maris piper), peeled and cut into 5cm chunks1 large plum tomato(130g), cut into 83 whole green chillies35gfresh ginger, peeled and finely grated5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated4 tbsp melted ghee4 cloves3 fresh bay leaves6 cardamom pods375gbasmati rice, washed until the water runs clear, soaked for at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours, then drained2 tbspfreshcoriander leaves, roughly chopped, to servePut the saffron, rosewater and a tablespoon and a half of hot water in a small bowl. Mix all the ground spices and the ground black lime in a second small bowl.Put the chicken thighs in a medium bowl , add half the spice mixture, a teaspoon and a half of salt and a generous grind of pepper, and mix well to coat, then leave to marinate.Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Drain the soaked split peas, add them to the pan and cook for 15 minutes, until two-thirds cooked. Drain and put in a large bowl with the onions, potatoes, tomato, whole chillies, ginger and garlic. Add the halved black lime, all the remaining spice mixture, two tablespoons of ghee, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and mix with your hands.Half-fill a large (roughly 28cm), deep-sided, nonstick saucepan with water. Add two and a half teaspoons of salt, bring to a boil, then add the cloves, bay leaves, cardamom and rice. Boil for just four minutes, then drain through a large sieve set over the sink. Rinse and dry out the pan.Spread a tablespoon of ghee over the base of the clean pan. Spread over half the potato mixture, then top with the chicken skin side down. Top evenly with the remaining potatoes, then spoon over half the saffron water. Top with the rice and aromatics, without compressing the mix, and spread it out carefully so as not to break apart the rice grains. Pour over the remaining saffron water and the last tablespoon of ghee, cover with a clean tea towel and the lid, then bring the ends of the towel up and over the lid and secure with a rubber band or by tying them together.Put the pan on a medium-high heat for exactly 15 minutes, rotating it once halfway, then turn down the heat to low and leave to cook undisturbed for an hour and 45 minutes.Take off the lid and towel, and leave to settle for 10 minutes. Put a large platter on top of the pan and, in one swift movement, invert the rice mix on to the platter. Lift off the pan and shake the platter a little to distribute everything nicely; don’t worry if a few bits stick to the pan – just spoon them on to the rice. Sprinkle with the coriander and serve.Tomato, potato and saffron riceView image in fullscreenNoor Murad’s tomato, potato and saffron rice.This can be a side or a main dish – I like to eat it with fried fish, chopped salad and a spicy pickle.Prep20 minSoak20 min+Cook1 hr 50 minServes4-6⅓ tsploosely packedsaffron threads, finely crushed1 tsp rosewater4 tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced (220g)Fine sea salt andblack pepper400g floury potatoes, such as maris pipers (about 2 medium ones), peeled and cut into rough 2½cm cubes350gbasmati rice, washed until the water runs clear, soaked for at least 20 minutes, then drained3 fresh bay leaves5 cloves5 cardamom pods50g unsalted butter, cut into small cubes4 large ripe plum tomatoes, halved lengthways (600g)2 whole green chillies1½ tbsp picked flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped (optional)Put the saffron, a tablespoon and a half of hot water and the rosewater in a small bowl and leave to infuse for at least 20 minutes (or up to overnight).Put two tablespoons of the oil, the onion and a half-teaspoon of salt in a nonstick saute pan for which you have a lid, then cook, stirring occasionally, on a medium-high heat for 10 minutes, until the onions are nicely golden.Stir in the potatoes, two tablespoons of water and another quarter-teaspoon of salt, give everything a good stir, then cover with the lid and turn down the heat to medium-low. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring once halfway, until the potatoes are cooked through and have taken on some colour.Meanwhile, fill a 26cm nonstick saucepan for which you have a lid with water. Add two teaspoons of salt, bring to a boil, then add the rice, bay leaves and spices, and boil for five minutes, until the rice is half cooked. Strain through a sieve set over the sink, then rinse out and dry the pan.Put the last two tablespoons of oil and half the butter in the clean pan. Sprinkle the cut sides of the tomatoes with three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt in total and a good grind of pepper, then arrange them cut side down in the pan with the chillies. Top evenly with half the rice, including the aromatics, spoon over half the saffron water, top with half the potatoes, then repeat with the remaining rice, saffron water and potatoes .Poke three or four holes in the rice with the handle of a wooden spoon, then dot with the remaining butter. Cover first with a clean tea towel and then with the lid, then bring the ends of the towel up and over the lid and secure with a rubber band or by tying them together.Cook on a medium-high heat for 10 minutes, then turn the heat to low and leave to steam undisturbed for 45 minutes. Take off the lid and tea towel and set aside for five or so minutes. Put a platter on top of the pan and, in one swift movement, invert the rice mix on to it; if any tomatoes stick to the bottom of the pan, just lift them off and arrange on top of the rice. Shake the plate a little to spread things out, sprinkle with parsley, if using, and serve.These are edited extracts from Lugma, by Noor Murad, published by Quadrille at £28.
