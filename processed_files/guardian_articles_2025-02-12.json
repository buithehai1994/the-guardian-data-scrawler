We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”US no longer ‘primarily focused’ on Europe’s security, says Pete HegsethRead moreThe Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. “No one wants peace more than Ukraine,” he wrote. “Together with the US, we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”0:48'I don't think it's practical': Trump on Nato membership for Ukraine – videoTrump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”But, he said, “sometime [Ukraine’s] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks thatKyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia.“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. Instead, peace would have to be secured by “capable European and non-European troops”, who he stressed would not come from the US.Any British or European troops deployed in Ukraine would not be covered by part of a Nato mission or covered by the alliance’s article 5 guarantee, Hegseth added, meaning they would in effect be reliant on help from participating states.Though Hegseth set out some positions for achieving peace in Ukraine, few experts believe there has been any serious diplomatic progress. Russia, which has been gaining ground on the battlefield, remains keen to press home its advantage and has demanded that Ukraine cede further territory and in effect be demilitarised as part of a deal.Russia’s demands could mirror those made on the eve of its full-scale invasion in 2021: that Ukraine adopt a neutral status and that Nato cease deploying weapons to member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began accepting former communist nations. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.Earlier this week,Zelenskyy told the Guardianthat Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. “Security guarantees without America are not real,” he said.A multinational deterrence force based in Ukraine after a ceasefire would need to be 100,000 to 150,000 strong, Zelenskyy said, though that would be far smaller than the 600,000-plus Russian troops in occupied Ukraine.“Europe cannot field a force like this right now,” one senior European diplomat told the Guardian. “But we cannot force the US [to commit troops]. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”Zelenskyy: Europe cannot guarantee Ukraine’s security without AmericaRead moreAnother senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The person also said that the readiness to offer concessions from Ukraine would encourage Russia to demand more in the upcoming negotiations.In his readout of their call, Zelenskyy also suggested that Ukraine was reviewing a deal with the US regarding a new “security, economic cooperation, and resource partnership”. That followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who had visited Kyiv to discuss US access to rare earth minerals, energy resources and energy assets, according to Reuters.The US has suggested that it would seek access torare earth minerals, which are strategic metals essential for industries developing computers, batteries and cutting-edge energy technology in exchange for providing military aid to Ukraine in the future.The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops [under a ceasefire agreement], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. “And we have not been consulted.”European foreign ministers declared their support for Ukraine during a meeting of the country’s allies in Paris on Wednesday. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion. We have always said we will support Ukraine to achieve a just and lasting peace. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involvingMarc Fogel,a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVladimir PutinUS foreign policyUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the 12 new towns are not likely to be standalone but extensions to existing big settlements.The new towns would be led by regional development corporations, with an initial injection of public funding to buy land which would be returned after sites had been sold at a higher value to private developers, in part to pay for infrastructure.Starmer said home ownership remained a “distant dream” for many people, resulting in a “disconnect between working hard and getting on” which eroded public faith in the system.He said: “This is about more than just bricks and mortar. It’s about the security and stability that owning your own home brings. I know what this means for working people – the roof above our head was everything for our family growing up.”The government is aiming for at least 40% of the homes to be affordable, including social housing. A new towns code is expected to demand that buildings have “character” and are designed with reference to local history and in tree-lined streets, with guaranteed public transport, GPs surgeries and schools, as well as access to nature and play areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All have the benefit of proximity to existing rail infrastructure.Possibilities for new towns include settlements between Derby and Nottingham, between Bedford and Northampton and between Stafford and Stoke. Planners are also understood to be looking near Nottingham, Stafford and Northampton, as well as both sides of the Thames estuary.Ministers are also to announce a separate push to continue with stalled housing projects which has already unblocked 20,000 homes.A further three sites – Frome Gateway in Bristol, south of Cayton in North Yorkshire and Beam Park in Dagenham, east London – will receive support from the “new homes accelerator” scheme.As part of efforts to regenerate areas and use brownfield land, £30m will go to Bradford, £1.5m to a scheme at Manchester Victoria North and £20m will help transform small-scale council-owned sites around England.A new plan to broker disagreements between developers and government agencies which need to be consulted during the planning process has also been set out.Quangos including National Highways, Natural England and the Environment Agency will need to bring planners and housebuilders to the table to iron out concerns, with £1m of funding to speed up the planning approval process.A £2m package will support the Building Safety Regulator to speed up the process of signing off high-rise housing blocks. Councils will share £3m of grants to boost planning capacity.Explore more on these topicsHousingCommunitiesKeir StarmerAngela RaynerLabourEnglandKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, Egyptian and Qatari mediators were working “intensively” to compel Israel to address Hamas’s new demands before Saturday’s scheduled release of three Israeli hostages, Egypt’s state-run al-Qahera television reported.Mahmoud Mardawi, a senior Hamas official, said there were “positive signals” that the hostage handover would go ahead as planned, but added it had “yet to receive Israel’s commitment to implement the full terms of the deal, especially the humanitarian protocol”. There was no immediate comment from Israeli authorities.King Abdullah rebuffs Trump’s push for Jordan to take in displaced PalestiniansRead moreThe future of the three-week-old ceasefire agreement was thrown into jeopardy on Monday when Hamas’s armed wing announced it would postpone freeing the next group of captives. It citied alleged Israeli violations of the truce, including the continued killing of Palestinians, blocks on aid, including tents, and delays in allowing displaced people to return to the north of the strip.It said it had announced its stance early in order to give mediators enough time to pressure Israel to “comply and compensate for the past weeks” before the scheduled weekend handover.Israel denies the Hamas allegations, but claimed responsibility for an airstrike in the Rafah area on Wednesday that killed two people who the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said were flying a drone.The surprise announcement by the US president,Donald Trump, last week that the US would take over and “develop” the Gaza Strip appeared to be central to the group’s decision, although it did not directly mention it in its statement. Hamas reportedly no longer believes Washington’s guarantees for the ceasefire will hold and it does not think Israel is serious about implementation.The crisis, however, escalated sharply afterTrump respondedto Hamas’s delay by threatening “hell is going to break out” unless it released all of the Israeli hostages it was holding on Saturday.After a lengthy cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appeared to be keeping the option to continue the ceasefire open and a statement from his office did not explicitly back Trump’s call for “all” 76 of the remaining hostages to be freed this weekend.His defence minister, Israel Katz, echoed the deliberately ambiguous language on Wednesday, saying: “If Hamas does not release the Israeli hostages by Shabbat, the gates of hell will open on them, just as the US president promised. The new Gaza war will be different in intensity from the one before the ceasefire – and will not end without the defeat of Hamas and the release of all the hostages.”Hamas’s spokesperson, Hazem Qassem, said on Wednesday that Israel was “evading implementation of several provisions of the ceasefire agreement” and reiterated the group’s stance that hostages could only be released through diplomatic means. “Our position is clear, and we will not accept the language of American and Israeli threats,” he said.Talks on the second stage of the ceasefire, which is supposed to begin in early March, were due to start last week, but an Israeli team sent by Netanyahu to Qatar lacked a mandate to discuss matters not related to stage one, and returned on Sunday night.Egyptian and Qatari mediators are now trying to persuade Israel to meet the demands Hamas made on Monday, including “implementing the humanitarian protocol … and beginning negotiations for the second phase”, a Palestinian diplomatic source told Agence-France Presse.The head of the UN, António Guterres, has urged Hamas to proceed with the planned release and “avoid at all costs resumption of hostilities in Gaza”.The first stage of the truce, in which Israeli captives are released in batches in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli custody, has come under increasing strain as both sides accuse the other of violations.Last week’s release of three emaciated hostages sparked anger in Israel and beyond. The Gaza health ministry says Israeli fire has killed at least 92 Palestinians and wounded more than 800 others since the fragile ceasefire took hold on 19 January. The IDF says it has fired on people who approach its forces or enter certain areas in alleged violation of the truce.Trump has doubled down on his proposal to build a “riviera of the Middle East” in Gaza and to relocate its population of 2.3 million people to Egypt and Jordan, a plan international law experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing.The Arab world has flatly rejected the idea, which could destabilise the region and put Israel’s peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan at risk.Jordan’s King Abdullahmet Trumpat the White House on Tuesday, saying in social media posts he “reiterated Jordan’s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians”.Egypt said on Wednesday that it planned to present an alternative vision backed by Arab states for reconstruction of the Palestinian territory that will ensure Gaza’s residents remain on their land.The ceasefire halted 15 months of fighting in the strip, during which about 48,000 Palestinians were killed, sparking a devastating humanitarian crisis and reducing the occupied territory to ruins. The war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 were killed and another 250 taken hostage.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

James Tarkowski triggered a detonator under the old place. The Everton captain volleyed in a stunning 98th-minute equaliser to ensureLiverpoolwent seven points clear in the title race rather than nine.Everton 2-2 Liverpool: Premier League – live reactionRead moreThe historical context meant as much to jubilant Evertonians as rescuing a deserved draw. Mohamed Salah’s late goal put Liverpool on the cusp of a 42nd victory at the home of their oldest rivals. Tarkowski’s even later strike, a fitting final act, kept the Goodison derby scoreline at 41-all. Bedlam ensued.There were two VAR reviews after Tarkowski lashed Tim Iroegbunam’s flick-on into the roof of Alisson’s net, one for offside and another for a push by Beto on Ibrahima Konaté. When both were cleared – the referee, Michael Oliver, might have feared for his safety had they ruled against Everton – the final whistle sounded almost immediately and Abdoulaye Doucouré celebrated in front of the Liverpool fans. Curtis Jones grabbed the Everton midfielder, sparking a huge fracas. Both were sent off for their second bookable offences of the night. Arne Slot and his assistant, Sipke Hulshoff, also received red cards for their furious protests over the decision not to penalise Beto.Premier League rules prevented Slot from holding a post-match press conference. The anger over his first Merseyside derby may not have subsided by the time he faces the media on Friday.For Moyes and Everton, however, the final scheduled game under the Goodison floodlights was a night to savour. It was a wild place before, during and after the 245th derby, from the crowds that greeted the team coach before kick-off to the delirium that followed Tarkowski’s spectacular goal.View image in fullscreenCurtis Jones clashes with Abdoulaye Doucouré after the match before both players are sent off.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersEverton fed off the energy of the crowd and made a ferocious start that never granted Liverpool a moment to settle. Best make it count. Quick thinking by Jarrad Branthwaite and slow reactions by the Liverpool defence ensured they did. Alexis Mac Allister was penalised for a foul on Iliman Ndiaye. As Liverpool players prepared for a high ball into the box, Branthwaite slipped a quick free-kick between Konaté and Conor Bradley. Beto was alert to the training‑ground routine and sprinted through to place a composed finish under Alisson.Goodison’s noise levels cranked up to 11 but after witnessing such a well-worked goal the home crowd was soon silenced by a fairly simple equaliser. Not that the timing of Mac Allister’s run into the penalty area or cute header were by any means routine.Liverpool drew level after their first spell of composed, possession play. Hence Moyes’s objective to disrupt it from the off. The visitors won a corner, taken by Andy Robertson and cleared to Doucouré, who lost possession when attempting to lead a counterattack. Mac Allister ghosted into the box unmarked. Salah found him with a delicious cross from the right and the Argentina midfielder steered a header into the bottom corner. Jordan Pickford reacted too late.Mac Allister was one of six players in the Liverpool matchday squad who would have missed the derby had it been played as planned on 7 December. Liverpool’s starting lineup was their first without an English player in the Premier League era. Five first‑half bookings confirmed the Merseyside derby still has an edge. Idrissa Gueye and Bradley were both fortunate not to receive a second yellow. Mac Allister flirted with a second yellow, too. Ndiaye left the pitch in tears having been injured following a foul from behind by Dominik Szoboszlai. The in-form Everton forward was knocked off balance by the Liverpool midfielder and jarred his knee when his foot caught the ground.As for the football, well, there was still plenty of that. Szoboszlai forced Pickford to save a low, powerful drive at full stretch in first-half stoppage time. Tarkowski did just enough to prevent Luis Díaz pouncing on the rebound.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first was a free header from a Gueye cross and the second a miscued shot from a Tarkowski pass.View image in fullscreenAlexis Mac Allister scores to make to 1-1.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe hosts had a penalty claim rejected when Konaté handled while tussling with Beto inside his area. VAR also confirmed the on-field decision to disallow a Branthwaite goal for offside against Jake O’Brien at a James Garner corner.Liverpool and Salah had been restricted, rarely troubling Pickford’s goal in the second half. But Salah only ever needs one moment to make his mark. Tarkowski did well to hook away a Díaz cross from the left but Jones, a fresh introduction from the bench, was quicker to the loose ball than Jake O’Brien.Jones exchanged passes with his fellow substitute Darwin Núñez and, though Branthwaite headed away the midfielder’s shot, the clearance fell perfectly for Salah at the back post. He was never going to miss the invitation. Another slice of Merseyside football history beckoned for Salah but Tarkowski ensured he would score the final derby goal at Goodison when volleying home. A final kick worthy of the grand old stadium.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Fritsche was given a two-year suspended sentence at Wuppertal district court.The trial, which began in December, heard that more than 1,500 images, videos and confidential medical records were downloaded from a computer.The sensitive data was given to Fritsche, who passed them to Tozturkan. Tozturkan told the Schumacher family he would “upload them on to the dark web” unless money was paid, the court heard.Tozturkan had denied blackmail and insisted they were offering the family a “business deal”.Before the verdict was announced, Tozturkan, who is in jail on an unrelated crime, told the court: “I’m very sorry and ashamed for what I have done. It was a very disgusting thing. I take full responsibility.”During the trial, the family expressed concerns that one hard drive containing sensitive material had not been recovered despite repeated searches of the defendants’ properties.Thilo Damm, the Schumacher family lawyer, said they planned to appeal against the “lenient sentences”.Damm added: “We do not agree with everything the court said. You can rest assured that we will exhaust all legal possibilities at our disposal.“We don’t know where the missing hard drive is … so there is the possibility of another threat through the back door.”Schumacher, 56, a seven-time Formula One world champion, has not been seen in public since a ski accident in 2013 in the French Alps where he suffered severe head injuries.He was put in an induced coma and brought home in September 2014, with his medical condition since kept private by his family.Prosecutors previously told the court the Schumacher family received an email containing samples of the stolen material from the perpetrators.The family alerted authorities in Switzerland, who traced the plot to Germany through the phone number used to contact the family.In September, German prosecutors said they were bringing charges against the three men arrested.Explore more on these topicsMichael SchumacherGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

He is expected back on campus next week.However, the Guardian can reveal that, during his investigation, O’Brien did not have access to the diaries or WhatsApp messages, which are understood to have run over hundreds of pages and shed light on the nature of his relationship with the woman.The KC is understood to have been persuaded not to review the documentary evidence by Tooley’s lawyers, Griffin Law, who argued the materials were confidential and if they formed part of the inquiry it would breach his privacy.One senior source at the university, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they believed the investigation was therefore flawed.“It is difficult to draw proper conclusions if you haven’t got access to the full evidence base. It is drawing conclusions on the basis of a partial evidence base, which is not satisfactory,” they said.Another senior staff member at the university, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Cynthia and James Tooley were the principal individuals interviewed as part of the inquiry, meaning it was “essentially one person’s word against another”.Lawyers for Tooley maintain he was exonerated by O’Brien’s investigation. They said the suggestion that the inquiry was constrained because of lack of access to the diaries and WhatsApp messages was “baseless”.They also said that O’Brien “spoke to” the young woman in India during the investigation. However, three sources familiar with the investigation said she was not formally interviewed by him.Tooley’s imminent return to campus will come at a fraught time for the university, amid division among its leadership.After his suspension, Tooley filed a formal grievance against members of the council whom he accused of seeking his removal because of their opposition to his “political views and beliefs”.O’Brien also investigated that grievance in a separate investigation, and concluded it was “wholly without merit”. Tooley’s lawyers reject that conclusion, insisting he was targeted because of his political beliefs as part of an “attempted coup”.One of those accused by Tooley in his grievance was Mark Qualter, the chair of the university’s council. He emailed staff last week to complain about misreporting of the vice-chancellor’s suspension from “certain elements of the media”, which he said had been “unhelpful” and “unsettling”.The Guardian understands that there are also unresolved questions about the extent to which O’Brien’s investigation into Tooley’s relationship with the woman in India amounted to a full exoneration of the vice-chancellor.Do you have information about this story? Email investigations.contact@theguardian.com, or use Signal or WhatsApp to message (UK) +44 7721 857 348.In a council meeting on 27 January, after the report’s conclusion, members unanimously agreed with a subcommittee’s recommendation that there were no grounds to dismiss him. Qualter’s email to staff said the council was in “complete agreement” on this point.However, there were divisions among council members on other points. Some members believed Tooley had been fully exonerated. Others disagreed. One university document seen by the Guardian states that “a full range of views” was expressed on the question of whether he had been exonerated.It is understood that some members of the council raised concerns about whether it was appropriate for someone in charge of a university to have such a relationship in light of safeguarding considerations. One source with knowledge of the council meeting said Tooley’s “judgment was questioned”.The University of Buckingham is understood to have a large intake of students from India, including some who are a similar age to the Indian woman when they first met.Tooley reportedly knew the woman’s father, and paid her tuition fees. According to the Times, Tooley’s friends said this was a charitable gift and their intimate relationship began after she left university.The Indian woman told the newspaper that she was 18 when she met Tooley and they did not begin a sexual relationship until she was in her 20s. She said she was in love with him and “people will say he used me because he has power and money. But that’s not the case.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity of BuckinghamHigher educationEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Rowling serves as an executive producer. With a new cast, the show will delve into more detail than the eight feature films spawned by the epic franchise, released between 2001 and 2011.Cillian Murphy as Voldemort? Everything we know about HBO’s Harry Potter TV showRead moreThe series will be “full of the fantastic detail, much-loved characters and dramatic locations thatHarry Potterfans have loved for over 25 years”, Max, the newly branded streaming service for HBO, promised in a statement upon theseries announcementin April 2023.“Each season will be authentic to the original books and bringHarry Potterand these incredible adventures to new audiences around the world, while the original, classic and beloved films will remain at the core of the franchise and available to watch globally.”Casey Bloys, chair of Max content, said the new show “will dive deep into each of the iconic books that fans have continued to enjoy for all of these years”.Casting speculationhas abounded since, with reports that Warner Bros has reached out toMark Rylanceto play Dumbledore, played in the films by Richard Harris and Michael Gambon. The Hollywood Reporter reported thatPaapa Essieduwas offered the role of Severus Snape, played by the late Alan Rickman, and rumors haveswirledthat Cillian Murphy will take up the Voldemort-shaped mantle left by Ralph Fiennes.HBO also launched the search for the next Harry, Ron and Hermione – played in the films by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson – in September, with an open casting call for child actors aged nine to 11 based in the UK and Ireland. The casting call asked for prospective actors to submit two short self-tapes in their own accent – a short poem or story, but nothing from Harry Potter.Announcement of the series was met with mixed reactions from Harry Potter fans. Some felt that the longer format would allow for greater detail and faithfulness to the seven-book series, while others were conflicted over Rowling’s involvement despite anti-trans comments that have drawn criticism from some of the franchise’s original stars.Rowling’s expansive Harry Potter world – including the books, films, video games and theater – isworth an estimated £20bn($25bn).No release date has been set for the series, though Warner Bros Discovery chief David Zaslavsaidin February 2024 that the network aimed for a 2026 premiere.Lithgow was recently seen in Conclave, the papal election thriller that received eight Oscar nominations. He was also at the Sundance film festival in January with a role inJimpa, a queer family drama also starring Olivia Colman.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionJohn LithgowHarry PotterFantasy booksFantasy TVFictionHBOnewsShareReuse this content"

It stressed, however, that it wants the ceasefire to continue, emphasising that mediators had five days before the handover to ensure Israel “complies and compensates for the past weeks”.There are also two unspoken reasons for the group’s decision.Hamas officials are astute observers of Israeli politics and media; they took careful note of the furore caused by theemaciated condition of the three hostagesreleased last weekend, which the hostage families forum likened to images of Holocaust survivors.What do Hamas delay and Trump threat mean for Gaza ceasefire deal?Read moreIf the group is releasing the healthiest captives first, and the next to be freed are in even worse shape,Hamascommanders may be worried about pushing Israeli public opinion towards resuming hostilities in revenge for their treatment.Secondly, Hamas is as vulnerable as the rest of the world to Donald Trump’s tendency to make up policy on the fly.The militant group did not mention the president’s ill-considered proposal that the US take over and “develop” Gaza in its statement on Monday, but the president has essentially already torpedoed the next two phases of the ceasefire – an end to the war, and talks on future governance of the strip. He has left Hamas with dwindling options.Trump’s response to the delay of the next hostage release raised the stakes even higher. In an attempt to back the group into a corner, he has nowdemanded that Hamas releases “all” of the remaining Israeli hostageson Saturday, although he has acknowledged that the decision ultimately lies with Israel. For his part, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deliberately fudged his position in order to keep his options open, not explicitly backing Trump’s most recent statement.Hamas has dismissed Trump’s new deadline, saying that “the language of threats has no value and only complicates matters”, but the group now appears to have three courses of action.It can cut its losses and carry out its threat to delay Saturday’s planned hostage release, which will mean a return to fighting. While resuming hostilities is likely to trigger another mass exodus of Palestinian civilians to southern Gaza and dramatically worsen the strip’s humanitarian crisis, this is a way for Hamas to save face without giving up any more hostages, which remain its main leverage over Israel.It could also call Trump and Israel’s bluff by releasing more than three hostages. While it is logistically unlikely that the group could deliver all 76 – at least 30 of whom are dead – in one go, it could feasibly release the eight living captives due to come home in the first stage of the deal, in effect forcing talks to begin on implementing the second and third phases of the ceasefire ahead of schedule.Hamas also knows that if it does deliver the three hostages scheduled for release on Saturday, as planned, Israel is unlikely to withdraw from the agreement. This route would keep the truce alive, and to some extent defang Trump’s threats, although the president is unlikely to suffer such humiliation lightly.Which path the group will take will become clear on Friday night, when Hamas is supposed to deliver the names of the three hostages before their release. If they do not materialise, Israel will have ample justification to resume the war, with Trump’s blessing – an outcome that will let Netanyahu, the ultimate political Houdini,keep his rightwing coalition government intact.The ceasefire in the Gaza Strip is hanging by a thread after just three weeks, which does not bode well for its future. More than 2 million people in Gaza, and hundreds of Israelis still desperate for captive loved ones to return, have no choice but to hold their breath.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Bear in mind, the last he played in the area, in June 2022, was at the nearby MetLife Stadium with its 82,000 capacity. But for this special engagement, just 575 people would come together to watch the music icon at the comparatively minuscule Bowery Ballroom.‘The whole human condition is encased in the story’: why Beatles films just keep comingRead moreNaturally, tickets disappeared immediately, with stories of hopeful attenders physically running (yes, running!) down to the venue for box office-only sales. And lest you think Macca would use the opportunity to line his coffers, think again: tickets were sold for just $50 a pop, the price of a beer and a snack at most concerts.Doors opened at 5pm with a promised showtime at 6.30, with many attenders milling about, still bleary-eyed and in shock. Was this really about to happen? Perhaps it’s some trick? A fellow writer I ran into stayed up all night working and assumed he was about to get some shuteye when he heard about the show. Sleep can wait. Perhaps the biggest irony for the audience was that for what would be such a little-seen show, it’d be the perfect set to record every aspect of it – but no luck: as wristbands were given out, everybody’s phones were locked in pouches.By 6.20pm, the tiny space began to buzz and remixes of McCartney songs began playing over the loudspeaker to warm up the crowd. The venue was by no means packed: acts with barely any following have had more attendance in this particular venue. Among the crowd, ticket holders included the Apple Music maven Zane Lowe and a host of lucky fans. A smattering of grey hair mixed with a healthy dose of gen Z faces peppered the crowd, proving McCartney’s universal appeal.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: MJ KimThen he appeared as the crowd screamed: dressed in navy slacks with a black corduroy jacket over a pinstripe blue shirt, donning a slight stubble and long hair, a buoyant energy from the start. Surrounding him was a seven-piece band, including a three-piece horn section. This wasn’t going to be a stripped-down set. Paul’s guitar pick was in his mouth before switching to his hand, and he lifted his brown Höfner bass (could it bethe one he was reunited withlast year?).At 6.45pm, the familiar opening chord of A Hard Day’s Night rang out into the venue, with McCartney hitting that Höfner just as he did on the original recording (it was Beatles bandmate George Harrison who handled lead guitar duties on that one, with McCartney keeping up the tradition tonight). Letting Go, a 1976 cut from his Wings Over America album, and Got to Get You Into My Life followed in quick succession. “I can’t quite believe we’re here doing this. But we are here, doing this,” he said at one point.From there, McCartney in no way downsized his set or presence for the small venue, with the audience screaming, yelping and hanging on to every word. One of the major questions going into the surprise gig was:why?What was the point of all this? Was this to herald the start of a new era? Was it being filmed? Did they just want to put together a live rehearsal? Early on, he seemed to answer that query: “So, here we are,” he said mischievously. “Some little gig.New York. Why not?” Enough said, Paul.Interspersed in the music, he shared little stories: nothing earthshaking to serious fans of his work, but nonetheless compelling to hear them live. Before appropriately playing My Valentine considering the week, he talked about how that ballad was inspired by a soggy vacation with his late wife Linda. (What if it rained? She didn’t care.) When he played the seminal Beatles classic From Me to You, McCartney discussed how in the early days of the band he tried to write more personal songs with specific “I”, “me” and “you” words, as if he was directly reaching out to the fans: LoveMeDo,IWant to Hold Your Hand,ISaw Her Standing There,IFeel Fine.Halfway through his set, the band departed the stage, leaving McCartney solo in a spotlight with his acoustic guitar. He relayed a story of watching the Little Rock bus boycotts on TV back in England and writing Blackbird as a tribute to the civil rights movement. Later, he was set to play a gig down south with the Beatles but they were informed it was segregated, which the Fab Four thought was simply stupid. They wound up demanding the show be integrated and he heard years later a Black woman told him that gig was the first time she sat in an audience with white people. From there, McCartney said they “wound up writing it into our contracts” to never play a segregated venue. With that, he played the familiar, luscious opening chords of Blackbird, a chill-inducing moment if there ever was one.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: MJ KimHe also couldn’t help acknowledge his late friend John Lennon and how enamored his fallen frontman was with New York City. “Let’s hear it for John,” he said at one point as the crowd cheered and he played the Beatles’ most recent song Now and Then, the recording of which won best rock performance at the Grammys earlier this month. Elsewhere he spoke about playing a gig in Kyiv, Ukraine, noting it was a joyful show full of freedom. “Let’s hope it gets back to that soon.”At a certain point the distinct smell of marijuana wafted into the air, which he also couldn’t help but notice and said his guitar player has been sober for many years, but with the smell, McCartney joked now he’ll “have to call his sponsor”.The vigor of an arena show was on full display in performances of songs like Jet (with its distinctive horns) as well as an Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da sing-along with the audience (first guys, then girls). Then he sat at a piano to bring it all home: busting out passionate versions of Lady Madonna, Let It Be and Hey Jude. The audience wanted more, as someone yelled he should “play all night”. Ever the realist, McCartney shook his head disapprovingly.But the joke was on us, as he came back out for an encore of Golden Slumbers and the Abbey Road ending of Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight and, fittingly, The End. “And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make,” he sang into the microphone.Then the band took a bow and he and his band disappeared from the stage two hours after that first chord. The audience just stood there, some staring off into the distance processing what just happened. That sense of disbelief followed the crowd as they walked outside the doors and into the cold. On the street as snow was falling, a gaggle of news cameras and spectators huddled in front of the venue.It was a full-circle week, considering two days earlier was the 61st anniversary of the Beatles performing on The Ed Sullivan Show, which occurred uptown in this very same city. Decades may have passed, but whatever magic happened there that night remains. “That was a Beatles scream!” McCartney said at one point after someone in the crowd reacted with a yelp. “OK, let’s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.”But that wasn’t the end of the surprise: McCartney is set to hit the stage at the Bowery again, tonight.Explore more on these topicsPaul McCartneyNew YorkThe BeatlesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My therapist said this was perfectly normal.“I just want to stay inside under a blanket in the winter,” she said. It didn’t bother her because she knew that, come spring, she would feel more motivated. This was actually quite aproductive insightfor me, so maybe she wasn’t giving herwinter abilitiesenough credit.Winter sluggishness is common, especially the farther you get from the equator, as temperatures and daylight hours vary more from winter to summer. “Most people – nine out of 10 – feel better in the summer to some extent,” says Dr Paul Desan, director of theWinterDepression Research Clinic at Yale.Oh, no! It takes 162,335 minutes a year to maintain my health and wellbeingRead moreBut why exactly does winter make so many of us feel drained and unmotivated? And how do we deal with this? We asked experts.Why do some people feel less motivated during winter?The wiring that controls human moods is not fully understood, but a certain amount of sluggishness in the winter makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, says Desan.“Obviously Mother Nature thinks people should shut down for the winter if they live far from the equator,” he says. “If you’re a hunter-gatherer, you’re probably better off just eating a lot and staying home and resting [in winter].” Then, when temperatures warm, days lengthen and resources are more plentiful, our energy returns.The sun also has a powerful effect on our hormones, explains Dr Jessica Jackson, a licensed psychologist and the vice-president of alliance development for MentalHealthAmerica. “When you’re getting less daylight in the winter months, that affects your serotonin levels, which then causes you to have a lower mood,” she says.How do you know if your winter blues are seasonal affective disorder (Sad)?Feeling low energy in the winter is common. But how do you know if it’s something more serious?“For some people, the seasonal change is major,” says Desan. “It shuts down their life, and affects their ability to work and their concentration.”People who have seasonal affective disorder experience an episode of clinical depression at roughly the same time every year, says Desan. This can manifest as a lower mood, lower energy, lower motivation, and sleeping and eating more than usual. For those with Sad, these episodes usually last from October or November through January or February, and then improve as the sun comes back in the spring.Sad affects roughly 5% of adults in the US, according to theAmerican Psychiatric Association, and about 3% of adults in the UK, according to theRoyal College of Psychologists.Anywhere from 10-15% of adults might experience subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder, says Desan. This includes those who don’t meet the criteria for clinical depression, but who experience low energy and motivation in the winter.“They say: ‘I don’t get anything done in the winter, I have to push myself to go to work, and I withdraw from my hobbies,’” explains Desan. “Maybe they don’t have a full [depressive] episode, but it still really affects people.”Doesn’t the heat sap energy too?Is winter really so much more draining than summer? As anyone who has sweated through a heatwave knows, high temperatures can also leave you feeling cranky and depleted.Heat can “impair cognition, worsen emotional states, increase aggression, disrupt brain networks needed for attention, lead to worse sleep, harm decision-making ability and exacerbate symptoms of mental illness”, says Dr Kim Meidenbauer, assistant professor in Washington State University’s department of psychology and Health Equity Research Center.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This leaves less energy for thinking clearly and paying attention.Both cold and hot temperatures can affect our ability to think and focus, but our responses tend to be different. “Cold will slow people’s responses, while heat will speed them up,” says Meidenbauer. High temperatures, therefore, can lead to greater impulsivity, while cold temperatures generally do not.How do you treat the winter blues?The first guard against seasonal mood changes is awareness, says Jackson. If you know you tend to feel lethargic in the winter, try building a routine you can stick to, even when you want nothing more than to burrow into your couch. Maybe you usually go to the gym before work, for example, but in the winter it feels better to go after work.‘Big light has no vibe’: why you should ditch overhead lightingRead moreLight therapy – exposing yourself to bright light, meaning 10,000 lux (the unit of illumination) or more, for half an hour every morning – has also been found to successfully treat both Sad and subsyndromal Sad. “It’s miraculous for a lot of people,” says Desan.Standard light therapy treatment is to expose yourself to 10,000 lux for 30 minutes every morning using a special light box. “You can set up one of these devices, and use it while you eat breakfast and read the paper,” says Desan.Light therapy lamps are easy to find, but not all are created equal, warns Desan.“There’s a lot of garbage out there that’s too small or too dim,” he says. “It might be 10,000 lux, but that’s only if you put your eyes against it and don’t move.”Effective light therapy lamps are bright enough that you can sit at arm’s length from them and still experience the benefits.Experts say that if your mental health deteriorates significantly during the winter, make sure to see a mental health professional “who can do an assessment and identify all the factors that might be relevant”, says Desan.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyMental healthHealthWinterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As Christina Hendricks plays a Hollywood mogul, she talks about the whirlwind of fame – and what happens when it stopsWed 12 Feb 2025 11.39 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 12.55 ESTShareIt would be too much of a spoiler to reveal the dark secret at the heart of the new comedy drama Small Town, Big Story, but I can say that it’s huge, weird and unbelievable. In the six-part show,Christina Hendricksplays Wendy Patterson, a Los Angeles TV producer who is back in her small home town in Ireland to shoot a big Hollywood production. She has returned, successful and glossy, to the place where that weird experience changed her life – not least because nobody believed her and she was laughed out of town.Hendricks plays Wendy spiky and tough. “She’s got a real defence mechanism,” she says. “Something extraordinary happened to her and no one has ever believed her. She’s built up a wall, not letting people get too close, because then she’d have to reveal this big secret that, again, they are not going to believe.”For a decade, every weekend was a photoshoot, a premiere or an award showWritten and directed by Chris O’Dowd, Small Town, Big Story is a fun, eccentric show, full of misfits, beautiful Irish scenery and great characters. Paddy Considine plays Seamus, the local GP, who was Wendy’s teenage boyfriend and the only person, she thinks, who will reveal the full truth of what happened. “He’s one of those interesting actors that you see a lot in dramas,” says Hendricks, “so it’s fun to see him in this lighter, quirkier role.” She met Considine years ago, when he was about to direct a film. “He ended up not doing it, which I told him made me feel better that he didn’t cast me,” she says with a laugh.We’re talking over Zoom, Hendricks at her upstate New York home by the woods (you can follow its renovation on Instagram – all whimsical wallpaper, quirky antiques and heritage paint). There has been, she says, “a lot of nomadic living recently. I’m starting to wonder where I live.” She filmed this show in Ireland for five months, then spent five months in Scotland where she was making the Apple TV+ period romcomThe Buccaneers. Her husband, cinematographer George Bianchini, and their dog travel with her. “That makes all the difference. I have my little family unit, which makes it an adventure. If I was alone, it would be a little bit heartbreaking.” She’ll soon be back at their other house in Los Angeles.View image in fullscreenHomecoming ... as a TV executive returning to Ireland in Small Town, Big Story.Photograph: Bernard Walsh/SkyHendricks was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. In her early life, because of her father’s job in the US Forest Service, she moved around a lot. “I think it prepared me, or trained me, and gave me a respect for new places – I’m a guest, and try to fit in and contribute, rather than ruffle. Many actors will say they moved around a lot – so their job was to fit in quickly, to find friends.” By the time she was 18, Hendricks was working as a model in New York. After living in London for a while, she spent her 20s building up her acting work, before getting her big break in 2007 as confident, smart office manager Joan inMad Men, the hit period drama about advertising agencies.Did she base Wendy – who is handling the shoot by herself – on any of the Hollywood executives she has worked with? Not really, says Hendricks, although maybe in elements of her resilience. “Hollywood is still very much a boys’ club – changing hopefully more rapidly now. But Wendy has that toughness, to prove that she can take the role a man would normally have and hold her own. I’ve certainly seen that in Hollywood.”Although it’s quirky and funny, underlying the show is a serious thread about how damaging it is to not be believed. “When you are gaslit, you start doubting yourself, because it’s such an outrageous experience,” says Hendricks. “It’s a very uncomfortable thing to think about. I think it comes out in snarkiness and Wendy displaying her authority to gain strength and respect – an exhausting way to live.”In flashbacks, teenage Wendy is a goth – a look based on Hendricks’ own school years when she dyed her hair black. Red is not her natural colour, although she is now entirely committed to it. “Any time I try to change it, to go back to blond, I like it for a month or two, then I don’t feel like myself, which is the weirdest thing. I’ve always felt like a redhead.”View image in fullscreen‘An absolute whirlwind’ … with Jon Hamm in Mad Men.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyHendricks, 49, wanted to be a ballerina first. “I studied for a long time and realised I was probably never going to be good enough. It was also incredibly masochistic and brutal on your body, your mind, everything.” Discovering community theatre, she realised she could sing and dance in musicals instead, but then she became a model. Doing this, instead of going to college, was “a great disappointment to my family, mostly to my father. I felt I had to prove that I was making the right decision, that I knew what I was doing. And the only way to do that was if I was really professional and worked really hard.”Now that so many women have spoken out, that era seems rife with danger for young actors and models. “I was young and travelling alone – always had my spidey senses up,” says Hendricks. She felt lucky to have been around people who “had no other agenda but to give me good advice and help me navigate”. Moving into acting, she was again fortunate, quickly finding a part in a series: for two years in the late 1990s, she was in Beggars and Choosers, a comedy about network TV.“I didn’t have to go to as many auditions and have as many of those experiences that left me in a vulnerable place,” she says, “so in a way, I avoided some of that stuff, but I was incredibly aware of it – the comments, the power differences and all those things. It’s such a part of everyday life as a woman growing up.”When Hendricks got the Mad Men role that would change her life, she was in her early 30s. Would it have been harder to have had that sudden fame if she had been 10 years younger? “No, I would have loved it!” she says with a laugh. “I feel like my 30s were all about Mad Men. I would have loved it to have happened sooner – I would have had more opportunities.”Has anything of Joan remained in her? “I think so – a confidence I got to appreciate through Joan. Also, I saw so many women around the world speak about, and tell me, how she influenced them and gave them strength. It was the character that moved them, but hearing their stories emboldened me and made me feel more confident and proud.”View image in fullscreenScottish shoot … in The Buccaneers.Photograph: Angus Pigott/Apple TV+Still, it felt strange to become so recognised. “No one teaches you how to be famous,” says Hendricks. “No one tells you how to be or act or answer questions, or how to not fall on your face. You just have to learn how to stay above water. And then no one teaches you how to not be famous after you were famous. There’s a lot of ebb and flow. You really have to ride that river, because it’s ever-changing and you can’t count on anything.”During the Mad Men years, things were definitely in full flow: “There was a decade where every weekend was a photoshoot, a premiere or an award show. It was an absolute whirlwind. And then the show stops, and all that stops, and you adjust to your new and different life. Sometimes you feel blindsided, sometimes you miss certain things and sometimes you’re relieved.”These days, the people who approach her are just as likely to talk about Good Girls, the comedy series in which Hendricks plays one of three mums turned criminals. Are we now beyond wondering if there are enough interesting roles for women in their 40s and beyond? “There’s so many wonderful roles these days,” she says, “and more and more developing.”Mad Men allowed Hendricks to break out of the “cute” roles she had often been lumped with. “I think there was a ‘sweetness’ to me,” she says. “People didn’t think I had this strength, so that opened up for me. And what Good Girls did is get me a lot of comedic roles.” She is sure that’s how she landed Wendy in Small Town, Big Story, a part she now says she was craving. “It was just my weird cup of tea.”Small Town, Big Story is on Sky Atlantic/Now from 27 February.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionChristina HendricksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Redefine the parameters. It’s usual to think of prime minister’s questions as a moment of jeopardy for No 10. The brief 10 minutes or so each week when the leader of the opposition gets to make life uncomfortable for the prime minister. When we the punters get to imagine how life might be if she were to get her toes inside Downing Street.Only it no longer works like this. Because ever since Kemi Badenoch was elected leader of theConservatives, PMQs has become R&R for Keir Starmer. Nor is it just teething problems for KemiKaze. A slow learner easing her way into the job. Rather it’s that she appears to be getting worse by the week. It’s already a horror show for the Tories, so God knows where we will be in a month or so.Who would have thought that having seven days to think up six questions was so difficult? They don’t even have to be clever, incisive and funny questions. That’s the icing on the cake. They just have to be reasonably coherent. Hell, it’s not as if Kemi is short of choice.Labourhas hardly aced the last seven months. Almost everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong.Apart from one thing. It should count itself lucky to have Kemi on the opposition benches. Though Starmer needs to tread carefully, for if he carries on like this the Conservatives may replace their leader.It may be hard to imagine Robert Jenrick or Chris Philp doing any better but stranger things have happened. For one thing, they would be hard pushed to do worse. My dog would give Kemi a run for her money and he’s not that sharp. So Keir might want to consider making Badenoch look good. “You know what? That’s a brilliant question, Kemi. I wish I had thought of that. I’m completely stumped.” Fake it to make it.2:01PMQs: Starmer says ‘loophole’ that enabled Gaza family to claim UK asylum will be closed – videoSo the real interest inPMQsthese days is no longer in who wins or who loses. It’s as a window into KemiKaze’s psyche. To see what she is thinking. Or, to be more accurate, what she isn’t thinking. Because if she paused to engage both synapses she would stay silent. As with Donald Trump, she suffers from a mind-body split. Her words have a life independent of her brain. Unlike Trump, she’s not the most powerful person in the world, so no one feels obliged to listen to her. Or take her seriously.This Wednesday was peak Kemi. Most opposition leaders spend hours in preparation. Collecting their thoughts. Stress-testing their argument. Badenoch had woken up that morning without an idea in her head. For once, there was no culture war battle on X on which she could fixate. Her mind was a tabula rasa. So she glanced at the front pages of the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail. And then she made a crucial error. She believed every word. Something even regular readers have learned is a category error. She would indulge in her very own Theatre of the Absurd.It was a supremely confident Kemi who stood up to ask her first question. She appears to be the only person in the Commons who doesn’t realise she’s about to die on her feet. Even her most loyal followers like the Philpster now adopt expressions of absence. I’m not really here. You can’t see me. Just close my eyes for 10 minutes and it will be like none of this has really happened. The empty spaces on the opposition backbenches told their own story. There is only so much pain that Tory MPs can manage.Badenoch was oblivious to all this. Unaware of her own shortcomings. For her, everything is always someone else’s fault. Was the prime minister aware that a family of six Palestinians had been granted citizenship under a law designed for Ukrainians? Starmer was. He too had read the Telegraph front page. He wasn’t sure if the judge had made a bad decision or whether there wasa loopholein the law that had been passed by the Conservatives. Either way, he was determined to make sure this wouldn’t happen again.You really couldn’t get much clearer than this. Starmer had been asked a straight question and had given a straight answer. But this wasn’t in Kemi’s script. She had never knowingly taken yes for an answer. So she had another go. Would Starmer appeal against the decision? This was getting embarrassing. An appeal obviously depended on whether it was the law or the judge that was at fault. But Badenoch still wasn’t satisfied, desperate to prove that Keir was weak on immigration. Most people would be hard pushed to see much difference between Labour and Reform on the issue these days.Judge who granted Palestinian family asylum made wrong call, says Keir StarmerRead moreIt got worse. KemiKaze then accused Starmer of not being on top of his brief. That must have stung, when Keir had said the same of her last week. She made an attack on the attorney general, Richard Hermer. He was just a lefty lawyer who hated Britain. Now Keir had to give the opposition leader a lesson in law 101. If lawyers only represented clients whom they liked then murderers and rapists would be left to cross-examine their victims. Badenoch seemed to think that was an excellent plan. What could go wrong.Even then we hadn’t hit rock bottom. That came when Kemi recited the Mail front-page story that the chief inspector of borders was working from home in Finland. Starmer sighed. This was getting too easy. He didn’t want to be too patronising but it was hard when you were dealing with an idiot. It had been the Tories who had recruited the inspector and allowed him to work from Finland. Labour had insisted he would have to return to the UK.Still, Kemi had no idea she had crashed and burned. Only that she had run out of questions. Though the humiliation continued when one of her less intelligent backbenchers brought up theChagos Islands.“Er, hello,” said Keir. He had several times offered Kemi a privy council briefing so she could get up to speed with the facts but she still hadn’t accepted the offer. It was as if she was happiest with her prejudices in a state of ignorance. Even the Labour MPs were now watching through their fingers. The entertainment had become a blood sport.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchKemi BadenochKeir StarmerConservativesLabourHouse of CommonsImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s perhaps notable forHarrison Fordplaying a US president for the first time since Air Force One in 1997, but now with secret health worries and liable to succumb to a terrifying rage which turns him into Red Hulk (Red State Hulk?) who is the ultimate disruptor, putting his great big red fist through the West Wing.A novelty there, maybe, though he conforms to the time-honoured Hulk tradition of somehow having miraculously stretchy trousers so that the Red Hulk genitals are not exposed. As for the apparent Maga implications, Mr Ford has himself denied them, and the MCU is as cautiously apolitical as ever, though Ford’s character is certainly keener on international cooperation than the current real-life incumbent.Supersoldier Captain America is the title now conferred on Sam Wilson, played by the personable Anthony Mackie; the previous holder Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) having stepped down and gone back in time to his 1940s heyday. Wilson is astonished to receive an invitation to a reception at the White House, now presided over by the ex-general turned commander-in-chief Thaddeus Ross (Ford) – an enemy of the Avengers who is regretfully tormented by the thought that he has alienated his daughter Betty (Liv Tyler) on account of her relationship with Bruce Banner.Captain America shows up to the shindig with his buddy and protege Joaquin Torres, or Falcon (Danny Ramirez) and Korean war veteran Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly), who is bitter at his former imprisonment as a mistrusted supersoldier. The reception ends in violent chaos, connected with a sinister plan to exploit the powerful new element Adamantium recently discovered in Japanese waters, and to create warlike division between Japan and the US who might otherwise sign a treaty guaranteeing international ownership. Captain America and President Ross are going to have to put aside their differences to battle this new threat to the Pax Americana, which might have something to with the awful scientist Dr Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) whose shocking appearance perhaps indicates thatno one on this production got the memo about stigmatising facial deformation.And so this convoluted green screen digital contrivance finally snakes its way to a suspended episode-conclusion; the action is moderate and it’s lacking in the steam-heat, humour and the surreal energy of superhero movies past. Mackie has charm and presence, and it would be great to see him at the centre of something more satisfying.Captain America: Brave New World is out on 13 February in Australia, and 14 February in the US and UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuperhero moviesMarvelHarrison FordreviewsShareReuse this content"

From the long-awaited sequel to a best picture winner to an inspirational boxing drama to a music biopic starring an Oscar favourite, here are some of the more primed picks that failed to register:How Anora became this year’s surprise Oscar frontrunnerRead moreThe Fire InsideView image in fullscreenRyan Destiny as Claressa Shields and Brian Tyree Henry as Jason Crutchfield in The Fire Inside.Photograph: Sabrina LantosOn the same day at last year’s Toronto film festival, two rousing sports dramas premiered, both based on true stories and both released by Amazon. The wrestling pic Unstoppable might have had the edge at the time, thanks to a better-positioned slot and the headlines created by its star Jennifer Lopez, but it was the Barry Jenkins-penned boxing saga The Fire Inside that ultimately won out with critics. Yet the film, based on the incredible story of the Olympic champion Claressa Shields, couldn’t break through the end-of-year scrum with audiences or voters. The previous best supporting actor nominee Brian Tyree Henry, who plays her coach, should have been a shoo-in to repeat in that same category but he was unfairly ignored, reflecting a shift in the Academy’s move away from sports films and also a campaign that lacked the necessary aggression.Gladiator IIView image in fullscreenPaul Mescal in Gladiator II.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/APIt had appeared for a brief while that Ridley Scott’s long-awaited Gladiator sequel would be a major player during awards season. Not only had the original won five Oscars, including best picture, but early word on his follow-up was positive enough to have some speculating that it could finally be the three-time nominee’s time to win best director. But the more that people saw it, the less that felt likely and each potential nomination started falling away, from Paul Mescal to Scott to the film itself to, finally, evenDenzel Washington, who was seen as the film’s last hope. It ended up with just one nod, for best costume design, the blockbuster best picture slots swallowed up by Wicked and Dune: Part Two.BlitzView image in fullscreenElliott Heffernan in Blitz.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/APThings had seemed perfectly aligned for Blitz on paper: the directorSteve McQueen, who had been embraced by the Academy for his powerful 2013 best picture winner 12 Years a Slave, making a film about the London Blitz recruiting the four-time Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan. But the film, which was an unusual world premiere at the usually world premiere-light London film festival, couldn’t quite distinguish itself in the year’s busiest period with polite rather than enthused reviews and a confusing release strategy from Apple that made it unclear when it was out and how it could be seen. The streamer’s award wins (CODA, Killers of the Flower Moon) are starting to be outnumbered by their losses (Blitz joins Emancipation, Napoleon and Flora and Son).MariaView image in fullscreenAngelina Jolie as Maria Callas in Maria.Photograph: Pablo Larraín/NetflixThe director Pablo Larraín seemed to have found the perfect formula for securing his lead female actors an Oscar nomination: cast them in an unconventional biopic of a famous and famously misunderstood woman. It worked for Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy in Jackie and then Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana in Spencer but his luck ran out withAngelina Jolieas Maria Callas in Maria, the film scoring just one Oscar nod for best cinematography. Jolie had originally been in the conversation, scoring herself a Golden Globe nomination, but the film didn’t quite have the momentum. It was an awkward fit for buyer Netflix, a withholding drama following a figure less known to the average viewer and Jolie’s comeback narrative ultimately didn’t have the same appeal as that of Demi Moore.The Piano LessonView image in fullscreenDanielle Deadwyler and Ray Fisher in The Piano Lesson.Photograph: David Lee/APAfter the success of Fences, which helped to end the #OscarsSoWhite embarrassment of the previous two years with a win for Viola Davis and three other nominations, Netflix found success with anotherAugust Wilsonadaptation, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. It won two Oscars (for costume design and makeup and hairstyling) and had another three nominations, making yet another Wilson movie seem like an easy win. The Piano Lesson premiered at last year’s Telluride film festival to positive reviews and early buzz for Danielle Deadwyler, who had been unfairly snubbed for her role in Till, suggested she would be a surefire best supporting actress contender. But despite a few other shreds of recognition (Sag and Critics Circle noms) she missed out on another deserved Oscar nod and the film, despite being arguably the most visually expansive and well-crafted of the three adaptations, didn’t even score any technical nods. It was another swing and miss for Netflix.ShirleyView image in fullscreenRegina King as Shirley Chisholm in Shirley.Photograph: Glen Wilson/NetflixThere was barely a swing made by Netflix for this one, a long-delayed biopic of Shirley Chisholm that was demoted earlier in the year. There had been an understandable race to transfer Chisholm’s incredible story, as the first Black woman to run for US president, to the screen with Viola Davis and Danai Gurira attached to different projects and in 2021, it was announced that the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave screenwriter John Ridley would be developing a project with the Oscar winnerRegina Kingstarring. By the end of the year filming began but after reports of underwhelming test screenings the following year, an easy-on-paper Oscar play for the streamer was then shelved for the next two years and released in the spring of an election year to mixed reviews.

But her role in the rather boringly conventional war biopic Lee wasn’t enough to include her name in the final five, the kind of performance in the kind of film that might have had more of an impact 20 years ago. She had somelast-minute helpfrom her Titanic co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and the recent Oscars queenmaker Frances Fisher (whohelpedto steer Andrea Riseborough to a controversial best actress nod) but the film, which premiered at Toronto back in 2023, just didn’t have enough critical support.Joker: Folie à DeuxView image in fullscreenJoaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga in Joker: Folie à Deux.Photograph: Niko Tavernise/Niko Tavernise/© 2024 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved.A sequel to a DC Comics movie would not be typically expected to gain Oscar recognition outside of technical nods but then 2019’s Joker didn’t operate in a traditional way. After its unusual Venice premiere, it insisted its way into the conversation for the next few months whether we liked it or not, scoring Oscars for its score and the actor Joaquin Phoenix along with another nine nominations, another landmark moment for comic book adaptations after Black Panther broke through a few years before. The stage was set for a repeat with the sequel getting another Venice bow and an Oscar-nominated co-star in Lady Gaga butJoker: Folie à Deuxemerged with its middle finger up, a defiant semi-musical uninterested in giving anyone what they expected, including the Academy who shunned it in the same way that both critics and fans had.Will & HarperView image in fullscreenHarper Steele and Will Ferrell in Will & Harper.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/APLast year’s Sundance brought the kind of old-fashioned crowd-pleasing magic the festival was once known for: laughs, tears and cheers for Will Ferrell’s heartfelt road trip documentary Will & Harper. The film, which saw the actor travel across the US with his trans friend Harper Steele, ticked off the traditional feelgood boxes while also bringing something more contemporary and politically urgent in its plea to treat a maligned group with some humanity. Netflix paid a large sum for it and gave it a robust awards campaign but the doc branch have been resisting both films featuring celebrities (in the last six years the only nominee that would fall into this category would be Summer of Soul) and films from the US in general. Even the novelty submission of Kristen Wiig’s theme song couldn’t break through.HereView image in fullscreenTom Hanks and Robin Wright in Here.Photograph: © 2023 CTMG, Inc. Sony PicturesThe surprise success of Robert Zemeckis’s Forrest Gump ($678m at the global box office, six Oscar wins) led to the inevitable question of a sequel. The book it was based on did spawn a follow-up and in 2001, a draft was put together by the original screenwriter, Eric Roth, but he submitted it on 10 September 2001 and after the next day’s tragedy, it was felt that it had “no meaning” any more. Three decades later and Zemeckis, Roth and stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright reunited for something else, something that ended up feeling even less necessary than Forrest Gump 2. Here, an adaptation of Richard McGuire’s graphic novel, was another Zemeckis tech gimmick – the same room, from the same angle over time – and like his other recent films, it sank without a trace, not even a visual effects nod in sight.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesSaoirse RonanKate WinsletSteve McQueenJoker: Folie à DeuxLady GagafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was looking for a mink that had been killing his eider ducks. This image opened doors for him, leading to advert and movie work’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 12 Feb 2025 10.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 10.34 ESTShareIfirst met Guðjón Þorsteinsson through my work as a photographer for the Icelandic daily newspaper Morgunblaðið. He and his older brother, Óskar, ran a farm above the peninsula of Dyrhólaey, a couple of hours’ drive from Reykjavík. A raging storm had broken lots of power lines so the farm had no electricity. I’d heard the brothers were having to milk their cows by hand and thought I might be able to get a good picture for the paper.When Guðjón opened the door, he just said: “What do you want?” He wasn’t very friendly, though I sensed this was an act. He invited me in for coffee and I ended up getting the shots I wanted, but after they ran in the paper, someone complained that the cows looked dirty and they were taken away. Feeling it was my fault, I went back to the farm to apologise. Guðjón said: “I’m glad – I didn’t want to milk them anyway.”We became friends, and I would always stop if I was travelling past his home. On the day this was taken, in 1995, we were walking on the black volcanic beach below the farm with Guðjón’s dog, Gái. Guðjón was looking for a mink that had been killing his eider ducks. There was a moody atmosphere, it was windy and there was salty spray flying everywhere. Dyrhólaey has ahuge rock archthat you can see in the background here. I had a plane and had once flown through that hole in the cliff with a friend. Óskar wasn’t impressed by that – he said we’d encourage others to try to do the same and they’d kill themselves.He could not believe how much he got paid for acting. He called me and said: 'I have some money for you'When I looked at Guðjón, it was like seeing a whole nation in one face, right back to the Vikings. He was kind of angry that day, concentrating on finding the mink, and I was able to photograph him off guard, which is what I’d wanted. This moment just happened. He was distracted and being completely himself. I saw the shot and managed to catch the waves in the background hitting the rocks.The photograph kind of breaks the rules of framing, but it works. It was a turning point in my career. Until I took it, I felt a little like Robinson Crusoe stuck on my island. I’d try to interest editors and publishers in my work outside Iceland and they didn’t want to know. But even now, whenever I have exhibitions, curators want to include farmer Guðjón. I carried on visiting him until his death in 2006, when he was 81. I still took photos but not many, because I felt I had already captured him. I often talk about this picture in terms of songs: this was my Yesterday, and I wasn’t going to top Yesterday. I wanted to move on to my Let It Be, my Hey Jude and my Here Comes the Sun.The image opened doors for Guðjón, too. Once his face became known, he was hired for some advertisements and as an actor in a couple of movies. After doing one of them, he called me and said: “I have money for you.” He couldn’t believe how much they’d paid him. I told him: “It’s your money, not mine.” He was very happy about it, because by that stage his brother had died and he’d been living alone for a while, so he was kind of lonely and glad to have something to do. They’d made a great double-act, those brothers. Sometimes I went there just to listen to them argue. It was so much fun: they were likethe two old guys in the balcony seatson The Muppet Show.I worked for the Morgunblaðið for 44 years and only left in 2020, to concentrate fully on documenting people in the Arctic regions and the effect the climate crisis is having on their ways of life. I’ve been visiting these places for decades and photographed generations of families. As with Guðjón, I find the best pictures happen when I’ve become so familiar that these friends of mine forget what I’m doing. Then I can photograph them like I’m not really there.Ragnar Axelsson’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn:Iceland, 1958.Trained:Morgunblaðið newspaperInfluences:“W Eugene Smith,Mary Ellen Mark, Henri Cartier-Bresson,Don McCullin, the Beatles, Caravaggio, Rembrandt.”Low point:“I don’t think about things that didn’t go well in the past, that is not where I am going.”Top tip:“Follow your instincts, do your own thing, believe in your dreams.”Ragnar Axelsson’s Behind Mountains is available for pre-order fromQerndu Gallery & Publishing.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyIcelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In our system of government, it’s up to thecourtsto determine whether the president is using his power “legitimately”, not the president.Consider Trump’s freeze on all federal spending. Article I, section 8 of the constitution gives Congress the power to appropriate money, not the president.So far, two federal judges have ordered Trump’s freeze on spending stopped, pending full hearings on the lawsuits. But Trump is ignoring these court decisions and continues to freeze funds Congress has appropriated.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, says the freeze will continue even though Trump’s office of management and budget (OMB) has withdrawn the memo implementing it.Today, federal judge John L McConnell Jr ordered theTrump administrationto comply with what he called “the plain text” of an edict he issued last month to release billions of dollars in federal grants.It’s the first time a judge has expressly declared that the Trump White House is disobeying a judicial mandate.Last week, US district judge Loren AliKhan reprimanded the OMB for disregarding a similar order:It appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without actually ceasing the challenged conduct. The court can think of few things more disingenuous.On Saturday, federal district court judge Paul A Engelmayer temporarily denied Musk’s young recruits access to the treasury’s payment and data systems, finding a risk of “irreparable harm”. The judge ordered anyone who had been granted access to the systems since 20 January to “destroy any and all copies of material downloaded” from it.Another federal judge, John Coughenour, has blocked Trump’s executive order altering birthright citizenship, calling it “clearly unconstitutional”. The judge didn’t pull any punches:It has become ever more apparent that, to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals. The rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or simply ignore, whether that be for political or personal gain.Meanwhile, in a lawsuit filed on Friday, several “sanctuary” cities and counties are challenging both Trump’s executive order withdrawing federal funds from places that refuse to help carry out his immigration agenda and his justice department’s threat to prosecute any jurisdiction that refuses to comply.Plaintiffs are seeking to “check this abuse of power” by asking the courts to declare the Trump regime’s actions unlawful and prevent their enforcement.The law is clearly on the plaintiff’s side. The supreme court has repeatedly held that the federal government cannot force cities and states to adopt laws or to enforce federal mandates.But Trump isn’t budging.Over the next months, these and dozens of other federal cases will be appealed to the supreme court – either by the plaintiffs arguing that Trump is ignoring lower-court decisions, or by Trump’s justice department appealing those decisions.Then what?You have every reason to be cynical about the current majority on the supreme court. But the cases I’ve just cited, along with many others, are based on the supreme court’s own precedents that say that Trumpcannot legally do what he’s doing.The Roberts court has shown itself willing to reverse its prior opinions (see: Roe v Wade), but my betting is that at least on some of these issues the high court will rule against Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Robert ReichFree newsletterGet Robert Reich’s latest columns delivered straight to your inboxEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAll of which raises a final, perilous question: What if the Trump regime ignores the supreme court just as it has ignored lower courts?In his 2024 year-endreporton the federal judiciary, Chief Justice John Roberts anticipated this possibility, noting that judicial independence “is undermined unless the other branches [of government] are firm in their responsibility to enforce the court’s decrees”.Roberts mentioned defiance by southern governors of the supreme court’s 1954 ruling in Brown v Board of Education. Their defiance required that federal troops enforce the supreme court’s decision.Roberts then commented on more recent defiance:Within the past few years … elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings. These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.There’s no secret whom Roberts was referring to. His first initials are JD and he ought to know better. Vance graduated Yale Law School Class of 2013, and his wife, Usha, clerked for Roberts from 2017 to 2018.Yet Vance said on a 2021 podcast: “When the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say: ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’”Here’s Vance in a February 2024interviewwith ABC’s George Stephanopoulos:Vance: “The president has to be able to run the government as he thinks he should. That’s the way the constitution works. It has been thwarted too much by the way our bureaucracy has worked over the past 15 years.”Stephanopoulos: “The constitution also says the president must abide by legitimate supreme court rulings, doesn’t it?”Vance: “The constitution says that the supreme court can make rulings, but if the supreme court – and, look, I hope that they would not do this – but if the supreme court said the president of the United States can’t fire a general, that would be an illegitimate ruling, and the president has to have Article II prerogative under the constitution to actually run the military as he sees fit.”In other words, if the US supreme court rules against Trump on an important issue, there’s a fair chance the Trump-Vance-Musk regime will thumb their nose at it.What then? Impeachment isn’t a possibility because Republicans run both chambers of Congress and haven’t exactly distinguished themselves with integrity or independence.If Trump simply ignores the high court, is that the end of law?Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

But her acquittal underlines that the charges and court battle that followed were a waste of time and moneyWed 12 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 11.53 ESTShareAny woman who has been sitting in a cab and reached for the handle to find the door locked and felt their muscles instinctively tense for a split second until they hear the familiar clink of the car unlocking, even though they have been safely delivered to their requested destination, will have had an opinion onSam Kerr’s court case.Drunk or sober, when a woman gets in a taxi at night, they are keeping a close eye on the route being taken, sharing their live location, messaging friends and/or partners and sharing trip details, watching the driver. In an Uber watching the driver go off the recommended route on your phone? Watching out the window as a driver turns off the route you know makes the most sense? Logical answers flash through your mind – there must be traffic, perhaps there are road closures, maybe there’s been an accident – but they do not quell a rising fear that puts you on high alert.Sam Kerr trial: how a drunken night out revealed questions of race, power and privilegeRead moreIt’s not just in cabs either. Every woman who has walked down a street after dark has at some stage taken a longer route to stay on more populated roads, has taken a different route to stay under streetlights, has either removed their earphones or turned them off so that they can be alert to everything and everyone around them, has clasped their keys in their hand in case they need some kind of weapon.Every woman will have mentally listed the items in their bag according to how useful they could be in an emergency, will have thought about the clothes they’re wearing and what they look like that day to determine whether they might be at a higher risk, will have crossed the street when they don’t need to to check whether someone they suspect of following them does the same, will have watched their shadow to make sure no other shadows creep silently closer.These are just some of the many examples of the unspoken things women instinctively do to stay safe. There are also many examples of unspoken things people of colour and members of the LGBTQI+ community do to protect themselves at night too.I and a friend were followed home from school by three men when we were 11. We were acutely aware of it, managed to stay calm and waited until there was enough distance between us, and we had turned a corner and were out of sight before running. Each morning as a teenager, I and friends used to choose which of the two routes to school we wanted to take, one which took us down the nicknamed “Paedophile Lane” and the other down the nicknamed “Rapist Road” . I won’t go into the many examples that have followed.How often does a straight, white man consider these things? This is the question an intoxicated Kerr was attempting to ask of PC Stephen Lovell when she was sat in a police station telling him to “put your shoes in a female’s shoes. We were trapped for 20 minutes in this guy’s car.”2:37Police footage shows officer dismissing Sam Kerr claims before arrest – videoThe Chelsea player added: “You have to understand the emergency that both of us felt. Look at what happened last time when a woman accepted a police officer’s help in Clapham and got raped and killed.”Kerr and her fiancee, Kristie Mewis, said in court that they felt like they were being kidnapped by the taxi driver when he rerouted from driving them home to a police station after Kerr had “spit-vomited” out the window. He did so without telling them, they alleged.They also said that it was in fear for their lives that Mewis kicked a window out with the doors locked and the driver refusing their requests to stop. They claimed the taxi driver’s allegations of fare dodging were fabricated and that he was driving erratically. They said they had called the police themselves and had been hung up on. They questioned why, despite Mewis admitting it was her who kicked out the window, they were both charged with criminal damage. This is what preceded Kerr’s inappropriate and poorly articulated rant, which she conceded was embarrassing. “You guys are stupid and white, you guys are fucking stupid and white,” she said. “I’m looking you in the eyes, I’m looking you in the eyes, you guys are fucking stupid.”The prosecution argued that all that preceded those words was irrelevant because what she has said was there for everyone to see on video.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Start with the Metropolitan police, which was found to be institutionallyracist, misogynistic and homophobicin a report less than two years ago and has a history (including a very recent history through the murder of Sarah Everard) of failing women, seemingly ignoring two women in significant distress. They were intoxicated but that does not mean they should not have their concerns taken seriously.As Kerr and Mewis were sitting in the police station their claims were dismissed without investigation. The police did not subsequently request copies of emergency service calls, speed cameras and ANPR records were not checked, the taxi driver was taken at his word that he did not have a recording device in the vehicle and this was not checked. The taxi driver was not arrested or interviewed despite detaining the women in the taxi to drive them to the station (an action explicitly advised against in theTaxi Drivers’ Handbookwhich states: “Detaining passengers against their will in the back of a taxi over an unpaid fare, including locking the passenger in and driving to a police station, is not condoned by police and could get you in trouble.”) In addition, when the police saw a woman climbing out of a broken taxi window, they did not see the need to switch on body cams.Meanwhile, PC Lovell failed to mention any upset caused by Kerr’s “stupid and white” comments in his first statement. The Crown Prosecution Service initially decided that the evidence against Kerr did not meet the required threshold. Then, 11 months later he submitted a second statement saying he had been left “shocked, upset and humiliated”.In his closing statement, the prosecutor, Bill Emlyn Jones KC, asked the jury: “The fact you will be able to think of much worse examples of racial aggravation is irrelevant. Would we consider this a racially aggravated insult if she had said stupid and black? Of course you would, it wouldn’t even be contestable.”View image in fullscreenSam Kerr celebrates opening the scoring in Chelsea’s 2023 FA Cup final victory over Manchester United.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAExcept, that feels like a straw man argument. The likelihood of Kerr calling a black police officer “stupid and black” was and is close to zero. Had she been talking to a black male officer, who does not benefit from the same privilege as a white man, race would probably have not been brought into the equation even in a drunken rant. It’s reasonable to speculate that had a black man been in that room interviewing Kerr her concerns as a woman of colour might have been taken more seriously. And had a woman, of any race, been in the room interviewing Kerr, the likelihood is her concerns as a woman would have been taken more seriously too.What will the impact of this case be on Kerr and her very valuable image? Hopefully, not significant. People make mistakes that they may not be proud of, and Kerr certainly won’t be proud of the widely watched footage of events in the police station, but being dragged through a jury trial charged with racially aggravated harassment was an unnecessary trauma to inflict and a waste of time and money.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrMetropolitan policePoliceAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Finally, a disillusioned electorate cry: after all, two-thirds of UK voters believeLabour feels like“more of the same” compared with the previous disastrous Tory government, includingnearly halfof Labour voters. Perhaps the plan includes radical proposals to deal with Britain’s unprecedented cost of living crisis – not least given that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation projectsreal disposable incomes will fallunder Labour rule? Perhaps there’s a recognition that Britain’s crumbling public realm can never be fixed without meaningful tax hikes on the thriving well-to-do?Alas, no: the plan is “kick migrants more, just harder”. Labour has decided to lift the policies and approach of Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. It will plough up to £392m intodeporting undocumented migrants, enough money totrain more than 10,000 new nurses. The Home Office is offering migrant-bashing porn, by publishing footage of migrants being deported, and hasissued guidanceall but forbidding refugees who have taken a “dangerous route” from ever getting British citizenship, in violation of the UN refugee convention. Rhetoric is being toughened up.All of this is a panicked response to Reform UK surging in the polls. Park the moral bankruptcy of exploiting the basest prejudice of voters for political expediency. Labour is adopting a strategy that has repeatedly been proven to be disastrously counterproductive. Remember what seems like a distant universe, the coalition era? David Cameronrelentlessly pilloried immigration, stating “for too long, immigration has been too high”, blaming the failure of migrants to integrate for causing “discomfort and disjointedness” in communities.The thenLabourleader, Ed Miliband, made repeated tortured speeches about tackling immigration, rather than offering a compelling, coherent vision of how Labour would fix the country’s problems. Both succeeded in pushing up the salience of immigration, boosting Ukip, which in turn convinced Cameron of the necessity of a referendum on EU membership. That entire plebiscite revolved almost entirely around immigration, and years of poison about foreign arrivals from politicians laid the foundations for the triumph of leave. The destruction of Cameron and Miliband’s political careers had much to do with their posturing on migration rebounding.Note, too, how Rishi Sunak’s “stop the boats” campaign inevitably failed, but helped frame the national political conversation on Farage’s terms. Rather than burst theReform UKbubble, it helped deliver that party more than 4m votes in the general election.Look across the continent. In France, “centrist” president Emmanuel Macron thought he could bring Marine Le Pen’s far right to heel by raiding her policies and rhetoric. Refugees’ tents were torn down, to thecondemnation of human rights organisations. Hisinterior minister suggestedLe Pen was in fact “too soft on immigration”. But when Macron’s prime minister suggested the French felt “submerged” by immigration, that wascorrectly describedby Le Pen’s movement as evidence it had “won the ideological battle”. Le Pen and her acolytes are closer than ever to forming France’s first far-right government since Marshal Pétain.Austria’s traditional conservative People’s party became ahardline anti-migrant party, introducing aggressive preventive detention measures for asylum seekers – along with its Green coalition partners – and then making pledges to tighten asylum laws and clamp down on undocumented migrantsthe centrepiece of its election campaignlast year. The result? The far-right Freedom party – more extreme than ever – came top, with 30% of the vote, and is now set to head the government. In Germany, the shift of both government and opposition parties to embrace xenophobia culminated in the centre-right conservatives joining forces with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland toback a motionadvocating anti-migrant policies. The AfD is now second in the polls. The same story can be found in, say, the Netherlands, where the far right leads a governing coalition.Keir Starmer is in a tight spot, but a ‘Trump, baby, Trump’ strategy just won’t work | Marina HydeRead moreIndeed, which mainstream party has actually succeeded in seeing off its radical-right challengers with this approach? The reasons for its failure are straightforward. Pursuing this strategy pushes political discourse on exactly the terms desired by the hard right. Its rhetoric and policies are legitimised, but the rightwing insurgents can always outbid the mainstream and seem more authentic. Because this approach is a substitute for dealing with many of the grievances that trigger anti-migrant scapegoating – such as stagnating living standards or failing public services – the electorate is left without an inspiring alternative. If voters march to polling stations thinking about, say, immigration, rather than policies that might actually improve their lot, the anti-migrant right prospers.Data analysis has found that anti-migrant sentiment correlates most strongly not with increasing numbers of arrivals, but tabloid coverage that isnegative about immigration. That coverage, of course, is in turn fed by politicians’ statements and actions. Labour’s advisers have already illustrated their penchant for self-defeating strategies. Witness how – after Labour’s election win – Keir Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, resorted tospeeches promoting doom and gloomabout the economy. They thought this would buy public acquiescence for cuts, like the winter fuel payment, itself an example of catastrophic political rebounding.Instead, it helped suck business and consumer confidence out of the economy, helping to plunge the government into crisis. Put simply, given the absence of any clear vision for the country, Labour is floundering, its advisers offering no evidence that they know what they are doing. Bashing migrants might seem terribly clever to them, but it merely offers Farage vindication. The electorate can smell the panic, and the stench will only grow.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It will end in many tearsWed 12 Feb 2025 12.35 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 18.51 ESTShareYou would be forgiven for thinking we were back atthe Bullingdon Club, in the company of Jonty, Munty, Stiffy, Kipper, Chugger and, to use the polite version, Pig Botherer – only in this case it’s Big Balls and a guy with a history of racist tweeting. This is the sudden, startling emergence into American political life of a type deeply recognisable to Brits: that is, jaunty young men with juvenile nicknames and a firm belief they should be running the world.This being America, the class signifiers are slightly different from those in Britain. But in most regards, the cohort of young men hired byElon Muskfor his cost-cutting taskforce, the department of government efficiency (Doge), will be familiar to anyone who lived through the era of Boris Johnson’s weapons-grade flippancy or reports of David Cameron’s youthful hijinks. (Donald Trump is very flippant, of course, but his style skews locker room rather than debate chamber – or, in this case, maths olympiad.) And while politics has always run on young, volunteer energy, less common in the US, perhaps, is the imperial swagger, the sheer frivolous entitlement accompanying a crowd that has seemingly been given the keys to the kingdom.Let’s look at the lineup. The youngest of Musk’s Doge hires, Edward Coristine – online username, Big Balls – is a 19-year-old former intern at Neuralink, Musk’s neurotechnology company, who until recently appeared to be a first-year student at Northeastern University in Boston. Luke Farritor is a 23-year-old former SpaceX intern. Marko Elez, 25, used to work for X and SpaceX, and was revealed by the Wall Street Journal to have authored several since-removed tweets asserting, among other things, “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.” (Elez briefly resigned before Musk announced he’d reinstate him.)And Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old whoboosteda post on X by thewhite supremacistNick Fuentes, and whose newly launched Substack this week highlighted the perils of skipping freshman English 101 with a post entitled “Why DOGE: Why I gave up a seven-figure salary to save America.”Between them, these men have gained access to federal premises and staffing systems that govern agencies including USAid, the Department of Health and Human Services, the education and energy departments, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and contain sensitive information relating to millions of Americans. Elez was, reportedly, erroneously given overwriteaccess to the Treasury department’spayment system before it was yanked back to read-only.Of course, given thatDoge has not responded to questionsabout what, if any, security clearance these young men have gone through, read-only is bad enough. The head of Doge, hiring in his own image, has turned to young, male software engineers with startup energy and the conviction that if you understand coding, you understand life. They’ve established sleeping pods in spare offices at the federal agencies they have been engaged to gut or dismantle, so that while Musk goes on X to mock federal employees for not working at weekends, his mini-mes work round the clock.This feat would be more impressive if their online remarks and bios didn’t flag what might diplomatically be called large gaps in their skill-sets. Musk, a man with the emotional maturity of a cartoon bank robber, is leading a group of men most of whom have no government or management experience whatsoever, let alone expertise in fields governed by the agencies they have been tasked to reform. The whole scene is reminiscent of the 90s boom in management consultancy, during which new graduates stared with frank disbelief at anyone who was over 35 and still breathing. And sure enough,as reportedin the New York Times, young engineers have been overheard referring to federal employees as “dinosaurs”, who have in turn called the guys in baseball caps “Muskrats”.On X, meanwhile, Muskamplified a postpitching “autistic tech bros” against “non-binary Deep State theater kids”, and another that said what’s happening in the US right now is equivalent to “the yearbook committe and theater kid types getting rocked by a football team and chess club alliance”. Theatre kids and chess nerds are, traditionally, both categories of social death in high school that are targeted by queen bees and jocks, a case of Musk siding with the oppressor that’s even sadder when you consider that Trump isn’t even a real jock. (For a full account of Trump’s hilariously mediocre sports career relative to his claims about it,read Lucky Loserby Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig.)Anyway, we know how this ends. In the largest sense, with the cancellation of programmes mandated democratically in Congress by a bunch of unelected goons in puffer vests. And in the smallest sense, with one of these 22-year-old jerks spilling his Big Gulp cup of Mountain Dew over a keyboard at the Treasury and wiping the social security data of 70 million Americans. I look forward to watching as Big Balls and co find new ways to tank an economy even more efficiently and irreversibly than Brexit.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDogeOpinionElon MuskUS politicsUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

Will the company appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority to try to bag bigger bill rises than the pre-inflation 35% permitted by the regulator? Does special administration, AKA temporary nationalisation, loom at the end of the end of next month?Answers to the first two questions should emerge in the next week. In the meantime, here comes a subplot that in other circumstances would be the main event:Ofwat will investigatewhether Thames has breached its obligations by failing to deliver environmental upgrades on time.But, actually, this latest inquiry is revealing because it says so much about how the crisis at Thames, which has been at least a decade in the making, goes very deep. It is not primarily about the ridiculous levels of borrowing; it is about the company’s basic inability to do the day-to-day job of fixing the infrastructure.The first feature to note is the scale of Thames’s shortfall on delivering projects, which cover everything from removing phosphorus to upgrading sewage works. It is enormous. Thames was supposed to complete 812 schemes between 2020 and 2025 – and “more than 100” are unlikely to happen on time, with the deadline six weeks away. As far as we know, no other water company is so far behind. Thames blames “cost increases that are higher than the inflation index applied to our allowances”, but those cost increases will not be a south-east England-only phenomenon.Second, the facts have emerged in slow motion. Thames was having internal deliberations about cutting back on the environmental works as early as the end of 2021 and throughout 2022,the Guardian reportedlast December, but its formal notification to Ofwat was only made in August 2023. And it is only now – 18 months later – that the regulator is opening an enforcement case. Yes, Ofwat has to follow due process, but the regulatory cogs take an age to turn.Third, Thames somehow thought it appropriate to keep paying dividends – £37.5m in 2023 and £158m in 2024 – to its holding company even after it had told Ofwat it was not even close to hitting its binding targets. The regulator did jump on that manoeuvre,proposing an £18m penalty plus clawback last Decemberon the grounds the payments could not be justified by performance measures. But, again, the striking feature was the chasm between Thames’s on-the-ground performance and its board’s view that dividends were OK. It is a mindset that tries to push the crisis around the next corner.And, arguably, that is where we are again with the high court proceedings. A thumbs up to an emergency £3bn loan would buy time to pursue a restructuring that would involve haircuts for bondholders and, it is intended, the arrival of new shareholders. If such a deal emerges in the summer, prepare to hear it hailed as yet another “fresh start”, the phrase overused by Thames’s changing cast of chief executives over the years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That isn’t true: but he must grab the reins and create a government in his own imageTom Baldwin is the author of Keir Starmer, The BiographyWed 12 Feb 2025 09.24 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 13.42 ESTShare“When people say I might be gone in a year or two, they’re just making the mistake others have made about me in the past,”Keir Starmertold me recently, eyes unblinking behind his glasses.Certainly, the political careers of those who made this mistake of underestimating him now rot in graves dotted around Westminster. They include not only three Conservative prime ministers, but also his immediate predecessor asLabourleader and countless others who failed to realise how ruthless Starmer can be until – for them – it was too late.And yet, despite such salutary examples, it hasbecome fashionableonce again over recent days to portray the prime minister asa bit-part playerin his own story, or even thefigurehead of a shipbeing steered by others who mightthrow him overboardif the waters get much choppier.The reason for this has been the publication ofGet In, by Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, two serious journalists who have provided an extraordinarily detailed and sometimes bloodstained account of Labour’s transformation over the past five years, from which Starmer himself is often notably absent. Instead, the book revolves aroundMorgan McSweeney, the strategist who masterminded the party’s election landslide in July.In part, this is a function of the authors’ sources, and a genre of “inside-the-bunker” political writing which elevates the role of advisers such as Dominic Cummings above that of elected leaders who are necessarily less accessible to journalists. But even Starmer’s closest friends would also recognise this ostensibly unpolitical politician has a tendency to subcontract some of the most unpalatable aspects of a profession he entered only in middle age to people who have known little else in their lives.Starmer’s dislike of real politics is plain to see. It’s why his government has no direction | John HarrisRead moreMany of these intensely political aides and advisers instinctively cluster around McSweeney who, though not as vain or self-publicising as Cummings, has developed something akin to a cult-like status among some of them. For instance, the latest edition of my biography of Starmer describes how his admirers at party HQ began queueing outside a south London sandwich shop during the election campaign when they found out it was where their hero bought his lunch.McSweeney understands the danger of all this, not least to himself. He is particularly unhappy about quotes attributed to him comparing his boss to “an HR manager, not a leader” – or those of an unnamed adviser suggesting Starmer is merely a pretend driver sat at the front of a vehicle controlled by similarly unseen hands. The chief of staff has been at pains to point out to anyone who will listen that he only serves at the prime minister’s bidding and that this latest job is his sixth, each tailored to “different circumstances and different electorates”, for a leader whose demands of him have changed with the times.Such an analysis, however, only opens a familiar and much bigger question: if this government is not defined by the internal battles which made Labour electable, nor the campaign which won the election, for what purpose exactly was it elected?It is Starmer himself, not any backroom adviser or Labour faction, who must provide the answer. His task of building a coherent governing strategy is, of course, made more difficult by the ground shaking beneath his feet. From Donald Trump’s seismic activity on the other side of the Atlantic to the surging support here for Reform’s own rightwing populism in those “red wall” working-class seats that McSweeney had so effectively targeted during the campaign.Last week, there was some excitement when Starmer railed against the complacency of “progressive liberals” as he told cabinet colleagues they must be “the insurgents and disruptors” on behalf of working people left behind by globalisation.Some might interpret this as a sign that the government is preparing a lurch into its own kind of “Blue Labour” populism, confusing admiration for Trump’s boldness in rolling out policy with approval for content that trashes everything from net zero to the rule of law. Then, right on cue, there was a fresh wave of the orchestrated briefing Starmer loathes, this time against energy secretary Ed Miliband and the attorney general,Richard Hermer, who are among the very few in politics who the prime minister counts as friends.View image in fullscreenMorgan McSweeney in Downing Street, 10 October 2024.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockBut what was not reported from Starmer’s remarks to the cabinet last week was what he went on to say. He talked about how Britain may be the last G7 country still to have a centre-left government in the next few years and how they had a responsibility to prevent this era being “defined by rightwing populists” preaching “nonsense” about making people pay for healthcare or introducing flat-rate taxes. He emphasised the need to show “respect” to ordinary people who feel looked down upon, like his own father had been, as a necessary condition to restoring faith in the ability of progressive government to deliver real improvement in real lives.For all the focus on Brexit-backing voters, most ministers would recognise the government won’t get the economic growth it so desperately needs to achieve anything unless it does more to mitigate the deep damage done by leaving the EU. Nor, if it wants to be re-elected, can it afford to take for granted middle-class remain voters in the same way the last Labour government did with its working-class support 25 years ago.Although the government must address angerabout levels of immigration, it would be utterly counterproductive to do so by depriving British businesses and public services of skilled staff recruited from abroad. More than anything, it has to deliver on health, housing and living standards at a time when there is little money to spend and the world outside is on fire.This feels more like the authentic and necessarily nuanced voice of Starmer. Recognising the complexity and difficulty of the challenges ahead doesn’t stop the government from being “insurgent” and “disruptive”, but instead requires it to be so. His impatience for change reflects the connection he has to the real world from his own life that, unlike most of those who work for him, has mostly been spent outside politics.It is this resilient, relentlessly determined personality that now needs to become the character of the government. Starmer himself can provide the direction his government needs. And no one, whether they watch from outside Downing Street or work within it, should make the mistake of underestimating him.Tom Baldwin is the author of Keir Starmer, The BiographyExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

The orgy of earthenware was bafflingWed 12 Feb 2025 11.24 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 11.38 ESTShareHaving lived in London since 1986, it was to my shame and discredit that I’d never been to the British Museum. I was not proud of the fact. This wasn’t a one-man boycott overthe Parthenon marblesor anything like that. I’d just never got round to it. And this wasn’t good enough. So last week, at the ripe old age of nearly 58, I paid the British Museum a visit.“Ah, Mr Chiles,” exclaimed no one when I walked in, “about time!” But there must have been something trepidatious about me, because a nice chap asked if I needed any help. I stammered something about looking for room 41. A friend had told me room 41 was special, so it seemed as good a place as any to start. This room tells the story of Europe from AD300. Which was amazing and all that, except it was a story told mainly through the medium of pots. Urns, pots and assorted drinking vessels of all shapes and sizes. I moved from room 41 to other rooms, going backwards and forwards in time and to all points of the compass, and found yet more pots, urns and drinking vessels. Ornate pots, rustic pots, arty pots, functional pots.This was the history of the world told in pots. Perhaps this is how it must be, but it left me rather cold. Before long, I was suffering from what I can only describe as pot blindness. I mean, one ancient urn from antiquity is mind-boggling; a thousand of them makes each individual one that bit less interesting. Less is more. They merge into one.The younger visitors seemed more engaged than I was: they were taking selfies with the urnsSoon, my inner Trewick was stirring. For the 99.7% of readers who won’t know what I mean by that, John Trewick was a footballer, one of the West Bromwich Albion team which, incredibly, in 1978, went ona pre-season tour of China. This was the subject of a BBC documentary, The World About Us: Albion in the Orient. On a visit to the Great Wall, the players oohed and aahed appropriately. But Trewick, not so much. “Impressive, isn’t it,” he acknowledged. “But you’ve seen one wall, you’ve seen them all, haven’t you?”Whether or not this was a fair question, I can’t say. But here I was, in the British Museum, feeling that having seen one pot, to some extent I had indeed seen them all. The shame of it. Furtively, I checked for attendants or cameras on the lookout for such impure thoughts. I also looked at my fellow museum-goers, for any signs they felt the same way. If they did, they hid it well. Some stopped to stare in wonder at an urn, while I stared in wonder at them, wondering what they could see in this particular urn that they’d missed in the hundred other urns in that room alone. Everyone seemed more into it than me. Admittedly, some younger foreign visitors didn’t dally in any room for long, but even they seemed more engaged than I was, taking selfies with urns behind them, that kind of thing. One lad paced around videoing them. This seemed a bit strange but, as the odd one out in this earthenware orgy, who was I to judge?Afterwards, when I told friends I’d been to the British Museum for the very first time, they all said, “Wow, amazing, isn’t it?” To which I replied, “Well, yes and no. Isn’t it basically an awful lot of pottery?Historytold through pots, urns and assorted drinking vessels? Put it like this: if the museum was called Pottery Through the Ages, how would it look any different?” Eyebrows were raised, sighs were sighed, heads were shaken. So I’m going back to give it another go. I’ve got John Trewick’s number somewhere. I might see if he fancies coming along.Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Whether it is Elon Musk and his engineers taking the axe to US agency spending, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, wishing she had her own mini-Musk, or SirKeir Starmercomplaining about the “tepid bath of managed decline”, the complaint is that bureaucracy is bloated and needs to be cut down to size.We’ve heard such charges before. For some it is ideologically driven: they believe that the state is inherently inefficient and that only businesspeople know how to make money count. For others it is prompted by the expansion of government in response to crises ultimately caused by state undercapacity, not overreach. They were wheeled out in the 2010s, after rich states stepped in to save the banks and prop up the economies. Then came the Covid pandemic, in which rich states stepped in to save employees (through such measures as furlough) and support businesses.Last time, it was David Cameron’s team who styled themselves as “disruptors” and brought in the businessmanPhilip Green as an “efficiency guru”. This time it’s Donald Trump. Yet, measured as a proportion of all US workers,the US federal government workforce is smallerthan it was just after the second world war, when Mr Trump was born. And shifting its work to costlier private-sector operations has not been a boon.One of the great parables of the consequences of an outsider hacking away at a complex organisation is contained in a history of Britain’s trashy cable channel,Live TV. The authors,Chris Horrie and Adam Nathan, give a picture of what happened when the lifelong print journalist Kelvin MacKenzie suddenly got to be boss. Not understanding many of the technicalities of television, he would apparently charge into the studio gallery while programmes were going out live and demand staff answer his questions. “Who are you? What do you do? … If you can’t tell me in 20 seconds … you’re out.” If the programme fell off air after they’d been given the boot, he would plead with them to come back.Even Live TV’s viewers are unlikely to have been gravely distressed by its inadequacies. But government touches everyone’s lives, and in the most serious manner.“Efficiency” is not synonymous with frugality. Spending public money carefully is a virtue in itself, but running down the public sector can cause huge problems later on. As theCovid inquiryhas shown, the pandemic hit an NHS that had been run too hot for too long – and so couldn’t cope when we most desperately needed it, in spite of the enormous efforts made by frontline staff and hospital managers. Who understands best which efficiencies make sense – those who work within an organisation, or someone who has seen its budget?Not only is the public sector most essential when the private sector has failed, it is also usually among the most labour-intensive parts of the economy. And as the economist William Baumol famously showed, there is often a limit to how much productivity can be squeezed out of labour-intensive operations. Playing a piece written by Mozart for a string quartet will require four musicians in 2025, just as it did in 1925. You could speed it up, but neither players nor listeners would gain. As societies grow richer, older and more complex, they will grow bigger public sectors and they’ll need funding. That’s not always waste. Often, it should be counted as progress.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsOpinionLabourKeir StarmerKemi BadenochElon MuskDonald TrumpDavid CameroneditorialsShareReuse this content"

It was the right decision for practical and ethical reasons. The Rwanda scheme was anexpensive failurethat put Britain in breach of international treaty obligations and promised to prolong the trauma of refugees.Labour’s alternative policy is contained in the border security, asylum and immigration bill that passed its second reading in the Commons this week. Theproposed lawcreates new police powers to disrupt the traffic of small boats smuggling people across the Channel. A new border security command will have powers like those deployed in counter-terrorism operations.There is a valid rationale in focusing policy on the criminal gangs that run the illegal boat crossings – and put many lives in jeopardy in the process. And if that emphasis were matched with the creation of safe routes for people to seek asylum in Britain, the combination would start to look like a functional system – ruthless in shutting down the lethal route, humane in opening a legal one.But the second part of that proposition is absent. Worse, the government hasdiscreetly preservedone of the egregiously uncharitable features of the junked Conservative policy. In guidance for assessment of naturalisation claims, the Home Office stipulates that applicants who have “made a dangerous journey will normally be refused citizenship”. The fact of having come to Britain by unlawful means should, in the official Home Office view, mean disqualification under the test of whether a claimant is of “good character”.This implies that tens of thousands of people whose claims to asylum are recognised as legitimate and who, in some cases, have settled in the UK on that basis, are barred from becoming citizens. They will be trapped in an administrative no man’s land. This isn’t the same as the Conservative statute that barred small boat passengers from even making asylum claims in the UK – and thereby breached UN refugee conventions, which stipulate that entitlement to sanctuary is not conditional on the means of arrival in a safe haven. But there is now less divergence between theLabourand Tory approaches than was promised.The Conservatives justified their policy with a theory of deterrence. Withdrawing the prospect of asylum was supposed to discourage people from making the journey, although there was no evidence of any such effect. The undeclared motive was the hope that a performance of obstruction would appeal to voters who were abandoning the Tories for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. It looks as if Labour, facing a similar electoral challenge, has inherited thesame neurosis.TheConservativesmade bad policy that ramped up the salience of illegal migration as an issue without persuading anyone that their methods were sufficient to deal with it. Sir Keir is replicating that blunder. The error could be doubly costly. Reform will not be neutralised by yet more amplification of their favourite campaign themes by the Home Office, while many Labour supporters will be appalled. It might not be possible to design an asylum system that satisfies everyone, but one that is pragmatic and humane will garner more support than one that is neither. Sir Keir seemed to understand that in opposition. It is an insight he will regret abandoning in government.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionLabourKeir StarmerConservativesReform UKRwandaHome OfficeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Enver Solomon (Lights, camera, and a new low: why is the government making Deportation TV, 10 February) and John Harris (Starmer’s dislike of real politics is plain to see. It’s why his government has no direction, 9 February) rightly suggest that this performative attempt to take the wind from Reform’s sails will not only fail but also foster racism and xenophobia.In my articlein the RTE/Espol journal’s special edition on migration in 2022, I argued that Theresa May’s support for the Modern Slavery Act and the 2014 protocol to the International Labour Organization’s forced labour convention (no 29) had been linked to their weaponisation by anti-migration populism.Despite its legal obligations and a glaring inherent contradiction concerning these recent raids, the Starmer government appears intent on continuing that populist discourse.The ILO protocol requires victims of trafficking, even if they have been forced to perform illegal acts in their work, to be protected and compensated, not victimised further. Yvette Cooper can’t have it both ways: the government can’t justify the raids on the grounds that many of these workers are trafficked by criminal gangs and then violate their legal rights and dignity by parading them on television.Most people still arriving on small boats are seeking asylum from persecution and conflict. If the government really believes that trafficking by criminal gangs is the principal problem, it can remove the demand that fuels their existence by regularising Britain’s informal economy; by enforcement against unscrupulous employers who abuse workers, whether documented or undocumented; and by reopening routes for safe passage in compliance with its obligations under the 1951 UN refugee convention.Simon SteyneFormer senior adviser on fundamental rights at work, InternationalLabourOrganizationThe threat from Reform UK is based on the fact that a significant proportion of the electorate is disappointed with the poor state of public services and its lack of spending power, and that Reform gives it a group to blame and a simple solution (Group of Labour MPs urge No 10 to be tougher on migration to fend off Reform, 4 February). Tory governments since 2010 successfully placed the blame for the nation’s ills on EU membership, resulting in the referendum vote. That gave them repeated electoral success.Recent pollsshow that the majority now realise that leaving the EU was a mistake.The Labour government implicitly accepts Reform’s false allocation of blame on immigration for the nation’s ills and is trying to show that it will solve our problems by reducing the number of immigrants. This tells voters that Labour accepts Reform is correct.The government must refute Reform and Tory arguments, explain the real causes of low pay, housing shortages, poor NHS performance etc, and show that it has a sensible plan to address them. As long as it communicates to the electorate that its opponents are correct about the EU and immigration, it will convince voters that the Tories and Reform understand the nation’s problems while Labour does not.Gareth JonesLittlehampton, West SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromJess McQuail and Kartik RajWed 12 Feb 2025 12.09 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 12.12 ESTShareHeather Stewart’s excellent analysis (Labour must seize the moment to show child poverty matters in push for growth, 9 February) draws attention to those parts of the social safety net – housing, employment and benefits – that need to be strengthened by Labour’s child-poverty strategy. There are also two parts of the nutritional safety net, which, with the right reform, would put more money in poorer families’ pockets.First, the NHS’s Healthy Start scheme is worth at least £4.25 a week for families on low incomes with children under the age of four, enabling them to purchase fruit and vegetables, milk and pulses. Yet, at any one time, about one-third of eligible recipients are not registered for the scheme, leaving tens of millions of pounds worth of support unclaimed each year.Second, the best estimates suggest that a little over200,000 childrenin poverty in England alone are eligible but not registered for their free school meal entitlement. Feeding Britain has worked with dozens of local authorities, with support from the Department for Education, to explore ways of maximising registration rates, and one clear recommendation has emerged: a national policy of auto-enrolment, covering both Healthy Start and free school meals, should be embedded in a single application form, which, when eligible families apply for universal credit, automatically signs them up for these two schemes without the need to fill in separate applications.This modernisation of the welfare state would use data and technology to banish the low take-up of passported schemes that bedevils it and putLabourfirmly on the side of children in poverty who have previously been denied this much needed support.Andrew ForseyNational Director, Feeding BritainHeather Stewart’s article rightly stresses the need to scrap the two-child limit. Nevertheless, its removal would still leave child poverty atmore than double the rateof the 1970s. Ultimately, the level of poverty depends on how the cake is shared. It is Britain’s yawning income gap that explains its dismal record on poverty. The lesson of history is clear: poverty and inequality are umbilically linked. Britain achieved a low point for poverty in the 1970s because it also reached peak equality. This was the high-water mark of postwar egalitarianism. With the dismantling of the pro-equality strategy, Britain is back to its long-term norm of high inequality and high poverty.The scale of the task involved is shown by the “poverty gap”. This is the amount by which a particular household falls below the poverty line. This sits at about30%, or over more than £6,000 a yearfor a couple with two children. This gap stood at about 23% in the 1990s. It is a stark indicator of the inadequate share of national income enjoyed by those on the lowest incomes, and of the power of those at the top to colonise the gains from economic activity.Stewart LansleyVisiting fellow, University of BristolHeather Stewart succinctly captures the cost of further dithering on child poverty. Child poverty, however, is only one issue where the government is falling short on rights. This week, theUN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rightswill grill a UK government delegation on a wide range of issues ranging from its anti-poverty strategy to housing safety, and from discrimination in education to fair working conditions.Submissions fromJust Fair,Human Rights Watchanddozensof others groups paint a deeply worrying picture that the government must account for.The evidence is clear: for many across the UK the system is failing. People are struggling to access food, housing, healthcare, decent work and social security.One in fivepeople live in poverty in the UK; healthcare servicewaiting timesare excessive; and benefit levelsfailto allow for an adequate standard of living. Addressing these isn’t optional but a matter of fundamental human rights.The Labour government may look to shift the blame on to its predecessors, but its own decisions are part of the problem. Keeping thetwo-child limiton benefits in placeincreaseschild poverty by the day; andrefusing to accepta key recommendation of the Grenfell inquiry meansdisabled peoplein residential blocks won’t have personal evacuation plans.In 1976, the UK became a party to theInternational Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, which protects rights to health, housing, education, work and social security. But because those rights under the covenant are still not part of domestic law, those affected have no way to hold the government directly to account.

The return leg next week looked ­little more than a box-ticking exercise.What happened next was as ­curious as it was intriguing. ­Daizen ­Maeda’s header affordedCeltichope to the extent that they actually ­finished as the stronger side. ­Bayern, once so vastly superior, started to rock. Vincent Kompany’s team will still be the heavy favourites to progress from this playoff but Celtic will believe they can cause a shock.Celtic 1-2 Bayern Munich: Champions League playoff round, first leg – live reactionRead moreIt was testament to the attitude of Celtic that they did not wilt against one of the favourites for the competition. Indeed, there was intelligence and bravery on show.“I think it is a really good result,” Kompany said. “The fans here don’t see many losses so we can ­appreciate the importance of victory. We are at home now and we are also pretty decent at home.” Before that ­second leg, ­Bayern have an ­important Bundesliga game against Bayer Leverkusen.Brendan Rodgers wants his Celtic players to leave Munich with “no regrets”. The manager said: “We are still right in the tie.” That much is undeniable.A series of strong home European performances – Celtic were unbeaten in six – had raised confidence levels before Bayern’s visit. Within 30 seconds, an already fevered atmosphere had been raised a further notch as Nicolas Kühn cut in from the left and unleashed a low shot past Manuel Neuer. The problem was, Adam Idah had moved into an offside position directly in front of Bayern’s veteran goalkeeper. The goal would not stand.Bayern heeded the warning. They dominated possession for the remainder of the opening period, Leroy Sané proving a particular ­menace to the Celtic defence.Michael Olise was the first to properly test Kasper Schmeichel after a one-two with Harry Kane. Schmeichel subsequently dived to bat away a teasing Kane cross. In the stands, the vociferous Bayern contingent unveiled banners that appeared to take aim at their own club for not donning their traditional red and white strip. Bayern’s away colours were on display here. Uefa had apparently deemed the writing on Bayern’s home kit to be unreadable. Strange business.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane wheels away after scoring what proved to be the winner for Bayern Munich at Celtic.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersAlso peculiar was seeing Celtic restricted so heavily on their own pitch. Bayern’s passing, movement and physicality was a joy to behold at times. Not that they created loads by way of clear cut opportu­nity in the opening 45 minutes. Schmeichel saved excellently at point-blank range from Kane but there was an ­offside in the build‑up. In ­organisational terms, Celtic had been excellent; it was just that­crossing the halfway line was a novelty.Kane should have sent Bayern in front three minutes before the break. Instead, the England captain headed into the side-netting from Olise’s corner. Just as Bayern’s lack of ruthlessness threatened to be costly, Olise opened the scoring in emphatic style. The 23-year-old lashed a terrific, left-footed shot from 16 yards high beyond the despairing Schmeichel right on half-time. Olise had earlier benefitted from the break of the ball on the angle of the penalty area. ­Bayern fully merited their lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was to atone for it, ­peeling away from the Celtic defence to meet an inswinging Joshua Kimmich corner. Kane’s volley hit the net as Schmeichel hit the turf. This was the striker’s 29th goal of the campaign. It was also his 19th against Schmeichel. With 40 minutes of the first leg still to play, the hosts had to somehow alter the sense that the tie was over.Officialdom almost gave Celtic a helping hand. There was no appeal for a foul on Arne Engels inside the Bayern penalty area and the assistant referee originally flagged for an offside. The VAR decided that Jesús Gil ­Manzano should review the matter. After what felt an interminable delay, the Spanish official decided there was no cause to award a penalty. Replays did suggest Dayot Upamecano took the ball before minimal contact with Engels. It was puzzling, in fact, that the VAR got involved at all.Schmeichel produced a fine low block from Serge Gnabry, on as a substitute, as Bayern chased a third. Neuer’s failure to meet a back‑pass allowed Maeda an opportunity, which the Japanese forward flashed across goal.Maeda made no mistake with his next chance, affording Celtic unlikely salvation in the process. An Engels corner was met by Auston Trusty and Yang Hyunjun before landing right on the head of Maeda. He converted from close range. This time, Celtic survived a VAR check for offside.Alistair Johnston stung Neuer’s palms as seven minutes of stoppage time got under way. By the time that concluded, applause filled the air.

The system uses ­camera footage and tracking software to calculate the position of players at the moment of a potential offside, removing the need for VAR teams to manually add lines to still images. VARs may still be required to assess offside decisions in the event of a goal being scored, depending on the complexity of the assessment.Clubs voted unanimously to introduce the technology at a Premier League meeting last April, and have been frustrated by the delay. The Premier League will inform clubs of the trial at its shareholders’ meeting in London on Thursday.Scholes said last week that he had been concerned about the relia­bility of the technology until recent improvements.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe he’s just wondering if he should have worn the quilted over-gown after all.Even Total Haaland cannot stop Manchester City’s continuing nightmare | Barney RonayRead moreBut it wasn’t hard to take a best guess at Guardiola’s thoughts on Tuesday night as he caught a first glimpse of the petty, harmless but also oddly revealing tifo banner draped across the south stand before kick-off.This was a really big night for City’s manager. There has been talk of Guardiola feeling “invigorated” bythe trip to Orientat the weekend, revived by the source‑energy of the FA Cup, the entire trip a kind of Rocky Balboa training regime, Pep out there pulling a sledge full of rocks down Leyton high street, high-fiving passersby. But Real Madrid in a knockout tie: this is home, clarity, first principles, a chance to refocus every drop of mental energy at the level that defines his professional existence.Except, suddenly someone is waving a massive pre-match internet-bantz flag mocking the opposition over a bullshit individual award via the use of Oasis lyrics (Stop Crying Your Heart Out; release date 2002; peak chart position in Spain, six). And mocking specifically Madrid’s most dangerous player, who will in a few minutes be sprinting directly into the arc of a full-back Pep knows is held together with glue and string.Pep is obsessed with details, and this is at the very least one of those, and a strange one too. As City’s season continues to narrow before the second leg in Madrid next Wednesday, welcome to Anatomy of a Tifo, and what it tells us about this most confused and confusing of super-clubs.To be clear, it really doesn’t matter in itself. This is not a big deal. It’s a big piece of material. With some words on it. No lines have been crossed. Fans can say stuff. Yes, Rodri may have been surprised to find himself up there gloating at his Spanish friends and colleagues over an award received at the time with winning humility. Hmm. About those image rights.Also yes, it makes the champions of England look small and overly fixated on someone else’s reaction to your own nice moment. Even if Real Madrid started this by behaving like deranged toddlers whenRodri received the gongahead of Vinícius Júnior. And yes it looks bad on the newly founded Stay Humble Scale when you end up collapsing like a damp sheet of newspaper andlosing 3-2 at home.But it is also just some words. Football has always been a place to shout and mock and taunt people. Pep probably didn’t even notice. The Madrid players, who have six of these golden balls in the past 12 years, won’t have cared at the time. It took Vinícius an hour to find the right angles and begin the process of torturing City’s replacement right-back. He wasn’t running on banner energy.On the other hand if the Titanic has taught us anything it is to beware of constructing powerful self-propelling metaphors of doom. The tifo is significant solely because it seems to capture a moment. And to capture also the scene of an organisation slightly losing the run of itself, and in areas that actually matter.View image in fullscreenManchester City’s failure to strengthen when it was clear the squad was growing thin has left Pep Guardiola reliant on a few very good players.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAWho authorised this banner? Generally these things are created by supporters. It is unclear at the time of writing whether the club have a sign-off on content. Either City did know and thought this was a good message, which is a bit weird. Or they just let their fans decide what message to present to the watching world, which is also odd.Even this wouldn’t really matter if City were currently a happy, functioning club, redolent with good choices from top to bottom. But in a place defined, suddenly, by defeat, bad decisions and a strain of trapped internal rage, it becomes a thing. If only because City’s problems on the pitch are a product of other bad decisions, a rare and surprising loss of focus on the detail.It might be tempting to present recent on-field collapses as a product of existential angst, era decay, systems rot. But the panic spending of the January window points to a more prosaic truth, a simple failure of recruitment over the past two years. The failure to strengthen when it was clear the squad was growing thin has left Guardiola reliant on a few very good players. The Rodri tifo could equally have been a message to City’s hierarchy. Cry now. This is what you’re missing. This is what happens when you fail to buy a back-up. City have never really let the playing culture drift. It seems like a significant oversight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What image of a champion club does that banner project? Paranoid, angry, obsessed with trivia? Are these good things?Defiance has been part of the character of the club in its old and new eras. For decades City were blue-collar underdogs. To present yourself, still, as outsiders, when you have spent close to £2bn in the past 10 years and reshaped the ecosystem of English football, when you’re owned by an autocratic monarchy using the club and English football as a propaganda tool; this requires a genuine degree of cognitive dissonance.Is it good for the soul to live out this illusion for too long? Victimhood and conspiracy theory have stalked some parts of the fanbase for the past few years. The atmosphere inside the stadium is in danger of reflecting it. And that strangeness, the rage, the sense of aggressive victimhood flows right from the top.There is something paradoxical about the way City and Madrid perceive themselves. Here they come, rebel emperors, railing against the injustice of commercial rules (also known as: sport) or imagined notions of bias, kings of a world they still want to tear down. Digesting the defiant club statements, the talk of bondage within a rigged system, feels a bit like hearing Prince Andrew has got himself a smash the state tattoo and is out there moaning about nepo babies.These are the two richest clubs in the world, at a time when football has never been so rich. What is it for, this angry acquisitiveness? What is it serving when you no longer win, or play beautiful football, or create an exemplary structure? City have always been a cold project to the outsider. That sense of galvanising rage is in danger of becoming their defining energy.There is also an opportunity here for some of the club’s fans to question, just a little, the aggression of their owners; the need to takedestructive legal actionagainst your own structure; the corporate line of victory at all costs, more lawyers, total commitment to the “freedom” of very rich people to control a sport. Will it be taken up?At least the flag doesn’t matter. Flags are flags. It is in the end just noise. The most worrying sign on Tuesday was the wider, amplified sense of distraction, of a place that feels for the first time as if it is slightly losing its own strict and hugely impressive sense of order.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaBallon d'OrReal MadridcommentShareReuse this content"

Thefinal $100m was paidin December and raised his share­holding to 27.7%. It is understood United’s cash reserves would have run dangerously low without that.This difficult financial position is the reason why the Glazers, the majority owners,announced a stra­tegic reviewin November 2022. A club statement at the time said: “As part of this process, the board will consider all strategic alternatives, including new investment into the club, a sale, or other transactions involving the company.”This led to Ratcliffe’s purchase of a share in United and he has driven a series of measures to bring down costs. Last summer and autumn hemade about 250 employees redundantand he is driving the plan for this round of about 200 job losses.Ratcliffe, the founder and chairman of the petrochemicals firm Ineos, understands his decisions are unpopular but feels there is a lack of awareness outside the club regarding the full picture of United’s situation.The balance sheet is severely stressed because of what some United insiders regard as years of poor financial management but Ratcliffe is optimistic that if these painful measures are taken, United will be in secure financial health in about two years.Moves to reduce costs and restructure are designed to make United strong, financially stable and able to compete again at the top of ­English and European football. The ambition is to invest in improved facilities for players and supporters.Additional cost-reducing ­measures taken by ­Ratcliffe includeending Sir Alex Ferguson’s ambassadorial roledespite the Scot being United’s most successful manager during a 26‑and‑a‑half‑year tenure. He was paid about £2m annually.Bryan Robson, Andy Cole and Denis Irwin, prominent players under Ferguson, will reportedly have their salaries as ambassadors lowered, and Jackie Kay, the head of team logistics and an employee for three decades, is set to lose her job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some players are taking part in a cricket match on the indoor athletics track, while others are chatting to members of the public and upstairs, their head coach, Matt Peet, is relaxing with a coffee. “If someone said describe a high-performance environment, I don’t think this would be the first place you’d think of,” their former captain and assistant coach, Sean O’Loughlin, smiles.Super League 2025: team-by-team guide to the new seasonRead moreBut this is the culture and atmosphere that Peet has instilled during his three years in charge and is at the heart of Wigan’s success. A little-known academy coach when he was appointed in late 2022, Peet has gone on to win seven major trophies in just 100 games, including the quadruple last year.It was only the fifth time in rugby league’s 129-year history a teamhas won every trophyon offer. For the man who appointed Peet, it was further justification that his instinct during the Covid-19 lockdown that he had a future coaching great among his developmental staff was the right one.“I was getting abused,” Wigan’s chief executive, Kris Radlinski, says. “We would go on walks in lockdown and I’d realise he could take this club forward in a way I’d never really seen before. We had a fans’ forum and someone stood up and said if the rumours of Matt being appointed were true, he’d never watch Wigan again. He’s missed some good times.”Peet has transformed Wigan, making them arguably the world’s best club side, leading to recognition at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. Off the field he has been instrumental in making the Warriors feel different and has ensured enormous backing from the local community.That is evident from just one morning spent watching Wigan’s final preparations for the new Super League season. Robin Park doubles up as a community hub as well as the club’s unique spin on a high-performance training complex. There is a strict open-door policy, with anyone allowed in to interact with players.Of course, there are moments when it is strictly business, which comes later in the day. But when the doors are open, so too are Wigan’s. The result, Radlinski and O’Loughlin – two proud Wiganers – believe, is an energy around the town they have never seen, underlined by a surge in attendances since Peet took charge.View image in fullscreenWigan’s Kruise Leeming lifts weights in training.Photograph: Wigan WarriorsThey have also been handed a remit from the owner, Mike Danson, about what success looks like in 2025 after such a historic campaign. “Mike told us that winning trophies is great, but you’ll be judged next year on the impact around the town and the things we can do in people’s lives,” Radlinski says. “To hear from your boss that winning trophies isn’t as important as the impact you can have on people shows the emphasis we’re putting on it. We want to really try to address some of the inequalities in the town. We’re in this tricky position of trying to change the world by going to Las Vegas [for their home fixture against Warrington] but staying true to our roots. But we’ll never forget that.”On any Tuesday, Wigan’s afternoon schedule is blocked out. They sacrifice a training session to go into the community and give something back. “Matt has had a huge push on us connecting with the community,” O’Loughlin says. “We have started to notice the good feel around Wigan. People are just enjoying supporting Wigan; I think they’re proud to be Wiganers.”Wigan, alongside Leigh, hope to raise £1m for local charities on Thursday in front of the biggest opening-night crowd in Super League history. But mid-morning here, the relaxed mood shifts when it’s time to head over the road to the Brick Community Stadium for Wigan’s last on-field hour before the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Learning days involve the players studying their own footage and reporting back to the coaching staff, such is the trust he has in his squad. Long gone are the days of being cramped into a room and watching an entire game back with screaming and shouting inside Robin Park.But this is categorically a sharpen day. “It’s a different experience to when I played,” Radlinski admits. “I had a military existence of ‘turn up at this time, do this, eat this’. But Matt trusts everyone and he lets the leadership group decide how our programme should be shaped. It’s relaxed without doubt, but when it’s time to work, we work.”And Wigan do work. There is an immediate shift in intensity as the final touches – not led by Peet, but by O’Loughlin and fellow assistant Tommy Leuluai in another sign of trust – are applied. Wigan’s academy coach, Matty Smith, gives an approving nod from the touchline when they score a try as if to imply this group are ready to start their pursuit of history all over again.There is a lot to come over the next couple of months, including the historic trip to Las Vegas. Radlinski is acutely aware that showcase for the game in the US matters immensely for the whole sport, but he is also keen to ensure the local community, who perhaps cannot afford to make that trip, are part of the occasion. Thursday’s opener will start to address that.The question will be asked a lot of Wigan this year: how do you improve on perfection? “I think it’s just the start,” offers Radlinski. “They’re ordinary, hard-working people so they’re so humble, I think they can go on to achieve even greater things. And at the heart of it all, they know they’re doing it for the town. The people of Wigan. That’s what drives us.”Explore more on these topicsWigan WarriorsRugby leagueSuper LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

León then appears to say something to her opponent. It thenspiralled out of control.León was condemned for her perceived actions by some and a torrent of horrific online abuse was aimed at Caracas followed by others. Espanyol released a statement shortly after the footage began to circulate and gain traction expressing their “complete discontent and condemnation” of what they described as an “unacceptable” incident. The club said the incident should “not be overlooked” and that they would make their legal services available to the Colombia international should she wish to take legal action.As any woman in the back of a locked taxi knows, Sam Kerr should never have been brought to court | Suzanne WrackRead moreLeón responded by denying any wrongdoing. “As the images show, it was part of a playing action in which she deliberately touches me and I touch her leg saying in reaction to the clash: ‘what’s up with you’,” she said. “There is NO contact with her private parts, and certainly no intention. I insist, it was just part of the game that does not warrant the importance that has been attached to it.“The idea of touching the private parts of a colleague would never enter my head, it goes against my principles and I would never do such a thing.” She added: “I condemn the harassment that Daniela appears to have been suffering on social networks, which has nothing to do with me, and I offer her my most sincere support.”Espanyol’s head of women’s football, Dolors Ribalta, subsequently said in an interview on the radio show El Partidazo de Cope that León had not been in contact with the club or Caracas, who is in shock, adding that León’s “statement has come out too late” and that “it is a very clear image”.The club have left the decision on what, if any further action will be taken in the hands of Caracas. Regardless of what happens next, the online abuse faced by Caracas has been a damning indictment of a rapidly changing women’s football landscape.View image in fullscreenDaniela Caracas of Espanyol in action during the Liga F football match with Barcelona.Photograph: Judit Cartiel/SPP/ShutterstockOnline abuse is becoming an increasingly familiar problem. The digital harassment of the player came days after Khadija Shawfaced racist and misogynistic abusefollowing Manchester City’s 4-3 loss to Arsenal. Barbra Bandafaced unfounded speculationover her gender and a torrent of misogynistic and transphobic abuse after she won the BBC women’s football of the year award for 2024. Lauren James has spoken about the impact of the racist abuse she has received onlineseveral times. Is it a coincidence that all these players are black? Unlikely, and that is an issue that needs further discussion, alongside the question of how we protect Caracas and players suffering similarly.Women’s football has a duty of care to protect players from hate-fuelled abuse and clubs and governing bodies at all levels must urgently explore how they do that, while acting on combating the root causes of views that spawn it. Lip service is not enough.The reality is that as women’s football grows and becomes more mainstream, increasingly the multifaceted elements of society will become part of its ecosystem. Football doesn’t exist in a bubble, it exists within the context of the world we live in, encompassing all its ills as well as positive elements.For a long time, women’s football has been able to exist in somewhat of a bubble audience-wise. Why? Simply, because it took a certain level of political liberalism or progressiveness to buck the trend and back women playing football. In that climate, those responsible for the game could get away with a lack of a plan for tackling online abuse and its causes and be solely reactive to isolated incidents that occurred.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An MIT graduate, Sgamma has been a leading voice for the fossil fuel industry, calling for fewer drilling restrictions on public lands that produce about 10% of US oil and gas.If confirmed by the Senate, she would be a key architect of Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda alongside the interior secretaryDoug Burgum, who leads the newly formed National Energy Council that Trump says will establish US “energy dominance” around the world. Trump has vowed to boost US oil and gas drilling and move away from Joe Biden’s focus on the climate crisis.The former interior secretary David Bernhardt relocated the land bureau’s headquarters to Colorado during Trump’s first term, leading to a spike in employee resignations. The bureau went four years under Trump without a confirmed director.The headquarters for the 10,000-person agency was moved back to Washington DC under Biden, who installed the Montana conservationist Tracy Stone-Manning at the bureau to lead his administration’s efforts to curb oil and gas production in the name of fighting the climate crisis.Sgamma will be charged with reversing those policies, by putting into effect a series of ordersissued last week by Burgumas part of Trump’s plan to sharply expand fossil fuel production.Burgum ordered reviews of many of Stone-Manning’s signature efforts, including fewer oil and gas lease sales, an end to coal leasing in the country’s biggest coal fields, a greater emphasis on conservation and drilling and renewable energy restrictions meant to protect a wide-ranging western bird, the greater sage grouse. Burgum also ordered federal officials to review and consider redrawing the boundaries of national monuments that were created under Biden and other presidents to protect unique landscapes and cultural resources.Sgamma said on social media she was honored to be nominated.She said she greatly respects the agency’s work to balance multiple uses for public lands – including energy, recreation, grazing and mining — with stewardship of the land. “I look forward to leading an agency that is key to the agenda of unleashing American energy while protecting the environment,” she wrote on LinkedIn.But environmentalists warned that Sgamma would elevate corporate interests over protections for public land. “Kathleen Sgamma would be an unmitigated disaster for our public lands,” said Taylor McKinnon at the Center for Biological Diversity, adding that Sgamma has “breathtaking disdain for environmental laws, endangered species, recreation, or anything other than industry profit”.Trump interior department directive raises fears for national monumentsRead moreThe Wyoming governor, Mark Gordon, said Sgamma’s nomination was an “excellent choice”.“I know she is well-qualified and knowledgeable when it comes to Wyoming, the West, and multiple use of public lands,” Gordon, a Republican, said in a statement.Trump nominated Brian Nesvik to lead the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which also is under the interior department and helps recover imperiled species and protect their habitat.Nesvik until last year led the Wyoming game and fish department, where he pushed to remove federal protections for grizzly bears. That would open the door to public hunting for the first time in decades after the animals bounced back from near-extinction last century in the northern US Rocky Mountains.TheBiden administrationin its last days extended protections for more than 2,000 grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone and Glacier national parks, a move that was blasted by Republican officials in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOilOil and gas companiesUS politicsFossil fuelsBiden administrationClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

And as for my 6pm crisps fix – forget itEmma BeddingtonWed 12 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 10.08 ESTShareThe scale of plastic pollution is so terrifying, I mostly try to avoid thinking about it, but some facts stop me in my tracks. According to theUN Foundation, there is already enough plastic in the oceans to fill 5m shipping containers – and if production continues at its current rate, by the middle of this century there will be more plastic in the sea than fish. It is also indestructible – all the plastic ever made is still here, decomposing into microplastics that contaminateevery corner of the planet– includingour bodies. And it’s not just a case of somehow finding a way to “clean it up”. “Plastic pollution is now altering some major processes at the scale of the entire Earth system,” theStockholm Resilience Centrereported, chillingly, in November.In the UK alone, our plastic waste problem is mindblowing: in its 2024Big Plastic Count, Everyday Plastic got almost 225,000 people to count their plastic waste for a week; the final tally was over 4.6m pieces.Is there anything individuals can do about a problem on this scale? I’m pessimistic, but my editor wants me to give it a try: she challenges me to eliminate single-use plastic (SUP) for a month. Uneasily, I agree.View image in fullscreenIf unchecked, plastics will replace the amount of fish in the sea by the middle of this century.Photograph: BIOSPHOTO/AlamyWeek 1Single-use plastic is all the stuff that you use once, then throw away or recycle, from moisturiser tubes to milk cartons. Starting out, I complacently believe I don’t consume that much of it.I already use York’s “weigh and pay” store, theBishy Weigh, for refills of cleaning products, laundry stuff, shower gel, nuts and pulses; I buy bread, milk and vegetables at the market, get a veg box delivered, and have a cupboard full of plastic containers I reuse until they fall apart. Having the time and money to do that is a privilege – and living in a city with lots of similarly privileged folk means those resources are available. I’m lucky.Even so, going through my house and tallying up the SUP reveals piles of it, from the bathroom to my office and worst of all, the fridge-freezer. It’s packed with plastic: mostly sachets and pots with film lids. My supermarket shop includes salads, stir-fry veg, fruit, frozen peas, chips, fruit and crisps, all encased in protective plastic cocoons. According to Alison Colclough of Everyday Plastic, this tallies with the Big Plastic Count’s findings: “The two big hitters were soft plastic from snacks and soft plastic from fresh fruit and veg.”Why is flexible plastic so ubiquitous? Because it’s engineered to be excellent at its job. “Flexible plastics save a lot of food waste,” says Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at UCL and founder of itsPlastic Waste Innovation Hub. These wrappings are “managing the humidity inside the package, allowing water to pass through, but they’re also a barrier to oxygen, and oxygen ages food very quickly.”Adam Herriott, from waste-prevention charity Wrap, agrees that food wrapping is sometimes better than food waste. However, a2022 Wrap studyfound that for apples, bananas, broccoli, cucumber and potatoes, the impact of plastic packaging on shelf life was demonstrated to be minimal. What actually made a huge difference was refrigerating at 4C. Wrap is asking supermarkets to ban plastic wrapping for21 grocery productsand to sell them loose.View image in fullscreenSome 70% of UK food and drink is plastic wrapped.Photograph: Radharc Images/AlamyAppropriately inspired, I head to my nearest supermarket, M&S. Beyond tinned stuff, pickings are dismal: apart from onions, garlic and leeks, the only vegetables I find loose are two types of cabbage. Morrisons is much the same: some loose fruit, but almost all veg is wrapped. Waitrose does slightly better: we get cauliflower, broccoli, sprouts, carrots and mushrooms.It’s quickly apparent in supermarkets how many aisles are off-limits – many of them entirely made up of bright, convenient, indestructible flexibles and films. Some 70% of UK food and drink is plastic wrapped – 51% of thisunnecessarily so, according to one study.Emerging with a trolley of tins and loose carrots, our weekly shop is cheaper than usual, but what’s for dinner? We add pasta, rice, lentils and oats at the zero-waste shop, but the real revelation is our local greengrocer,Millie’s, where there is far more unpackaged fruit and veg. Meals take plastic-free shape: oats and nuts for breakfast, homemade hummus with lunch when I can be bothered, or tinned soup and toast. Green stuff isn’t plentiful – and salad is basically impossible. When I was in Italy in November you could buy beautiful loose salad leaves in paper bags, I rant, boringly, to anyone who will listen. Dinner is as boring as I am: we cycle through baked potatoes and beans, brassica-based stir-fries and pasta and sauce – all fine, but not every night.Sweet treats are easy – York is 90% artisanal bakeries – but it rapidly transpires that I’m dependent on my 6pm crisps for my mental equilibrium. I trial hummus with carrot sticks (dull), plain nuts (depressing) or bougie olives in tins (ruinously expensive). None of them scratches the itch.I’m exasperated that teabags come in inner bags for “freshness”: I have open boxes that have done three house moves with me and they still taste fine (I know because I’m reduced to finishing them). Thankfully, before things get really unpleasant, I track down plastic-free teas (thank you,Clipper) in a local health food shop.Week 2Desperate for crisp-adjacent snacks, I get peanut crackers and something called “paprika twists” at the weigh-and-pay shop. The latter are dreadful: dusty, sad, with the barest memory of crunch. I eat them all anyway.View image in fullscreenFlexible-plastics recycling bins are a step in the right direction.Photograph: Mark Boulton/AlamyIs there actually any point to this exercise, I wonder, crispless and cross. “I’d say yes,” says Herriott. He explains that eliminating plastic is the first step towards stopping the global plastic mountain getting any bigger. Then, the waste-reduction hierarchy of reduce, reuse and recycle should kick in. “Most people default to recycling because that’s convenient,” he explains, and it’s true that I rely on the fact I can put hard plastics – all those tubs and pots – in my recycling to assuage my guilt, but it’s animperfect solution. Breaking down plastics for recycling canincrease their toxicityand much of the global north’s plastic waste ends up inpoorer countries to be dealt with. With this in mind, while the flexible-plastics recycling bins outside supermarkets seem like a step forward, it’s worth remembering that they are limited in number, and also flexibles can only be “downcycled” (used, for example, to make bin bags) not “closed-loop” recycled (made back into food packaging). An investigation byEveryday Plasticslast year placing trackers in waste in storefront containers cast doubt on the efficacy of this system, finding a proportion was being incinerated or exported. Herriott is emphatic it’s worth doing anyway: “Downcycling is necessary for things to happen,” he says, and recycling flexibles “shows recyclers this material is here.” Still, everyone agrees that using less is the best option, so I stagger on.Crisps aren’t the only head-scratcher; I struggle with household stuff. I already get washing-up and laundry liquid refills, plus paper-packed bamboo loo and kitchen roll (a decent eco option, according to the Radio 4 consumer showSliced Bread). The compostable dish sponges the Instagram algorithm (which swiftly cottons on to my new obsession) recommends are fine. But bathroom bits are trickier: good luck sourcing plastic-free ibuprofen. Shower gel and shampoo refills are widely available if you’re not fussy (I’m not) and I won’t run out of moisturiser this month (Ethique and the Body Shop offer good plastic-free options if I do, according to an Instagram reel from sustainability bloggerMoral Fibres).Dental stuff, though, is a nightmare. Toothpaste tablets in a glass jar are awful, like brushing your teeth with a Trebor mint. My normal floss comes in cardboard boxes, but inside, the roll is packed in a tiny plastic bag. I upgrade to a metal dispenser and silk floss and switch to bamboo-based interdental brushes (you remove and recycle bristles, compost the body); they’re fine, but a further expense. So are “recyclable” toothbrush heads, which need to be returned to the manufacturer for recycling. Researching, I realise they arerecycled into walking sticks, not more toothbrush heads. The whole sector feels opaque and unsatisfactory: another “eco” toothbrush manufacturer I’m algorithmically advertised turns out not to have recycled any of its brushes yet because they haven’t reached “critical mass”.My fail of the week: on a Sainsbury’s dash, my brain switches off entirely imagining my Friday night martini and I buy a bag of ice cubes. The shame.View image in fullscreenSome of Emma’s purchases made over the month couldn’t avoid being plastic.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianWeek3My weekly get-out-of-vitamin-jail card is salad in “home compostable” bioplastic bags in my Riverford veg box. Unfortunately, I discover UCL investigated home compostables in 2022 and the results were “just bad,” as Miodownik, who conducted the research, explains. Although these bioplastics compost under lab conditions, 60% of the study participants whoattempted it at home failed. “It’s just not a good solution,” says Miodownik. I can’t bear to quit, but unable to guarantee my compost is up to scratch, I send the bags back to Riverford, which composts them itself (I check, and they confirm, sending me a photo of their compost heap).To vary my brassicas ‘n’ beans diet, I peruse my freezer, unearthing berries from last summer and long-forgotten curries. Deprived of biscuity things and other treats, we bake apples (good) and roast our own nuts (meh, they’re no crisps). “It’s probably forcing you to eat a lot less processed foods,” says Herriott when we discuss the snack shortage, and I sanctimoniously tell him that, actually, I miss beansprouts and baby spinach. It’s true, but I miss big Hula Hoops more.Carefully selected takeaways relieve the monotony: pizza works, and our local Korean serves bibimbap in cardboard boxes. Unfortunately, when I collect, I realise the bag I thought was paper is plastic, so that’s my fail of the week.Week4Planning a day trip, I recall that in aGerman studywhere a small group kept diaries of their attempts to reduce their SUP use, commuting and travel was one of the most challenging areas. “You have to plan your trips differently,” Melanie Jaeger-Erben, who conducted the study, tells me. So I do, bringing my usual water bottle, but also a reusable coffee cup and snacks. My bag weighs a ton. Despite this, I end up adding to my plastic count, when the Lebanese treats I always pick up in London come in a box with a plastic window rather than their usual paper bag.I’m exasperated that teabags come in inner bags for freshness. I have boxes that have done three house moves and taste fineBack home, I’m struggling. I’m a vegan, so easy protein is usually tofu, which is now off limits. I consider, research, then abandon the idea of making my own: I can’t find soya beans that aren’t in plastic and the coagulant also comes in plastic sachets. Someone tells me chickpeas and lemon juice work as substitutes, but by this point, I’ve lost the will. I become a lunch nihilist, joylessly chomping jars of cold lentils, like a plastic-free Huel.I’m guilted into another fail: I can’t bear our baby tortoise’s sulky face when presented with foraged dandelions, so treat him to the plastic-wrapped chicory he loves. He falls on it with unprecedented savagery.Week5Trudging to the finish line, the one bright spot is the arrival of Two Farmers crisps inhome-compostable bags; the catharsis of crunch returns to 6pm. Thinking guiltily of Miodownik’s research, I put the empties aside to compost in spring, when I vow to get our bin up to a high enough temperature for decomposition.Despite all these efforts, my final box of plastic shame contains 20 items. It’s a combination of stuff beyond my control (boxes of matches bought online arriving plastic wrapped), medical necessity (ibuprofen, HRT), “lesser of two evils” rationalisations (I eat some tofu well past its best-before date) and the various other failures catalogued above.View image in fullscreenEmma and evidence of some of her ‘fails’.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianI can achieve a low – not a no – plastic existence, but there’s a massive sacrifice of convenience and money. Online shopping is out (except for specialist sustainable suppliers) and so, more or less, is supermarket shopping. Busier people, especially those with caring responsibilities, will find that impossible. “A packed life leads to packed things,” as Jaeger-Erben puts it. Even experts struggle: Miodownik describes his “Jekyll and Hyde existence”: weekends thoughtfully buying loose produce at markets, but a midweek dash to feed his kids (“I’m rushing to the local shop and I am not questioning”). The waste minimisation team atSt Nicks, a York-based environmental charity I’m a trustee of, tried a plastic-free month in 2021; waste and recycling manager Sam Taylor says the worst bit was “the amount of planning. You’re going around three or four places trying to get your basic staples.” She ate, she recalls, “a lot of risotto”.I’m angry with supermarkets – stop wrapping oranges! – and with governments. Consumers won’t just choose to sacrifice their convenience; reducing plastic use needs to become the easy (arguably only) option. “I always say structures need to come first,” Jaeger-Erben says. Miodownik agrees. “If the government were to say, ‘No, sorry, the environment is more important than your choice,’ I think people would grumble for a couple of years then they’d just get used to it.”There are two elements, Miodownik thinks, to effecting fundamental change: “government legislation and innovation”. He’s hopeful for “meta materials”: changing the structure of a polymer so it can do all the things that currently require three to nine different materials in plastics. That would make “closed loop” flexible-plastic recycling a reality: “This is really exciting work,” he says, but for it to be viable at scale, non-recyclable plastics need to be taxed more. Other research is exploring replacing SUP withseaweed derivativesand variousnatural fibres, but reducing use will always be a vital part of the solution.Even so, I recognise the “deep ambivalence” participants in Jaeger-Erben’s study reported. “I avoided buying snacks, potato chips or my beloved coconut water, thus reducing single-use plastic consumption,” one said. “However, this is not a long-term option, as I already limit myself in other areas of life to reduce my ecological footprint (vegan, no flights, vacation travel only by train, no car, sharing of living space, mobility in the city only by bike, secondhand purchases whenever possible …). I’m notthatvirtuous, but I try hard to live low-carbon and trying to eliminate SUP is hard and boring – it fills me with a mutinous kind of, ‘Why me?’”Why not me, though, since I can? The four loyalty cards I’ve mysteriously accumulated for the Bishy Weigh are filling fast and I’m a regular at the greengrocer now. Still, when the month ends, there’s no denying the guilty thrill of chucking a six-pack of Seabrook sea salted crisps into my shopping basket. My life isn’t packed, but my treats are.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The new restrictions also require all Noaa employees and affiliates to document “all international engagements” in an internal spreadsheet for approval by a Trump political appointee on a case-by-case basis.“We haven’t stopped anything yet,” the scientist said, but “it’s a crazy amount of stuff to do. Working internationally is so routine, it’s just hardly thought of.”View image in fullscreenA meteorologist monitors weather activity on a computer screen at the Noaa Center for Weather and Climate Prediction headquarters in College Park, Maryland, on 5 December 2024.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images“It’s a difficult time to be a federal employee right now,” said the scientist, who did not want to be named.The Noaa directive did not outright bar its scientists from continuing ongoing international collaboration, but the additional administrative burden appears to be especially onerous for the National Weather Service (NWS) – the division of Noaa that underpins all weather forecasting in the US and provides a constant stream of data on the atmosphere and oceans to the world for free as a public good.A climate scientist at the EU’s Copernicus agency, who did not wish to be named, said he was “appalled and saddened” when he heard the news last week. “The climate crisis knows no boundaries, and halting international scientific collaboration can only undermine our ability to understand and combat it.”Staff within Noaa are also preparing for further budgetary and staffing cuts which would place further strain on the agency. According to reporting from CBS, “current employees have been told to expect a 50% reduction in staff and budget cuts of 30%”.Before he was confirmed as the director of the office of management and budget last week, Project 2025 architectRussell Voughtproposeda 38% budget cut for Noaa to “to curb excessive mission creep in key agencies, halt steadily increasing climate extremism within the department, and eliminate the prioritization of woke agendas”.Other policy experts within Trump’s inner circle want to privatize the NWS. Arecent studyfound that for every dollar invested in the National Weather Service, it produces $73 in value to the American people (and more to the world through freely available public data access).Because the NWS is so valuable to society, Greg Carbin, who until recently served as the chief of the forecast operations branch for the NWS’s weather prediction center, said the restrictions at Noaa cannot be seen to be strictly a cost-saving measure.“Cutting these services now would be a reckless decision that would cost far more in lives and damages than it would ever save on a balance sheet,” said Carbin. “Investing in weather and climate services is not a cost – it is an essential safeguard for the nation’s security, economy and wellbeing.”The steps appear to be part of a larger coordinated effort by theTrump administrationto reduce government spending and reprioritize federal efforts away from the climate crisis.Earlier this month,Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge), placed the head of Noaa’s human resources teamon administrative leaveand initiated anagency-wide purge of activitiesrelated to diversity, equity and inclusion. According tofurther reporting, Noaa staff have also been recently asked to compile lists of all climate-related programs the agency currently operates or funds.Sources within Noaa say that the additional administrative burden, combined with an ongoingfederal hiring freezeand additional anticipated staff and budget cuts, will hamper ability of the US to maintain a functioning public weather service. It could also result in a restriction in the freely available use of Noaa data abroad, which could have a profound global impact.“Accurate forecasts protect lives, mitigate billions of dollars in disaster-related damages, and enable businesses, from agriculture to transportation, to operate more efficiently,” said Carbin.Trump picks former chief entangled in ‘Sharpiegate’ to lead NoaaRead moreEuropean scientists who work with Noaa said they were worried by what they had heard from their US colleagues, but were waiting to hear what the changes would mean in practice for their work.“One of the most concerning aspects of this situation is the availability of US datasets for environmental science, particularly in weather forecasting and climate science,” said Nicolas Bousserez, an atmospheric scientist at Copernicus, who was not speaking on behalf of the agency.Bousserez, who has collaborated extensively with Noaa andNasa, said it was not yet clear whether access would be restricted but that “such an extreme scenario remains plausible and could have significant consequences”.The US has played an outsize role in climate and weather science for decades, particularly in fundamental climate observations, said Peter Thorne, a climate scientist at Maynooth University who has collaborated with Copernicus and Noaa. “It’s not as if in a worst case of Noaa going dark, everything would be sent into an existential crisis ... [but] it would not be pretty.”Noaa did not respond to a request for comment.The NWS usually employs about 4,500 scientists and technicians but is struggling to keep itself fully staffed. Noaa has a sprawling mission that spans the entire globe, but is primarily focused on maximizing science’s benefit to society.“If the proposed cuts to Noaa and NWS are enacted, the consequences will be severe,” said Carbin. “It will lead to less accurate and slower weather forecasts and warnings–putting lives and property at risk.”One senior Noaa official estimates that “hundreds” of Noaa staff have already accepted a federal buyout offered by the Trump administration.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS weatherUS politicsDonald TrumpNasaShareReuse this content"

SSSIs are nationally or internationally important places for rare wildlife and habitats, meet strict criteria and are then usually protected from almost all possible development.But in the past three financial years up to and including 2023-24, Natural England has designated just two new sites.Wildlife campaigners say thatMiddlewick Ranges, a former Ministry of Defence firing rangeearmarked for 1,000 new homesdespite being the second-best site in the country for rare nightingales, is one of a number of threatened, wildlife-rich places that should have been made an SSSI in recent years.According to ecologists, the site on the southern fringe of Colchester meets or exceeds the scientific criteria for an SSSI in six categories: for its endangered nightingales, rare barbastelle bats, range of invertebrates, rare acid grassland, waxcap fungi and veteran trees. Listing it as an SSSI would protect it from development, but in the current political climate might add to accusations that wildlife regulators are blocking development.The site may now be saved because Colchester city council hasrecommended removing it from its local planfor the allocation of new housing.Miles King, of thePeople Need Naturecharity, said: “It’s rather ironic that it should be a council that is highlighting the importance of this site rather than Natural England.”According to King, Natural England has been cowed by recent Conservative government budget cuts and threats to abolish it, andnow by the anti-nature rhetoric of Labour.He said: “The most important job Natural England have as a regulatory body is notifying SSSIs. We know it makes a huge difference to the survivability of the habitats in the future.”He called on Natural England to designate Middlewick and other nature-rich places as SSSIs as soon as possible, “if nothing else to show that they exist and they are performing their regulatory function. Unfortunately ‘regulation’ is a dirty word now”.Sources close to the council’s decision on Middlewick say that Natural England experts played a crucial role in assembling evidence that convinced councillors of the site’s national importance for nature.The rate of Natural England’s SSSI creation has slowed in recent years after highs of 10 new SSSIs in 2011-12, eight in 2018-19 and six in 2020-21.Jamie Robins, programmes manager of Buglife, drew up a scientific case for the SSSI designation of Middlewick and theSwanscombe peninsulain Kent, which wasmade an SSSI in 2021. Its listing helped halt plans for a theme park on the Thames estuary site.Robins said Natural England’s designation of sites listed in their “designation pipeline” was “painfully slow”.“Natural England seem to have ground to a halt with SSSI notification across the country in recent years, largely because an underfunded organisation barely has the capacity to even monitor and review the status of their SSSIs, as has been well documented. Every new SSSI they notify creates a bigger workload,” he said.According to analysis of Natural England data by Miles King, from 2016 to 2019,when Tony Juniper became chair, the average time it took to designate 12 SSSIs after they had been proposed was 0.92 years. In the six years from April 2019 to Feb 2025, the average time from proposal to confirmation for 11 new sites was 2.7 years. A further 13 sites proposed since April 2019 have not yet been confirmed as SSSIs.John Holmes, strategy director for Natural England, said: “We base every SSSI designations decision on robust evidence, underpinned by scientific advice, and, as such, assessments can run over several years. However, the scale of our current SSSI programme has remained consistent over the last decade.”According to Natural England, the Covid-19 pandemic significantly affected the designation process, stopping evidence-gathering. In several complex cases, delays were exacerbated by evidence becoming outdated, requiring resurveying. The most recent SSSI designation,West Penwith Moorsand Downs in Cornwall, was the biggest designation for seven years and was the focus of the organisation’s efforts in 2022 and 2023.In 2024, Natural England’s resources were taken up successfully defending a legal challenge to the designation, which wascontroversial among some local farmers.There isa list of 22 proposed new SSSIsunder consideration, including Flamborough Head in East Yorkshire, Prees Heath in Shropshire and Savernake bat tunnel in Wiltshire, but not featuring Middlewick Ranges. Natural England is not committed to designating all proposed sites.Some potential designations are contentious, such as Wensum Woods in Norfolk, which stands in the way of the favoured route for the controversial and recently mothballed Western Link road. Norfolk county council last monthwithdrew its planning application for the road, citing intervention from Natural England. The government watchdog provided the council with new evidence of the national importance of barbastelle bat populations in the area afterbat surveys by local ecologists and charities.Norfolk county council is now lobbying the Department for Transport to restart the road-building project, but if Wensum Woods were designated as an SSSI it would compel planners to find an alternative route.A Defra spokesperson said: “Protecting the natural environment is at the heart of our vision for making space for rare habitats and threatened species to thrive. That’s why we are investing £400m to plant millions of trees and restore peatlands and have wasted no time in establishing a rapid review of our plan to achieve our legally binding targets for the environment, including measures to improve the condition of protected sites.”Explore more on these topicsNatural EnglandConservationWildlifeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He had been referred to Prevent in 2014 by his school and his case was adopted amid concerns he could have an interest in violent Islamism.His case was closed in 2016 after he had been referred to the Channel scheme for those deemed most at risk of radicalisation.The Prevent learning review published on Wednesday found the decision to close Ali’s case had been taken too soon.Far from being deradicalised, Ali went on to consumeIslamic Statepropaganda and in October 2021 attacked Amess, 69, with a knife 21 times as he held a Southend West constituency surgery in a Leigh-on-Sea church. Ali told an onlooker he was doing it for Syria.Amess’s family had a copy of the review last year and wanted it to be made public. Prevent learning reviews are usually kept secret.His widow, Lady Amess, said on Wednesday that a public inquiry was needed. “I am very pleased that the failures of Prevent are now in the public domain – we were aware of them but were essentially gagged,” she said. “We are determined to keep up our fight for a public inquiry which we believe the family, and others, deserve.”Their daughter, Katie Amess, said: “I am very disappointed that the government has refused our request for an inquiry. My father gave his life for this country.“Given the similarities with the Southport killer and the man who murdered my father and the multiple failing of Prevent in both cases, it is wrong and illogical to have an inquiry into one and not the other. I sincerely hope that the government will change its mind.”This review into Prevent’s handling of the Ali case followed a critical report last weekinto its handling of the Southport killer, Axel Rudakubana. Rudakubana was referred to and rejected from Prevent three times.Ali’s criminal trial heard he had hidden his real views while in the Prevent scheme. The court was told he had wanted to travel to join Islamic State in Syria, and a year after being cleared by Prevent and Channelhad decided to carry out a terror attack in the UK.He was suspected of having an interest in Islamism after being referred by his school in 2014, which was concerned by changes in behaviour, such as suddenly wearing Islamic clothing, and a deterioration in his studies.In 2016 Ali was cleared by Prevent, with the risk he posed of carrying out a terrorist attack deemed as low. The review found that assessment had been made too soon, after just one meeting with him over coffee at McDonald’s.The review found “the ultimate decision to exit Ali is based on the one initial report from the IP [intervention provider]”.Announcing the review, the security minister, Dan Jarvis, told the Commons: “The reviewer found that from the material reviewed, the assessment in terms of the perpetrator’s vulnerabilities was problematic, and this ultimately led to questionable decision-making and sub-optimal handling of the case during the time he was engaged with Prevent and Channel.“It identified that the vulnerability assessment framework was not followed, with the perpetrator’s symptoms being prioritised over addressing the underlying causes of his vulnerabilities.“The reviewer ultimately found that while Prevent policy and guidance at the time was mostly followed, the case was exited from Prevent too quickly.”Jarvis added: “Record-keeping was problematic, and the rationale for certain decisions was not explicit. Responsibilities between police and the local authorities were blurred. The tool used for identifying an individual’s vulnerability to radicalisation was outdated.“The school that made the referral to Prevent should have been involved in discussions to help determine risk and appropriate support. And the tasking of the intervention provider was problematic, with a miscommunication leading to only one session being provided instead of two.”Prevent is a voluntary scheme intended to deflect people away from being radicalised before they commit terrorist acts.The head of counter-terrorism, assistant commissioner Matt Jukes, said: “It is clear from the Prevent learning review where the management and handling of Ali Harbi Ali’s case in 2014 should have been better.“The report also acknowledges that by the time of the attack in 2021, significant changes had been made, and more work has been done since then to act upon the review’s recommendations.“Difficult decisions in steering people away from radicalisation continue to be made every day, and with almost 60,000 Prevent referrals in the last decade, we owe it to all those affected, including those making the decisions, to take every opportunity possible to improve the system.”Ali’s criminal trial heard that he had confessed to police after his arrest that in 2014 he was such a devotee of Islamic State that he considered travelling to Syria to join them, but did not do so.By 2017 he had chosen to carry out an attack in the UK and he became determined to kill an MP, eventually picking Amess as his target.Jarvis said that the new Prevent commissioner would “ensure the implementation of all relevant recommendations” from the review about the programme’s interactions with Ali.Explore more on these topicsPrevent strategySouthend-on-SeaEnglandIslamic StatenewsShareReuse this content"

However, the BBC said it recorded a call in which a senior MI5 officer broke that policy in an attempt to influence the broadcaster’s coverage.On Wednesday in the high court, Mr Justice Chamberlain castigated MI5 and said: “There is no contest that the evidence was not just misleading, it was false. Whether or not it was deliberately false is the subject of an investigation.”Courts were given a statement on behalf of MI5 by one of its deputy directors general.The woman who complained about the agent, who she says attacked her with a machete, had taken a case to the investigatory powers tribunal.She wanted the tribunal to investigate MI5’s recruitment and handling of the man she said had abused her. MI5 said its policy of neither confirming nor denying that someone was their agent should stand; the woman’s lawyers said that would frustrate her push for justice.Two inquiries are now under way: one internally by MI5, the other ordered by the home secretary to be carried out by Jonathan Jones, the former head of the government legal service.In a statement,Yvette Coopersaid: “It is clearly a very serious matter to provide incorrect information to the court and MI5 has apologised directly for this.“Sir Jonathan Jones KC … will lead the review and ensure that an independent authoritative view can be taken on what went wrong and any actions MI5 needs to take to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.”Cooper said the use of covert agents was vital to national security. “Covert human intelligence sources – or agents – play a crucial role in that work, and maintaining the secrecy of their identities is essential to protect them, their families, the vital intelligence they provide, and the recruitment of future sources.“The government maintains and supports the principle of neither confirming nor denying allegations about whether individuals may or may not be operating on behalf of the UK intelligence agencies.”The revelations led to a rare public apology from the MI5 director general. Ken McCallum said: “It has become clear that MI5 provided incorrect information to the high court in relation to an aspect of our witness statement. As soon as we became aware of the issue, we immediately took steps to correct that part of the statement. We take our duty to provide truthful, accurate and complete information very seriously, and have offered an unreserved apology to the court.“The use of agents is difficult, human work that is governed by legislation and tightly overseen. It is fundamental to MI5’s ability to keep the UK safe.”During the saga, McCallum called the BBC director general, Tim Davie, as the two organisations clashed over the story. The BBC has accused MI5 of lying and says it was pressed to drop the story.Kate Ellis, a solicitor for “Beth”, from the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “We now understand that MI5 has misled three courts by giving or relying on false evidence – over a period of several years – and this has allowed them to avoid giving ‘Beth’ any meaningful answers. This is in circumstances where Beth’s ex-partner specifically boasted of his MI5 status to Beth, and used this to abuse her.“Most concerning of all, perhaps, is that the truth has only emerged at all because of a secret recording made by the BBC. Until the BBC disclosed this secret tape to MI5, it appears that MI5 and their lawyers were robustly maintaining their original version of events.”Explore more on these topicsMI5BBCFar rightYvette CooperViolence against women and girlsUK security and counter-terrorismWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”.Higgs was dismissed after reposting and commenting on messages on her personal Facebook account that criticised plans to teach the No Outsiders equalities programme at her son’s Church ofEnglandprimary school.The posts referred to “brainwashing” children and criticised the teaching of “gender fluidity” and the view that same-sex marriage was equivalent to marriage between a man and a woman, which conflicted with Higgs’s Christian faith.Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”.An employment tribunal found in 2020 that while Higgs’s religion was a protected characteristic, her dismissal was still lawful, but this decision was subsequently overturned by an employment appeal tribunal (EAT) in 2023.The EAT then ruled the case should be sent back to an employment tribunal for a fresh decision, which Higgs’s lawyers challenged in the court of appeal as “unnecessary”. The court of appeal judgment ruled the decision to remit the case to the tribunal was discriminatory.Underhill said it was not in dispute that Higgs’s beliefs that gender was binary and same-sex marriage could not be equated with marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act 2010.The school, however, sought to justify her dismissal on the basis that the posts in question were “intemperately expressed and included insulting references to the promoters of gender fluidity and ‘the LGBT crowd’, which were liable to damage the school’s reputation in the community”.Underhill said in the judgment: “However, neither the language of the posts nor the risk of reputational damage were capable of justifying the claimant’s dismissal in circumstances where she had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils.”In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to young children in schools as part of statutory relationships and sex education.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Today, after nearly seven years, the court of appeal has finally put that right. Expressing biblical Christian teaching on gender and sexuality may appear to be offensive to those who hold the opposite views, but as today’s judgment signals, Christians have a right to express their beliefs publicly.Sean Jones KC, acting for Farmor’s, said in earlier written submissions that Higgs was not dismissed for manifesting her beliefs “but because the manner in which it was manifested could reasonably have caused and did cause others to think she was expressing homophobic or transphobic views”. He argued remitting the case was appropriate as “fuller reasons” for the decision were needed.In a 57-page ruling, Underhill said Higgs’s posts were not grossly offensive but a series of derogatory sneers. “I do not believe that dismissal was even arguably a proportionate sanction for the claimant’s conduct,” he added.A spokesperson for Stonewall said: “Today’s court of appeal ruling is a judgment on the proportionality of her dismissal, not an endorsement of the beliefs she expressed. This judgment does not weaken the responsibility of schools and institutions to uphold inclusive policies, or to tackle discriminatory environments for both students and staff.”The Press Association contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSchoolsLGBTQ+ rightsCourt of appealReligionEnglandAnglicanismnewsShareReuse this content"

But now a mural will be painted on one of its outer walls depicting Malcolm X along with Claudia Jones –the campaigning journalist who helped launch the Notting Hill carnivaland Britain’s first black newspaper – andAvtar Singh Jouhl, the anti-racism activist who invited him to Smethwick.View image in fullscreenThe artist Bunny Bread’s design for the forthcoming Malcolm X mural outside the Ivy Bush pub in Smethwick.Photograph: HandoutThe visit came at a pivotal moment in the international battle for equality. Days before arriving in Smethwick,Malcolm Xhad visited Selma, Alabama, where Martin Luther King was being held in the city jail after campaigning for equal voting rights.In England, black and Asian workers were facing discrimination, violence and intimidation in the West Midlands. ABritish branch of the Ku Klux Klanhad formed in Birmingham after the election of the Conservative MP Peter Griffiths, whose campaign used an openly racist “unofficial” slogan.In Smethwick,a “colour bar”operated in housing, workplaces, shops and in pubs, denying minority ethnic workers equal pay and access to amenities. Malcolm X experienced it for himself at the Blue Gates pub, which segregated customers at the time, and, on seeing posters outside properties saying “coloured people need not apply”, said: “This is worse than in America.”Nine days after coming to Smethwick, Malcolm X was assassinated in New York. Jouhl, who died in 2022,previously told Birmingham Live: “Malcolm’s visit put racism in Britain on the international map … After he visited, things started changing.”At the end of 1965, the Race Relations Act – the first piece of legislation of its kind in the country – became law. It followed years of grassroots campaigning against discrimination in the UK – fromLen Johnson challenging a Manchester colour barin the 1950s, toPaul Stephensonrefusing to leave a venue in Bristol until he was served, a year after helping to lead 1963’sBristol bus boycottwhich fought racist employment policies.The Smethwick mural, funded by Arts Council England, will be created by the artist Bunny Bread and is part of a festival of anniversary celebrations led bythe anti-racist collective MX60.Jagwant Johal of BirminghamRaceImpact Group said: “The story of how and why Malcolm X found himself in Smethwick is one of international Black unity and solidarity. The significance of the visit was to connect the dots of global racism, be it in Soweto, Alabama or Smethwick.“The same racist scapegoating of refugees and asylum seekers today was very much the background back then, leading the Indian Workers’ Association to invite Malcolm X to expose the unfolding apartheid in Smethwick.”Explore more on these topicsMalcolm XCivil rights movementEnglandRacenewsShareReuse this content"

We have looked at the papers … and today I can confirm there will be a judge-led inquiry into this case. More than that, it will be a statutory inquiry,” Starmer said as he opened the meeting.“I’m really pleased that we have got that far and I want to make sure you are at the heart of this. I know, acutely, you didn’t feel that before, and we will do everything we can to make sure you are at the heart of this. At least now we can begin this stage … towards the justice and accountability you so desperately need.”He said the decision would have to be announced and discussed in parliament but added: “I don’t think there’s anybody that will question an inquiry.”The families had called for a statutory inquiry in order for witnesses to be compelled to give evidence, and Starmer said this was important so that witnesses could “answer questions about their actions and their decisions”.Speaking outside Downing Street after the meeting, Barnaby’s mother, Emma Webber, said this was the “first bit of positive news that we’ve been able to have for a very, very long time. We’re still processing it”.Kumar added: “We welcome it, we’ve been working so hard towards it and I just think we couldn’t be more delighted. For the nation it’s a great day because for everyone who has also suffered the way we have, we will make sure that changes come from our inquiry for the betterment of our country.”Webber said they had been told the inquiry would be concluded within two years.Ian Coates’s son, James, said: “Today is finally a good reason to come to London, to get the promises we were given. It’s about the future, it’s about protecting the public so they don’t have to walk in our shoes.”AnNHS England reporton the mental health care Calocane received before the attacks found his treatment “was not always sufficient to meet his needs”, and risk assessments failed to consider the “potential acts of violence” that could result from his failure to take medication.It included detailed information on four occasions between 2020 and 2022 when Calocane was sectioned for mental health treatment, and his repeated failure to take medication at home, before he was discharged to his GP because of a lack of interaction with mental health services.The report also foundCalocane was allowed to avoid taking long-lasting antipsychotic medication as he did not like needles, and that he did not consider himself to have a mental health condition.The Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating the way Leicestershire police dealt with alleged assaults by Calocane a month before the attacks inNottinghamin June 2023.It said it anticipated being able to publish the findings and outcomes of the investigation “in the coming weeks”.Explore more on these topicsNottinghamNottinghamshireEnglandKeir StarmerCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The family had made their application through theUkraine Family Scheme.Hugo Norton-Taylor, an upper tribunal judge, allowed the family to come to the UK on the basis of their right to a family life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights (ECHR).“We conclude that the respondent’s (Home Office’s) refusal of the collective human rights claim does not, on the particular facts of these cases, strike a fair balance between the appellants’ interests and those of the public.“On a cumulative basis, the weight we attach to the considerations weighing on the appellants’ side of the scales demonstrates a very strong claim indeed. Put another way, there are very compelling or exceptional circumstances.“Accordingly, the appellants’ appeals are allowed,” he said.He said that the youngest children, now aged seven and nine, were “at a high risk of death or serious injury on a daily basis” and that it was “overwhelmingly” in their best interests to be in a safer environment with their parents and siblings.2:01PMQs: Starmer says ‘loophole’ that enabled Gaza family to claim UK asylum will be closed – videoAnswering the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, during PMQs on Wednesday Starmer said: “I do not agree with the decision. She is right, it is the wrong decision. She hasn’t quite done her homework because the decision in question was taken under the last government.”Starmer said it “should be parliament that makes the rules on immigration, it should be the government that makes the policy, that is the principle and the home secretary is already looking at the legal loophole which we need to close in this particular case”.As first reported in the Daily Telegraph, the Palestinian family – a mother, father and four children aged seven to 18 – had seen their home destroyed by an airstrike and were living in aGazarefugee camp with daily threats to their lives from Israeli military attacks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The case also caused the biological mother’s mental health to suffer, the court heard.The judge said: “Women and children appear to be almost a commodity to him as he sets about increasing the number of his children around the globe.”The case,first reported by the BBC, was heard at Cardiff family court in late 2023, when Albon was 52, but the written judgment has only recently been published.The judge said Albon had pursued the case as a “means to control” or “punish” the mothers. He said this and a similar case “highlights the need for women to understand the risks which they expose themselves to in approaching unlicensed, unregulated and unofficial sperm donors”.Both women supported naming Albon. The non-biological mother said the world needed to know the risks associated with unregulated sperm donation, calling the two-year court battle a “nightmare” and a “horror story”.Neither woman opposed one email or card each year to the child from Albon under so-called letterbox contact, with the items kept for when the child is able to understand them.In an interview with the Sun last year, Albon said he had been a donor for 13 or 14 years and had fathered about 180 children.He said he offers to send or bring semen to women or have sex with them, describing his services as his “special hobby” and he is “always on call and willing to help”.Explore more on these topicsSperm donationWalesChildrenParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

The comments, made in January 2023, came after officers doubted her claims of being “held hostage” in a taxi.Robertson said the CPS should launch an investigation into its lawyers who “wrongly authorised this prosecution”.He said: “The CPS should investigate and consider why it was necessary to bring this case to trial with all the money they expended on it. Especially at a time when the criminal justice system itself is collapsing as a result of many years of underfunding by Conservative governments. Cases of this kind, which involve no public disorder or dismay, should not be brought to court.”The CPS initially decided against charging Kerr due to insufficient evidence. It went ahead with the charge nearly a year after the incident when a second statement was submitted by PC Stephen Lovell, the officer her comments were aimed at.In it, Lovell said Kerr’s comments left him “shocked, upset and humiliated”. He had not mentioned being upset at being called “stupid and white” in his first statement.After the verdict, it was revealed that Kerr’s legal team had attempted to get the case thrown out at a preliminary hearing in January, arguing there had been an abuse of process by crown prosecutors.Kerr’s lawyer, Grace Forbes, claimed the CPS had violated its own guidance, adding that a “loophole” in the victims’ right of review scheme was used to justify prosecution proceedings a year after the alleged offence. The judge refused Forbes’ attempt.Robertson said “no one in their right mind” would think Kerr’s comments “justified a prison sentence”.A CPS spokesperson said:“The Crown Prosecution Service’s function is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges for a jury to consider. In this case, we decided that there was sufficient evidence and that it was in the public interest to proceed. We respect the jury’s decision.”Explore more on these topicsCrown Prosecution ServiceUK criminal justiceSam KerrMetropolitan policePoliceLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Since then he has been struggling on benefits.This week he will receive a “significant”, six-figure sum as an interim payment – and has already begun planning a trip to Australia to see his half-sisters for the first time since 1990.Malkinson, 59, said he was relieved not to have to worry about money after feeling he had beenleft “to rot”on universal credit for 19 months. “It’s been a mighty struggle, because I could hardly pay for my rent and food … So I’m very pleased now that I’m financially independent and I’ve got the freedom I craved whilst in prison.”The final amount Malkinson will receive is still being decided by the independent assessor of miscarriage of justice compensation, the retired judge Sir Robin Spencer. But the substantial payment in the meantime is enough for him to travel in the way he dreamed of when he was incarcerated.Malkinson was a keen backpacker before his freedom was abruptly taken away when he was 37. As he approaches his 60th birthday, he can finally rediscover his passion. “Now I’m able to escape the UK soon enough, and get some respite from what I consider to be a hard place to live.”As well as hoping to make it to Australia, Spain and Portugal this year, Malkinson has more modest plans for his windfall. He wants to buy some “small stargazing binoculars” to look at the night sky in the southern hemisphere and “a nice speaker” for his car so he can hear his favourite reggae music without the bass sounding tinny.He also hopes to buy a small flat in the UK but is conscious that he will need to make the money last.It is likely that his considerable time spent in prison will put him in line for the maximum amount of compensation. But legislation introduced by Labour in 2008 capped the scheme at £1m, something he believes is in urgent need of an update.In his case, even this maximum would translate to just £50,000 for every year he spent wrongly being treated by the state as a convicted sex offender. Malkinson said the scheme “needs undoing and putting back on the road to justice”.Toby Wilton at Hickman and Rose, the legal firm representing Malkinson in his civil claim, said the interim payment was “long-awaited good news in this case”, but that it was “not right that this statutory compensation scheme can only pay out a maximum of £1m to victims of serious miscarriages of justice”.Wilton added: “This £1m cap on compensation (which even includes all the costs of claiming compensation) was set nearly 20 years ago, in 2008. One million pounds then would be worth around £2m today. The arbitrary and unfair compensation cap should, at the very least, increase with inflation in just the same way that other compensation in the English legal system, and that – say – MPs’ salaries increase over time.”Despite several applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to investigate his case, it was a team at the charity and law practice Appeal who uncovered the evidence that resulted in his case being re-examined. An independent review found missed opportunities by the CCRC meant hecould have been exonerated almost a decade earlier.After revelations in the Guardian about the CCRC’s spending onexpensive French business coursesfor its chief executive and allegations about its“absent” leadership, Malkinson said the stays in “Fontainebleau and all those fancy la-di-da trips” made him think “they seem to have a problem with priorities”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now he wants to see further improvements.As well as lifting the £1m cap, he wants more people whose convictions are overturned to receive money. More than 93% of applicants to the scheme are denied compensation, according to evidence in a test case in theEuropean court of human rights last year.Miscarriage of justice victims have to prove innocence “beyond reasonable doubt”. Malkinson said: “I can barely express how dreadful that is, to put an innocent citizen in prison for years on end, have it overturned and then say: ‘Well, we’re not going to compensate you.’ It’s horrific. What is that victim supposed to do with his life or her life?”He added: “It should be automatic … the government owes the victim.”The secretary of state for justice, Shabana Mahmood, said:“Andrew Malkinson suffered an atrocious miscarriage of justice, and we have issued an interim payment so he can begin to rebuild his life.“We are actively considering the concerns he has raised to ensure we are effectively supporting individuals who have suffered a miscarriage of justice.”Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justicePrisons and probationGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

The released American has not been identified.The opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya posted on social media that the activist Alena Maushuk was among those released and was in serious health condition, adding that all three of those released were in Vilnius.The freed detainees also included Andrey Kuznechyk, a journalist with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which is known in Belarus as Radio Svoboda.In a statement, Stephen Capus, the president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), said: “This is a joyous day for Andrey, his wife, and their two young children. After more than three years apart, this family is together again thanks to President Trump.”RFE/RL is a broadcaster funded by the US Congress, which was founded during the cold war to transmit information behind the iron curtain.On Sunday, the billionaire Elon Musk, who is spearheading Trump’s federal government cost-cutting efforts, called for RFE/RL and another broadcaster funded by Congress, the Voice of America, to be shuttered.According to RFE/RL Kuznechyk was initially sentenced to 10 days in jail on hooliganism charges before facing fresh charges of creating an extremist group and sentenced to six years.His case is seen as part ofa larger campaign of repression against independent media and civil society groupsin Belarus.The US ambassador to Lithuania, Kara McDonald, speaking on CNN from Vilnius, described the release as “a big day for team America, for the president, for the secretary of state”, adding: “We just welcomed them [the detainees] here a few minutes ago.”Chris Smith, the deputy assistant secretary of state for eastern European affairs, described a “special operation” in which he and other US officials “crossed into the Belarusian frontier [and] went into Minsk to meet with Belarusian counterparts who brought these three detainees to us”.Authoritarian leaders in former Soviet bloc seize on Musk’s USAid crackdownRead more“They were handed over to us, and we brought them back out through Lithuania,” he told CNN.The release of detainees from Belarus comes after the American schoolteacher Marc Fogel was released by Russia after three and a half years in prison.Fogel, 63, was serving a 14-year sentence for drug smuggling after being caught at a Moscow airport with a small amount of marijuana. He was flown on Tuesday to Washington, where he celebrated his release with Trump at the White House on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsBelarusEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said it would be “good for society” for the company to be part of evolving geopolitical discussions in response to a question about why the company removed prohibitions against building AI for weapons and surveillance.Parker said that, as a federal contractor, the company has been reviewing all of its programs and initiatives in response toDonald Trump’s executive orders that direct federal agencies and contractors to dismantle DEI work. Parker’s role has also been changed from chief diversity officer to the vice-president of Googler Engagement.Google scraps diversity hiring goals and cites Trump’s DEI ordersRead more“What’s not changing is we’ve always hired the best person for the job,” she said, according to a recording of the meeting the Guardian reviewed.Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said the company had always “deeply cared” about hiring a workforce that represents the diversity of its global users but that the firm had to comply with the rules and regulations of where it operates.“Our values are enduring, but we have to comply with legal directions depending on how they evolve,” Pichai said.Pichai, who was speaking from Paris while attending an international AI summit, and other executives were responding to questions employees posted in an internal forum. Some of these questions were part of a coordinated effort among worker activist groups such as No Tech for Apartheid to force company executives to answer for the tech giant’s drastic move away from its previous core values.Employees had submitted 93 questions about the company’s decision to remove its pledge not to build AI weapons and more than 100 about Google’s announcement that it was rolling back DEI pledges, according to screenshots the Guardian reviewed. The company recently shifted to using AI to summarize similar questions employees had ahead of regularly scheduled staff meetings, which are known as TGIF.Last week, Google joined Meta and Amazon in shifting away from an emphasis on a culture of inclusivity in favor of policies molded in the image of the Trump administration. In addition to removing mentions of its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) from filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it would no longer set hiring targets for people from underrepresented backgrounds. The company also removed language from its publicly posted AI principles that stated it wouldn’t build AI for harmful purposes including weaponry and surveillance.“We are increasingly being asked to have a seat at the table in some important conversations, and I think it’s good for society that Google has a role in those conversations in areas where we do specialize – cybersecurity, or some of the work around biology, and many more,” Walker, the chief legal officer, said. “While it may be that some of the strict prohibitions that were in [the first version] of the AI principles don’t jive well with those more nuanced conversations we’re having now, it remains the case that our north star through all of this is that the benefits substantially outweigh the risks.”Google has long attempted to give the impression that it was toeing the line between its stated corporate and cultural values and chasing government and defense contracts. After employee protests in 2018, the company withdrew from the US Defense Department’s Project Maven – which used AI to analyze drone footage – and released its AI principles and values, which promised not to build AI for weapons or surveillance.In the years since, however, the company has started working with thePentagon againafter securing a $9bn Joint Warfighting Cloud Capabilitycontractalong with Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle. Google has also had active contracts toprovideAI to the Israel Defense Forces. The tech giant hadworked over timeto distance the contract, called Project Nimbus, from the military arm of the Israeli government, but the Washington Post revealed documents that showed the company not only worked with the IDF but rushed to fulfill new requests for more AI access after the 7 October attacks. It is unclear how the IDF is using Google’s AI capabilities but, as the Guardian reported, the Israeli militaryhas used AI for a number of military purposes including to help find and identify bombing targets.In a statement a Google spokesperson, Anna Kowalczyk, said the company’s work with the Israeli government was not “directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The AI distilled the questions about the development of AI weapons to: “We recently removed a section from our AI principles page that pledged to avoid using the technology in potentially harmful applications, such as weapons and surveillance. Why did we remove this section?”While the company does not make all of the questions that were posted visible, the list gives a snapshot of some of them. Questions that employees asked included how the updated AI principles would ensure the company’s tools “are not misused for harmful purposes” and asked executives to “please talk frankly and without corp speak and legalese”.The third-most-popular question employees asked was why the AI summaries were so bad.“The AI summaries of questions on Ask are terrible.

And for anendangered owlbreeding program in Canada, it’s also a dish best served dead.For the price of a coffee, spurned and disgruntled lovers can revel in the satisfaction of having a dead rat named after an ex, before it is fed to a northern spotted owl.The British Columbia-based breeder isrunning its No regRATS campaignahead of Valentine’s Day, promising a photo and video of one’s rat, named after a former lover – or arch-enemy – and the owl it has been fed to in exchange for at least a C$5 donation.Before industrial logging in south-west British Columbia, there were nearly 1,000 spotted owls in the old-growth forests. But they have vanished in recent decades, victims of habitat destruction.Activists have tried in vain to hold the government to account, alleging protected species laws have failed to prevent the extirpation of the owls.In February 2023, the federal environment minister, Steven Guilbeault,saidthe spotted owl was facing “imminent threats to its survival”and told environmental groups he would recommend an emergency order to block further destruction of its habitat in British Columbia.‘All I see are ghosts’: fear and fury as the last spotted owl in Canada fights for survivalRead moreMonths later, however,Canadian cabinet ministers rejectedGuilbeault’s plea tosave the endangered owl.Efforts to revive the population have failed, with a pair of owls released from the breeding program dying within months. The lone female in the wild is also believed to have died.The breeding program, which operates with limited funds, is seen as the last hope of returning the owls to the wild and reviving a population widely seen as a barometer for the health of old-growth ecosystems.Predictably, the campaign has angered rat fans.After teasing the campaign on Instagram, users chimed in that it was unfair to equate “noble” and “clever” animals to a former flame.“How dumb and cruel. What you are feeding is a bad opinion about rats. Completely undeserved. What about ticks or mosquitoes instead?”The breeding program says rodents make up most of the owls’ diet. “They’re going to be eating the rats anyway. We’re just trying to have a little fun and fundraise so we can continue caring for the owls,” it wrote. “Don’t get us wrong, we love rats too.”Others, however, were more than happy to fork over the cash.“The satisfaction of naming a rat after someone who has hurt you and having said rat get eaten!!!! And then to get a picture? Priceless,” wrote on user. “Love this more than I should. Perfect fundraiser.

City officials were insistent that the law would not be used to target aid workers, but declined to clarify that point in the ordinance itself.The proposal, with its unusual language about aiding and abetting, had attracted considerable attention and condemnation from civil rights groups and community organizations. Nearly 20 such groups signed a letter urging the council to vote against it, describing it as “misguided” and warning it would create “legal liability and devastating humanitarian consequences”.“This sweeping language would effectively make it a crime to be unsheltered in the City of Fremont,” the letter stated, adding that unhoused people cannot avoid living outdoors when there is no access to housing. “As such, there is effectively no way for unsheltered individuals to comply with the proposal.”The ordinance in Fremont comes as cities across the US are cracking down on homeless encampments following the US supreme court’sruling last yearthat cities can criminalize unhoused people for sleeping outside – even when there are no shelter spaces available.Dozens of US cities enacted harsher anti-camping policies in the aftermath of that decision. In California, which has thehighest rateof unhoused people living outside in the country, the governor issued anexecutive ordercalling for the removal of encampments on state property and encouraging local governments to adopt similar policies.In Fremont, a2024 countfound that 807 people in the city were experiencing homelessness and 612 of them were unsheltered – a decrease from 2022. But the city, like much of California, had seen a major rise in homelessness in recent years with the population increasing from 608 in 2019 to 1,026 just three years later.Fremont has just over 100 shelter beds available.Housing in the city has not kept up with the growing number of jobs, said David Bonaccorsi, a member of the Fremont for Everyone group and a former city councillor.In December, the council began considering the proposal to ban camping on public property and make “aiding and abetting” a misdemeanor with a penalty of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. The ordinance also makes it illegal to store personal property in public areas.Fremont had a long history of working with non-profit and advocacy groups, Bonaccorsi said, but that suddenly changed when the council moved to consider the ordinance without consulting with those organizations. Elaine Sanchez with the Sisters of the Holy Family echoed that sentiment.“That’s why it’s such a surprise because Fremont has already done so much good with housing,” Sanchez said. “It was a real reversal when we read this ordinance. Why did they not consult or call together some of the stakeholders? Instead [they crafted] an ordinance that really does criminalize people that are poor, people that are unhoused.”The council moved ahead with the ordinance despite the objections of community groups who feared they may be subject to fines or arrest for providing support and aid to unhoused people, and took a final vote on the matter this week.On Tuesday evening, as many as 700 people showed up at the Fremont city council chambers, where the line to enter snaked around the building and into a parking lot. Some carried signs reading “don’t criminalize aid workers” and “poverty is not a crime”.Dozens of advocates and residents begged the council not to pass the ordinance, arguing it was cruel and would not solve the crisis and would instead criminalize unhoused people and those who help them. It would force people to leave encampments even when there is nowhere for them to go, several speakers said.“What are we doing?” said Thaddeus Sprinkles. “We are playing musical chairs with people’s lives. This is not a solution.”And there aren’t enough services to help people who are unhoused, said Kimberly Wise, who was unhoused in Fremont for more than a year.California’s unhoused people protest US supreme court order: ‘Not going to push us out of view’Read moreMany others advocated in favor of the ordinance, with residents stating they no longer felt safe in their community and had found needles near their homes and businesses. Some reported encampments that butted up against their properties and posed a hazard and said the situation was negatively affecting the city and economy.“Compassion is not about enabling,” one resident said. “There has to be accountability.”The city attorney said the ordinance does not make it illegal to provide food or aid to unhoused people. The council briefly considered amending the proposal to explicitly state that the ordinance would not affect aid workers but ultimately opted not to and the ordinance passed with just one councillor opposing it.The city’s mayor, Raj Salwan, argued that despite criticism that the council lacked compassion, Fremont was a leader in providing support to unhoused residents.“It’s not fair for folks to have to navigate their paths around these large encampments,” he said. “These encampments are not humane for the unhoused. We’ve done more than any other city.”“We are a leader in homeless prevention,” he said, but added the city “must balance accountability with compassion”.As the meeting came to an end at midnight, people yelled “shame, shame, shame” at the council. JC Clark, a lifelong Fremont resident, continued shouting “shame” until she walked to her car.“Poverty is not a crime. This ordinance says it is,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaHomelessnessWest CoastHousingPovertySocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

Its $53bn deal to acquire oil producer Hess and gain a foothold in Guyana’s lucrative oilfield is in limbo due to a court battle with its larger rival Exxon Mobil, which has more aggressively expanded its own production.Chevron also faces industry-wide weakness in the refining business and the expectation that oil prices could be under pressure over the next two years as global production growth outpaces demand.Chevron has said it is targeting up to $3bn in cost cuts through 2026 from leveraging technology, asset sales and changing how and where work is performed.At the end of 2023, Chevron employed 40,212 people across its operations. A layoff of 20% of total employees would be about 8,000 people. Those figures exclude another roughly 5,400 employees of Chevron service stations. Shares of Chevron declined 1.3% in afternoon trading.The company told employees during an internal town hall that they can begin opting for buyouts now through April or May, according to a source familiar with the matter.The oil industry has been consolidating in recent years, focusing on mergers and operational efficiency more than drilling new wells. Chevron will reorganize its business and announce a new leadership structure in the next two weeks, the source said.“Chevron is taking action to simplify our organizational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness,” said Mark Nelson, vice-chairperson of Chevron, in a statement. “We do not take these actions lightly and will support our employees through the transition.”The company’s oil and gas reserves have declined to their lowest point in at least a decade, raising concerns about its long-term prospects and highlighting the importance of closing the Hess acquisition.Chevron moved its headquarters from San Ramon, California, to Houston last year and replaced several longstanding managers to renew its leadership.Last year, it also announced a new hub in India that will be its largest tech center outside the United States.Explore more on these topicsChevronOilExxonMobilEmploymentOil and gas companiesKazakhstanGuyananewsShareReuse this content"

Researchers said the study backed up anecdotal evidence from patients and doctors that semaglutide can lead to a sudden loss of longing for alcoholic drinks.Alcohol-related deaths in UK hit record high of 10,473, ONS data showsRead moreA key finding was that semaglutide’s effects were bigger than was often seen with existing drugs to curb alcoholism, even though the medicine was only administered at the lowest clinical doses.The study’s senior author Klara Klein, from the University of North Carolina school of medicine, said: “These data suggest the potential of semaglutide and similar drugs to fill an unmet need for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.“Larger and longer studies in broader populations are needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy in people with alcohol use disorder, but these initial findings are promising.”In the research, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, 48 people with drinking problems were recruited, who had not been actively seeking treatment. They all had alcohol-use disorder, which can include the inability to stop or control drinking despite negative consequences.Participants were taken to a comfortable lab setting one week before injections and asked to drink their preferred alcoholic drinks over two hours, with instructions to delay drinking if they wished.They were then randomly assigned to receive weekly, low-dose injections of semaglutide or a placebo for nine weeks, during which time their weekly drinking patterns were also measured.The semaglutide dose was 0.25mg a week for four weeks, 0.5mg a week for four weeks, and 1.0mg for one week, all given during clinic visits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Researchers calculated how much alcohol people had drunk and the alcohol concentration in their breath.Semaglutide injections reduced the amount of alcohol people drank in the lab setting, the study found, “with evidence of medium to large effect sizes for grams of alcohol consumed”.The semaglutide group also saw a 41% reduction in the number of drinks they consumed on each of their drinking days. In addition, weekly alcohol cravings dropped by about 40%, while there were also bigger reductions in heavy drinking over time compared to the placebo group.Nearly 40% of people in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days in the last month of treatment, compared with 20% in the placebo group.Dr Stephen Burgess of the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said: “This is a small study, but an exciting one. It provides evidence that semaglutide treatment can reduce alcohol consumption, similar to how it has been shown to reduce food consumption and consequently body weight. The likely mechanistic pathway is by dampening brain cues that prompt an individual to crave both food and alcohol.”Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chairman of theAlcoholHealth Alliance UK, welcomed the study’s findings. He said there was still an urgent need to tackle the affordability, availability and marketing of alcohol, but further research on semaglutide’s mechanism of action might also help to develop understanding of the cause of alcohol dependence.Explore more on these topicsAlcoholObesityDiabetesMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Grayson, 30, is charged with first-degree murder in Massey’s death.Jack Campbell, a former Sangamon county sheriff, who hired Grayson, retired following the shooting. The countycame to an agreement with the justice departmentto ensure they have the tools to adequately train its department in de-escalation techniques, dealing with mental health disabilities and non-discriminatory policing.Following the shooting, a citizen’s commission in Sangamon county, calledthe Massey commission,was founded “to take action and make recommendations that expand safe and equitable access to services by addressing systemic racism and mistrust in law enforcement and other helping professions”, according to the commission’s website.Before county officials voted on the settlement, Andy Van Meter, the Sangamon county board chair, released a memo about the shooting.“No price paid can take back the actions of a rogue former deputy, but this agreement is an effort to provide some measure of recompense to the Massey family for their unimaginable loss,”the memo reads.“The county remains committed to working with the community to strengthen policies to try to ensure tragedies like this never happen again.”Massey’s death received national attention as both another example of police brutality and the police killing of people who were in need of mental health help.In the days leading to the shooting, both Massey andher mother called 911repeatedly for help. Massey’s mother specifically asked the dispatcher not to send anyone “prejudiced” and said thatshe didn’t want anyone to hurt her daughter.On the day of the shooting, Massey herself called emergency responders to report a suspected prowler. Grayson and another sheriff’s deputy responded to the call. While talking to Massey in her living room, Grayson told the other deputy to remove a pot of water from the stove.Massey removed the pot herself, noted that Grayson backed away from it, and told him: “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Grayson drew his weapon and yelled at Massey to drop the pot. She ducked behind a counter and apologized. Grayson shot three times, and killed Masseywith a shot to the head.“When Sonya Massey was staring at the barrel of his gun, she stooped down, said, ‘Sorry, sir, sorry,’ and the bullet was shot while she was in this stooped position, coming up,” the civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Massey’s family,said in a press conference last year.“The autopsy confirms what everybody already knows, that this was just a senseless, unnecessary, excessive use of force.”After the killing, Massey’s family said that she was a descendant ofWilliam Donnegan,a Black man who was lynched by a white mob during Springfield’s 1908 race riots, which killed 17 Black people over a two-day period. Following the race riot, a group of Black and white Americans came together tocreate the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).A relative noted last year that Massey was taken to the same hospital as her ancestor following the shooting. It was there that Massey was pronounced dead and where, 116 years earlier, Donnegan was also pronounced dead.Massey’s family is expected to hold a press conference about the settlement on Wednesday, which would have been her 37th birthday.Explore more on these topicsIllinoisUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were each down by about 1% after New York opened for trading. The 10-year US treasury yield – a key barometer for US economic expectations – rose to about 4.629%.Inflation soared across much of the world three years ago, as the pandemic continued to distort the global economy and supply chains. It peaked at 9.1% in the US, its highest level in a generation.While price growth has since fallen dramatically, consumer prices have remained high –challenging perceptions of an economywhich, on paper, has proved remarkably resilient.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shortly after the data was published, he added: “BIDEN INFLATION UP!”Many economists have warned that Trump’s tariff strategy risks exacerbating inflation.As millions of Americans struggled with the cost of living last year, Trump promised to take action on the campaign trial. “Prices will come down,” hedeclaredduring one speech. “You just watch – they’ll come down, and they’ll come down fast.”Since his election victory last November, however, Trump has appeared to soften his pledge. “I’d like to bring them down,” hetold Time magazineof prices in December. “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard.”Asked by Fox News when families will be able to “feel prices going down” this weekend, the president changed the subject and claimed other countries were taking advantage of the US.Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationEconomicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson at the Department of Defense did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment about the protests.The actions were in response to a spate of anti-DEI initiatives Hegseth implemented. Since his confirmation last month, Hegseth has banned Black History Month celebrations and similar events. He has also restricted access to several books in defense department schools that children ofUS militaryfamilies attended.Hegseth has alsoannounced in a memothat the US military will no longer accept transgender service members and ordered a pause on gender-affirming medical care.“Effective immediately, all new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are paused,” wrote Hegseth.“All unscheduled, scheduled, or planned medical procedures associated with affirming or facilitating a gender transition for Service members are paused.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

There were some tired novelties but, by virtue of its conscientiously maintained stream of likable gags, it leapt back into our hearts and BJ3 seemed a decent way to sign off the franchise and remember Helen Fielding’s inspired creation. But though I was willing myself to enjoy this fourth film, about the heroine’s adventure with a younger man, the Bridget Jones series has frankly run out of steam.Big knickers, bad decisions and old bats: Renée Zellweger on the return of Bridget JonesRead moreThis is a fourquel in the same unhappy tradition as Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. The jokes have been dialled down to accommodate a contrived and unconvincingly mature “weepie” component but the film becomes sad in the wrong way. The actors are mostly going through the motions, there is so little chemistry between each of the two lead pairings they resemble a panda being forced to mate with a flamingo, and Renée Zellweger’s performance is starting to look eccentric.View image in fullscreenRenée Zellweger and Leo Woodall in the film.Photograph: Photo Credit: Alex Bailey/Universal PicturesThere are one or two nice touches: an uproarious pastiche of theLevi’s swimmer TVad gives us a Darcy 2.0 hunk in the water and showcases Dinah Washington’s performance of Mad About the Boy; there’s a nice gag about Bridget being asked by a young man at the till if she wants to complete her meal deal. Naturally Hugh Grant gets giant laughs, returning as the ageing, golden-hearted cad Daniel Cleaver. So does Emma Thompson, back as the down-to-earth gynaecologist from the previous film. But Bridget herself looks marooned and oddly dazed.Those who don’t want to know what is revealed in the trailer’s opening moments had better look away now … but Bridget’s husband has died. Carrie Bradshaw’s Mr Big collapsed fatally and ignominiously on his Peloton, but human rights lawyer Mark Darcy has somehow nobly expired doing his good works in foreign parts and the movie doesn’t give us the details. Bridget is now left a widow living in a gorgeous house in Hampstead, north London, with two preteen children, Billy (Casper Knopf) – the “baby” from the last film – and Mabel (Mila Janković) who get babysat by their cool Uncle Daniel and go to a posh prep school, presided over by uptight yet fanciable science teacher Mr Wallaker (Chiwetel Ejiofor).All of Bridget’s mates return in continuing laugh-free cameos, including Shazzer (Sally Phillips), Jude (Shirley Henderson), Tom (James Callis), Miranda (Sarah Solemani) and Talitha (Josette Simon). Bridget’s mum and dad, Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent, return too on a melancholy note and Celia Imrie is there so briefly she is almost subliminal.‘Pre-sales are bigger than Barbie’: Bridget Jones 4 set to break box office records – despite no US cinema releaseRead moreAfter such a long time in brave misery, Bridget decides to revamp her life: she goes back to work as the world’s ditsiest TV producer and her friends urge her to get back in the dating scene. And so, on a thrillingly cradle-snatching basis, she ends her shag drought by hooking up on Tinder with Roxster, played byLeo Woodall, a sexy young park attendant at Hampstead Heath who gallantly rescues Bridget and her two kids when they get stuck up a tree.So this age-gap affair continues, and incidentally all these recent older-woman-younger-man movies such asBabygirl, A Family Affair and The Idea of You are surely just marking time while the French cinema industry finally plucks up the courage to tackle the grande affaire ofBrigitteand Emmanuel Macron. And yet something else happens in Bridget’s love life when she volunteers to help out on a school excursion led by Mr Wallaker – what looks like a geographically startling weekend trip from London to the picturesque Lake District, for which the school minibus has perhaps been fitted with supersonic jet engines or a Star Trek matter transporter.View image in fullscreenChiwetel Ejiofor in the film.Photograph: Jay Maidment/APWith the exception of Grant and Thompson, really all of the actors are phoning (or rather voice-noting) it in, though this is a function of the material. Zellweger looks as if she’s thinking about something else and Woodall has none of the charm and believable humanity he has showed us before – the scenes here on Hampstead Heath are an uneasy, inadvertent echo of his romantic One Day moments on Primrose Hill. Fans might prefer to remember the previous three films.Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is released on 12 February in Australia and 13 February in the UK, and on 13 February on Peacock in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmRenée ZellwegerChiwetel EjioforHelen FieldingHugh GrantBridget Jones' DiaryBridget Jones: the Edge of ReasonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Kandinsky theatre company’s bruising sci-fi drama sweeps us thrillingly from 1803, when scientists electrocute a corpse to simulate stuttering new life, to 2074, when private tech companies experiment with downloading brain scans of the dead to infallible new bodies. A smartly composed exploration of greed, loss and the loneliness of eternity, More Life is an incredibly human play about technology.Victor (Marc Elliott) is our futuristic Frankenstein, a bulldozing consultant obsessed with progress, preservation and a dead woman he hopes will be the first success in his company’s experiments. As Vic brings Bridget (Alison Halstead) to a kind of life, the wonderfully precise ensemble watches as she tries on her new body. Under James Yeatman’s delicate direction, the voice is dislocated, alienating the physical form. Halstead is wonderful here, estranged from her own body, limbs suddenly stiff and unknown.Shankho Chaudhuri’s set, surprisingly chameleonic for something so orange, resembles what someone in the 70s would imagine the future to look like. We are surely foolish to think we can predict our future more accurately today. Written by Lauren Mooney (dramaturgy by Mooney and Gillian Greer), the story is inspired by the investments of Silicon Valley tech bros, but the ensemble’s squabbles over details reveal how uncertain we remain about what lies ahead.Most of Kandinsky’s work began at New Diorama under David Byrne, now artistic director of the Royal Court. More Life is a bright indication of the vision he brings with him. The pace drops in the second half, but there’s so much to engage with. Beyond intellectual and ethical debates, this play stabs at the heart. Tim McMullan roils as Bridget’s husband, unable to cope with the shock of her return. He gazes at her as one would an old videotape. Helen Schlesinger is softly stern as his second wife, host to this uncomfortable reckoning and aching for her own eternity.The show’s working title was Meat Sacks,a phrase transhumanists useto refer to our material forms. By interrogating the possibility of cheating hunger, pain and death, Kandinsky illuminate what we lose in conquering immortality, and reveal a kind of wonder in these saggy, exhausted, ravenous meat sacks of ours.At theRoyal Court, London, until 8 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Court theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Could it be to show how vastly superior the Courtauld’s own works are?Jonathan JonesWed 12 Feb 2025 12.51 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 12.53 ESTShareThe bland title of this show reads a bit like a confession, in terms of how little it has to say. Goya to Impressionism – so? Why do we need to see the troubled Spanish painter of war and witchcraft juxtaposed with soft scenes by Renoir and Sisley? No reason, except they all belong to a collection whose home in Winterthur, Switzerland, is closed for renovation, meaning the Courtauld can borrow them as a job lot. The trouble is that the Oskar Reinhart Collection is too similar to the Courtauld’s own to be an overly exciting proposition.Both hoards were gathered in the early-20th century by wealthy private collectors with a penchant for French art of the late 1800s, yet by and large Samuel Courtauld got the best stuff. Reinhart’s Manets are minor compared with the dazzling masterpieces owned by the Courtauld. This is also true of Renoir. The Courtauld owns La Loge, Renoir’s scintillating early painting of modern love, but Reinhart’s row of soppy, second-rate Renoirs live down to every stereotype of this big impressionist softy.View image in fullscreenArtistic despair … A Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Rank, Théodore Géricault, c1819-22In fact, it’s almost possible to believe the whole exhibition is a sly way for the Courtauld to swank about the superior class of its own treasures. But you can’t just throw some unconnected paintings together with no theme, argument or narrative and expect it to thrill.The problems start with the single Goya at the start, but not because it is weak. The work is so drop-dead brilliant it brings all the other “masterpieces” here into question. What is art for? What is the point of it? You feel Goya asking himself these uneasy questions, as he paints Still Life With Three Salmon Steaks. The thick cuts of salmon touch each other on a grey tablecloth, their pink interiors turned upward with holes where the vertebrae were, and silver and black scales on their sides. The spine-holes are sinister, like eye-holes in a skull. Deep red blood drips out of one steak in a gory stain on the cloth. The colour of salmon flesh seems reminiscent of pink human bodies. It’s like I’m seeing my own mortality on a tabletop.View image in fullscreenA labour of looking … Still Life with Faience Jug and Fruit, Paul Cézanne, c1900It’s a stunning, dislocating work that makes you wonder why the other revered paintings here don’t worry away at existence in the same unguardedly honest way that Goya’s does. Why, I found myself asking, has Cézanne bothered arranging all those apples and peaches on a tabletop when he doesn’t seem to see any meaning in them? Are they just food for his formal preoccupations? Yet, Cézanne’s Still Life With Faience Jug and Fruit is a revolutionary masterpiece of modernism dating from circa 1900. Nevertheless, here it seems complacent and makes the labour of looking at it dutiful. It is partly Goya’s baleful despair infecting your eyesight, showing up the lack of metaphysics in all these lovely French paintings. With their dedication solely to the visual, they are strikingly devoid of human stress.But wait – here’s a fierce painting of a massive wave, a wall of blue water heading straight for you, before curling into explosive white foam near the shore. It’s byGustave Courbet, who seems to be looking at his own fate in that merciless sea. And Géricault, who depicted a social world going insane on the open seas in The Raft of the Medusa, here concentrates on a single patient in a mental hospital: his portrait, A Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Rank, gives this suffering soul a sad dignity yet also makes you feel the artist’s terror of losing his own grip on reality. These earlier 19th-century paintings are extraordinary and, in fact, the Reinhart Collection has plenty more pre-modernist art that could have been loaned, including masterpieces by Bruegel and Cranach. So it seems a cheap choice to focus on impressionism.View image in fullscreenMini-me … The Clowness Cha-U-Kao, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1895Van Gogh is also among the ill in two paintings here, both done in hospital. The Ward in the Hospital at Arles is a compassionate scene of patients gathered round a stove: he looks at them with love and sympathy, forgetting his own troubled condition. But again, the Courtauld seems to be merely mirroring its own collection in a narcissistic way, for of course it owns Van Gogh’s most sensational depiction of his despair, Self-Portrait With Bandaged Ear.This treatment of Oskar Reinhart’s collection as the Courtauld’s mini-me is even more pointed in the caption for Toulouse-Lautrec’s The Clown Cha-U-Kao, which points out that in the background you can see the distinctive profile of the dancer Jane Avril, who, we are reminded, appears in its own greatest work by this artist. Indeed she does and, needless to say, the Courtauld’s painting is better.The final painting is Picasso’s blue-tinged portrait of the sculptor Mateu Fernández de Soto, done in 1901 as they mourned the suicide of their friend Carles Casagemas, for whom the wild life of Paris bohemia proved fatal. It’s a powerful conclusion to the thread of artistic despair and insanity that haunts this otherwise drearily grand exhibition.The Courtauld proudly tells us its scientific research has revealed that Picasso painted it over a portrait of a woman – perhaps to save canvases as an impoverished young artist. But I can’t see her. And you can’t see her, either. So, as with much of this show, why should we care?Goya to Impressionism: Masterpieces from the Oskar Reinhart Collectionis at the Courtauld Gallery, London, from 14 February to 26 May.Explore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsFrancisco de GoyaPaul CezannePierre-Auguste RenoirGustave CourbetPablo PicassoreviewsShareReuse this content"

[Baker] did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.”Video game performers in the SAG-AFTRA union have been on strike since July, the major issue being the use of generative AI in the games industry. The union wants members to be compensated when AI performances are generated from their work, and demands consent and transparency around Gen AI technology. Major video game publishers such as Activision Blizzard, Disney, Warner Bros and Electronic Arts are involved in the dispute, and several recent titles including Destiny 2: Heresy and Genshin Impact have been affected, with English-language voice performances missing. AI voice synthesis isbeing touted as a means of cutting costsin an industry where game budgets are spiralling, but such technologies imperil actors’ livelihoods while relying on their work to seed virtual performances. Plus, the budgetary benefits of the tech are still in question.Experienced voice actor Sarah Elmaleh, who has appeared in games such as Fortnite, Halo Infinite and Gears 5, is chairing the SAG-AFTRA committee negotiating with the game industry. She sees in Ford’s statement a key underlying message: “What I hear is Mr Ford rightly pointing out that it is both more creatively valuable and more financially viable and efficient, especially for the whole of a major performance like this, to direct a talented human than to wrestle with an AI replica and its interface. The human-to-human interface of creating games performance can already be shockingly fast, when game actor and director are talented and experienced.”Many video game developers are willing to meet the union’s demands. According to Elmaleh more than 160 video game productions have signed interim or independent agreements with AI protections in place, ensuring that voice and motion capture work cannot be used to seed synthesised AI actors without permission. But major publishers are still holding out: a representative for the companiesrecently told Polygonthat they had put forward a proposal that includes “industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games”.However, in a document sent to members, SAG-AFTRA claims that the companies are seeking a variety of loopholes, including the classification of motion capture work as “data” rather than “performance”, and limiting protections only to performance work carried out after a new deal has been ratified. “It turns out the employers would like to be able to use all past game performances, and any external material, without consent or compensation,” says Elmaleh. “That means anything else you’ve performed in, TV or film-wise, anything you’ve put on social media, any interviews, anything they can ingest that’s already out there on the internet – all of that could be fair game. This fight certainly affects all actors, no matter the category …“If we don’t right now reject the assertion that performance as a concept can be flattened and dissolved into ‘data’, then the environment will be all the richer for abuse and exploitation across the board. Can you imagine telling Charlie Chaplin he wasn’t giving a performance – that he was just [creating] film, the material he was captured on? It sounds absurd in that context, but because digital tools and language are novel and abstract and often mysterious to people, bosses will say such things with an absolutely straight face.”Ford’s intervention has at least put the spotlight on the actors who aren’t household names, but whose onscreen video game characters definitely are. “No company in their right mind would tangle with Mr Ford’s team, or the bad optics of replicating him without any consent or compensation,” says Elmaleh. “But that’s what the bargaining group is trying to get away with for workaday actors.”Explore more on these topicsGamesHarrison FordUS unionsArtificial intelligence (AI)ShareReuse this content"

With unfair expectations, it’s the niche and left-field titles that will sufferKeza MacDonaldWed 12 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 10.02 ESTShareBack in 2013, having bought the series from Eidos, Square Enix released a reboot of the hit 1990s action game Tomb Raider starring a significantly less objectified Lara Croft. Iloved that game, despite a quasi-assault scene near the beginning that I would later come to view as a bit icky, and I wasn’t the only one – it was extremely well received, selling 3.4m copies in its first month alone. Then Square Enix came out andcalled it a disappointment.Sales did not meet the publisher’s expectations, apparently, which raises the question: whatwerethe expectations? Was it supposed to sell 5m inone month? If a book sells 10,000 copies in a week it’s considered a bestseller. Even at the height of its popularity in the 90s, no Tomb Raider game ever sold more than a few million. Square Enix’s expectations were clearly unrealistic. It wouldn’t be the last time; in a 2016 interview with Hajime Tabata, Final Fantasy XV’s director, he told me that game needed to sell 10m to succeed.Last week in an earnings call, EA’s executives had to explain a shortfall in profits. It was driven mostly by EA FC, the ubiquitous football series whose revenue was down on the previous year, but CEO Andrew Wilson also singled out the long-awaited RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which came out last October. “Dragon Age had a high-quality launch and was well reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market,” he said.Dragon Age has “reached 1.5 million players” in the months since launch, which presumably includes people paying via subscription services as well as direct sales. If 3.4m was a disappointment for Square Enix in 2013, you can only imagine that 1.5m was a disaster for EA in 2024, when games cost multiples more to make.However, as Polygon’s Maddy Myers points out ina detailed analysis of comparable games, 1.5m is more than Metaphor: ReFantazio (1m), and not much less than the second part of the Final Fantasy VII remake (2m) over comparable time periods. Dragon’s Dogma, the genre’s breakout hit last year, sold 3.3m over six months.View image in fullscreenA breakout hit … Dragon’s Dogma 2.Photograph: CapcomIn those terms, Dragon Age was certainly not a flop. I can only come to the same conclusion as Myers: EA’s expectations were unrealistic. The company was expecting an instant mega-hit from a game in a series that had sat dormant for 10 years. The Veilguard had been rebooted and reworked several times over a tortuous development period, during which time BioWare struggled enormously. Having previously made standard-setting role-playing games in Mass Effect, Dragon Age and Star Wars: The Old Republic, its only releases since 2014 were Mass Effect: Andromeda (disappointing) and mech shooter Anthem (broken). Meanwhile, a different developer hadan enormous hitwith a series that BioWare itself established: Baldur’s Gate, which sold 15m.The developers at BioWare have suffered the fallout from this. The studio is now down to a relativelybare bones staff of 100, and it seems EA will not be giving it the chance to build on what it achieved with The Veilguard. It’sa miracle that game existsat all.I’ve written a lot in this newsletter about the ridiculously high stakes of modern video game development; it’s clear that a more sustainable path needs to be forged. But in 2025 as in 2013, short-termism and unrealistic expectations on a corporate level stand in the way. That Tomb Raider reboot ended up selling more than 14m over time, more than any other game in the series. First-quarter sales cannot be used as the first and final measure of a game’s success. Nintendo’s principle of selling the same games for literally decades has meant that plenty of mid-selling titles have become million-sellers over time.There was also a point in EA’s history – indeed in most publishers’ history – where the portfolio was more important than each individual game’s profitability. The likes of EA FC and Call of Duty were the bankable successes that could fund the rest of the slate, allowing those publishers to make room for thenextsurprise success. Not every game released in a year by a given company was expected to be a mega-hit. As long as the overall slate was profitable, there was space for the critically acclaimed or fan-pleasing games that didn’t break out of their niche.The space for those games now appears to be confined to independent developers and the smaller publishers that overtly support them. Mike Laidlaw, the director of the first three Dragon Age games, left BioWare in 2017 and formed a new studio in 2020; its first game, Eternal Strands, came out last month and is picking up great word-of-mouth buzz. By all accounts it’s a banger – and its team haven’t had to labour under the expectation of instant success.What to playView image in fullscreenWhy are we waiting … While Waiting’s gameplay.Photograph: Optillusion Games/SteamWhile Waitingcame out a few days ago, an unusual game that feels like a playable version of those slice-of-life newspaper cartoons. You play through the life of an incredibly regular guy, from birth through waiting for exam results through all the banal moments of his existence at the doctor’s surgery, crossing the road, waiting for new software updates to finally finish their endless install cycles. You can do absolutely nothing, or mess around in each scene to amuse yourself. It’s an interactive version of the adage that life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans, a small celebration of embracing the mundane.Available on:PC, Nintendo SwitchEstimated playtime:5 hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re perfect in moments of crisis and joy, and make the recipient feel thought of. So, you might think that sending flowers would be hard to get wrong. However, flower deliveries aren’t cheap, so investing in a bunch that won’t wilt on day one is essential.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whether you’re thoughtfully browsing ahead for the perfect arrangement for Mother’s Day – or panic shopping the day before Valentine’s Day (no judgment) – online flower delivery services cater for everyone. Many of them offer amazing turnaround times too, including same-day delivery.While doing my research, I grilled each service about its sustainability initiatives and looked for delivery services that provided British-grown flowers. I tested in January – not a time when the UK is bursting with blooms, but my research revealed they’re out there, even in winter.At a glanceBest overall:Marks & Spencer£100 at M&SBest budget:Scilly Flowers£28.50 at Scilly FlowersBest subscription service:Freddie’s Flowers£41 at Freddie’s FlowersBest same-day flowers:InterfloraFrom £75 at InterfloraBest letterbox flowers:Bloom & Wild£42 at Bloom and WildWhy you should trust meI’ve been in the product-testing game for four years now, and have reviewed more than 1,000 products in that time. I’ve tested everything from heated blankets to high chairs, and all my reviews are firm but fair.I’m a self-confessed anthophile, and this isn’t my first time testing flower delivery services. Of course, I love luxury flowers as much as the next person – I have a soft spot for a fussy arrangement or silk ribbon – but I also have a lot of time for budget flowers. In spring, I rarely go past a bucket of £1 supermarket daffodils without picking up a bunch. Whatever your budget, I’m determined to hunt down the best bouquet for your buck.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I needed to invest in several new vases.’Photograph: Zoë PhillimoreDuring testing, I received many bunches from the main British flower-delivery services. In fact, I received 17 arrangements over a few days. My regular courier drivers asked if everything was OK, as they were delivering enough flowers to evensatisfy Elton John’s needs. The flowers were counted and cut on arrival to condition them, and then arranged into vases and placed around my house. I followed the directions for each bunch where relevant – arranging them and adding flower food as suggested.I kept my eye on each bouquet every day, noting when any flowers began to fade. My house is a draughty Victorian number, but I did fire up the central heating and log burner intermittently to see how the flowers coped. I had all the flowers delivered over the course of two days so I could be sure they all underwent the same conditions (yes, I did need to invest in several new vases – charity shops are great hunting grounds for them).The best flower delivery services in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Iaroslava Zolotko/Getty Images/iStockphotoBest overall:Marks & SpencerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore£100 at M&SBouquet tested:rose, freesia and eucalyptus bouquetThis is a huge arrangement. There were 72 stems, with white and off-green roses making up the bulk of the hand-tied bouquet. There were also feathery freesias and lisianthus, and two types of deliciously scented eucalyptus. White veronica added drama.Why we love itThese are not just flowers, these are … sorry, I just can’t finish that sentence without screaming. But these are undeniably premium quality. The bouquet is dramatic and abundant, teeming with white and green flowers and foliage. And the stems were incredibly fresh. Marks and Spencer offers a guarantee that its flowers will look beautiful for at least five days. The flowers in my bunch exceeded this by some stretch, with just a few roses drooping after six days and everything else lasting into week two.M&S says it sources as many flowers from Britain as it can, depending on what’s in season. It also uses sustainable packaging. The flowers I tested came in a cardboard box and the bouquet was wrapped in kraft paper with a form of cellophane wrap over the top.It’s a shame that…some of the roses drooped quite quickly compared with the rest of the flowers in the arrangement.Fastest delivery:next dayDelivery cost:FreeB Corp certified:noBest budget:Scilly FlowersView image in fullscreen£28.50 at Scilly FlowersBouquet tested:60 scented narcissiSpring sunshine in a box, this affordable delivery overflows with 60 beautiful budded narcissus stems, some vibrant egg-yolk yellow, some pastel. These could fill one massive vase or you would have plenty to split over two or three vases.Why we love itAll Scilly Flowers stems are grown naturally outdoors without artificial light or heat. As such, these particular flowers are available from October to Easter. The whole farm is making strides in sustainability with low-irrigation initiatives, a solar power cold store and postal plane and boat shipping.The flowers were easily the most highly scented delivery I received. They’re low-effort, maximum joy in flower form. You don’t need any special skills to arrange them because they’re so gloriously simple. Many of the stems came as buds, and gradually opened up over the week, which spread the joy for longer.It’s a shame that…this bouquet isn’t available all year round, although that’s understandable.Fastest delivery: 1st class Royal MailDelivery cost:freeB Corp certified:noBestsubscription service:Freddie’s FlowersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore£41 at Freddie’s FlowersBouquet tested:showstopper (seasonal arrangements change on four-weekly cycles)Freddie’s Flowers started as a subscription business, but now offers one-off gifts, too. For the subscription plan – which is the one I tested – you can set a day and frequency of your choice, and you can skip and cancel deliveries too. The flowers arrive in a box with instructions on how to arrange them best – so creative types will get a kick out of this subscription.Why we love itThe flowers arrived unarranged, so I had loads of fun arranging the stems, following the instructions – but with a bit of creative licence. Some might find this stressful, but if you really love flowers it’s such a joy to create your own display. The stems are all great quality and these flowers lasted the longest of any on test by some stretch. My finished arrangement was dramatic for sure – it filled a huge vase (you can opt for classic or the more spenny “showstopper” box that I tested) and provided a focal point in my dining room.I love that the subscription model means flowers are grown to order and that all packaging is biodegradable. Freddie’s Flowers also allows you to return the delivery boxes to be reused – great if you have the space to save the box. The company is also signed up to the Floriculture Sustainability Initiative (FSI). The FSI focuses on responsible production and trade while attempting to improve the entire supply chain.It’s a shame that…you don’t have much control over your delivery days, or which flowers you get – beware, cat owners, as lilies might be in the mix.Fastest delivery: variable – delivery days are set depending on your postcodeDelivery cost:£4B Corp certified:yesBest same-day flowers:InterfloraView image in fullscreenFrom £75 at InterfloraBouquet tested:All My LoveInterflora is the flower-industry middle man, uniting customers with local florists who make the arrangements and then deliver them. The bouquet style is dictated by Interflora. I got a Valentine’s special, All My Love, which had a couple of red roses, pink gerbera and peach-blush stocks along with foliage.Why we love itInterflora is such a convenient service. It links you with a local florist, which is ideal if you’re sending flowers to someone in a town you’re not particularly familiar with. The flowers for my order came from my favourite local florist. Using local florists reduces the carbon footprint of the service somewhat. And the flowers themselves were beautiful – full of colour at a time of year when this is hard to achieve. If you order before 3pm, you can even get same-day delivery – great if you want to say “sorry you’re having a crappy day” to someone straight away (or have some making up to do).It’s a shame that…at £75, I expected more than two roses in a bouquet.Fastest delivery:same day (order before 3pm)Delivery cost:£10 for same-day delivery, £7.50 for named-day deliveryB Corp certified:noskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

After testing various letterbox flowers, I rate Bloom & Wild as the best. There are two types of roses and some tulips in the mix, as well as pistache foliage. Their riot of colour and blousy petals were very welcome in grey January.Why we love itThe best thing about this bunch is that they came with the bulbs still attached to the tulips. Not only does this look cool in the vase, but it means you can keep the bulbs, store them in a paper bag (also provided), and plant them out next year to grow in your garden or window box. It’s best to plant them between September and November, or in December or January. They should then bloom again in six months.I also loved how brightly coloured this bunch is, with plenty of pinks, reds and oranges that provided a colour clash I personally enjoyed. For the price, this had plenty of main character flowers – 11 in my count, which is much more than some of the pricer arrangements I received.It’s a shame that…the roses didn’t last longer.Fastest delivery:next dayDelivery cost:freeB Corp certified:yesThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: yacobchuk/Getty Images/iStockphotoSmith & MunsonView image in fullscreen£30 at Smith and MunsonBest for:British-grown single-variety flowersBouquet tested:pink British tulipsSmith & Munson grows all its flowers in Lincolnshire – it specialises in tulips, like the sample I tried, lilies, peonies and ranunculus. These are all seasonal, so you can’t get them out of season. I loved that they came in a dramatic cylinder, bursting with 20 tulips.They were all buds when they arrived, ensuring they lasted as long as possible. However, thanks to the wonders of central heating, they quickly unfurled to showcase their candy-pink hues. Smith & Munson is dedicated to growing quality flowers in the UK, and having a single-variety bouquet meant every stem was a winner.It didn’t make the final cut because …the flowers didn’t last quite as long as we’d have liked (about five days)Fastest delivery:24 hours (Tuesday-Saturday);delivery cost:free;B Corp certified:noFlowerbxView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë PhillimoreFrom £65 at FlowerbxBest for:show-stopping flowersBouquet tested:peach avalanche roses, 20 stemsFlowerbx is another delivery service that offers single-variety bunches. For me, this was a peach avalanche rose, and you can pick from 20 to 100 stems. My arrangement was 20 stems, and they were absolutely gorgeous. Tightly budded when they arrived, they quickly opened and brought the drama to my kitchen island. I had so many admiring comments from visitors about them – many people deemed them the best. Despite being a single-variety offering, these still arrived as an arrangement rather than flat in a box, creating a bigger wow factor.It didn’t make the final cut because …the delivery turnaround times can be fairly long for £5.Fastest delivery:same day in London, variable nationwide;delivery cost:from £5;B Corp certified:yesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: yacobchuk/Getty ImagesSustainabilityCut flowers don’t have a great reputation in the sustainability stakes, but many brands are working hard to improve practices. Look for British-grown flowers where you can, and go for those that are seasonal. Peonies in January are just not a good vibe for the planet.Delivery timesNot all flower-delivery services offer next-day delivery. Check the delivery service offering on the website or underneath each entry above. And some can sneak in the cost on top of the flowers, which ends up making a fairly affordable bunch rather punchy.How to make your flowers last longer at homeCut flowers may only last for five days at home, even with all the variables being in their favour. Roses and tulips especially don’t last long. However, other flowers such as hydrangeas and chrysanthemums can go for a lot longer.To make your flowers last longer at home, you’ve got to think about care and the environment. Only ever use a clean vase, then trim off a few centimetres from the end of each stem. Cut them at a 45-degree angle to increase the surface area in the water. Remove any foliage on the stem below the water line, and then put them in cool water, mixed with flower food (all decent flowers should come with flower food).12 affordable jewellery brands, worn and rated for style and qualityRead morePick the right spot for your flowers. Spring flowers don’t appreciate being near heat sources. Don’t put them too close to your fruit bowl, either: fruit releases ethylene gas, which makes your flowers wilt more quickly.Tips for buying seasonal flowersAs well as being more sustainable, seasonal flowers will last longer in your home. Knowing what’s in season is the best place to start. If you’re buying flowers in the depths of winter, this means no sunflowers or dahlias are coming your way.Buy your flowers from a local florist, or via an online flower delivery service that says it offers British seasonal flowers. It may take a deep dive to find out what that actually looks like. Flower subscriptions, such as Freddie’s Flowers above, are also a great way to get seasonal flowers that have been grown to order.Zoë Phillimore is a freelance journalistwith 20 years of experience.She’s tested everything from mattresses to makeup, and she’s slightly obsessed with finding small new businesses to spotlight.

Do a thorough inventory of your pantry and make a list of items, noting their expiry dates. Operate a “fifo” rotation system: first in, first out. Arrange items so those with the shortest shelf life are at the front.There are many benefits to keeping a good inventory, not least the avoidance of duplicate purchases.It can also fuel new meal ideas based on available ingredients, minimising waste and maximising savings.There are several apps available – such as Fridge Pal, KitchenPal and Your Food: No Waste Inventory – that can help you take stock of your larder, but I prefer pen and paper.Use a whiteboard or a notepad in your kitchen to jot down what needs to be used up first or what needs to be replaced, and use this to plan your shopping list.Some of the larder inventory apps cost money to download but will send reminders of items that are close to expiry, helping you to use them in time and avoid the financial and environmental costs associated with food waste.Get to grips with expiry datesUnderstanding the difference between “use-by” and “best before” dates can lead to significant savings. Don’t fall into the trap of disposing of perfectly usable food just because you think it is out of date.View image in fullscreenFood that is beyond its best before date is often still safe to eat.Photograph: AlamyA use-by date is a food safety directive in place to avoid illness and should be adhered to. A best before date refers only to the quality of the food rather than its safety. The manufacturers have deemed that the product may not be at its best after that date but it could still be safe to eat.Store it properlyMake yourself aware of proper storage techniques because they can significantly reduce spoilage and waste. It is important to store perishables in the fridge, but remember that some fruit, such as bananas and tomatoes, fare better at room temperature.Remove all foods from plastic before storing them to avoid sweating. Familiarise yourself with the fruit and vegetables that are high in ethylene, a gas released during the ripening process that encourages the ripening of anything nearby. These include apples, bananas, avocados, tomatoes and pears.How to refurbish your home successfully – and enjoy the journeyRead moreKeep grains and legumes such as lentils and chickpeas in airtight containers to protect against pests and moisture. Excessive moisture leads to spoilage.Ensure you use your spices and condiments fifo style. If you have two jars of cumin, use the one with the shortest shelf life first and store the other in a separate space to avoid confusion. As with all of your pantry, don’t overstock your spice rack. Keep spices in a cool, dark place to extend shelf life. For best results, invest in a spice grinder and only grind whole spices as you need them.View image in fullscreenGrinding whole spices as you need them is a good idea.Photograph: Marcin Jucha/AlamyUse up leftoversOne of the reasons a well-stocked larder is so important in my household is that it helps me make the most of any leftovers. I’ll often purposely cook a little more than we need to give myself a head start on one of the next day’s meals. One of my favourite ways to use up leftover potatoes, for example, is a tuna and caper potato cake topped with a poached egg and some pesto.Some of the most interesting dinners are created when there’s “nothing in the house”. Simply knowing what to do with a couple of tins of chickpeas, a can of tomatoes and a can of coconut milk means that even when the fridge is running low, a delicious meal can be made in minutes.View image in fullscreenHomemade vegetable soup.Photograph: Cavan Images/AlamyMost vegetables, for example, will make a wonderful soup when combined with some basic larder ingredients such as onions and stock. Leftover proteins and vegetables can be transformed into hearty casseroles with the addition of a can of tomatoes and some grains and spices.Embrace bulk buyingBuying in bulk can be a savvy way to save money, especially for non-perishable items.Focus on items that have a long shelf life, such as grains, legumes, canned goods and spices. Whole spices and bulk-buy legumes are now available at some good supermarkets but try to locate a nearby wholesaler for the best value.View image in fullscreenAirtight containers are a good way to keep bulk items fresh and free of pests.Photograph: Rachel Husband/AlamyEnsure you have adequate storage space to keep bulk items fresh and free of pests. The airtight containers you find in most good homeware stores are invaluable for maintaining quality. When we looked, Argos had a12-piece storage box collectionfor £22, and Ikea hadthree boxes for £5.Pickle itIt’s a good idea to learn the basics of preserving fruit and vegetables. This allows you to enjoy seasonal produce all year round while saving money.The most basic pickling recipe is to take equal parts of apple cider vinegar to sugar and water, bring the mixture to the boil and simmer until all the sugar is dissolved. Then allow it to cool.Using a fully sterilised jar, put raw vegetables inside and pour the liquid over, ensuring they are fully immersed. Pickling is particularly useful if you have a glut of some type of vegetable that you are not likely to get through. It elongates shelf life, and it’s how many grandparents made their larders last through the winter.Pickled vegetables last for varying times. If stored correctly, in airtight containers in cool dark spaces, most are good for at least three months.Ferment itWhile pickling is submerging something in vinegar, fermenting is preserving it in salt and water. The process is much easier than might be expected and the results help gut health. Many people begin with cabbage, cucumbers or carrots, but the possibilities and varieties are endless.View image in fullscreenFermented lemons.Photograph: Lyudmila Mikhailovskaya/ShutterstockWash the ingredients and chop them into bite-size pieces if necessary. Salt is crucial in fermentation because it helps to draw out moisture and creates an environment conducive to beneficial bacteria. A general rule of thumb is to use about 2-3% salt by weight of the produce.Combine the salt with your food in a bowl and massage it for a few minutes. This process helps release the juices from the vegetables, creating a brine. Then transfer the mixture into clean, sterilised jars, ensuring you pack it tightly and leave some space at the top. Make sure the vegetables are submerged in their brine to prevent spoilage. Seal the jars and store them in a cool, dark place at room temperature.Depending on the temperature and the ingredients, fermentation can take anything from a few days to a few weeks. Taste occasionally until you reach the taste you want and then move the jars to the fridge to slow down the fermentation process. This will help preserve the flavours and keep the food safe to eat.Orla McAndrew is the author ofLarder, which is published by Blasta BooksExplore more on these topicsFood wasteMoney hacksFoodSaving moneyConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He much prefers to ruffle a few feathers.Literally so, this season. Birds, which along with shrunken grey suits are aThom Brownesignature, were everywhere. The models’ eyelashes, made from bright feathers, had a wingspan that dusted the collar. Above the catwalk, 2,000 origami birds were suspended in flight.But Browne may be disappointed this season, because these clothes were easy to love. Jackets and coats in British-made tweeds, their proportions tweaked rather than distorted, were charmingly embroidered with herons and magpies drawn from theluscious watercoloursof John J Audubon’s Birds of America anthology. “I mix the conceptual with the classic, and it seems to work,” as he put it with a shrug after this show.View image in fullscreenA model’s eyelashes made from bright feathers.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockBrowne wants to make clothes that are used, worn and worn again and again, embedded into real lives. Hence why he loves a suit, that 9-to-5, bread-and-butter uniform. But the skewed proportions of Browne’s suiting, with their tight sleeves and short legs, are a wink to camera by which the wearer tells the world that they are game for taking risks. David Bowie was a devoted customer.

Every man who wears his trousers slightly cropped, so that a flash of sock is visible above his shoes, owes his look to Browne, who has based his career on the deliberately awkward proportions of the grey suits he has been selling since 2001. (Browne calls the ankle “male cleavage”.)

Silhouette is paramount, which is why Browne uses grey, to sharpen the focus on shape. There was a new sporty boxiness this season – “a nod to the Super Bowl”, he said – in quarterback-wide blazers. But plenty of colours, too, this season: a pale pink cocoon gown had pistachio silk peeking from inverted pleats.Browne has become a pillar of the American fashion industry. In 2018, he sold an 85% stake in his company to the Zegna group in a deal that valued his brand at $500,000 (£403,327).

If you’re wondering where to tuck in, try these hot picksAilsa SheldonWed 12 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 02.04 ESTShareEdinburgh is having a foodie moment. Last week it was named the Most Exciting Food Destination for 2025 by The Good Food Guide. This week, the Michelin Guide Ceremony (Great Britain and Ireland) – held in Scotland for the first time – saw new stars awarded toLylaandAvery, and new Bib Gourmand awards forArdfernandSkua.The city is not immune from hospitality sector pressures, but there has been wave after wave of new openings recently, from casual cafes, pizza and taco bars to fine-dining, and everything in between.After seven years reviewing restaurants in the city, it’s hard to narrow down my favourites … but here are 10 places that I’m always thrilled to eat at, for every budget.The PalmerstonFew restaurants have claimed the heart of Edinburgh residents quite like The Palmerston. It’s a bright airy space, a former bank branch transformed into an elegant easy-going restaurant. Sustainability and local produce guide the menus, with proper starters, mains and puddings. Settle in with a large plate of baked Berkshire pork shoulder, swede mash, January King cabbage, cider and sage (£27) with a glass of something delicious from the cellar. The weekday set lunch (Tues-Fri) is a steal (two courses £21, three courses £24).1 Palmerston Place,thepalmerstonedinburgh.co.ukArdfernView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AwAyeMediaThis relaxed all-day cafe and wine bar from Edinburgh-born, award-winning chef Roberta Hall-McCarron is next door to her flagship restaurant The Little Chartroom. While the Chartroom is dreamy for a special occasion, Ardfern has become part of the fabric of Leith. The day begins with good coffee and fresh doughnuts (£4.50), pork belly brioche buns (from £6.50), and stacked hash browns (£8). Later, order barbecue aubergine tacos with sweetcorn, fermented chilli and feta (£13) or braised beef pie with beans (£20).10-12 Bonnington Road,ardfern.ukPomeloView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christina LeahyOn cold days I daydream about hot hand-ripped noodles at Pomelo: chewy, spicy and singing with Sichuan peppercorns (£11.50). Chef Jun Au’s vibrant take on modern Chinese cooking is fresh and fun with a small changing menu. Come for the noodles at lunchtime, or in the evening for family-style dishes to share (from £8.50). The windows steam up and you’ll bump elbows with a neighbour, but I promise you won’t care.27 Sciennes Road,pomelocafe.co.ukLeftfieldView image in fullscreenEvery neighbourhood deserves a restaurant like this: one where you feel like an invited guest on every visit. This intimate family-run bistro has gorgeous views over Bruntsfield Links towards Arthur’s Seat. On the menu you’ll find the freshest Scottish seafood, cooked with creativity and care. Start with Shetland mussels (£12), then try sea trout with broccolini, olives, and wild garlic butter sauce (£20).12 Barclay Terrace,leftfieldedinburgh.co.ukKa PaoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianWhether perched at the bar or tucked into a booth, Ka Pao feels like somewhere you can stay all night. Experimental small dishes are inspired by the flavours of south-east Asia, using Scotland’s larder. A favourite is Arbroath smokie miang, with galangal, spinach and peanuts (£7.50) and the corn ribs with salted coconut, shrimp and lime are messy but addictive (£7). Take friends for the sharing menu to try as many dishes as possible (£30.50pp).St James Quarter,ka-pao.comHarajuku KitchenView image in fullscreenThis bistro sets high standards for Japanese food in Edinburgh. There’s a rustic feel to the space: exposed brick walls, rattan lights and fabric screens echoing ryokan walls. The food is incredible, the sashimi is light and delicate, arranged with precision and care, and always the highest quality (from £7). The £14.90 weekday lunch menu (and served 5pm-6pm) is unbeatable.10 Gillespie Place,harajukukitchen.co.ukMontroseView image in fullscreenSister restaurant to the Michelin-starred Timberyard, Montrose offers the same experimental approach to Scottish ingredients at a more affordable price. The award-winning drinks list includes low-intervention wines, and homemade bitters, liqueurs, vermouths and soft drinks. In the wine bar, order oysters and olives, then playful dishes like suyo cucumber, burnt vegetable dressing and egg yolk (£8). The weekend set lunch is a delicious demonstration of this kitchen’s creativity (£20/£25 for two or three courses). Upstairs the restaurant is a more formal affair, also delightful (set menu £80).1-7 Montrose Terrace,montroserestaurant.coLylaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Murray OrrIf you’re going to blow the budget in style: go to Lyla where Stuart Ralston – executive chef and owner of four restaurants in the city – is at the peak of his powers. Expect 10 delicate-but-dazzling seafood-focused courses from the open kitchen. A year since eating here I still recall tender cured plaice decorated with radish flowers, an individual exmoor caviar pearl in every bud; cured trout sashimi fanned into petals on smooth salty chawanmushi, with marigold, lemon and nori, and a fat langoustine wrapped in crisp pastry strands, dunked in burnt apple and sorrel ketchup. (dinner £165, lunch £65/£95 for five to seven courses).3 Royal Terrace,lylaedinburgh.co.ukKitchen Table by Twelve TrianglesView image in fullscreenEdinburgh does cafes really well, with dozens of lovely spaces to while away an afternoon. Kitchen Table is one of the best, run by early Edinburgh sourdough pioneers Twelve Triangles. Pull up a mismatched wooden chair and order granola for breakfast with homemade yoghurt, berry compote, nut butter, and fresh fruit (£8.50), later perhaps a huge focaccia sandwich with black garlic roast aubergine, hummus, salsa and zhoug (£12.50). Co-owners Emily Cuddeford and Rachel Morgan have a cookbook out this spring and I dearly hope their Basque cheesecake (£6.50) has earned a page.22-24Easter Road,twelvetriangles.co.ukEleanoreView image in fullscreenThere’s a soft minimal design to the interior at Eleanore, helping this small restaurant feel calm and relaxed rather than crowded. Think sleek lines, handmade ceramics and thick curtains, all allowing the focus to rest on the food, which is outstanding. There’s a set menu, though do add the oysters. Recently, I loved a main of cod au poivre with creamed spinach and sweet roscoff onions, followed by Eleanore’s cult Tirami-choux bun.

Thecaneléde Bordeauxis a prime example of such understated genius. An inexperienced eye might well miss these squat little Doric columns amid the glitz and glaze of a French patisserie, but as my friendNicola Lambputs it, discovering them“is like being in a secret club, a club that all shares a valuable piece of knowledge: the canelé is the pastry GOAT”. That unassuming mahogany shell should shatter into caramelised shards to reveal a rich, almost custardy vanilla- and rum-scented interior.View image in fullscreenLabour of love: Felicity’s prototype perfect cannelés. All thumbnails taken by Felicity Cloake.Not that many people who’ve tried making cannelés at home would call them simple; rarely have I sifted through so muchagonised discussion and mournful photosof failed attempts that have mushroomed out of their moulds or failed to brown on top. Many thousands of words have been devoted to the correct way to season bespoke hand-tooled copper cannelé moulds with beeswax, the precise temperature of the milk, the optimum time to age the mixture, all creating almost as much mystique around what is basically a batter pudding as there is around its origins. For all the talk of 17th-century nuns with a glut of egg yolks from the local winemaking industry, the first mention of cannelésdates from 1937. In fact, they did not become widely available even in Bordeaux, where they are now omnipresent, until the establishment in 1985 of the Confrérie de Canelé, the organisation that dictated that authentic Bordeaux cannelés should be distinguished by being spelled with just the one n. Henceforth, therefore, I will revert to the original spelling of cannelé out of respect for the Brotherhood, and because such a simple recipe cannot possibly be in the least authentic, however delicious the results.The batterView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s version turns out to be the testers’ favourite.Cannelé batter – a mixture of milk, eggs, butter, sugar and flour – is not dissimilar to that used for clafoutis (or indeed sweet Yorkshire pudding), save for the fact that it features fewer eggs and more milk. I am neither a professional chef nor a chemist, so here I will quote directly from Lamb, a pastry chef and author of theaward-winning Sift, who credits this low flour, high liquid content for the cannelé’s distinctively moist yet springy interior. The “high proportion of liquid set [is] thanks to a mixture of starch gelatinisation and egg coagulation,” she writes on her Kitchen Projects baking newsletter. “The thick, browned crust is thanks to a strong browning reaction from the milk solids. Here’s my theory: as the canelés [sic] go into the oven, the batter heats up. As it passes 70C, the starches and egg begin to set, but it remains a flexible network due to the high proportion of liquid. As the batter continues to heat, water in the milk and eggs evaporates via steam, resulting in the custardy, holey network we know and love.”The precise ratio is a matter of hot debate, though most of the recipes I try operate in a fairly narrow window, with ratios of flour to milk ranging from 1:3.6-1:5, flour to sugar 1:1.6 to 2 and flour to butter from 1:0.2 to 0.5 (though that 0.2 isa recipe from American baker Erin Jeanne McDowell, who uses heavy [whipping] cream as well as milk, which will make up the fat content). I find that those with the most milk (French pastry supremoPierre Herméand the legendary American food writerPaula Wolfert) also have the dampest interiors, those with the least butter (Wolfert and McDowell) have the most delicate flavour, and the recipe with the highest total number of egg yolks (Hermé again) is the richest.View image in fullscreenPaula Wolfert’s cannelé has a somewhat ‘damp interior’.Even within eggs, though, there’s little consensus: Hermé, McDowell and the Bordelais bakeriesla Toque CuivréeandBaillardranuse a mixture of whole eggs and egg yolks; while Lamb, Wolfert andDominique Ansel(in whose bakery Lamb once toiled filling a hundred cannelés every morning) work with just yolks. The higher water content of the egg whites is (I assume) what gives the former group’s bakes a slightly taller, springier texture, so I’ve hedged my bets and gone for a yolk-heavy mixture plus a single egg white. You, however, may prefer to stick with four yolks for a denser cannelé, or two yolks and two whole eggs for a lighter one. My recipe below is based on my testers’ most popular cannelés, which come from Lamb, but with a couple of Hermé-inspired tweaks,visthe extra egg white and the use of icing sugar.Indeed, Hermé is the only recipe to call for icing rather than caster sugar: Ansel even goes so far as tocaution againstthe use of icing sugar, saying that the cornflour that stops it caking together causes the mixture to “puff up excessively”. I don’t find that to be the case, and Hermé’s cannelés also boast a distinctively crackly crust, which, in the absence of other clues, I put down to the powdered sugar’s ability to melt more quickly before caramelising on the hot metal of the moulds. If anyone can supply any other, better founded suggestions, I’d be delighted to hear them.View image in fullscreenVanilla and dark rum are the traditional flavourings, and I see no reason to deviate; you could, if you like, save yourself some money and a little work by swapping the vanilla pod for a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and stir it in along with the rum, in which case there’s no need to infuse the milk. Though not “correct”, as the French would say, whisky or brandy would do instead of rum, if that’s all you have; alternatively, leave out the booze altogether and replace it with the same amount of milk.The methodA lot, apparently, rests on the method when it comes to cannelés. Bakery bloggerElan Kogan describes them on the Iron Whisk as potentially “France’s, and perhaps even the world’s,most complicated pastry”, though Rory McDonald of the Institute of Culinary Education says the cannelé recipe itself is “relatively simple”, with the technique and execution being key. “Egg yolks, flour, butter, salt and milk are mixed together in a very specific order and left overnight so the flour can absorb the milk and hydrate before baking.”Good pastry chefs are always concerned with the minutiae, but having made five versions with as many different formulae for success, I can tell you that, as cannelé amateurs, we felt that almost all of them worked a treat. Wolfert whizzes the chilled butter, sugar and eggs into the flour like a cake mixture before beating in hot milk, while Lamb whisks melted butter into flour. McDowell melts the butter in the milk until hot, then beats the two into the eggs, flour and sugar. The easiest, however – which is, of course, the one I have borrowed – comes from Hermé, who combines everything cold, whisking the sugar into the eggs, then stirring in the remaining ingredients.View image in fullscreenAnne Willan’s cannelé is a bit of a ‘faff’.The only failure I have is withAnne Willan’s recipe, which uses a method from her friend “Chef Chambrette, now in his 80s”, who believed the secret was to “cook the egg-and-milk mixture until it curdles like overcooked crème anglaise”. Not only is this a bit of faff, but, perhaps because the batter isn’t allowed to rest, the cannelés balloon up and then sink, giving them huge pockets of air in the middle. I have no doubt that the venerable chef and Willan herself can turn out perfect cannelés using this method, but I find it difficult to master.The salutary lesson I take from this disaster is that the single most important thing with cannelés is to minimise the amount of air in the batter. To this end, it’s vital to rest the batter to allow the flour to hydrate, which will yield a denser, but more evenly risen result. However, it’s fine to hand-whisk the batter to combine it (and much easier than barely stirring it and pushing the resulting lumps of flour through a sieve, as some recipes recommend). . I also suggest tapping the tin on a work surface a couple of times before baking, to eliminate any lurking air bubbles, and keeping an eye on the oven, so you can puncture any mushrooming tops before they get out of hand.The tin(s) and the temperatureView image in fullscreenFirst things first: if you want to invest £100 on copper moulds, be my guest – they certainly look very pretty, and traditionalists insist they are the only way to bake cannelés – but please know that you can get very decent results with thick, nonstick metal moulds. Silicone, in my opinion, is never much good for anything crunchy and, honestly, you shouldn’t have a problem with the cannelés sticking so long as you brush the moulds with melted butter or, my own preference, baking spray (easily found online). If you do use copper, you can also have a go at seasoning them with melted beeswax, which imparts a lovely, shiny finish and, it’s claimed, has a subtle flavour of its own. But frankly, life is too short and it’s difficult for me to take a tradition seriously when it’s probably younger than I am.Opinions also differ as to the best temperature for perfection: Wolfert freezes the tin before use, Lamb heats it so the batter sizzles as it hits the metal, and Hermé fills it cold. Unexpectedly, having tried both temperatures with the same batter, I find I get a better crust from a cold tin and a steady temperature of 200C (180C fan) gas 6, rather than starting the cannelés off very hot, then turning down the heat. How long you leave them in there for, though, is up to you. Hermé believes that “When it’s black, it’s cooked. I sometimes see bakers cook them only to golden, and that’s no good. A cannelé has to be black.” Rory McDonald (a south-London boy originally) notes that “having lived in the US for a long time, I don’t think this would work here. Customers will either think the pastry is burnt or a chocolate flavour. Either way, it has to be baked lighter for this market.”View image in fullscreen‘When it’s black, it’s cooked,’ says Pierre Hermé.I, however, think the bittersweetness of burnt sugar is one of the cannelé’s principal charms. However far you char, take them out of the tin immediately and leave to cool to warm before serving. They’re at their best by far eaten on the day of baking, but they can be perked up by being put in a warm oven the day after.Perfect cannelésPrep10 minInfuse30 minChill4 hr+Cook90 minMakes121 vanilla pod400ml whole milk50g butter, plus extra, melted, to grease (or use baking spray)1 egg3 egg yolks200g icing sugar⅛ tsp fine salt50ml dark rum100g plain flour, siftedView image in fullscreenSlit the vanilla pod down its length and scrape out the seeds.Put both in a small saucepan, add the milk and bring slowly to a simmer.Turn off the heat and leave to infuse until cool.

(If you are using copper moulds, season them according to the instructions.)Take the batter out of the fridge half an hour before you’re planning to bake. Put a baking tray on a lower shelf of the oven and heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Stir the batter again until smooth.View image in fullscreenGrease your moulds well with melted butter or baking spray, then pour in the batter to fill them ½cm from the top. Tap the moulds on a work surface to get rid of any bubbles, then put them on the hot tray and bake for 70-90 minutes, depending on how dark you like them. Keep an eye on them, though: if the cannelés puff up, swiftly prick with the tip of a knife, but be careful not to let too much heat out of the oven as you do so.Take out of the oven and quickly unmould from the tins (a butter knife helps here), then leave to cool on a rack – the cannelés will crisp up as they cool. Best enjoyed on the day of baking.Canelés, cannelés: however you spell them, why do they have such a fearsome reputation, and what are your secrets for success?

When it comes to a romantic meal, we can plan ahead, make an effort and present something a bit special or, more often than not, it’s a mad dash to the kitchen and a ready, steady, cook approach.Ducklegs will probably require a trip to the butchers, but the potato hash can be made with things you probably have at home already (or can easily find at the corner shop). Whatever your approach, the result must be delicious enough to say those three precious words: I love you.Duck legs with pear and swede (pictured top)Deeply savoury duck marries perfectly with sweet pears and slightly bitter swede.Prep10 minChill6 hr+Cook1 hr 40 minServes21 tsp table salt1 tsp Chinesefive-spiceFinley grated zest and juice of 1 orange2 duck legs(500-600g)1 swede, peeled and cut into 6 chunks (400-500g)1 firm pear, quartered and cored1 tsp sugarStart the day before. Mix the salt, five-spice and orange zest in a small bowl. Put the duck legs on a plate, scatter the spice mix over both sides, then cover and chill overnight, or for at least six hours.Twenty or 30 minutes before you want to start cooking, take the duck legs out of the fridge, uncover and set aside so the skin dries – this will help it crisp up nicely.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and put the duck legs skin side up in a small roasting tray or skillet. Roast uncovered for 25 minutes, then baste with whatever liquid has accumulated in the bottom of the tray. Lift out the duck, add the swede to the tray and stir so the chunks get coated in the duck juices. Put the duck legs on top of the swede, then return the tray to the oven for another 15 minutes. Baste again, add the four pear wedges to the tray, then turn down the heat to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, cover the tray and roast for another 30 minutes.Scoop three or four tablespoons of the duck roasting juices into a small bowl, add the orange juice and a teaspoon of sugar, and stir so the sugar dissolves. Pour this all over the duck legs, roast uncovered for a final 15 minutes, then serve.Greek potato hashView image in fullscreenHoney & Co’s Greek potato hash.When the salty feta melts on to the tomatoes and the egg yolk drapes over the potatoes, something very special happens.Prep10 minCook30 minServes21 lemon2 tbsp olive oil2red or maris piper potatoes, washed and diced into roughly 2cm cubes (about 400g)Flaky sea salt and black pepper1 tsp dried oregano1 red onion, peeled and diced (about 120g)2garlic cloves, peeled and halved250ml chicken stock,or 1 tsp chicken stock powder dissolved in 250ml boiling water1 large plum tomato, diced (about 130g)2 eggs100g feta1 handfulfresh basil leavesCut two thick slices off the unpeeled lemon, and save the rest for later.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.After five years,Appleis back with a full revamp of the earbuds that put its Beats headphones brand on the map for athletes and sports people: the Powerbeats Pro 2.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Designed to hook on to the ear and stay put without wires, the original Powerbeats Pro werethe best earbuds for working outand were worn by sports superstars including LeBron James and Anthony Joshua.For 2025 Apple has taken all the good bits of the originals and refined the fit, slimmed down the bulk, and added noise cancelling and heart rate monitoring for £250 (€300/$250/A$400), aiming to retake the premium workout earbuds top spot.The overall shape of the earbuds has stayed the same. A flexible silicone wire hooks over the back of the user’s ear while an arm connects it to an earbud that sits in their ear. The fit is lighter but no less secure than their predecessors: comfortable for extended listening sessions on the commute while not budging at all during vigorous exercise.View image in fullscreenEach earbud has a multifunction ‘b’ button for playback and noise cancelling control, plus a volume rocker for easy adjustment during workouts.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe earbuds last about eight hours of playback with noise cancelling (10 hours without it) and charge in a good flip-top case that contains enough juice for 3.5 full charges of the earbuds. The case is 30% smaller than before but it is still quite large, fitting easily in a bag but only in a pocket at a push.The Powerbeats Pro 2 have the same H2 chip and connectivity asApple’s AirPods Pro 2, which means a seamless connection with various Apple gear, including spatial audio for movies and music, audio sharing, Siri support and lossless audio when used with anApple Vision Pro.But the earbuds also support advanced features on Android too, using the Beats app for one-touch pairing, customisation, updates and other functions, making them much more flexible than other Apple earbuds.Great Beats sound and effective noise cancellingView image in fullscreenYou can adjust noise cancelling and other bits in the iPhone Bluetooth settings or with the Android Beats app.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe H2 chip gives the Powerbeats many of the top-class features of the AirPods. That includes active noise cancelling that is almost as effective as Apple’s top buds, able to significantly reduce outside sounds and only falling slightly behind by letting a little more of higher tones break through, such as chatting or clicks.The earbuds handle wind noise well and have a best-in-class transparency mode, which is excellent while out walking or in the gym. While running it accentuates your own footsteps a little and reduced my awareness slightly compared with bone-conduction headphones, but was perfectly usable in environments such as parks and safer streets.The new Powerbeats are easily Beats’ best-sounding earbuds, producing a balanced sound with great separation of tones, well-controlled punch in the low end and plenty of detail with high notes. They do justice to pop, hip-hop and big rock tracks while remaining rounded enough for more nuanced genres such as classical or jazz. They aren’t quite as good as the AirPods Pro and have no ability to adjust how they sound, which can be a little too clean and controlled for some tracks, lacking a little energy in dance tracks, but they are far better than most workout buds.The Beats also have Apple’s personalised spatial audio system with head-tracking for immersive movie sound with Apple devices, similar to AirPods, and excellent call quality for both ends of calls.SpecificationsConnectivity:Bluetooth5.3, SBC, AAC, H2 chip, HR sensorBattery life:8 hours ANC playback (36 hours with case)Water resistance:IPX4 earbuds (sweat resistant)Earbud dimensions:45 x 41 x 24mmEarbud weight:8.7g eachCharging case dimensions:75 x 66 x 34mmCharging case weight:69gCase charging:USB-C, Qi wirelessHeart rate monitoring in your earView image in fullscreenThe optical heart rate sensor sits just inside your ear next to the silicone tip.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Powerbeats have optical heart rate sensors that can monitor your pulse through your ears similar to Sennheiser’s recent Momentum Sport earbuds. The sensors are on the part of the earbuds that touches the inside of your tragus, and in theory can match or better the accuracy of optical heart rate monitors on watches. The sensors only work when wearing both earbuds, which compare the data between your ears before sending out a reading via Bluetooth to a connected phone or device every five seconds.In testing they were similar in accuracy to aGarmin Fenix 8smartwatch and stayed in place, but an appropriate app is needed on Android or iPhone to connect to the earbuds. Neither Beats nor Apple make a workout app for them and only a small number of apps work out of the gate on an iPhone, including the popular Runna, Peloton and Nike Run Club apps, the latter of which worked seamlessly.On Android, any app that works with heart rate devices such as Bluetooth chest straps should work with the earbuds, including Strava when tested.Heart rate data is stored in the Health app on an iPhone or in the connected workout app for Android users.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe case for the Powerbeats Pro 2 is smooth and solid, charging via USB-C and Qi, but is quite large and not water resistant.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries, but they should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of their original capacity.The earbuds contain recycled plastic in some internal components. They are not repairable but Apple will offer individual replacements for lost or damaged parts. It does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.PriceThe Powerbeats Pro 2 cost£249.99(€299.95/$249.99/A$399.95).For comparison, theBeats Fit Procost£219.99, theBeats Studio Buds +cost£179.99, theBeats Solo Budscost£79.99,Apple’s AirPods Pro 2cost£229and the Sennheiser Momentum Sport cost£199.VerdictThe Powerbeats Pro 2 are an upgrade to just about every aspect of the originals, making them some of the very best premium workout earbuds available.The fit is super-secure but surprisingly light, holding themselves in place for vigorous workouts without the pinching force many similar alternatives with ear hooks require. They sound great for powering through workouts but have enough nuance to be daily earbuds for all sorts of music genres too. The effective noise cancelling helps with commutes or quietening busy roads. The very good transparency mode is miles better than most competitors, but still diminishes your awareness compared with open-ear headphones so best saved for workouts in safer spaces.Built-in heart rate monitoring in earbuds is still a novelty. The sensors worked well in my ears, but they rely on third-party apps to work, which are in short supply with an iPhone. That’s not a problem for Android users who can use Strava and most heart-rate compatible apps from the off.At £250, Beats is certainly asking a lot for a set of workout buds. But unlike many fitness rivals the Powerbeats Pro 2 are good enough to be the only earbuds you might need, particularly if you’re an iPhone user who get on with the fit of Apple’s AirPods – these are not going to fall out.The biggest disappointment is that the battery is still not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable andlosing a star.Pros:great sound, very good noise cancelling and transparency modes, very long battery life, secure and comfortable fit, excellent controls, spatial audio, great call quality, cross-platform compatibility with enhanced features for iPhone and Android.Cons:expensive, case still not very pocketable, not many compatible apps for the heart rate feature on an iPhone, no multipoint connectivity, battery can’t be replaced making them disposable.View image in fullscreenThe sensors on the underside of the earbud pause the music when you take off the Powerbeats Pro 2.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsAppleHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a daunting choice. Although you wouldn’t know it from sapiens’ utterly spine-sided culture, invertebrates are charismatic, ingenious and occupy all kinds of surprising niches and habitats on land and sea.Will you choose one of themyxozoans, the smallest animals ever known to have lived, at 10 micrometres in size (a fifth of the diameter of a human hair) or the 14-metre long, half-tonnecolossal squid?Will you choose a bizarre creature that is a world away from our own way of life, simply because it deserves to flourish as much as we do? Or will you nominate one of the creatures without which we would be stuffed?As the US biologist EO Wilson warned in 1987: “The truth is that we need invertebrates but they don’t need us.”Last year, readers overwhelmingly chose one of those vital invertebrates, the common earthworm, the graceful soil-maker, whichwon a landslide 38% of the popular vote.Bringing up the rear with 0.8% of the vote in the UK contest last year was the invasive Asian or yellow-legged hornet,despite being championed by Chris Packham.Will a similarly controversial choice triumph in this ominous year of the disrupter?You decide.

But to the surprise of some supporters, it took half an hour for anyone in the environment-rooted party to mention the climate.Germany’s Greens are fighting to hold on to power after four years in a coalition government where they have been pilloried by other parties, and during which their core issue of climate action has slipped down the political agenda. Though the party is still far from being considered aVolkspartei– a main party whose voters span demographic groups and issues – the Greens have sought to boost their mainstream appeal with talk of beefing up security and bringing down rents and bills.View image in fullscreenA destroyed Green party election campaign poster in Seppenrade, western Germany, on 7 February.Photograph: Ina Fassbender/AFP/Getty“Electricity has become green,” an animated Habeck told the crowd, pointing to a boom in wind and solar that raised the share of renewables to 60% last year. “Now we’re making it cheap.”The odds of a Green surge when Germans head to the polls next Sunday are by some measures slim. Governing parties of all stripes have had a disastrous year at the ballot box, losing votes in almost every democracy that held elections, and the Green parties that made it into coalition governments in Ireland, Austria and Belgium all shed seats. Heavy losses in Germany and France drove a continent-wide setback at the European parliamentary elections in June.German election 2025 poll tracker: which party is leading and who could be chancellor?Read moreBut in Germany, the sixth-biggest historical polluter of planet-heating gas, the Greens have also shouldered the blame for the country’s economic woes – and become a target of ridicule for other politicians. Their market-liberal former coalition partners, the centre-right opposition and an emboldened far-right have held them responsible for Germany’s “deindustrialisation”. A clean-heating law, introduced by Habeck in 2023, proved particularly unpopular with the public.“What’s happened in the last years is that the far-right has identified the climate as a target – partly, honestly, because climate politics was quite successful,” said Luisa Neubauer, Germany’s best-known activist from the Fridays for Future school strike movement. “There wasn’t a climate revolution in Germany, but things got going, and that turned it into a threat for basically any party other than the Greens.”The far-right Alternative für Deutschland, which is polling at about 20% before the election, has led the charge that Germany has fallen under the moralistic grip of an “eco-dictatorship”, where the long arm of the state dictates how people heat their homes, power their cars and feed their families. Though it has targeted its attacks at the Greens, it has accused other parties of succumbing to their ideology.Neubauer said the Greens’ election campaign seemed to be playing by rules set by others. “Climate discourse has turned into something of a witch-hunt – where the far-right is screaming anxiously about windmills and many others are running after them.”View image in fullscreenElection campaign posters for the Greens in Wulfen, western Germany, on 7 February.Photograph: Ina Fassbender/AFP/GettyThe Greens’ strategic shift is visible on the campaign trail and online. Climate and energy were mentioned in just a quarter of the 20 election posts that the party spent the most money promoting on social media, according to a Guardian analysis of political adverts on Meta platforms such as Facebook and Instagram since the start of the year. At the Berlin rally on Sunday, the first question put to Habeck from the audience lamented how little climate protection had featured in the election campaigns of any party.“Climate protection has long ceased to be a consensus issue in this society – and also no longer in the political arena in which we operate,” said Habeck. He contrasted it with the debate around reaching climate neutrality at the last election, which “was just about the implementation steps and the speed. All of that can no longer be taken for granted.”Observers suggest the Greens can rely on climate-concerned voters turning out for them whether they prioritise it as an issue or not. And in spite of bad press, the party is polling at 14% – only slightly below its vote share in the last election four years ago. It also recorded a record-breaking wave of new applications at the end of January, with 5,000 people joining in five days, after the conservative frontrunner Friedrich Merzbroke a longstanding taboo in German politicsby relying on far-right votes.The development, which triggered mass protests, has helped the Greens position themselves as defenders of democracy – and worked to the favour of the party’s oddly mysterious campaign motto, “one person, one word”. Habeck described the slogan, which is a gender-inclusive play on a German phrase that implies honesty and reliability, as being inspired by the quiet kitchen-table conversations that allow for dialogue.“It’s a bit of a shame that it’s so hard to understand, but he explained it well,” said Eva Kohler, a retired Green voter attending the rally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Between the European elections in 2019 and 2024, the share of the youngest voters fell by two-thirds for the Greens, and tripled for the social media-savvy AfD.“While the Greens lost overall, their losses were particularly pronounced among young voters,” said Cornelius Erfort, a political scientist at Witten/Herdecke University – with the Green vote share among first-time voters in Germany falling from one-third in 2019 to one-eighth in 2024. “As for what parties may do with this? The Greens might focus on winning back young voters or accept that their base is now older.”By courting the far right, the man tipped to be Germany’s next chancellor may have sealed his own downfall | Florian RanftRead moreIn September, the entire board of the Greens’ youth organisation resigned, citing the party’s willingness in a coalition government to support stricter asylum and austerity rules, and increase military spending. It has also come under fire for its support of Israel. The party’s rally in Berlin on Saturday was interrupted twice – once by right-leaning hecklers and once by pro-Palestinian protesters.“The difference to the other centrist parties is shrinking more and more,” the former Green Youth board members wrote in a letter announcing their departure. “The Greens are becoming a party like any other. But what difference does it make?”Neubauer said the Greens had grown more vocal about the climate crisis over the last few weeks of the election campaign, suggesting they were adapting their strategy again.“The far-right wants us to play by their rules,” she said. “Even though we know it’s only them who know the rules well enough to win.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyGreen partyClimate crisisThe far rightAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)EuropeRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But she cracked the door open for me to start seeing the world differentlyGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailWed 12 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 14.11 ESTShareIspent most of my adult life as an evangelical Christian, learning to accept a whole-body compliance to a regimented way of living and submission to the Bible as God-breathed and infallible. For me, this became a rigid and tortured way to live, the opposite to the freedom it initially promised.I followed in the footsteps of my big sister, the trailblazing poet Dorothy Porter, and attended a church camp when I was 10. But unlike Dorothy (or Dod as I called her), who fell in love with a sequence of beautiful and beatific female Christian leaders at the camp, I charted my own path and invited Jesus into my life and was born again. Dod was horrified, but I think quietly set about trying to deconvert me from that time. It took 35 years.‘Pioneering’, ‘engrossing’, ‘a hymn to connection’: the best Australian books out in FebruaryRead moreWhile Dod, in her bohemian life as a poet of rabble-rousing, sexually charged verse novels, ran towards delicious worldliness, I took the other fork in the road, towards asceticism and self-sacrifice. I believed I knew all the answers, so chose a different type of zealous life to my dazzling sister – and clung to it with equal tenacity.She died in 2008 aged 54, living passionately to the end.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningDespite our radically different life choices, we both felt like outsiders in the family: me because of my intense religiosity and sense of invisibility, and she because she lived the closeted life of a gay woman until her early 30s. We became confidantes for each other, sharing our recent dramas with our father, the prominent Sydney barrister Chester Porter, reassuring each other of complete discretion. She became my reliable drinking companion in the Chester Porter Survival Club, as we navigated our father’s volatile temper and terrifying rages.View image in fullscreenThe Porter sisters. From left, Dorothy, Mary and Josie in 1985.Dod then wrote books that challenged my entire worldview, startling me out of my stupor and dogged adherence to what had been fed to me as the “Only Truth”. Her verse novel Akhenaten tells the tale of the monotheistic pharaoh and his desperate attempt to secure a male heir through his daughters, while he also has a passionate love affair with his brother. My exterior evangelical self was shocked, but always lurking beneath the surface was my other buried self, who delighted in Dod’s rule-breaking, her subversiveness and her galloping fame. My transgressive big sister cracked the door open for me to start seeing the world differently, beyond the narrow ideological compliance I felt subjected to. Her work gave me a place to hide, to know and feel the world as wild and varied, while on the outside I appeared as a respectable church handmaiden and matron.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was stuck in an evangelical church where women were permanently subordinated to men, but Dod celebrated women’s power with explosive poems of bold Minoan femaleness. “In what other time / has the breast been mightier / than the sword?” she wrote in The Power and the Glory. But it was her sublime verse novel Wild Surmise that sealed the deal for me. There would be no more conventionality and misogyny for me, as I immersed myself in her words and found courage: “You’re standing on a raft / of thick alien ice / but you’re moving – / floating like a berg / on the deepest ocean / in the unknown world / A new world / where you might learn / colder lessons / than nothing” (Europa).View image in fullscreenDod had an unerring belief in her creative voice, the power of a poem to blow a room or someone’s life apart. While she may have felt fear and anxiety in her private life (as I have, a legacy of some of the worst times with our father), she never felt it in her work, nor did it deter her from speaking out on things that matter: Indigenous massacres, nationalistic jingoism, the incarceration of refugees, homophobia. She showed me how to find my voice in the fog of cognitive dissonance and internal fury that characterised my former Christian life.It took me many years to apologise to her for my preachy Pharisaic self-righteousness, particularly of her sexuality. I never managed to tell her, except at her funeral, that she had become the impetus and example for me to be brave and speak the truth, to be subversive and challenge orthodoxy in its many guises, and to always be suspicious of fakes. I was never going to be silent again, and maybe I too could be dangerous and transgressive by unmasking the hidden networks of power within churches and help other people with the trauma they experience. I am now a psychotherapist and advocate for those who have been harmed by high demand religious communities. As I found my voice, I try to help others find theirs.My bold and lionhearted big sister showed me how.“I stand my ground / in the undaunted spray / and company / of my own words” (The Ninth Hour from The Bee Hut).Gutsy Girls by Josie McSkimmingis out now (A$34.99, UQP)Explore more on these topicsAustralian booksPoetryChristianityReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

The 63-year-old had been forced to leave her home and, with no fixed address, she placed nearly everything she owned in a storage shed in Melbourne’s north.She was left heartbroken – and out of pocket – when her unit was one of more than 10 at the StoreLocal in Campbellfield that police allege were broken into and robbed in June last year.The disability pensioner lost household goods and items that would have been almost worthless to others but were priceless to Kruger, such as her grandmother’s jewellery and her dogs’ ashes.AP excoriates White House barring of reporters as ‘alarming precedent’Read more“It was an absolute mess – my whole unit was just trashed,” she says. “I was crying. I was sobbing.“There were things in there that I can never be compensated for.”Kruger is only one of many who have suffered losses from several Melbourne storage facilities over the past 12 months.Victoria police say two men, aged 35 and 46, face multiple charges over the alleged Campbellfield break-in.Three other storage facilities in Melbourne’s south-east were allegedly burgled between January and June last year. Two men face multiple charges over the three alleged break-ins.Police also allege three offenders broke into between 70 and 80 storage units at National Storage in Mordialloc between 30 April and 7 May last year.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailLegal experts say Kruger’s case raises questions about the liability of the facilities in such cases.Kruger had signed a five-page contract, seen by Guardian Australia, which states goods are stored at the “sole risk and responsibility” of the customer “except to the extent of any negligence” by the facility owner.It further states that if the facility owner is “liable to the storer in any way” then compensation is limited to the total fees paid. It asks the customer to acknowledge the “limitations” as “reasonable”.Kruger wrote to StoreLocal Campbellfield asking for compensation for the stolen goods, but it declined. The facility ultimately told her it would refund her storage fees totalling $5,430.86, after she says she left it a one-star Google review.View image in fullscreenTracey Kruger says the Melbourne storage unit where she stored her possessions was robbed and trashed.Photograph: Simon Dallinger/Guardian AustraliaKruger wrote again, in a letter seen by Guardian Australia, arguing the storage facility should be liable, alleging it “did not install sufficient cameras, nor did it employ security guards at the site”.“It also failed to ensure that other storers were removed from the facility outside of the permitted access hours [6am-9pm],” she alleged.She received no reply to that letter.StoreLocal’s website advises people who rent storage space to insure their goods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNufar Gofman of the Consumer Action Law Centre, which is assisting Kruger, says Kruger told her she had not been able to find an insurance company that would insure her storage unit before she rented it in May 2023.The centre argues storers should be able to rely on broader Australian consumer law in such cases, even if storage companies have a clause in their contracts excluding them from liability.They argue the contract terms should be considered “unfair” because consumer law requires any service to be “fit for purpose” and “provided with due care and skill”.Gofman says: “Australian consumer law entitles the consumer to damages if there’s been a breach of the consumer guarantees, which we allege there has been. This is something that we see with a lot of storage contracts, is that they try to limit their liability.”But Mark Giancaspro, a senior law lecturer at the University of Adelaide and an expert in contract law, says he would expect storage companies to have “fairly sweeping exclusion clauses” in their contracts.Tracey lost ‘priceless’ goods in a Melbourne storage unit break-in. Then the legal battle beganRead moreGiancaspro says Kruger’s lawyers could potentially argue that the storage services were not provided in line with the guarantees enshrined in consumer law because the alleged break-in raised questions about the effectiveness of their security protocols.However, Giancaspro says, there probably “isn’t anything wrong” with the contracts themselves.“The problem is, I dare say, most of the tenants who are renting units in that facility wouldn’t have read those terms,” he says. “Unfortunately, you are bound to them, even if you haven’t read them.”Prof Jeannie Paterson, from the University of Melbourne’s law school, takes a different view.Paterson, speaking generally, says companies can’t “contract out” of the protections provided by the Australian consumer law.“If you’re a consumer storing goods, the contract can’t exclude the liability of the facility to you,” she says. “Now that means that the person who stored their goods is entitled to damages for consequential loss to the extent that there’s a breach, which would mean getting much larger damages than just the refunding of the [storage] fees.”StoreLocal did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsPersonal financeVictoriaLaw (Australia)featuresShareReuse this content"

Asked about the timing, Zhu said “it had nothing to do with what is happening today, and I do NOT have the magic to predict or anticipate”, he posted,adding two laughing emojis.“The ambassador’s posts that day are an example of how nimble, reactive and quick the Chinese might be thinking in this era of rapid changes in US foreign policy,” said Ryan C Berg, director of theAmericasProgram at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).Trump’s aid freeze will drive migration from Latin America, experts warnRead moreBerg and other analysts argue that Trump’s protectionist measures –and the suspension of almost all US foreign aid– could push South American countries even closer to China, which has already overtaken the US as the region’s leading trading partner.“The US is going after its own allies,” said Carol Wise, professor of International Relations at the University of Southern California (USC), pointing toadditional tariffs Trump has threatened for Mexico and Canada. “So really, do the math: if you’re going after your friends, your friends will merge with your so-called enemies, right?” she said.On Monday, the US president announced a new round of25% tariffs on all foreign steel and aluminum. Brazil is the second-largest steel supplier to the US, behind only Canada.In 2023, South American countriesexported$91.2bn (£73.7bn) to the US, and double that amount to China, $181bn (£146.2bn). The US is still the largest trading partner for countries like Colombia and Ecuador, but 20 years ago, it was for all of them except Paraguay.“The US has not had a policy for South America for several administrations, since Barack Obama took office [in 2009],” said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “It was a very long period during which the US completely withdrew from the region, except for issues related to migration, Venezuela and drug trafficking … A vacuum was left that China has filled,” she said.For many analysts, the most significant symbol of China’s current and future strategy for South America is the Chancay“megaport” in Peru, a $3.5bn project inaugurated by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, himself last November.Last week, the Colombian government announced anew shipping route that will pass through Chancay. The Brazilian government has also reportedly admitted that, due to Trump’s protectionist measures, it isfast-tracking the launch of its operationsat the port – which would cut shipping times by 10 days compared with Atlantic routes.The most significant immediate potential beneficiary, of course, will be the host country itself. “It putsPeruin a position that was unthinkable 10 years ago,” said Wise.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US president’s special envoy to Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone, has already argued that any South American nation using Chancayshould face additional tariffs of 60%.“The US is demanding a level of loyalty, allegiance and respect that it squandered decades ago,” said Wise. “I hope that, in time, these Latin American countries will be able to just say: ‘Sorry, too bad, you know, a tariff is fine,’ because they’re selling so much to China.”US-Panama relationship was ‘very strong’. Then Trump upended the diplomatic playing boardRead moreThe port of Chancay is also an example of how the terms of the deal with China could change over time, Berg said. “Peru thought it was getting a Chinese-built port. Now it’s ended up with a Chinese-owned and operated port [by the state-owned Cosco Shipping],” he said.Antonio José Pagán, a researcher at the Center for China and Asia-Pacific Studies at the Universidad del Pacífico in Lima, said the increasing rapprochement between China and the region also raises the risk of growing dependent on Beijing.“But we must also not forget the agency of these countries,” he said. “As they want to improve economically, what matters to them is being able to cooperate with both sides and not be forced to choose between one or the other.“But this may be impossible if the rivalry between the United States and China continues to worsen.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsChinaPeruColombiaAmericasDonald TrumpXi JinpinganalysisShareReuse this content"

But the latest fighting has shocked the rights activist. “Before, being a woman offered you some protection. You had to do something serious to get killed,” she says.García fled the countryside when armed young men started going from house to house last month searching for civilians deemed sympathetic to rival groups. “Now, the slightest accusation or tiniest thing is enough for you to end up dead,” she says. “These guys really do not care about the pain of the people.”It seemed peaceful for a while but everyone knew it was the chronicle of a death foretoldCommunity leaderGarcía has been displaced more than 10 times from Catatumbo, a cocaine-production and trafficking region straddling Colombia andVenezuelaand coveted by warring groups.Last month’s violence in Catatumbo was the worst Colombia has experienced for years.At least 80 people were killed, 50,000 displaced and dozens of civilians kidnapped as the National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia’s largest active guerrilla insurgent group, sought to purge the region of rivals.About46,000 children are still out of education, after violence forced the government to close schools in 10 districts,according to Save the Children.View image in fullscreenPeople displaced by violence in Catatumbo last month shelter in a stadium in Cúcuta.Photograph: Mario Caicedo/EPAIn response to the violence, Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, hasbroken off peace talkswith the ELN.Andrés Preciado, director of theIdeas for Peace Foundation(FIP), in Bogotá, says: “There is no way back for peace negotiations with the ELN now, but I also think this is the end of the road for Petro’s‘total peace’ plan[Paz Total].”Six decades of war in Colombia have killed450,000 people and displaced eight million. A series of the country’s presidents have tried to negotiate a way out of the conflict, and in 2016, Juan Manuel Santossigned a peace dealwith the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). But as quickly as 7,000 combatants laid down their guns, smaller armed groups filled the power vacuum.View image in fullscreenPresident Gustavo Petro marking eight years since the peace deal with the Farc in Bogotá last November.Photograph: Andrea Ariza/AFP/GettyPetro, Colombia’sfirst leftist president, was seen as the man to get the country back on track. In 2022, he told excited crowds at his inauguration: “I will work to achieve true and definitive peace, like no one else, like never before.”A former guerrilla himself, the 64-year-old appeared to be just the person to persuade the rebels to disarm. Instead of sending more soldiers to remote corners of the country, Petro pledged to send negotiators to meet anyone willing to talk.“It seemed peaceful for a while but everyone knew it was the chronicle of a death foretold,” says a community leader in Catatumbo, who asked for anonymity for fear of being targeted by armed groups. “Now, all hell has broken loose.”Petro’s government is in talks with nine different armed groups and has one active ceasefire with a group known as “General Staff of the Blocs” (EMB) – a small faction ofFarcdissidents who broke away from a larger splinter group, Central General Staff (EMC), who refused to disarm in 2016.The biggest thorn in Petro’s side has been the ELN. Negotiations with the 3,000-strong rebel group have been repeatedly halted, including in October after thekidnapping of the father of the Liverpool footballerLuis Díaz.You cannot expect these groups to talk in good faith if they are not experiencing some sort of military pressureElizabeth DickinsonThe incident exposed a key flaw in Petro’s strategy: while the military halted its offensive during the ceasefire, armed groups showed little interest in stopping their criminal activities.Thenumber of kidnappings have risen 79% under Petro and extortion cases have increased 96%, according to data analysis by the Bogotá-based Conflict Analysis Resource Centre (Cerac). The number of homicides has dropped 4%, though killings in military and police operations and in robberies were excluded from the national police figures from 2022, obscuring the trend.“We actually believe the homicide rate has increased. That would be huge as Colombia has not seen a growth in the homicide rate since 2002,” says Jorge Restrepo, director of Cerac. “I’ve been searching for a positive but all I can find is a drop in deaths from landmines.”View image in fullscreenColombian soldiers stand guard as a humanitarian delegation meets residents in El Tarra, Catatumbo, as part of ceasefire efforts this month.Photograph: Carlos Eduardo Ramirez/ReutersWhile the Colombian military withdraws, militias have taken advantage of the respite to seize new territory and swell their ranks with children.The ombudsman’s office, which monitors human rights violations, says the ELN is now active in 232 of Colombia’s 1,100 municipalities, up from 189 in 2022. The Gulf Clan, a paramilitary drug-trafficking outfit, has grown even more quickly and is operating in 392 municipalities – up 54% from 255 two years ago.Elizabeth Dickinson, an analyst at the International Crisis Group thinktank, says it was naive to think the world’s biggest drug cartels would willingly give up billion-dollar cocaine and illegal mining rackets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Family members could not bury their loved ones and bodies were left on roadsides inJanuary as armed groups enforced a lockdown.Unlike the Farc, which was born out of a Marxist-Leninist insurgency, today’s splinter groups have no ideology, say experts, with their only interests being illegal mining, extortion and drugs.García says: “No ‘total peace’ has arrived here. All that has arrived is war and death. It is actually more painful because before, people from different territories were fighting each other. Now it is our own children from the very same town who are killing each other in these smaller groups.”Petro admits that the events in Catatumbo are a“national failure”and that “the situation in Catatumbo is a sign of how things are going”.View image in fullscreenA banner calls for peace in Teorama municipality, Catatumbo, last month, after a series of militant attacks left at least 80 people dead.Photograph: Raúl Arboleda/AFP/GettyColombia’s justice minister, Ángela María Buitrago, said earlier this month that “the population today feels it is in apermanent state of insecurity”, as she pleaded with Petro to rethink his strategy.Iván Cepeda, a senator from the coalition government who has been negotiating with the ELN during the on-off talks, acknowledges that the government has made mistakes but remains committed to its dovish approach. “We do not accept that ‘total peace’ has failed,” he says.We do not accept that ‘total peace’ has failed … [talks with the ELN] are suspended, not finishedSenator Iván CepedaCepeda admits that coordinating talks with so many armed groups simultaneously is challenging but says critics are overreacting to the violence in Catatumbo. Talks with the ELN are “suspended, not finished”, he insists.The senator points out that when M19 guerrillas, of which Petro was then a member, stormed Colombia’s Palace of Justice, seat of the supreme court, in 1985 (in whichnearly 100 people were killedand 12 people were abducted by the army), people reacted the same way. “They said, ‘there is no way negotiations can continue,’” says Cepeda, adding: “The peace process with the M19 is, in fact, one of the most successful ever seen.”Though the fighting in Catatumbo in recent weeks has quietened, experts expect violence to flare up in other regions as rival groups seek revenge or to exploit weakened forces. At least20 people were killed in the Colombian Amazonin late January as rival Farc splinter groups fought for control of the drug trade.View image in fullscreenPeople from Catatumbo camp in Bogotá’s Bolívar Square last month to seek a meeting with Petro about violence in the north.Photograph: Fernando Vergara/APThe timing of this renewed violence is inauspicious. Petro’s total peace plan is unravelling just as Trump hasfrozen $380m (£300m) in aidthat Colombian peacebuilding organisations rely on for emergency relief to families fleeing violence and encouraging farmers to swap coca for legal alternatives. At the same time, Petro is caught in a growing political crisis, with his defence minister, Ivan Velasquez, the latest in a string of cabinet ministers to resign.Meanwhile, Colombia’s relations with Venezuela, a key mediator in the ELN talks, have become strained afteran intelligence report revealed that armed rebels had moved through the neighbouring country before launching their deadly offensivein Catatumbo.For those like García who are caught in the violence, there seems little cause for hope. “Why do you think 50,000 people have left with nothing but what they could grab and stuff in a rucksack?” she says. “The ELN started the attacks, but we know other groups will want revenge.”*Name has been changed to protect her identityExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentConflict and armsColombiaFarcAmericasPeace and reconciliationDrugs tradefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I have been following Donald Trump’s suspension of the US Agency for International Development. USAid is the world’s single biggest aid donor, and the decision to halt its work has sent shockwaves around the world. This week, I trace the effects of its potential demise on the Black diaspora. But first, the weekly roundup.Weekly roundupView image in fullscreenThe rainbow-hued homes of Bo-Kaap have become a must-have image for Instagram feeds.Photograph: RM Nunes/Getty ImagesFresh calls for DRC ceasefire |A summit of leaders from across Africa, including Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has called for animmediate and unconditional ceasefire in DRC.

The freezing of USAid’s work has severely compromised these life-saving efforts, as well as that ofUS-funded facilities caring for malnourished babies. In the capital, Khartoum,two-thirds of Sudan’s soup kitchens closedin the first week after the aid suspension.On Donald Trump’s first day in office, he announced a 90-day pause in the organisation’s operations because they were part of a “foreign aid industry and bureaucracy… not aligned with American interests”. USAid wasestablished by John F Kennedy in 1961as an independent agency of the US government. It grew to have a large remit, providing everything from humanitarian assistance to disaster relief. But it also plays a role in education, promoting democratic participation and governance, and supporting the health ministries of the countries it operates in. The range of its programmes and the number of locations in which it is active is staggering.The USAid budget was more than $40bn in the 2023 fiscal year.The suspension, which looks like a permanent dismantling, is embroiled in legal disputes. A federal judge hasblocked the decisionto put thousands of USAid workers on administrative leave, on the grounds that the Trump administration does not have the authority to abolish an agency established by congressional legislation. As the process unfolds, the work of the agency has been halted overnight, with severe repercussions.Sub-Saharan AfricaView image in fullscreenA worker distributes yellow lentils to people in Geha at a programme co-run by USAid in Mekelle, Ethiopia.Photograph: Jemal Countess/Getty ImagesCountries in sub-Saharan Africa account for more than a third of US foreign assistance spending.In addition to famine relief and medical and humanitarian support in conflict areas such as Sudan, USAid assists health ministries and, most urgently, a large sexual health and HIV prevention programme.Approximately 40,000 healthcare workers in Kenyapartly financed by USAid are likely to lose their jobs. The impacts on treatment available to patients, pregnant women and disease treatment are almost too vast to estimate.What is unfolding in South Africa – where patients have showed up for treatment and medicationto find that clinics were closed– offers a small insight into what could happen next to people at the sharpest end of medical emergencies. The country is in the grip of one of the world’s largest HIV/Aids epidemics, constituting a quarter of cases worldwide.Latin AmericaView image in fullscreenIrma Cal Pop, 26, is reflected in a mirror in her home.

InLatin America, support for those displaced by guerrilla violence, integration of migrants and the prevention of sexual exploitation have relied heavily on US foreign assistance.Almost 8 million Venezuelans have left the country in the past decade, fleeing economic crises and settling in neighbouring countries. About 3 million of them are in Colombia, the largest recipient of US foreign aid in South America. Last year, USAid funded the feeding and nutrition of a large number of refugees in Colombia, partnering with the UN World Food Programme andextending almost $50m in relief. Abandoning such vulnerable populations not only deprives them of food, but leaves them prone to exploitation and abuse by the sort ofcriminal gangs that prey on the displaced and hungry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Brazil, USAid forged the Partnership for the Conservation of Amazon Biodiversity, an agreement that supports Indigenous people and rural communities, and in doing so protects the Amazon and helps combat the climate emergency. The loss of that support affects not just these communities and those employed by such foreign assistance programmes, but the environmental health of the planet.The CaribbeanView image in fullscreenOfficers from the Royal Bahamas Defence Force load relief supplies to be delivered to residents after a hurricane in Nassau.Photograph: Tim Aylen/APIn the Caribbean, USAid projects are diverse and embedded in civil society, environmental protection and future proofing younger generations. In Jamaica, among the programmes that have halted is theYouth Empower Activity, which is targeted at the most at-risk people. It helps them access education, professional training and improve job prospects, with a view to increasing household income and promoting national development.Thousands of Jamaicansare enrolled in the scheme – but now a total of$54m of US fundingis under threat in the country, according to government estimates.The suspension could also interrupt a USAid-funded,Caribbean-wide project to bolster food securityby increasing fruit and vegetable farming, scholarships for degrees in agriculture and support for small farmers. The shutdown camedays after the launch of a programmeto reduce the risks to marine and coastal biodiversity – an attempt to ameliorate anenvironmental crisis affecting the region’s coral reefs and biodiversity. Beyond the impact on individuals, small business owners, and the environment, there is, as with all such stoppages, the loss of livelihoods of people employed by these schemes.Soft power lostView image in fullscreenA boy peers through a hole in a sheet at a camp for displaced people in Bulengo near Goma, in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.Photograph: Karel Prinsloo/APDespite the large sums deployed,USAid, and US foreign assistance in general, is perceived to also benefit the United States. Although it cannot be quantified in exact numbers, supporters say such assistance contributes to the US’s soft power abroad. That soft power is twofold: the first is in a sort of preventive measure, whereby aid helps to stabilise poorer countries and pre-empt deepening crises that could compromise the US’s global security agenda. The second is that aid is seen as a bulwark to the influence of countries such as Russia and China, both of which are particularly active in Africa, for example. In maintaining a presence on the ground across the world, and strong alliances with governments and civil society organisations, the US promotes a foreign policy that aims to curtail the ability of its adversaries to create their own alliances and political footholds.Aid model under scrutinyView image in fullscreenAn effigy of Trump is held aloft during a rally supporting USAid workers, near the US Capitol, Washington.Photograph: Will Oliver/EPAThe speed of the suspension, and how it has plunged so many around the world into hunger and uncertainty, raises questions about the wisdom of depending so profoundly on a country that has proven to be so unreliable. Ken Opalo, a specialist in development and the author ofAn Africanist Perspectiveon Substack, wrote: “The cuts are a painful reminder that aid dependence isn’t a viable development strategy.” If the USAid suspension remains, that viable development strategy, or the stepping in of alternative funders, will not materialise overnight. In the meantime, millions of people wait to learn if their sudden change in circumstances will become permanent, subject to a huge constitutional battle thousands of miles away.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsUSAidThe Long WaveRaceBlack British cultureAfricaCaribbeanHumanitarian responseAidnewslettersShareReuse this content"

It’s like the wild west, they’re free to do what they like, how they like. People losing their life savings – that is the norm. People have no money left, they can’t believe they’ve lost everything. People that have worked hard all their lives and thought this was going to be a retirement thing for them to just sit and relax, and it’s not, it’s just a relentless financial strain.”Their group legal action, which is expected to be heard later this year, involves two legal claims – one against “unfair and legally unenforceable” pitch fees, which they claim holiday parks increase at extortionate rates and without proper communication.The second claim is in relation to buyers who say they bought at a price that far exceeded their caravan’s real value and were not told its value could drop substantially, even in a few years.Newer caravans, like cars, depreciate more quickly than older models, owing to general wear and tear and the fact design and fittings quickly become outdated. Some sites also have rules that mean caravans have to be removed when they reach a certain age, making them less desirable for new buyers as time goes on.Many buyers report being forced to sell their unit back to the site owners for a fraction of the price they bought for.Holiday park lodges and caravans differ from residential park homes in that they cannot legally be lived in year-round, and are designed for short-term, seasonal use.“It’s like a financial trap; you’re not given all the information on the onset to make an informed decision,” said Keeble.Sally Nicholls, 70, lost her pension savings and had to sell her home after losing more than £50,000 on a caravan lodge she bought on Tattershall Lakes Country Park, run by Away Resorts, in Lincolnshire in 2020.She planned to rent it out to holidaymakers, hoping it would generate a small income and help her to partly retire. She used a private loan and her pension pot to buy the lodge, complete with decking and hot tub, for £69,000, and said she got an accountant to check the figures.Within months, the caravan park started pushing up the price of pitch fees, as well as the cost of the passes guests needed to use on-site facilities, making the venture unfeasible.Away Resorts said the holiday park industry, like many others, had faced economic challenges, which had led to increased operational costs and the need to increase pitch fees. “We take great pride in our professional approach to holiday home ownership,” they said.Nicholls said a park pass, which was £80 when she bought her lodge, went up to £200, while pitch fees increased from £4,800 in 2020 to just under £7,000 in 2023, when she decided to sell up.“It made it tough for me, and the writing was on the wall. Then it hit home that the unit was never worth £69,000 in the beginning – I managed to sell it for £15,000. I had factored in depreciation, I knew it would go down in value, but not that much. I was gobsmacked, absolutely distraught,” she said.“The salesman said: ‘Why on earth did you think it was worth anything more than that?’”Nicholls claims she was given misleading information when she bought the lodge, but this was always verbal, not in writing, and the salesperson has moved on to another park.“It has affected me hugely, mentally and physically,” she said. “I lost everything. What was I going to do to live? I’d got no pension pot, so the only thing I could do was sell my home. I had to move 10 miles away from the village I’d lived in since 1975. It really took its toll.”Hugh Preston KC, who is representing the group, said that although residential mobile homes were regulated, holiday parks were not.“There’s no set of regulations prescribing what should and shouldn’t happen,” he said. “The issue is if you bought a caravan for £100,000, and after two years you find that you can’t afford pitch fees, then what’s your option? You have to terminate the agreement and sell. But if you’re being offered £20,000 for a caravan you paid £100,000, in reality it’s a bit of a Hobson’s choice.”Keeble said many of the people who have lost out are “elderly and vulnerable”, and have bought as a retirement investment. They tend to be cash buyers, which the caravan parks prefer.“No other industry would get away with doing this. People are struggling to keep their heads above water, and an industry this size should not be doing that,” she said.Nicholls said she had accepted she probably had lost most of her money, but was keen to speak out to “make people aware is so it doesn’t happen to anybody else”.“The whole industry needs regulation. It’s like they make their own rules,” she said. “It has affected my confidence as a person. I was in managing in education and training so you had to have your wits about you. But now, I’m a quivering wreck.”A spokesperson for Away Resorts said:“We take great pride in our professional approach to holiday home ownership, ensuring that individuals and families have access to all the necessary information before making a purchase.“Every prospective buyer receives comprehensive details, including clear terms and conditions, allowing them to make an informed decision with full awareness of both the benefits and responsibilities involved.”They added that the “holiday park industry, like many others, has faced economic challenges”, such as the pandemic, rising cost of living and adjusted VAT rates, which have led to increased operational costs and the need to adjust owner pitch fees.“We remain committed to making these increases in accordance with the pitch licence agreement,” they said.Explore more on these topicsTravel & leisureCaravans and campervansOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Then she adds some rotation. Extracting her own teeth required wiggling and twisting, she explains. “It took me a couple of weeks to get each one out, because they just loosened and loosened and loosened. I used a tissue to get a better grip.”We meet in her bungalow near Ottery St Mary in Devon, which she shares with her labrador, Cleo, and her jack russell, Josie. Before our meeting, she told me over the phone that she had kept the yanked teeth. I ask to see them. She disappears and returns with a small box. “They’re a bit grim‑looking now, because they’ve been out for a while.”The three teeth in the box are yellow, certainly, but actually don’t look too bad. They weren’t, she says. “There was nothing wrong with the teeth; it was gum disease.”She points to a front incisor. It was the first to come out. Then a canine and finally a big molar. “It sounds very dramatic, pulling them out. But actually they were already loose,” she says. There was some pain on extraction, but they had been causing her constant pain before that. “It was too painful to eat. They just had to come out.”I find it difficult to listen to Colla’s story. A few days before meeting her, I had an extraction. This was on theNHS, after a wait of six months; another patient cancelled their appointment, so I replaced them and had the extraction done in hospital, under local anaesthetic. I can’t imagine having to do it myself.Colla, who is 75, started having problems with gum disease and her teeth in her 30s. “It was probably too much coffee, too much wine and smoking,” she says. She was living near Nottingham and had an NHS dentist when she started having her teeth replaced by dentures in her late 30s. Over the years, her real teeth were gradually supplanted by false ones, attached to a plate.View image in fullscreen‘It was too painful to eat.’Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianIn 2018, Colla moved to east Devon. She contacted various dental surgeries and was told either that they didn’t take NHS patients or that they didn’t have the capacity to take any more. “One receptionist said they’d love to take more NHS patients, but with the budget given by the government they can only take a certain amount.”She went on a waiting list. “I got an email once – or was it a text? – asking if I still wanted to be on the list. I said yes, but I haven’t heard anything since.” She presumes, seven years on, she is still on that list.To have a tooth removed privately costs at least £150. Colla couldn’t afford that; she used to work as a charity area manager and a dog warden, among other things, and now receives pension credit. When her three remaining real teeth became too painful to live with, about three years ago, she felt she had no choice but to take matters into her own hands.She is by no means the first person to do so. Put NHS dentistry into a chair, get it to say ahh, shine a bright light on it and you will see a picture of neglect and decay.Thirteen million people in England– 28% of the adult population – have an unmet need for dentistry, according to an analysis in July by the British Dental Association (BDA). That includes 5.6 million people who tried and failed to get an appointment in the past two years; 5.4 million who didn’t try because they thought they wouldn’t get one; and 1.25 million who were put off by the cost. The number of people on waiting lists for an NHS dentist is estimated to be about 780,000.For new patients, the service has effectively ceased to exist. In December,ONS datashowed that 94.1% of people in England who didn’t have a dentist and tried to access NHS dental care in the previous 28 days were unsuccessful. There is some regional variation. London is a bit better, at 71.6%; the south-west, where Colla lives, is the second worst, at 96.7%. These are not healthy numbers.Our contract doesn’t allow dentists to deliver care to those who most need itWhat’s more, when the BDA and the Daily Mirror called up 100 practices listed on nhs.uk as “accepting new patients when availability allows”, they found that86 were not accepting new patients. Some practices reported a waiting list of up to 10 years. In March 2023, YouGov found that 10% of Britons had carried outtheir own dental work; 34% of those had pulled out – or tried to pull out – their teeth.Shawn Charlwood, a member of the BDA’s General Dental Practice committee, is well aware of the problem. “This is people in pain, with swelling, not able to sleep, not able to go to work, not able to look after their children, just desperate for dental care, and in the end resorting to filling their own teeth, re-cementing crowns and bridges, pulling their own teeth out.”He attributes it to two decades of underfunding and an NHS contract that is “unfit for purpose”. This contract is an agreement between a dental practice and the NHS that specifies the number of treatments the practice will provide each year. “Successive governments have essentially kicked that can down the road,” says Charlwood. “Of any sector in the NHS, dentistry has seen the greatest real-term reduction in financial support and we’ve got a contract that doesn’t allow dentists to deliver care to those who most need it.”The NHS dental contract is complicated. Practices vary in how much NHS dentistry they provide, depending on the size of the contract they have with their local branch of NHS England. They are paid a fixed sum for a specific amount of dental work; when that money is used up, their only option is to offer private care.Treatment comes in three bands. Band 1 includes examination, advice and scale and polish; band 2 includes fillings, root canals and extractions; and band 3 includes bridges, crowns and dentures. But the practice is paid one fee for treatment within a band. “Whether you need a small number of fillings or a large number of fillings and a lot of treatment, you would still fall into that band, so the dentist would be paid the same,” says Charlwood.Patients with a higher disease burden require more time in the chair, which is incompatible with the rigid system of targets for NHS dentists. Some small changes have been made to the contract recently, “but, in essence, if you haven’t seen a dentist for a long time and need a lot of work, the contract really does not support dentists to deliver that care”, says Charlwood. “That is fundamentally the problem – and many dentists are subsidising NHS activity through their private activity and patients. Clearly, that isn’t what we want; we want NHS dentistry to stand on its own two feet.”Colla is more than happy to have a go at the previous government. “The NHS has beenstarved of funding for years. We’ve had the Tories for the last 14 years and they’ve made an absolute hash of everything. But when you put people like Boris Johnson in charge, what do you expect?”What about the Labour government? Charlwood says it started off making the right noises. The BDA met the health secretary, Wes Streeting, the Monday after Labour won the general election: “He absolutely agreed that NHS dentistry was in crisis.” For the first time in the 76-year history of NHS dentistry, it was a doorstep issue during the election campaign. YouGov polling for the BDA in May showed that access to dentistry wasa bigger concern than education or even crime. The access crisis combined with the cost of living crisis means that millions who can’t afford to go private, such as Colla, have nowhere to go.NHS: how 14 years of Tory rule have changed Britain – in chartsRead moreSeven months after the election, how is the government doing? “To be honest, we’ve not seen a lot of progress,” says Charlwood. “You could argue that, since July, things have objectively become a little bit worse. The budget added new costs for practices. We’re employing receptionists, nurses and other staff and their employer national insurance contributions will have gone up.“I think the profession has been very patient, but goodwill is in short supply and patience is running out. Frankly, ministers need to offer something for the thousands of demoralised NHS colleagues thinking twice about what they’re going to do next. Many practices are finding it hard to deliver the care to patients and balance the books as well; they are having to subsidise NHS activity through their non-NHS activity.”If something isn’t done soon, Charlwood says, the service will continue to decline and it will become ever more difficult to get NHS dentistry – for children as well as adults. NHS data suggests that 45% of childrendid not see an NHS dentistin the year to March 2024, while a significant number haven’t seen a dentist for longer than that. On average,119 extractions of children’s teethare undertaken every working day in England, two-thirds of those because of tooth decay; this decay is the principal reason for hospital admissions for children aged five to nine. Like gum disease, says Charlwood, tooth decay is preventable.The state of children’s teeth and the lack of care for them is what most upsets Colla, now that she has pulled out the last of her teeth. “They have got their whole lives ahead of them and this is the legacy they have got: bad oral health for the rest of their lives. I mean, we’re going back to the 1800s, aren’t we? When I was a kid, you had dentists coming around the schools, checking the teeth.”View image in fullscreenThe three teeth Colla pulled herself.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianCharlwood says England spends a smaller proportion of its health budget on dentistrythan any other European country: “Not just Germany, Holland, France, but every European nation – the whole lot.” He says the state of the country’s teeth is apparent even just on a walk down the high street. “I notice it clearly – it’s what I’m interested in – and I think it’s embarrassing and it’s not necessary. As well as pain, swelling, infection, the ability to work or go to school, there are all the social issues if you’ve got poor dentition – job interviews, interacting with people in face-to-face roles – that all become more difficult.”Colla says: “You do not realise what teeth mean to you until you lose them. Teeth are confidence-builders … When they took out my front teeth, I cried.”After pulling out her last three teeth, Colla was left with visible, confidence-sapping gaps, which the state wouldn’t fill for her. For that, she managed to cobble together the money to go private. “He didn’t charge me for the initial consultation, which was good of him. Then it was nearly £300 to put three on the plate.”She has plans for the ones she pulled out. “When I’ve got the money, I shall cover them in gold and hang them round my neck. Why not? People have done worse than hang teeth around their neck, haven’t they?” she says, laughing. For now though, her teeth go back in the box.Explore more on these topicsDentistsThe waitNHSHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At Heathrow airport, I stood staring in awe at the escalators. I had heard about these “walking machines” from an elderly Somali woman in Addis Ababa who sat on a corner selling sweets, biscuits and cold Fanta in glass bottles. She had painted a picture of London, a city she had never been to, as a place of wonders.“You won’t need to use your legs to walk there – they have machines that move for you,” she said. My eyes bulged with excitement. I had never seen such machines on the streets of Addis Ababa. In my area, Bole Mikael, there were no pavements, just puddles of dirty water.In the mid-1990s, my familywas in this corner of the Ethiopian capital, along with thousands of other, mostly Somali, refugees who were there waiting for their documents, awaiting new lives in Europe or North America.I finally departed forLondonwith my family, on my first ever journey by plane. When I landed at Heathrow a day later, feeling weary and exhausted, I was disheartened to see only a few “walking machines” – perhaps I would have to use my legs occasionally after all.My aunt and uncle, who were already living in London, met us at the airport. On the train to their council flat, my aunt handed me my first taste of Britain: a packet of salt and vinegar crisps. I ate a handful and was quickly overwhelmed by the sharp, sour, tangy flavour, spitting out the half-munched crisps on the floor, much to the horror of my fellow passengers. It took me until my late 20s to try salt and vinegar crisps again, but I did find salvation in the form of custard cream biscuits and yum yum doughnuts. I also discovered salad cream, but not knowing it was meant to be used sparingly, I slathered it over everything, from white bread to goat meat to spaghetti. In Britain, I transformed from a stick-thin, sickly child into a portly, curious one.View image in fullscreenIsmail with his great-grandmother at their bomb-damaged home in Hargeisa, Somalia.Photograph: Courtesy of Ismail EinasheAs I took those first steps on British soil, I came to realise that I would need my legs in more ways than I could have imagined. I used them to explore my hectic new city, venturing into an entirely foreign culture. I could not speak English beyond “hello”, “yes”, and “thank you”, and I realised I was not at all prepared for the life that awaited me.Living in London was different, but not necessarily easier; I had a lot to learn. Everyone always seemed to be in a hurry and people kept to themselves, making the city feel achingly lonely. At the shops or at bus stops, people queued in silence – a marked contrast to the noise of Addis Ababa. My new city was vast and complex, as well as cold and grey. Soon after I arrived, it snowed: I ran out on to the street and felt the sensation of snowflakes on my hands for the first time.I spent weeks living in a rundown Victorian hotel for refugees in Camden, in the north of the capital, looking out from a small attic window to the fast and furious streets below. I was mesmerised. I didn’t start school until later, so I spent my days watching television, often sitting so close to the screen that my nose was touching it. I had never seen a TV like this – the colour, size and clarity was almost magical. In Addis Ababa, TVs were grainy, often black and white, and watched in small communal shacks with lots of people gathered around the set as if it were a campfire. I never got to choose what to watch – it was usually football or action films, and I hated both. In London, I would fight for the remote and on the occasions that I won, I watched pop music videos. One video seemed to play constantly: Stay Another Day by East 17, that year’s Christmas No 1, which planted itself in my heart for ever.The struggle to be British: my life as a second-class citizenRead moreSlowly, I began to explore London and adjust my expectations. I embraced the quieter, more ordered aspects of life here. I learned to be more independent, and to trust in myself to navigate a city that felt overwhelming. Plunged into a new life on a council estate, I had to leave behind childhood naivety. Looking back 30 years later, I realise that my move to the UK was not about finding magical “walking machines” to move me forward in life, but about being able to walk on my own two feet, one step at a time.Look Again: Strangers by Ismail Einashe is published by Tate (£10).

Campaigner Olivier Bancoult outlines why he hopes the deal will go aheadIn October last year, the UK and Mauritian governments reached a historic agreement to transfer the sovereignty of theChagos Islands, a series of atolls in the Indian Ocean that have been described as Britain’s last African colony.It seemed, as political correspondentEleni Coureadescribes, a diplomatic triumph for the new Labour government, ending decades of legal dispute over the ownership of the islands. And more than that, it offered Chagossians, after more than 50 years of exile, the prospect of returning home. In the late 1960s, when Britain granted independence to the rest ofMauritius, not only did it insist on carving out the Chagos Islands to keep for itself, but it forcibly displaced more than 1,000 people who lived there.Many of them, including campaignerOlivier Bancoult, have fought for decades in the years since for the right to return, and seem closer than ever to attaining it.However, asHannah Moorehears, the deal is not yet confirmed, and is on shaky ground. The Mauritian government that agreed it has since been voted out, and its successor is less sure about its merits. What’s more, any deal would be dependent on the approval of the US – which runs the military Diego Garcia base on the islands – and while the Biden administration signed it off in October, Trump’s team have expressed reservations.There have been problems on the domestic front for Labour too, with questions increasingly asked about why Britain is paying an estimated £9bn in the deal to hand over the islands. So will they keep their nerve and push through the deal? And if not, what will it mean for Chagossians, such as Bancoult, longing to go back?Photograph: CPA Media Pte Ltd/PAExplore more on these topicsChagos IslandsToday in FocusKeir StarmerDavid LammyDonald TrumpMauritiusColonialism"

And for anendangered owlbreeding program in Canada, it’s also a dish best served dead.For the price of a coffee, spurned and disgruntled lovers can revel in the satisfaction of having a dead rat named after an ex, before it is fed to a northern spotted owl.The British Columbia-based breeder isrunning its No regRATS campaignahead of Valentine’s Day, promising a photo and video of one’s rat, named after a former lover – or arch-enemy – and the owl it has been fed to in exchange for at least a C$5 donation.Before industrial logging in south-west British Columbia, there were nearly 1,000 spotted owls in the old-growth forests. But they have vanished in recent decades, victims of habitat destruction.Activists have tried in vain to hold the government to account, alleging protected species laws have failed to prevent the extirpation of the owls.In February 2023, the federal environment minister, Steven Guilbeault,saidthe spotted owl was facing “imminent threats to its survival”and told environmental groups he would recommend an emergency order to block further destruction of its habitat in British Columbia.‘All I see are ghosts’: fear and fury as the last spotted owl in Canada fights for survivalRead moreMonths later, however,Canadian cabinet ministers rejectedGuilbeault’s plea tosave the endangered owl.Efforts to revive the population have failed, with a pair of owls released from the breeding program dying within months. The lone female in the wild is also believed to have died.The breeding program, which operates with limited funds, is seen as the last hope of returning the owls to the wild and reviving a population widely seen as a barometer for the health of old-growth ecosystems.Predictably, the campaign has angered rat fans.After teasing the campaign on Instagram, users chimed in that it was unfair to equate “noble” and “clever” animals to a former flame.“How dumb and cruel. What you are feeding is a bad opinion about rats. Completely undeserved. What about ticks or mosquitoes instead?”The breeding program says rodents make up most of the owls’ diet. “They’re going to be eating the rats anyway. We’re just trying to have a little fun and fundraise so we can continue caring for the owls,” it wrote. “Don’t get us wrong, we love rats too.”Others, however, were more than happy to fork over the cash.“The satisfaction of naming a rat after someone who has hurt you and having said rat get eaten!!!!

Trump pulled back from the brink earlier this month following 11th-hour talks with Claudia Sheinbaum ofMexicoand Justin Trudeau of Canada.US officials are in talks with both countries ahead of the new deadline, 4 March, when tariffs are now due to be enforced.More than 40 Democrats in the House of Representatives, led by Jim Costa of California, urged the White House to consider housebuilding industryestimatesthat the proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, paired with duties already charged on Chinese goods, will raise the cost of imported construction materials by up to $4bn.Such increases are often “passed on to consumers, directly contributing to higher home prices and a slowdown in new construction activity, further burdening American families”, they wrote.Why Trump blinked before imposing his ‘beautiful’ tariffs on Canada and MexicoRead more“Immediate action will not only shield American families from escalating housing costs but also demonstrate leadership in steering our nation toward sustainable economic growth,” the representatives wrote to Trump. “We stand ready to work with you and other stakeholders to develop a balanced trade policy that bolsters domestic manufacturing while ensuring that safe, affordable housing remains accessible to all citizens.”The representatives – all Democrats – stressed that they were looking forward to “collaborating” with the White House “on solutions that promote robust economic growth, protect American families, and secure a vibrant housing market for the future”.Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said: “In his first administration, President Trump instituted an America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and an unleashing of American energy that resulted in historic job, wage, and investment growth with no inflation. In his second administration, President Trump will again use tariffs to level the playing field and usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for American industry and workers.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS politicsDonald TrumpDemocratsHousingUS foreign policyCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

Asked about the timing, Zhu said “it had nothing to do with what is happening today, and I do NOT have the magic to predict or anticipate”, he posted,adding two laughing emojis.“The ambassador’s posts that day are an example of how nimble, reactive and quick the Chinese might be thinking in this era of rapid changes in US foreign policy,” said Ryan C Berg, director of theAmericasProgram at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).Trump’s aid freeze will drive migration from Latin America, experts warnRead moreBerg and other analysts argue that Trump’s protectionist measures –and the suspension of almost all US foreign aid– could push South American countries even closer to China, which has already overtaken the US as the region’s leading trading partner.“The US is going after its own allies,” said Carol Wise, professor of International Relations at the University of Southern California (USC), pointing toadditional tariffs Trump has threatened for Mexico and Canada. “So really, do the math: if you’re going after your friends, your friends will merge with your so-called enemies, right?” she said.On Monday, the US president announced a new round of25% tariffs on all foreign steel and aluminum. Brazil is the second-largest steel supplier to the US, behind only Canada.In 2023, South American countriesexported$91.2bn (£73.7bn) to the US, and double that amount to China, $181bn (£146.2bn). The US is still the largest trading partner for countries like Colombia and Ecuador, but 20 years ago, it was for all of them except Paraguay.“The US has not had a policy for South America for several administrations, since Barack Obama took office [in 2009],” said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “It was a very long period during which the US completely withdrew from the region, except for issues related to migration, Venezuela and drug trafficking … A vacuum was left that China has filled,” she said.For many analysts, the most significant symbol of China’s current and future strategy for South America is the Chancay“megaport” in Peru, a $3.5bn project inaugurated by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, himself last November.Last week, the Colombian government announced anew shipping route that will pass through Chancay. The Brazilian government has also reportedly admitted that, due to Trump’s protectionist measures, it isfast-tracking the launch of its operationsat the port – which would cut shipping times by 10 days compared with Atlantic routes.The most significant immediate potential beneficiary, of course, will be the host country itself. “It putsPeruin a position that was unthinkable 10 years ago,” said Wise.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US president’s special envoy to Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone, has already argued that any South American nation using Chancayshould face additional tariffs of 60%.“The US is demanding a level of loyalty, allegiance and respect that it squandered decades ago,” said Wise. “I hope that, in time, these Latin American countries will be able to just say: ‘Sorry, too bad, you know, a tariff is fine,’ because they’re selling so much to China.”US-Panama relationship was ‘very strong’. Then Trump upended the diplomatic playing boardRead moreThe port of Chancay is also an example of how the terms of the deal with China could change over time, Berg said. “Peru thought it was getting a Chinese-built port. Now it’s ended up with a Chinese-owned and operated port [by the state-owned Cosco Shipping],” he said.Antonio José Pagán, a researcher at the Center for China and Asia-Pacific Studies at the Universidad del Pacífico in Lima, said the increasing rapprochement between China and the region also raises the risk of growing dependent on Beijing.“But we must also not forget the agency of these countries,” he said. “As they want to improve economically, what matters to them is being able to cooperate with both sides and not be forced to choose between one or the other.“But this may be impossible if the rivalry between the United States and China continues to worsen.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsChinaPeruColombiaAmericasDonald TrumpXi JinpinganalysisShareReuse this content"

One pay stub, which was seen by the Guardian, showed that a Mexican worker was paid about $38 per day, plus a weekly bonus of about $225 before taxes. Separately, they were also paid daily food expenses.In comparison, a former warehouse worker, who is American, said based on his experience, Uline’s American warehouse staff were earning between $30 to $35 per hour when he left the company in 2023. The American workers also received health insurance and 401(k) benefits.Most Uline warehouse positions in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania currently pay between $25 and $35 per hour, with some offering as much as $38 per hour, according to postings on the job listing website Indeed.com.The new revelations followa story the Guardian published in December, about a so-called “shuttle program” at the company, which Uline used to bring workers from its warehouses in Mexico to its warehouses in the US, especially Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.The Mexican workers traveled to the US using tourist visas and visas meant for employees who enter the US temporarily to receive professional training, known as B1 visas, and not for regular work. Sources with direct knowledge of the matter alleged the Mexican employees stayed for one to six months and performed normal work at the company.Major Trump donors who complained of immigrant ‘invasion’ used Mexican workers illegally, sources allegeRead moreUline, the shipping supply company that made $8bn in revenue in 2024, has13 distribution centersand employs more than 9,000 people across the US, Mexico and Canada. The company’s founders are Dick and Liz Uihlein. Dick Uihlein has established himself as a billionaire mega-donor, giving tens of millions to rightwing candidates and political causes. Liz Uihlein is also a conservative donor. Federal Election Commission reports show they collectively gave $130m in support of Donald Trump during the 2024 election cycle. One television advertisement funded by Dick Uihlein’s Super Pac, Restoration Pac, during the 2024 presidential election attacked the then Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, for allowing an immigrant “invasion” at the US-Mexico border.Uline has declined to respond to the Guardian’s questions about its shuttle program. It is unclear whether the program is still in place or has been discontinued.Since the Guardian’s December publication of that story, additional sources have come forward to talk about their own experience at the company.One person who had participated in the shuttle program told the Guardian that employees at Uline’s Mexico facilities were encouraged to enroll in the program amid US workforce shortages during the pandemic. The source, who declined to be named due to concerns about retaliation by the company, said he had traveled to the US on a tourist visa.Uline “sold” Mexican employees on the promise of independence, leisure travel and weekly bonuses if they participated, he said.But the terms of the arrangement were stressful, he said: employees understood they would be traveling to work in US warehouses, but they were instructed to tell immigration officials they were traveling strictly for training purposes and were given paperwork from Uline claiming the same.In reality, “we did the same work we do here in [Mexico],” he said. “You knew you were going to work, they even told you that – but they told us to say that we were training so that we didn’t get in trouble.”Making the trip from Mexico to the US could be stressful for those workers who understood that they were entering the US misrepresenting the nature of their travel, sources told the Guardian. There were also incidents when, they said, border officials seemed suspicious of the travel and stopped them for questioning, though the sources who spoke to the Guardian said there were no major incidents.“I was a little worried,” the person said. “They were detaining them in the airport, and asking a lot of questions.”Two other former Uline workers, who are non-Hispanic Americans and also asked not to be named, described other aspects of working for the company that made them uncomfortable. Both alleged that the company relied not only on full-time staff from both the US and Mexico, but also on a significant number of temporary workers who were contracted through an agency in Wisconsin. The former Uline workers alleged in independent accounts that these temporary workers were exposed to frigid and sometimes freezing temperatures in the warehouse without being allowed to wear jackets, hats or gloves.Uline’s permanent warehouse workers, one former employee said, had to wear a uniform of a red Uline polo, blue zip-up jacket, blue work pants and single-color shoes. In the winter, the permanent staff could wear a fleece and a thin hat, but not a thicker coat.The temporary contracted staff, who were mostly Hispanic, were given only a vest that said Uline.“They weren’t allowed to wear hats or gloves of any kind, because the manager said it broke code. There were times, in winter in Wisconsin, when it’s single digits at night,” the person said. “And if they got caught wearing them, they were told to take them off. If they were caught a second time, they were told to go home and then wouldn’t come back.”The person added: “They did not treat them like human beings.”The person, who worked for Uline for about four years, recalled that one night when it was “absolutely frigid” – about -6F – he and a co-worker grabbed some extra fleece jackets that were on a table designated for Uline staff and brought them to the temporary contracted workers, only to be “screamed at” by a manager.“I told him I didn’t care and to write me up because it was -6. It didn’t even make sense. It is unethical,” the person said.Another former worker independently corroborated the account, saying he had worked at multiple warehouse sites, but that no workers were treated as badly as temporary workers were treated at Uline.“Worse than any job I have ever seen in my life,” he said. There were frequent injuries related to the cold, he added.“You would see their hands, they could barely move their fingers and they had to work through it. They couldn’t just stop and take a break,” he said. Workers, he added, were easily replaceable, especially temporary staff.“There was a temp who had his foot run over, [and] he couldn’t tell management. He worked through it because he had a family to feed,” he said.Uline did not respond to questions about the former workers’ claims about the treatment of temporary workers.Do you have a tip on this story?

The start of the school year was pushed back after a court ruling on behalf of a teachers’ union, which had argued that classrooms lacked adequate ventilation and water supplies for students.In recent days, the highest temperatures recorded in Brazilian cities have all been in Rio Grande do Sul, a state which is normally milder than other Brazilian regions closer to the equator.Quaraí, a city of 23,500 inhabitants on the border with Uruguay, recorded the country’s highest temperature of the year on 4 February: 43.8C (110.8F), with a heat index of over 50C – thehighest ever recorded in the state since measurements began in 1910. More than 60 municipalities in the state have declared astate of emergency due to drought.Marina Hirota, a scientist and professor of meteorology at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, said that while it was still too early for in-depth analyses of the current heatwave, both it and last year’s floods are “potentially linked to the climate crisis”.Brazil’s devastating floods hit ‘Black population on the periphery’ hardestRead more“These extreme events – heatwaves, cold spells andintense flooding like what happened in Rio Grande do Sul in 2024, followed now by an extreme drought – are becoming more frequent and more intense … and this frequency and intensity are the result of the climate crisis,” she said.The teachers’ union saidmore than 70% of schools in the state lack air conditioning. Other schools have had air conditioning units for years but have been unable to install them becausetheir electrical systems cannot support them.Olindo Flores school in São Leopoldo was one of the few that had air conditioning, but the equipment was lost in last year’s floods and has not yet been replaced during reconstruction.“We had classes in November and December, and there were some hot days – but nothing like this – and it was already difficult for teachers and students,” said Luiz Henrique Becker, 63, a sociology teacher at the school. “People were exhausted, unable to concentrate. Now, with this heatwave, resuming classes would be impossible.”On Sunday, after the union’s request, a judge suspended the start of classes for at least a week. The government appealed, and yesterday, an appellate judgeruled that classes could resume on Thursday, when a cold front is expected to arrive.“We will keep fighting for the government to install air conditioning in all schools because new heatwaves will happen,” said Rosane Zan, president of the teachers’ union.Hirota, who is also a researcher with a tropical ecology group at the Serrapilheira Institute, said: “Last year, we had the floods, and now, we get this extreme heat immediately after … We’re becoming less and less able to predict these events because they never used to happen this way … For the living beings in these places – whether humans, animals or plants – it’s also becoming ever more difficult to adapt to such abrupt changes.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasExtreme weatherExtreme heatClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

With the wind battering her village of Rizal, about 10 miles east of Manila in thePhilippines, and water swirling through the rooms below them, they had no choice but to wait, hoping that someone would come to rescue them and hundreds of their neighbours.“We did not have shelter, we did not have food … we just had to wait for the government for two days,” Carbonel said. “It is not easy, no electricity, no light, we just wait for the sun to rise. The children were scared, we had never experienced anything like this.”‘Backsliding’: most countries to miss vital climate deadline as Cop30 nearsRead moreCarbonel was speaking to the Guardian asGreenpeaceactivists and youth leaders from the Philippines protested outside the oil firm Shell’s headquarters in London on Wednesday demanding “accountability from major polluters and justice for all the loss and damage they have caused”.The Philippines has always been hit by typhoons, but as the climate emergency has worsened the storms have become more violent, with more destructive winds and floods.Last year in a record-breaking typhoon season, six storms battered the country in just a month. The super-typhoon Man-yi brought winds of up to 120mph and drove more than 650,000 people from their homes. In all, the storm season –“supercharged” by climate change, according to experts – affected more than 13 million people, destroyed lives and livelihoods andcost an estimated $500m.Carbonel, who is president of her local homeowners association, said the storms had grown much worse since she was younger. “When I was a child I did not experience this type of strong typhoon,” she said. “We are scared but we are already preparing, we prepare food and medicines and water.”A sofa belonging to Carbonel was one of the climate-wrecked household items put in giant glass boxes filled with water outside Shell’s headquarters on Wednesday. The possessions, which also included a television, shoes and a teddy bear, had all been destroyed in the latest typhoon season.View image in fullscreenA teddy bear in a glass case was part of the Greenpeace protest.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAs Shell staff arrived for work, speakers played the sounds of children laughing, and people cooking or watching TV, which had been recorded in the Philippines. Those noises were then replaced with sirens like those used in the Philippines to warn people of impending floods.Activists then smashed the glass cases, allowing the “flood” waters to spill out in front of the building.Greenpeace UK’s climate campaigner, Maja Darlington, said: “The world is near breaking point and it is oil and gas giants like Shell, who pocket tens of billions every year from burning fossil fuels that drive this climate chaos, that are to blame. It’s time they coughed up and paid their climate debts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

By delivering these precious possessions, damaged and destroyed by typhoons supercharged by the climate crisis, from the Philippines directly by the doors of Shell, we demand accountability from major polluters and justice for all the loss and damage they have caused.”During the latest storms, Carbonel’s house was spared the worst damage and she spent the night walking the streets warning neighbours through a loudhailer. Ten families whose homes were badly hit sheltered in her home until the storm receded.With a few months to go before the next storm season is due, she says all she can do is hope the world takes notice and the big oil companies take responsibility for what they are doing.“How can we ask those kind of people to pay? They are in government, in big companies, they are powerful, they are rich. For someone like me, what can I do? I just tell my children don’t worry, just pray to God [that the next] typhoon will miss us.

The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has targeted his foes in the UK, including the2006 radiation poisoningof the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko. This was followed by a string ofmore than a dozen other suspicious deathsof Russians on British soil that are also suspected of being tied to the Kremlin.Quick GuideTransnational repressionShowTransnational repression is the state-led targeting of refugees, dissidents and ordinary citizens living in exile. It involves the use of electronic surveillance, physical assault, intimidation and threats against family members to silence criticism. The Guardian’s Rights and freedom series ispublishing a series of articlesto highlight the dangers faced by citizens in countries including the UK.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“This happens inside democracies,” said Yana Gorokhovskaia, research director of Freedom House, in an interview with the Guardian. “Every year, we record cases in places like the United States, Canada, the UK, France, Germany and Sweden. That would probably surprise people because I think there’s an assumption that there’s a level of protection and that autocrats can’t reach into democracies.”Iran is also featured in the top 10 perpetrators, with 47 cases logged over the timeframe of the research. Several of these campaigns have been publicly exposed in recent years.UK ‘turning a blind eye’ to threats to kill Saudi activists living in exileRead moreIn 2023,the Guardian reportedthat journalists at the BBC Persian news outlet had been targeted with offensive messages and threats of sexual assault. In March 2024, a presenter for Iran International, a Farsi-language news channel,was stabbedoutside his home in Wimbledon, south London.Muslims bear the heaviest burden of transnational repression, accounting for 64% of targeted incidents worldwide.The Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group from northwest China that are the target of widespread crimes against humanity within the country, are subjected tosustained monitoring, threats and policingby the Chinese authorities, according to the research.“Uyghurs don’t have to be activists to be targeted,” said Gorokhovskaia. “It’s not that censoring themselves would solve this problem for them. It’s because their whole group is viewed as a threat, and so that’s why they’re being targeted.”In 2022 aspyware campaigntargeting Uyghurs by posing as Android apps, including messaging services, was discovered by cybersecurity experts. Chinese students living abroad, including in the UK,have also reportedbeing watched and followed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2023, US authorities discovered anillegal Chinese police stationoperating from an office in New York. Beijing had also targeted Tibetans and Hongkongers, said Gorokhovskaia.“We’re struggling with the magnitude of what the People’s Republic ofChinais doing. It’s everywhere, on campuses. It’s through social media and online communication. It’s threats against people’s families. China has also made a concerted effort to expand extradition agreements all around the world,” said Gorokhovskaia.‘They want to show no one can escape’: how the long arm of Russia is reaching out for Putin critics in exileRead moreJournalists are among those most at risk of repression campaigns, frequently facing cross-border intimidation as authoritarian governments seek to silence critical reporting. Since 2014, at least 26 governments have orchestrated 124 incidents of transnational repression against exiled journalists, highlighting the growing threat to press freedom on a global scale.Freedom House documents cases using publicly available information that can be externally confirmed, such as media reports, NGO reports, reports by the UN and other information based on private reporting and civil society activism. Most cases go unreported, however, it says, as targets are scared into silence.“The purpose of transnational repression is to silence criticism, to scare people and stop whatever activism they’re engaged in,” said Gorokhovskaia. “I don’t think people are reporting what’s happening to them. They’re choosing to censor, if to ensure their safety or the safety of their families.”Explore more on these topicsTransnational repressionRights and freedomChinaRussiaAsia PacificEuropePress freedomUyghursnewsShareReuse this content"

Our community deserves justice for everything we have suffered.”The people of Rennell Island have never received any compensation.East Rennell is a site of environmental and historical value. It was placed on Unesco’s World Heritage List in 1998 and is one of the largest raised coral atolls in the world. The oil spill occurred just outside the world heritage area, but devastated the lives of local communities.Following the spill, Rennell Islanders said freshwater sources on the island were left undrinkable. In nearby Avatai village, it was reported every chicken died a week after the spill and children suffered skin and eye infections.Anindependent report into the disasterfound spilled oil polluted water and damaged the reef up to three kilometres from the grounded vessel. The report said the site could take up to 130 years to recover.In the aftermath, the bulk carrier’s Hong Kong owner, King Trader Ltd, and the vessel’s South Korean insurer,issued a “sincere apology” over the disaster, but stopped short of accepting liability.The companies said that although matters of liability were yet to be determined, they “expressed deep remorse” at the “totally unacceptable” situation.The customary landowners of Rennell Island directly affected by the spill, along with the government of Solomon Islands, are co-claimants pursuing a group of international companies for environmental and other damages.The claim identifies five companies as liable for the damage caused by the spill: Hong Kong-based King Trader Ltd, which owned the stricken vessel; the protection and indemnity insurer Korea P&I, a state-owned South Korean company; miner Bintan Mining Corporation and its subsidiary Bintan Mining (SI) Ltd; and MS Amlin Marine MV, a Dutch provider of charterer’s liability.Korea P&I said it had not yet been served with any legal action in relation to Rennell. MS Amlin said it could not comment on an ongoing legal matter. Other companies were either uncontactable or did not reply.William Kadi, from Primo Afeau Legal Services, said the communities of Rennell Island had had their traditional lands and waterways “irreversibly damaged” by the disaster.“Today we start the process of helping the community heal by seeking justice and accountability for the mess left behind,” he said last week.Harj Narulla, from London’s Doughty Street Chambers, which is acting for the claimants, said the island’s landowners lived daily with the impacts of the oil spill.“This case is one of the worst environmental disasters in Pacific history. The customary landowners and Solomon Islands government are owed millions of dollars in compensation for the catastrophic harm they have suffered from the Rennell Island oil spill.“By filing [this] landmark case we will ensure that justice delayed is not justice denied.”Explore more on these topicsSolomon IslandsPacific islandsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Then the legal battle beganRead moreThe legislation, which passed the House of Representatives on Thursday morning, placed a $50,000 cap on individual donations and lowered the disclosure threshold to $5,000. Spending limits for political campaigns were set at $800,000 an electorate, and $90m nationally.The last-minute amendments were secured this week in a deal between Labor and the Coalition, igniting fury among independent and minor-party MPs whoaccused the major political parties of a “stitch-up”.Farrell said the process to pass the legislation had gone on for three years and defended the reforms as the “most transparent electoral reforms” to have passed.“The whole process pushes downward pressure on the cost of elections so ordinary Australians have a chance to be elected, not those candidates that are supported by the billionaires and the millionaires,” he said.Steggall reiterated her concerns about the reforms at a press conference with fellow independents.“I would certainly welcome for this legislation to be challenged to the high court as to whether or not it is constitutional,” she said.“We are independents, we don’t have the capacity to do that, but I think the Australian people deserve to have this legislation tested.”The MP for Curtin, Kate Chaney, said a challenge was likely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the 2022 federal election the major parties received 68.5% of primary votes.The crossbench had pushed to send the bill to an inquiry to further interrogate the proposed arrangements and their impact on independent newcomers.Big Australian charities including Baptist Care Australia and the Australian Conservation Foundation also condemned the changes, pointing to a provision that prevents them using general donations to pay for electoral advocacy.Robyn Sampson, the chief executive of Baptist Care, said charities needed to use donations to help inform Australians about key issues including housing, the cost of living and aged care.“By restricting our ability to speak up, the government has made it harder for people to understand these issues,” she said. “The public deserves better.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian political donationsAustralian politicsZali SteggallIndependentsLabor partyCoalitionAustralian GreensnewsShareReuse this content"

They are transferred to sexual partners during intercourse and leave specific signatures that can subsequently be detected, researchers found.Study lead supervisor Dr Brendan Chapman, of Murdoch University, said the technique of tracing an individual’s sexual microbiome – or sexome, as the researchers have termed it – could eventually be used in sexual assault cases where no sperm is detected.Senior Liberal says state MPs should be in parliament as Moira Deeming prepares to attend Jordan Peterson conferenceRead moreIn Australia,97% of sexual assault perpetrators are male, whileone in five womenover the age of 15 have experienced sexual assault.“If there’s either no ejaculation, barrier contraceptive or a vasectomised male … that’s where this becomes really important as a potential second approach,” Chapman said.The researchers homed in on a bacterial gene known as 16S rRNA, not present in humans. Its genetic sequence differs in bacteria found on different people.Genital swabs from 12 monogamous, heterosexual couples before and after intercourse showed that a person’s bacterial signature could be identified on their partner after sex.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe signature was still transferred even when a condom was used during intercourse, though in these cases most of the transfer was from the female to male partner. Chapman noted, however, unknown factors such as the timing of condom introduction during intimacy.Pubic hair, oral intercourse, circumcision or lubricant use did not appear to affect the transfer of bacteria. Male personal hygiene following intercourse was a factor that might affect tracing, the study noted.In one couple, a bacterial signature appeared to persist for five days after it was transferred between partners, Chapman said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The research team also hoped to better understand the sexome in the absence of intercourse, as well as how it changed through the female menstrual cycle.Dennis McNevin, a professor of forensic genetics at the University of Technology Sydney, who was not involved in the study, said bacterial genetic profiling could be used to corroborate or oppose testimony in alleged sexual assault cases where other DNA evidence was lacking or insufficient.“DNA is always going to be the first port of call,” he said. He described bacterial tracing as a last resort because it “is going to take more time, it is more expensive – it’s a boutique analysis”.The paper was published in the journaliScience.Explore more on these topicsScienceSexual healthHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”US no longer ‘primarily focused’ on Europe’s security, says Pete HegsethRead moreThe Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. “No one wants peace more than Ukraine,” he wrote. “Together with the US, we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”0:48'I don't think it's practical': Trump on Nato membership for Ukraine – videoTrump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”But, he said, “sometime [Ukraine’s] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks thatKyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia.“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. Instead, peace would have to be secured by “capable European and non-European troops”, who he stressed would not come from the US.Any British or European troops deployed in Ukraine would not be covered by part of a Nato mission or covered by the alliance’s article 5 guarantee, Hegseth added, meaning they would in effect be reliant on help from participating states.Though Hegseth set out some positions for achieving peace in Ukraine, few experts believe there has been any serious diplomatic progress. Russia, which has been gaining ground on the battlefield, remains keen to press home its advantage and has demanded that Ukraine cede further territory and in effect be demilitarised as part of a deal.Russia’s demands could mirror those made on the eve of its full-scale invasion in 2021: that Ukraine adopt a neutral status and that Nato cease deploying weapons to member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began accepting former communist nations. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.Earlier this week,Zelenskyy told the Guardianthat Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. “Security guarantees without America are not real,” he said.A multinational deterrence force based in Ukraine after a ceasefire would need to be 100,000 to 150,000 strong, Zelenskyy said, though that would be far smaller than the 600,000-plus Russian troops in occupied Ukraine.“Europe cannot field a force like this right now,” one senior European diplomat told the Guardian. “But we cannot force the US [to commit troops]. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”Zelenskyy: Europe cannot guarantee Ukraine’s security without AmericaRead moreAnother senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The person also said that the readiness to offer concessions from Ukraine would encourage Russia to demand more in the upcoming negotiations.In his readout of their call, Zelenskyy also suggested that Ukraine was reviewing a deal with the US regarding a new “security, economic cooperation, and resource partnership”. That followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who had visited Kyiv to discuss US access to rare earth minerals, energy resources and energy assets, according to Reuters.The US has suggested that it would seek access torare earth minerals, which are strategic metals essential for industries developing computers, batteries and cutting-edge energy technology in exchange for providing military aid to Ukraine in the future.The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops [under a ceasefire agreement], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. “And we have not been consulted.”European foreign ministers declared their support for Ukraine during a meeting of the country’s allies in Paris on Wednesday. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion. We have always said we will support Ukraine to achieve a just and lasting peace. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involvingMarc Fogel,a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVladimir PutinUS foreign policyUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Rubiales has always denied wrongdoing andsays the act was consensual.View image in fullscreenHermoso after testifying in the first session of the trial last week.Photograph: Chema Moya/EPA“It was an unwanted kiss: I believe that after the examination carried out [during the trial], there is no doubt, or at least not sufficient reasonable doubt,” the public prosecutor, Marta Durantez Gil, told the court before repeating the sentencing demands.There was no history of animosity between Hermoso and Rubiales that could have led the player to “not tell the truth about what happened at the time of the kiss”, Gil said, adding there was “total consistency between the facts she recounted and her immediate and subsequent behaviour”.Rubiales told Spain’s national court on Tuesday he was “totally sure” Hermoso consented to the kiss during the medal ceremony after the final. “She squeezed me very tightly under my armpits, she lifted me, and when I came down I asked her if I can give you a kiss, and she said: ‘OK.’ That’s what happened,” he said.Rubiales conceded he had made a mistake on the podium and that his behaviour was not appropriate, saying he should have “been in a more institutional role”, but denied any offence had been committed.Hermoso told the opening day of the trial she felt “disrespected” after a non-consensual kiss that “should not happen in any social or work setting”.The player, who plays club football for the Mexican side Tigres, has since appeared for Spain, but the scandal cast a shadow over the team’s World Cup victory.The high-profile trial, which got under way in San Fernando de Henares, near Madrid, on 3 February, is expected to wrap up on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsSpain women's football teamWomen's footballSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The previous record, set in the 1960s, was 129 days.In a statement earlier on Wednesday, the ÖVP said it wanted to have the interior brief, with asylum and migration issues moved into a separate new ministry. The FPÖ, in turn, rejected that proposal as “fraught with numerous constitutional problems” and “doomed to failure”.Protocols from the negotiations, leaked over the weekend, also showed outstanding issues, including on EU policy and the treatment of asylum seekers.The ÖVP wanted the FPÖ – which has criticised EU sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine – to clarify its position on Moscow, insisting a future government must see Russia “as a threat”, according to a confidential document revealed by the media.Kickl is known for his harsh attacks on his opponents, including calling the Austrian president, Alexander Van der Bellen, a “senile mummy”.The FPÖ leader has also caused controversy by calling himself the future “Volkskanzler” – the people’s chancellor – as Hitler was termed in the 1930s. He has denied this is a Nazi reference.The FPÖ stands at more than 35% in voter opinion polls – up from the almost 29% it gained in September.The ÖVP, which came second in September with 26%, has slumped to about 18% and is trailing in third place behind the Social Democrats in the polls.Explore more on these topicsAustriaThe far rightEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

That would mean a doubling for the UK of defence spending – its budget is currently 2.33% of GDP.Trump reportedly fires watchdog who oversees USAid after damning reportRead moreHegseth explained that the shift away from Europe was necessary because the US “faces consequential threats to our homeland” and was focused on border security. At the same time, he added: “We also face a peer competitor in the communist Chinese” able to threaten the American mainland and “core national interests in the Indo-Pacific”.“The US is prioritising deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognising the reality of scarcity, and making the resourcing trade-offs to ensure deterrence does not fail. As the United States shifts its attention to these threats, European allies must lead from the front,” he added.Hegseth’s positioning reflects priorities repeatedly stated by the US president that Europe must increase defence budgets and contribute to its own security, though they fall short of saying the US would not protect a Nato member if attacked.Nato’s article 5 states that if one member state comes under attack, others have to be prepared to come to its aid. It has only been invoked once in the alliance’s history, when the US was attacked on 9/11.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyUkraineNatoPete HegsethEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But all our territories are important, there is no priority,” he said.Responding on Wednesday to the proposed exchange, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow strongly rejected all offers to trade territory.“This is impossible,” he told reporters at a daily briefing. “Russia has never discussed and will not discuss the exchange of its territory.”Peskov added: “Ukrainian units will be expelled from this territory. All who are not destroyed will be expelled.”Ukraine seized approximately 500 sq miles (1,300 sq km) in the Kursk region last summer in a surprise incursion that dealt a major embarrassment to Putin. In response, Russia has deployed tens of thousands of troops,including North Korean forces, in an effort to reclaim the territory.According to open-source monitor groups, Russia has since reclaimed about half of the lost territory in the Kursk region while still controlling just under 20% of Ukraine’s land.The two armies are engaged in a fierce and bloody battle for control of the Kursk region, now a key battleground in the latest phase of the war. Much of the fighting is centred around the town of Sudzha, which remains under Ukrainian control.An estimated 2,000 Russian civilians are believed to be living under Ukrainian rule in the Kursk region, their fate largely unknown due to the lack of phone and internet signals, which has cut off communication with the outside world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, Egyptian and Qatari mediators were working “intensively” to compel Israel to address Hamas’s new demands before Saturday’s scheduled release of three Israeli hostages, Egypt’s state-run al-Qahera television reported.Mahmoud Mardawi, a senior Hamas official, said there were “positive signals” that the hostage handover would go ahead as planned, but added it had “yet to receive Israel’s commitment to implement the full terms of the deal, especially the humanitarian protocol”. There was no immediate comment from Israeli authorities.King Abdullah rebuffs Trump’s push for Jordan to take in displaced PalestiniansRead moreThe future of the three-week-old ceasefire agreement was thrown into jeopardy on Monday when Hamas’s armed wing announced it would postpone freeing the next group of captives. It citied alleged Israeli violations of the truce, including the continued killing of Palestinians, blocks on aid, including tents, and delays in allowing displaced people to return to the north of the strip.It said it had announced its stance early in order to give mediators enough time to pressure Israel to “comply and compensate for the past weeks” before the scheduled weekend handover.Israel denies the Hamas allegations, but claimed responsibility for an airstrike in the Rafah area on Wednesday that killed two people who the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said were flying a drone.The surprise announcement by the US president,Donald Trump, last week that the US would take over and “develop” the Gaza Strip appeared to be central to the group’s decision, although it did not directly mention it in its statement. Hamas reportedly no longer believes Washington’s guarantees for the ceasefire will hold and it does not think Israel is serious about implementation.The crisis, however, escalated sharply afterTrump respondedto Hamas’s delay by threatening “hell is going to break out” unless it released all of the Israeli hostages it was holding on Saturday.After a lengthy cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appeared to be keeping the option to continue the ceasefire open and a statement from his office did not explicitly back Trump’s call for “all” 76 of the remaining hostages to be freed this weekend.His defence minister, Israel Katz, echoed the deliberately ambiguous language on Wednesday, saying: “If Hamas does not release the Israeli hostages by Shabbat, the gates of hell will open on them, just as the US president promised. The new Gaza war will be different in intensity from the one before the ceasefire – and will not end without the defeat of Hamas and the release of all the hostages.”Hamas’s spokesperson, Hazem Qassem, said on Wednesday that Israel was “evading implementation of several provisions of the ceasefire agreement” and reiterated the group’s stance that hostages could only be released through diplomatic means. “Our position is clear, and we will not accept the language of American and Israeli threats,” he said.Talks on the second stage of the ceasefire, which is supposed to begin in early March, were due to start last week, but an Israeli team sent by Netanyahu to Qatar lacked a mandate to discuss matters not related to stage one, and returned on Sunday night.Egyptian and Qatari mediators are now trying to persuade Israel to meet the demands Hamas made on Monday, including “implementing the humanitarian protocol … and beginning negotiations for the second phase”, a Palestinian diplomatic source told Agence-France Presse.The head of the UN, António Guterres, has urged Hamas to proceed with the planned release and “avoid at all costs resumption of hostilities in Gaza”.The first stage of the truce, in which Israeli captives are released in batches in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli custody, has come under increasing strain as both sides accuse the other of violations.Last week’s release of three emaciated hostages sparked anger in Israel and beyond. The Gaza health ministry says Israeli fire has killed at least 92 Palestinians and wounded more than 800 others since the fragile ceasefire took hold on 19 January. The IDF says it has fired on people who approach its forces or enter certain areas in alleged violation of the truce.Trump has doubled down on his proposal to build a “riviera of the Middle East” in Gaza and to relocate its population of 2.3 million people to Egypt and Jordan, a plan international law experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing.The Arab world has flatly rejected the idea, which could destabilise the region and put Israel’s peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan at risk.Jordan’s King Abdullahmet Trumpat the White House on Tuesday, saying in social media posts he “reiterated Jordan’s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians”.Egypt said on Wednesday that it planned to present an alternative vision backed by Arab states for reconstruction of the Palestinian territory that will ensure Gaza’s residents remain on their land.The ceasefire halted 15 months of fighting in the strip, during which about 48,000 Palestinians were killed, sparking a devastating humanitarian crisis and reducing the occupied territory to ruins. The war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 were killed and another 250 taken hostage.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It stressed, however, that it wants the ceasefire to continue, emphasising that mediators had five days before the handover to ensure Israel “complies and compensates for the past weeks”.There are also two unspoken reasons for the group’s decision.Hamas officials are astute observers of Israeli politics and media; they took careful note of the furore caused by theemaciated condition of the three hostagesreleased last weekend, which the hostage families forum likened to images of Holocaust survivors.What do Hamas delay and Trump threat mean for Gaza ceasefire deal?Read moreIf the group is releasing the healthiest captives first, and the next to be freed are in even worse shape,Hamascommanders may be worried about pushing Israeli public opinion towards resuming hostilities in revenge for their treatment.Secondly, Hamas is as vulnerable as the rest of the world to Donald Trump’s tendency to make up policy on the fly.The militant group did not mention the president’s ill-considered proposal that the US take over and “develop” Gaza in its statement on Monday, but the president has essentially already torpedoed the next two phases of the ceasefire – an end to the war, and talks on future governance of the strip. He has left Hamas with dwindling options.Trump’s response to the delay of the next hostage release raised the stakes even higher. In an attempt to back the group into a corner, he has nowdemanded that Hamas releases “all” of the remaining Israeli hostageson Saturday, although he has acknowledged that the decision ultimately lies with Israel. For his part, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deliberately fudged his position in order to keep his options open, not explicitly backing Trump’s most recent statement.Hamas has dismissed Trump’s new deadline, saying that “the language of threats has no value and only complicates matters”, but the group now appears to have three courses of action.It can cut its losses and carry out its threat to delay Saturday’s planned hostage release, which will mean a return to fighting. While resuming hostilities is likely to trigger another mass exodus of Palestinian civilians to southern Gaza and dramatically worsen the strip’s humanitarian crisis, this is a way for Hamas to save face without giving up any more hostages, which remain its main leverage over Israel.It could also call Trump and Israel’s bluff by releasing more than three hostages. While it is logistically unlikely that the group could deliver all 76 – at least 30 of whom are dead – in one go, it could feasibly release the eight living captives due to come home in the first stage of the deal, in effect forcing talks to begin on implementing the second and third phases of the ceasefire ahead of schedule.Hamas also knows that if it does deliver the three hostages scheduled for release on Saturday, as planned, Israel is unlikely to withdraw from the agreement. This route would keep the truce alive, and to some extent defang Trump’s threats, although the president is unlikely to suffer such humiliation lightly.Which path the group will take will become clear on Friday night, when Hamas is supposed to deliver the names of the three hostages before their release. If they do not materialise, Israel will have ample justification to resume the war, with Trump’s blessing – an outcome that will let Netanyahu, the ultimate political Houdini,keep his rightwing coalition government intact.The ceasefire in the Gaza Strip is hanging by a thread after just three weeks, which does not bode well for its future. More than 2 million people in Gaza, and hundreds of Israelis still desperate for captive loved ones to return, have no choice but to hold their breath.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesanalysisShareReuse this content"

The conglomerate is controlled by Adani, whose close relationship with the prime minister, Narendra Modi, hasrecently been under intense scrutiny.In November, the US government charged the billionaire with fraud for his alleged involvement in a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving renewable power from the Khavda complex. He has denied the claims.TheAdani Grouphas dominated India’s growing green energy sector and Khavda is at the heart of the conglomerate’s ambitions for renewable energy. The plant is seen as sufficiently important to India’s energy self-reliance and renewable pledges for it to be launched by Modi himself in 2020.Now, national security concerns have been raised over the project after private communications and confidential government minutes seen by the Guardian showed the defence ministry amended security protocols on behalf of developers to make sensitive territory on the India-Pakistan border commercially viable.The Adani Group is constructing solar panels and wind turbines 1km (0.6 miles) from the border with Pakistan in the Rann of Kutch, on land leased out by the government of Gujarat. The Rann of Kutch was targeted in past India-Pakistan conflicts and is adjacent to Sir Creek, a disputed territory with Pakistan. The two countries have gone to war four times.View image in fullscreenThe Khavda renewable energy park is the largest in the world.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersPrevious national defence protocols did not allow any major construction beyond existing villages and roads up to 10km from the border with Pakistan, preventing any large-scale installation of solar panels.But documents show that the Gujarat government, which is controlled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), lobbied at the highest levels for the protocols to be relaxed to make land in the Rann of Kutch available for both solar and wind construction.According to official communications, a letter was written prior to April 2023 by Gujarat officials to the prime minister’s office, requesting the matter be raised with the ministry of defence.A confidential government meeting was then convened in Delhi on 21 April 2023 to discuss the solar proposal from the Gujarat government. It was attended by the director general of military operations and officials from Gujarat and from the ministry of renewable energy.“Apprehensions” around the implications of solar panels for tank mobilisation and security surveillance along the international border were raised by senior military officials, according to the confidential minutes of the meeting. However, the developers gave assurances “that solar platforms would be adequate in mitigating any threats from enemy tank movements”.Other requests made by military officials for adjustments to solar panel size were rejected by developers on the basis they were not “financially viable”.At the end of the meeting, the defence ministry agreed with a “mutual consensus” to allow for solar panels and wind turbines to be built as close as 1km to Pakistan, in order to make the land economically viable for renewable energy.By 8 May 2023, the Modi government had formalised this decision. A notification was issued to all ministries confirming a relaxation of the guidelines around infrastructure development, which applied not only on the India-Pakistan border, but also on land adjoining Bangladesh, China, Myanmar and Nepal. It signalled a significant alteration in India’s strategic posturing along its entire volatile border.Military experts have raised concerns about the security implications of the decision to relax the border regulations and build one of India’s most valuable private energy assets so close to Pakistan.Ajai Shukla, a retired Indian army colonel and defence analyst, said: “It is strategically unwise to create a hybrid wind and solar power generation asset within easy striking distance of the India-Pakistan border.“By changing border defence norms and protocols to make cheaper land available for commercial exploitation, the military is effectively taking on even more expansive defence responsibilities for private commercial benefit.”According to a senior serving officer, the policy change was met with surprise and concern among army ranks. The Guardian understands that senior army officials overseeing operations in the area were not consulted about the decision.Two senior officers, who were not authorised to speak to the media, questioned how the military could mobilise in the event of any security threat or incursion from Pakistan, as has taken place in the Rann of Kutch in the past.“What happens if there is the need to lay mines, anti-tank and anti-personnel? What about the concept of space and surprise in offensive and defensive operations?” asked one officer.Another questioned the assurance given by developers that solar panels would be enough to stop enemy tanks. “We have compromised the professional requirements to defend Indian territory,” he said.How the deal was doneAt the time that the meeting in Delhi was convened in April 2023, the 230 sq km (90 sq miles) of land closest to Pakistan had been allotted to a state-run enterprise, Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). But by August, after the ministry of defence agreed to relax the border rules – making the land 10 times more valuable for renewable construction – it was in the hands of the Adani Group.Confidential communication states that SECI was encouraged to “surrender” the land at a meeting chaired by Modi’s renewable energy minister, RK Singh, in early May. SECI handed back the land to the Gujarat government in a letter dated 17 July 2023, clearly stating it had not been made aware of beneficial changes to border protocols and maintaining it was not “commercially viable”.The Adani Group, however, had been informed. Two weeks before SECI had agreed to give up the land, the company wrote to Gujarat officials expressing interest in acquiring it, in light of the “revised” border protocols, in a letter seen by the Guardian.It was a Gujarat government committee, led by the BJP chief minister, Bhupendra Patel, that reallocated the land in August. Several state-run entities put in bids, but ultimately another 255 sq km was given over to the Adani Group, on top of the 190 sq km it had already leased.The decision was highly lucrative for the Adani Group. Khavda now occupies 445 sq km, an area four times the size of Paris, and at its peak, the company claims the park will generate 30GW of renewable energy – enough to power entire nations such as Belgium, Chile or Switzerland. Google will be among its customers.In a statement, an Adani spokesperson said: “We are fully compliant with all the state and central government laws and regulations and have secured all the necessary approvals from the relevant competent authorities.“The land allocation for the project adheres to policy guidelines and is based on the credentials and performance of Adani Green Energy, India’s largest renewable energy company.”The Indian government did not respond to a request for comment.Opposition politicians have repeatedly accused the Modi government, and BJP state governments, of entering into corrupt deals and favouring the Adani Group. This has been particularly prevalent in Adani’s home state of Gujarat, where the allegations go back decades to when Modi was chief minister. The Adani Group denies any special treatment by the Modi government.In November, a US indictment accused Adani and his executives of involvement in an alleged scheme to pay $265m (£215m) in bribes to Indian government officials between 2020 and 2024 in an attempt to obtain lucrative solar energy supply contracts.The majority of these “corrupt” deals cited by US investigators related to renewable energy that would allegedly be generated at Adani’s Khavda plant and sold to state governments at inflated prices.The Andhra Pradesh state government is looking to cancel one of the biggest deals, to buy 7GW of solar power from Adani’s Khavda plant, while France’s TotalEnergies, which paid $444m for a stake in the project, said it was suspending all further investment in the conglomerate. The Adani Group has denied all allegations as “baseless” and said it was seeking all “possible legal recourse”.In December, India’s parliament was brought to a standstill when Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition, accused the prime minister of handing over the country to Adani.“The prime minister is protecting Mr Adani and the prime minister is involved in corruption with Mr Adani,” said Gandhi. “Adani has hijacked India … The country is in Adani’s grip.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaAdani GroupPakistanSouth and central AsiaNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the 12 new towns are not likely to be standalone but extensions to existing big settlements.The new towns would be led by regional development corporations, with an initial injection of public funding to buy land which would be returned after sites had been sold at a higher value to private developers, in part to pay for infrastructure.Starmer said home ownership remained a “distant dream” for many people, resulting in a “disconnect between working hard and getting on” which eroded public faith in the system.He said: “This is about more than just bricks and mortar. It’s about the security and stability that owning your own home brings. I know what this means for working people – the roof above our head was everything for our family growing up.”The government is aiming for at least 40% of the homes to be affordable, including social housing. A new towns code is expected to demand that buildings have “character” and are designed with reference to local history and in tree-lined streets, with guaranteed public transport, GPs surgeries and schools, as well as access to nature and play areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Planners are also understood to be looking near Nottingham, Stafford and Northampton, as well as both sides of the Thames estuary.Ministers are also to announce a separate push to continue with stalled housing projects which has already unblocked 20,000 homes.A further three sites – Frome Gateway in Bristol, south of Cayton in North Yorkshire and Beam Park in Dagenham, east London – will receive support from the “new homes accelerator” scheme.As part of efforts to regenerate areas and use brownfield land, £30m will go to Bradford, £1.5m to a scheme at Manchester Victoria North and £20m will help transform small-scale council-owned sites around England.A new plan to broker disagreements between developers and government agencies which need to be consulted during the planning process has also been set out.Quangos including National Highways, Natural England and the Environment Agency will need to bring planners and housebuilders to the table to iron out concerns, with £1m of funding to speed up the planning approval process.A £2m package will support the Building Safety Regulator to speed up the process of signing off high-rise housing blocks.

He is expected back on campus next week.However, the Guardian can reveal that, during his investigation, O’Brien did not have access to the diaries or WhatsApp messages, which are understood to have run over hundreds of pages and shed light on the nature of his relationship with the woman.The KC is understood to have been persuaded not to review the documentary evidence by Tooley’s lawyers, Griffin Law, who argued the materials were confidential and if they formed part of the inquiry it would breach his privacy.One senior source at the university, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they believed the investigation was therefore flawed.“It is difficult to draw proper conclusions if you haven’t got access to the full evidence base. It is drawing conclusions on the basis of a partial evidence base, which is not satisfactory,” they said.Another senior staff member at the university, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Cynthia and James Tooley were the principal individuals interviewed as part of the inquiry, meaning it was “essentially one person’s word against another”.Lawyers for Tooley maintain he was exonerated by O’Brien’s investigation. They said the suggestion that the inquiry was constrained because of lack of access to the diaries and WhatsApp messages was “baseless”.They also said that O’Brien “spoke to” the young woman in India during the investigation. However, three sources familiar with the investigation said she was not formally interviewed by him.Tooley’s imminent return to campus will come at a fraught time for the university, amid division among its leadership.After his suspension, Tooley filed a formal grievance against members of the council whom he accused of seeking his removal because of their opposition to his “political views and beliefs”.O’Brien also investigated that grievance in a separate investigation, and concluded it was “wholly without merit”. Tooley’s lawyers reject that conclusion, insisting he was targeted because of his political beliefs as part of an “attempted coup”.One of those accused by Tooley in his grievance was Mark Qualter, the chair of the university’s council. He emailed staff last week to complain about misreporting of the vice-chancellor’s suspension from “certain elements of the media”, which he said had been “unhelpful” and “unsettling”.The Guardian understands that there are also unresolved questions about the extent to which O’Brien’s investigation into Tooley’s relationship with the woman in India amounted to a full exoneration of the vice-chancellor.Do you have information about this story? Email investigations.contact@theguardian.com, or use Signal or WhatsApp to message (UK) +44 7721 857 348.In a council meeting on 27 January, after the report’s conclusion, members unanimously agreed with a subcommittee’s recommendation that there were no grounds to dismiss him. Qualter’s email to staff said the council was in “complete agreement” on this point.However, there were divisions among council members on other points. Some members believed Tooley had been fully exonerated. Others disagreed. One university document seen by the Guardian states that “a full range of views” was expressed on the question of whether he had been exonerated.It is understood that some members of the council raised concerns about whether it was appropriate for someone in charge of a university to have such a relationship in light of safeguarding considerations. One source with knowledge of the council meeting said Tooley’s “judgment was questioned”.The University of Buckingham is understood to have a large intake of students from India, including some who are a similar age to the Indian woman when they first met.Tooley reportedly knew the woman’s father, and paid her tuition fees. According to the Times, Tooley’s friends said this was a charitable gift and their intimate relationship began after she left university.The Indian woman told the newspaper that she was 18 when she met Tooley and they did not begin a sexual relationship until she was in her 20s. She said she was in love with him and “people will say he used me because he has power and money. But that’s not the case.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity of BuckinghamHigher educationEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the BBC said it recorded a call in which a senior MI5 officer broke that policy in an attempt to influence the broadcaster’s coverage.On Wednesday in the high court, Mr Justice Chamberlain castigated MI5 and said: “There is no contest that the evidence was not just misleading, it was false. Whether or not it was deliberately false is the subject of an investigation.”Courts were given a statement on behalf of MI5 by one of its deputy directors general.The woman who complained about the agent, who she says attacked her with a machete, had taken a case to the investigatory powers tribunal.She wanted the tribunal to investigate MI5’s recruitment and handling of the man she said had abused her. MI5 said its policy of neither confirming nor denying that someone was their agent should stand; the woman’s lawyers said that would frustrate her push for justice.Two inquiries are now under way: one internally by MI5, the other ordered by the home secretary to be carried out by Jonathan Jones, the former head of the government legal service.In a statement,Yvette Coopersaid: “It is clearly a very serious matter to provide incorrect information to the court and MI5 has apologised directly for this.“Sir Jonathan Jones KC … will lead the review and ensure that an independent authoritative view can be taken on what went wrong and any actions MI5 needs to take to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.”Cooper said the use of covert agents was vital to national security. “Covert human intelligence sources – or agents – play a crucial role in that work, and maintaining the secrecy of their identities is essential to protect them, their families, the vital intelligence they provide, and the recruitment of future sources.“The government maintains and supports the principle of neither confirming nor denying allegations about whether individuals may or may not be operating on behalf of the UK intelligence agencies.”The revelations led to a rare public apology from the MI5 director general. Ken McCallum said: “It has become clear that MI5 provided incorrect information to the high court in relation to an aspect of our witness statement. As soon as we became aware of the issue, we immediately took steps to correct that part of the statement. We take our duty to provide truthful, accurate and complete information very seriously, and have offered an unreserved apology to the court.“The use of agents is difficult, human work that is governed by legislation and tightly overseen. It is fundamental to MI5’s ability to keep the UK safe.”During the saga, McCallum called the BBC director general, Tim Davie, as the two organisations clashed over the story. The BBC has accused MI5 of lying and says it was pressed to drop the story.Kate Ellis, a solicitor for “Beth”, from the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “We now understand that MI5 has misled three courts by giving or relying on false evidence – over a period of several years – and this has allowed them to avoid giving ‘Beth’ any meaningful answers. This is in circumstances where Beth’s ex-partner specifically boasted of his MI5 status to Beth, and used this to abuse her.“Most concerning of all, perhaps, is that the truth has only emerged at all because of a secret recording made by the BBC. Until the BBC disclosed this secret tape to MI5, it appears that MI5 and their lawyers were robustly maintaining their original version of events.”Explore more on these topicsMI5BBCFar rightYvette CooperViolence against women and girlsUK security and counter-terrorismWomennewsShareReuse this content"

But now a mural will be painted on one of its outer walls depicting Malcolm X along with Claudia Jones –the campaigning journalist who helped launch the Notting Hill carnivaland Britain’s first black newspaper – andAvtar Singh Jouhl, the anti-racism activist who invited him to Smethwick.View image in fullscreenThe artist Bunny Bread’s design for the forthcoming Malcolm X mural outside the Ivy Bush pub in Smethwick.Photograph: HandoutThe visit came at a pivotal moment in the international battle for equality. Days before arriving in Smethwick,Malcolm Xhad visited Selma, Alabama, where Martin Luther King was being held in the city jail after campaigning for equal voting rights.In England, black and Asian workers were facing discrimination, violence and intimidation in the West Midlands. ABritish branch of the Ku Klux Klanhad formed in Birmingham after the election of the Conservative MP Peter Griffiths, whose campaign used an openly racist “unofficial” slogan.In Smethwick,a “colour bar”operated in housing, workplaces, shops and in pubs, denying minority ethnic workers equal pay and access to amenities. Malcolm X experienced it for himself at the Blue Gates pub, which segregated customers at the time, and, on seeing posters outside properties saying “coloured people need not apply”, said: “This is worse than in America.”Nine days after coming to Smethwick, Malcolm X was assassinated in New York. Jouhl, who died in 2022,previously told Birmingham Live: “Malcolm’s visit put racism in Britain on the international map … After he visited, things started changing.”At the end of 1965, the Race Relations Act – the first piece of legislation of its kind in the country – became law. It followed years of grassroots campaigning against discrimination in the UK – fromLen Johnson challenging a Manchester colour barin the 1950s, toPaul Stephensonrefusing to leave a venue in Bristol until he was served, a year after helping to lead 1963’sBristol bus boycottwhich fought racist employment policies.The Smethwick mural, funded by Arts Council England, will be created by the artist Bunny Bread and is part of a festival of anniversary celebrations led bythe anti-racist collective MX60.Jagwant Johal of BirminghamRaceImpact Group said: “The story of how and why Malcolm X found himself in Smethwick is one of international Black unity and solidarity. The significance of the visit was to connect the dots of global racism, be it in Soweto, Alabama or Smethwick.“The same racist scapegoating of refugees and asylum seekers today was very much the background back then, leading the Indian Workers’ Association to invite Malcolm X to expose the unfolding apartheid in Smethwick.”Explore more on these topicsMalcolm XCivil rights movementEnglandRacenewsShareReuse this content"

They also allow such firms to advertise on the front of Premier League football clubs’ shirts.The Gambling Commission said on Wednesday that Stake “will no longer be a licensed website” by 11 March after TGP “stated they would be shutting the site”.The statement added: “The commission will be writing to Everton – along with two other football clubs with unlicensed sponsors – warning of the risks of promoting unlawful gambling websites.”Everton has no plans to replace Stake as a main shirt sponsor, the BBC reported.The commission said the letter would warn that “club officers may be liable to prosecution and, if convicted, face a fine, imprisonment or both if they promoted unlicensed gambling businesses that transact with consumers in Great Britain”.Bonnie Blue – whose real name is Tia Billinger – last month attempted to break the “world record” for having the most amount of sex in 12 hours.

City officials were insistent that the law would not be used to target aid workers, but declined to clarify that point in the ordinance itself.The proposal, with its unusual language about aiding and abetting, had attracted considerable attention and condemnation from civil rights groups and community organizations. Nearly 20 such groups signed a letter urging the council to vote against it, describing it as “misguided” and warning it would create “legal liability and devastating humanitarian consequences”.“This sweeping language would effectively make it a crime to be unsheltered in the City of Fremont,” the letter stated, adding that unhoused people cannot avoid living outdoors when there is no access to housing. “As such, there is effectively no way for unsheltered individuals to comply with the proposal.”The ordinance in Fremont comes as cities across the US are cracking down on homeless encampments following the US supreme court’sruling last yearthat cities can criminalize unhoused people for sleeping outside – even when there are no shelter spaces available.Dozens of US cities enacted harsher anti-camping policies in the aftermath of that decision. In California, which has thehighest rateof unhoused people living outside in the country, the governor issued anexecutive ordercalling for the removal of encampments on state property and encouraging local governments to adopt similar policies.In Fremont, a2024 countfound that 807 people in the city were experiencing homelessness and 612 of them were unsheltered – a decrease from 2022. But the city, like much of California, had seen a major rise in homelessness in recent years with the population increasing from 608 in 2019 to 1,026 just three years later.Fremont has just over 100 shelter beds available.Housing in the city has not kept up with the growing number of jobs, said David Bonaccorsi, a member of the Fremont for Everyone group and a former city councillor.In December, the council began considering the proposal to ban camping on public property and make “aiding and abetting” a misdemeanor with a penalty of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. The ordinance also makes it illegal to store personal property in public areas.Fremont had a long history of working with non-profit and advocacy groups, Bonaccorsi said, but that suddenly changed when the council moved to consider the ordinance without consulting with those organizations. Elaine Sanchez with the Sisters of the Holy Family echoed that sentiment.“That’s why it’s such a surprise because Fremont has already done so much good with housing,” Sanchez said. “It was a real reversal when we read this ordinance. Why did they not consult or call together some of the stakeholders? Instead [they crafted] an ordinance that really does criminalize people that are poor, people that are unhoused.”The council moved ahead with the ordinance despite the objections of community groups who feared they may be subject to fines or arrest for providing support and aid to unhoused people, and took a final vote on the matter this week.On Tuesday evening, as many as 700 people showed up at the Fremont city council chambers, where the line to enter snaked around the building and into a parking lot. Some carried signs reading “don’t criminalize aid workers” and “poverty is not a crime”.Dozens of advocates and residents begged the council not to pass the ordinance, arguing it was cruel and would not solve the crisis and would instead criminalize unhoused people and those who help them. It would force people to leave encampments even when there is nowhere for them to go, several speakers said.“What are we doing?” said Thaddeus Sprinkles. “We are playing musical chairs with people’s lives. This is not a solution.”And there aren’t enough services to help people who are unhoused, said Kimberly Wise, who was unhoused in Fremont for more than a year.California’s unhoused people protest US supreme court order: ‘Not going to push us out of view’Read moreMany others advocated in favor of the ordinance, with residents stating they no longer felt safe in their community and had found needles near their homes and businesses. Some reported encampments that butted up against their properties and posed a hazard and said the situation was negatively affecting the city and economy.“Compassion is not about enabling,” one resident said. “There has to be accountability.”The city attorney said the ordinance does not make it illegal to provide food or aid to unhoused people. The council briefly considered amending the proposal to explicitly state that the ordinance would not affect aid workers but ultimately opted not to and the ordinance passed with just one councillor opposing it.The city’s mayor, Raj Salwan, argued that despite criticism that the council lacked compassion, Fremont was a leader in providing support to unhoused residents.“It’s not fair for folks to have to navigate their paths around these large encampments,” he said. “These encampments are not humane for the unhoused. We’ve done more than any other city.”“We are a leader in homeless prevention,” he said, but added the city “must balance accountability with compassion”.As the meeting came to an end at midnight, people yelled “shame, shame, shame” at the council. JC Clark, a lifelong Fremont resident, continued shouting “shame” until she walked to her car.“Poverty is not a crime. This ordinance says it is,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaHomelessnessWest CoastHousingPovertySocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

The sale is expected to close Friday, says Brock Harris, a real estate agent, who adds that he’s received “lots of calls from people also looking to sell”.The 9,109-sq-ft lot on West Calaveras Street, which was listed for $449,000, received dozens of calls from prospective buyers and went to a winning cash bid $100,000 above asking price, according toLAist.GoFundMe raises $250m for LA fires victims, more than for all other disasters last yearRead more“The property is being sold as land only,” the listing reads. “The home was destroyed in the recent Eaton Fire. Great opportunity to build on a generous-sized lot.”The Eaton fire, whichdestroyed more than 9,400 structures, killed at least 17 people, many of whom were reluctant to flee homes that had been in their families for generations. Nearly half of the Black households in Altadena were destroyed or majorly damaged,according to researchersat the University of California, Los Angeles. Before the fire, the Black homeownership rate in Altadena wasnearly doublethe national rate, at 81.5%.“What’s important is that homes get rebuilt,” Harris told LAist. “The worst thing would be if a third of the lots never get rebuilt at all for decades.”He added that the previous owner of the lot, who hadpaid $960,000for the two-bed, two-bath home in 2023, “didn’t want to take on the enormous project of rebuilding the home”, although he noted that others in Altadena shouldn’t feel rushed to sell.“No one should be taken advantage of, no one should panic-sell and no one should sell below market,” he said.But many in the Altadena community worry sales of properties after the Eaton fire will lead to gentrification in the historically diverse neighborhood.“Everybody wants to come back to this community. They’re pushing to not get bought out,”Jose Velazquez, whose home survived the fire, said. “Altadena is not for sale.”Donny Kincey, who lost his home in the fire, added: “I want to see what can be done to keep those homes with Black families to preserve our legacy in Altadena.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaWildfiresUS wildfiresWest CoastLos AngelesHousingnewsShareReuse this content"

We call it life.” The campaignincitedpushback from a scientist who said their research was misrepresented in the ads.During Trump’s first term, the organization also successfully pushed him to pull the US from the 2015 Paris climate treaty. Today, it regularly publishes arguments against the mandatory disclosure of climate-related financialrisksand increased efficiencyregulationson appliances.Last January, the CEI lost a lawsuit filed against it by the climate scientistDr Michael Mann for $1min punitive damages.The thinktank has extensive ties to the far-right network formed by the fossil fuel billionaire Charles Koch and his late brother David. In 2020, the network provided some$900,000to CEI, public records show – a number that is likely an underestimate, as it does not include “dark money” contributions which need not be disclosed. CEI also accepted more than$640,000from the Koch network between 1997 and 2015.Its other donors have included the nation’s top oil and gas lobbying group,American Petroleum Institute, and the fossil fuel giantExxon. The thinktank is also an associate member of ultraconservative State Policy Network, which has also received funding from Koch-linked groups and whose members have fought to pass punitive anti-pipeline protest laws.The White House and CEI were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskDonald TrumpClimate crisisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were each down by about 1% after New York opened for trading. The 10-year US treasury yield – a key barometer for US economic expectations – rose to about 4.629%.Inflation soared across much of the world three years ago, as the pandemic continued to distort the global economy and supply chains. It peaked at 9.1% in the US, its highest level in a generation.While price growth has since fallen dramatically, consumer prices have remained high –challenging perceptions of an economywhich, on paper, has proved remarkably resilient.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shortly after the data was published, he added: “BIDEN INFLATION UP!”Many economists have warned that Trump’s tariff strategy risks exacerbating inflation.As millions of Americans struggled with the cost of living last year, Trump promised to take action on the campaign trial. “Prices will come down,” hedeclaredduring one speech. “You just watch – they’ll come down, and they’ll come down fast.”Since his election victory last November, however, Trump has appeared to soften his pledge. “I’d like to bring them down,” hetold Time magazineof prices in December. “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard.”Asked by Fox News when families will be able to “feel prices going down” this weekend, the president changed the subject and claimed other countries were taking advantage of the US.Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationEconomicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the first time company executives have addressed the whole staff sinceGoogleannounced it would no longer follow hiring goals for diversity and took down its pledge not to build militarized AI. The chief legal officer, Kent Walker, said a lot had changed since Google first introduced its AI principles in 2018, which explicitly stated Google would not build AI for harmful purposes. He said it would be “good for society” for the company to be part of evolving geopolitical discussions in response to a question about why the company removed prohibitions against building AI for weapons and surveillance.Parker said that, as a federal contractor, the company has been reviewing all of its programs and initiatives in response toDonald Trump’s executive orders that direct federal agencies and contractors to dismantle DEI work. Parker’s role has also been changed from chief diversity officer to the vice-president of Googler Engagement.Google scraps diversity hiring goals and cites Trump’s DEI ordersRead more“What’s not changing is we’ve always hired the best person for the job,” she said, according to a recording of the meeting the Guardian reviewed.Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said the company had always “deeply cared” about hiring a workforce that represents the diversity of its global users but that the firm had to comply with the rules and regulations of where it operates.“Our values are enduring, but we have to comply with legal directions depending on how they evolve,” Pichai said.Pichai, who was speaking from Paris while attending an international AI summit, and other executives were responding to questions employees posted in an internal forum. Some of these questions were part of a coordinated effort among worker activist groups such as No Tech for Apartheid to force company executives to answer for the tech giant’s drastic move away from its previous core values.Employees had submitted 93 questions about the company’s decision to remove its pledge not to build AI weapons and more than 100 about Google’s announcement that it was rolling back DEI pledges, according to screenshots the Guardian reviewed. The company recently shifted to using AI to summarize similar questions employees had ahead of regularly scheduled staff meetings, which are known as TGIF.Last week, Google joined Meta and Amazon in shifting away from an emphasis on a culture of inclusivity in favor of policies molded in the image of the Trump administration. In addition to removing mentions of its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) from filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it would no longer set hiring targets for people from underrepresented backgrounds. The company also removed language from its publicly posted AI principles that stated it wouldn’t build AI for harmful purposes including weaponry and surveillance.“We are increasingly being asked to have a seat at the table in some important conversations, and I think it’s good for society that Google has a role in those conversations in areas where we do specialize – cybersecurity, or some of the work around biology, and many more,” Walker, the chief legal officer, said. “While it may be that some of the strict prohibitions that were in [the first version] of the AI principles don’t jive well with those more nuanced conversations we’re having now, it remains the case that our north star through all of this is that the benefits substantially outweigh the risks.”Google has long attempted to give the impression that it was toeing the line between its stated corporate and cultural values and chasing government and defense contracts. After employee protests in 2018, the company withdrew from the US Defense Department’s Project Maven – which used AI to analyze drone footage – and released its AI principles and values, which promised not to build AI for weapons or surveillance.In the years since, however, the company has started working with thePentagon againafter securing a $9bn Joint Warfighting Cloud Capabilitycontractalong with Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle. Google has also had active contracts toprovideAI to the Israel Defense Forces. The tech giant hadworked over timeto distance the contract, called Project Nimbus, from the military arm of the Israeli government, but the Washington Post revealed documents that showed the company not only worked with the IDF but rushed to fulfill new requests for more AI access after the 7 October attacks. It is unclear how the IDF is using Google’s AI capabilities but, as the Guardian reported, the Israeli militaryhas used AI for a number of military purposes including to help find and identify bombing targets.In a statement a Google spokesperson, Anna Kowalczyk, said the company’s work with the Israeli government was not “directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The “SVP of People Operations Fiona Cicconi communicated internally that the move to dismantle DEI programs was made to insulate government contracts from ‘risk’,” the groupwrotein a worker call to action published on Tuesday. “It is important to note that the bulk of government spending on technology services is spent through the military.”Google owner drops promise not to use AI for weaponsRead moreFor each category of question from employees, Google’s internal AI summarizes all the queries into a single query. The AI distilled the questions about the development of AI weapons to: “We recently removed a section from our AI principles page that pledged to avoid using the technology in potentially harmful applications, such as weapons and surveillance. Why did we remove this section?”While the company does not make all of the questions that were posted visible, the list gives a snapshot of some of them. Questions that employees asked included how the updated AI principles would ensure the company’s tools “are not misused for harmful purposes” and asked executives to “please talk frankly and without corp speak and legalese”.The third-most-popular question employees asked was why the AI summaries were so bad.“The AI summaries of questions on Ask are terrible.

Trump pulled back from the brink earlier this month following 11th-hour talks with Claudia Sheinbaum ofMexicoand Justin Trudeau of Canada.US officials are in talks with both countries ahead of the new deadline, 4 March, when tariffs are now due to be enforced.More than 40 Democrats in the House of Representatives, led by Jim Costa of California, urged the White House to consider housebuilding industryestimatesthat the proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, paired with duties already charged on Chinese goods, will raise the cost of imported construction materials by up to $4bn.Such increases are often “passed on to consumers, directly contributing to higher home prices and a slowdown in new construction activity, further burdening American families”, they wrote.Why Trump blinked before imposing his ‘beautiful’ tariffs on Canada and MexicoRead more“Immediate action will not only shield American families from escalating housing costs but also demonstrate leadership in steering our nation toward sustainable economic growth,” the representatives wrote to Trump. “We stand ready to work with you and other stakeholders to develop a balanced trade policy that bolsters domestic manufacturing while ensuring that safe, affordable housing remains accessible to all citizens.”The representatives – all Democrats – stressed that they were looking forward to “collaborating” with the White House “on solutions that promote robust economic growth, protect American families, and secure a vibrant housing market for the future”.Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said: “In his first administration, President Trump instituted an America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and an unleashing of American energy that resulted in historic job, wage, and investment growth with no inflation. In his second administration, President Trump will again use tariffs to level the playing field and usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for American industry and workers.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS politicsDonald TrumpDemocratsHousingUS foreign policyCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

This time, he has insisted that the tariffs would be enforced“without exceptions or exemptions”.Coca-Cola haspreviously been foundto be among the world’s most polluting brands when it comes to plastic waste, according to researchers and environmental groups. It has gradually increased the volume of its drinks sold in aluminium cans in recent years, as part of its sustainability targets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its $53bn deal to acquire oil producer Hess and gain a foothold in Guyana’s lucrative oilfield is in limbo due to a court battle with its larger rival Exxon Mobil, which has more aggressively expanded its own production.Chevron also faces industry-wide weakness in the refining business and the expectation that oil prices could be under pressure over the next two years as global production growth outpaces demand.Chevron has said it is targeting up to $3bn in cost cuts through 2026 from leveraging technology, asset sales and changing how and where work is performed.At the end of 2023, Chevron employed 40,212 people across its operations. A layoff of 20% of total employees would be about 8,000 people. Those figures exclude another roughly 5,400 employees of Chevron service stations. Shares of Chevron declined 1.3% in afternoon trading.The company told employees during an internal town hall that they can begin opting for buyouts now through April or May, according to a source familiar with the matter.The oil industry has been consolidating in recent years, focusing on mergers and operational efficiency more than drilling new wells. Chevron will reorganize its business and announce a new leadership structure in the next two weeks, the source said.“Chevron is taking action to simplify our organizational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness,” said Mark Nelson, vice-chairperson of Chevron, in a statement. “We do not take these actions lightly and will support our employees through the transition.”The company’s oil and gas reserves have declined to their lowest point in at least a decade, raising concerns about its long-term prospects and highlighting the importance of closing the Hess acquisition.Chevron moved its headquarters from San Ramon, California, to Houston last year and replaced several longstanding managers to renew its leadership.Last year, it also announced a new hub in India that will be its largest tech center outside the United States.Explore more on these topicsChevronOilExxonMobilEmploymentOil and gas companiesKazakhstanGuyananewsShareReuse this content"

The band are resume performing this year.Photograph: Yonhap Handout/EPAThe aggressive purchase of entertainment stocks has also been driven by expectations that K-pop is about to enter another boom period.BTS, whose members have been performing compulsorymilitary service, are due to resume their music careers this summer, while the girl bandBlackpinkwill start a world tour in the second half of the year.“The entertainment sector stands to gain significantly from the return of major intellectual properties like BTS and Blackpink, as well as minimal impact from US tariffs,” Shinhan Investment and Securities researcher Ji In-hae told the Korea Times.Signs of a revival in cultural ties between South Korea and China will also benefit theHallyuwaveof Korean cultural content.China was responsible for about a fifth of South Korean entertainment companies’ revenue in 2016, according to the Korea Times, but sales have stagnated since Beijing imposed restrictions on Korean cultural imports the following year.That could be about to change, thanks to a surge in the merchandise market in China and the decision last year to allow South Koreans to enter China without visas – a move that is expected to lead to more concerts and music sales.Along with film and TV dramas, cuisine and cosmetics, K-pop is one of South Korea’s most successful cultural exports, earning the country almost $900m in 2023 – an increase of more than a third on the previous year – according to the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute.Businesses in other sectors are nervous, however, about the possibility Trump will expand his tariff regime to include vehicles and semiconductors, which together account for more than 40% of South Korea’s exports to the US.South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, is to hold a meeting next week to discuss his administration’s response to Trump’s tariff on steel and aluminium, including possible countermeasures.“Uncertainty in the global trade environment is increasing,” Choi said during a meeting with ministers this week, according to the Yonhap news agency.Explore more on these topicsK-popDonald TrumpPop and rockSouth KoreanewsShareReuse this content"

Chinese retail chain’s expansion rankles Kenyan rivalsLocal business owners in Nairobi said the rapid expansion of China Square had created an uneven playing fieldCarlos Mureithiin NairobiWed 12 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 02.01 ESTShareOn a cool Friday morning in an expansive mall in Nairobi, dozens of people thronged outside a retail store covered in colourful banners, balloons and flowers.When the shutter doors finally rolled up a few hours later, fireworks were let off and music blared through speakers, the crowd now swollen to more than 100.It was the official opening of the sixth Kenyan branch ofChinaSquare, a Chinese-owned retail chain that mainly sells Chinese-made products, at Two Rivers Mall in northern Nairobi.Launched inKenyatwo years ago, the chain has grown rapidly due to strong demand for its low-priced items. “They’re bringing us really unique products and at very fair prices,” said Sheila Wangari, a 33-year-old product manager, at the Nairobi branch opening. “It’s a gamechanger.”View image in fullscreenJacob Musili said local businesses have struggled to compete with China Square’s prices.Photograph: Andrew Kasuku/The GuardianChina is Africa’s largest bilateral trading partner and a top creditor of many African countries, lending money to finance projects for itsbelt and road initiative. Private sector investment has also been rising in recent years, with funds flowing into sectors including retail.The development poses a dilemma for African governments over how to balance consumers’ love for bargains with the interests of local retailers, who said the Chinese incomers had created an uneven playing field.“They’re selling everything, and their prices are very different from ours,” said Jacob Musili, who sells hardware appliances in Nairobi. “They’re hurting us.”China Square opened its first branch in 2023 at a mall on Nairobi’s outskirts, and quickly sparked enthusiasm among shoppers. But opposition from local traders and the country’s then-trade minister, Moses Kuria, soon followed. The criticism boiled over, with traders protesting and Kuria threatening China Square managing director LeiChengwith deportation. China Square suspended its operations for a week but resumed them after talks between the Kenyan government and the local Chinese community.At the Two Rivers Mall branch opening, 26-year-old Jane Mwangi pushed her trolley between rows of shelves filled with suitcases, stopping after a few steps to check some out and consult an attendant. It was the last item she wanted to take, her trolley already stuffed with a microwave, clothes hangers, an oven mitt, a pillowcase and other products.Mwangi, a businesswoman, said she was keen to explore the new branch after she saw ads for it on TikTok. “As soon as I heard it’s at Two Rivers, I was wowed,” she said. She pointed to some eyelashes in the beauty section selling for Ksh 88 (£0.55). “I usually buy them at Ksh 200 (£1.25) in town,” she said.View image in fullscreenChina Square now has six outlets in Kenya.Photograph: Andrew Kasuku/The GuardianChina Square’s roots lie in South Africa, where the first branch was opened in 2017. The business has expanded over the years to Zambia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Mali, Senegal, Gabon and Kenya.Lei, who joined the business as a partner in 2019, said most of the products in the Kenyan operation were imported from China, but the chain also has items made in Kenya, Turkey and Egypt.He said he credited the success of the Kenyan operation to its big sales discounts, huge variety and “low” but “good” margins.Musili’s hardware appliance shop sits on Nairobi’s River Road, a hive of retailers selling everything from kitchenware to electronics. Musili, who took part in the 2023 protest against China Mall, said many of his would-be customers now chose China Square. “It’s like the Chinese have taken over our country,” he said. “We businesspeople don’t like hearing about China Square.”View image in fullscreenJohnson Munga said he worried that the growth of China Square would cause job losses.Photograph: Andrew Kasuku/The GuardianAbout 500 metres from Musili’s shop, Johnson Munga was working at Glass Craft, a 60-year-old business that sells kitchenware made in France, China and India. Aside from his concern about the loss of customers, he worried that the growth of China Square could cause job losses. “This shop has employed us. If business goes down, it means they’ll have to let go of some workers,” he said.Many Kenyan retailers of Chinese-made products have typically bought them from Kenyan wholesalers who shipped them from China, marked them up and distributed them to retailers.On the other hand, Chinese businesspeople have usually imported the items and sold them themselves directly to customers, or through middlemen within their own networks who negotiate low prices, said Eric Olander, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of the China Global South Project.Olander said Chinese retailers gave people with limited disposable income unrivalled access to a range of products. “Nobody can sell the pot cheaper than the Chinese,” he said. “The Chinese control the whole supply chain.“The people who consume it love it. The people who compete against it hate it,” he said, referring to Chinese products.View image in fullscreenLei Cheng, China Square’s managing director for East Africa, said: ‘Competition makes business healthy – and that’s a good thing for the consumers.’Photograph: Andrew Kasuku/The GuardianSome African countries have explored tax changes to address local retailers’ concerns. In reaction to concerns about competition from Chinese online sellers Shein and Temu, South Africa’s tax authoritysaid last yearit would impose VAT on imported low-value consignments.Kenyan retailers said China Square’s business model undercuts them, and that it should either operate as a wholesaler or as a retailer – not both. Lei rejected this argument.“Businesses need competition and competition makes business healthy – and that’s a good thing for the consumers,” he said at the opening of the Two Rivers Mall branch. “We are in competition. But who’s the end beneficiary? The consumers, right?”Explore more on these topicsKenyaAfricaChinaRetail industryChinese economyBelt and road initiativeInternational tradefeaturesShareReuse this content"

James Tarkowski triggered a detonator under the old place. The Everton captain volleyed in a stunning 98th-minute equaliser to ensureLiverpoolwent seven points clear in the title race rather than nine.Everton 2-2 Liverpool: Premier League – live reactionRead moreThe historical context meant as much to jubilant Evertonians as rescuing a deserved draw. Mohamed Salah’s late goal put Liverpool on the cusp of a 42nd victory at the home of their oldest rivals. Tarkowski’s even later strike, a fitting final act, kept the Goodison derby scoreline at 41-all. Bedlam ensued.There were two VAR reviews after Tarkowski lashed Tim Iroegbunam’s flick-on into the roof of Alisson’s net, one for offside and another for a push by Beto on Ibrahima Konaté. When both were cleared – the referee, Michael Oliver, might have feared for his safety had they ruled against Everton – the final whistle sounded almost immediately and Abdoulaye Doucouré celebrated in front of the Liverpool fans. Curtis Jones grabbed the Everton midfielder, sparking a huge fracas. Both were sent off for their second bookable offences of the night. Arne Slot and his assistant, Sipke Hulshoff, also received red cards for their furious protests over the decision not to penalise Beto.Premier League rules prevented Slot from holding a post-match press conference. The anger over his first Merseyside derby may not have subsided by the time he faces the media on Friday.For Moyes and Everton, however, the final scheduled game under the Goodison floodlights was a night to savour. It was a wild place before, during and after the 245th derby, from the crowds that greeted the team coach before kick-off to the delirium that followed Tarkowski’s spectacular goal.View image in fullscreenCurtis Jones clashes with Abdoulaye Doucouré after the match before both players are sent off.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersEverton fed off the energy of the crowd and made a ferocious start that never granted Liverpool a moment to settle. Best make it count. Quick thinking by Jarrad Branthwaite and slow reactions by the Liverpool defence ensured they did. Alexis Mac Allister was penalised for a foul on Iliman Ndiaye. As Liverpool players prepared for a high ball into the box, Branthwaite slipped a quick free-kick between Konaté and Conor Bradley. Beto was alert to the training‑ground routine and sprinted through to place a composed finish under Alisson.Goodison’s noise levels cranked up to 11 but after witnessing such a well-worked goal the home crowd was soon silenced by a fairly simple equaliser. Not that the timing of Mac Allister’s run into the penalty area or cute header were by any means routine.Liverpool drew level after their first spell of composed, possession play. Hence Moyes’s objective to disrupt it from the off. The visitors won a corner, taken by Andy Robertson and cleared to Doucouré, who lost possession when attempting to lead a counterattack. Mac Allister ghosted into the box unmarked. Salah found him with a delicious cross from the right and the Argentina midfielder steered a header into the bottom corner. Jordan Pickford reacted too late.Mac Allister was one of six players in the Liverpool matchday squad who would have missed the derby had it been played as planned on 7 December. Liverpool’s starting lineup was their first without an English player in the Premier League era. Five first‑half bookings confirmed the Merseyside derby still has an edge. Idrissa Gueye and Bradley were both fortunate not to receive a second yellow. Mac Allister flirted with a second yellow, too. Ndiaye left the pitch in tears having been injured following a foul from behind by Dominik Szoboszlai. The in-form Everton forward was knocked off balance by the Liverpool midfielder and jarred his knee when his foot caught the ground.As for the football, well, there was still plenty of that. Szoboszlai forced Pickford to save a low, powerful drive at full stretch in first-half stoppage time. Tarkowski did just enough to prevent Luis Díaz pouncing on the rebound.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both fell to Doucouré. Both went well wide. The first was a free header from a Gueye cross and the second a miscued shot from a Tarkowski pass.View image in fullscreenAlexis Mac Allister scores to make to 1-1.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe hosts had a penalty claim rejected when Konaté handled while tussling with Beto inside his area. VAR also confirmed the on-field decision to disallow a Branthwaite goal for offside against Jake O’Brien at a James Garner corner.Liverpool and Salah had been restricted, rarely troubling Pickford’s goal in the second half. But Salah only ever needs one moment to make his mark. Tarkowski did well to hook away a Díaz cross from the left but Jones, a fresh introduction from the bench, was quicker to the loose ball than Jake O’Brien.Jones exchanged passes with his fellow substitute Darwin Núñez and, though Branthwaite headed away the midfielder’s shot, the clearance fell perfectly for Salah at the back post. He was never going to miss the invitation. Another slice of Merseyside football history beckoned for Salah but Tarkowski ensured he would score the final derby goal at Goodison when volleying home. A final kick worthy of the grand old stadium.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I don’t get it. I don’t get why she was getting hate there,” Barkley said. “She was there supporting her significant other, and she’s made the game bigger. In football we’re all about, ‘How can we expand the game and make it more [international]?’ We’re traveling to Brazil, we’re traveling to Mexico. Apparently,we’re traveling to Australia soon. We’re trying to expand the game, and her being a part of it is only helping it. I don’t get the dislike she’s getting.”Swift grew up near Philadelphia, has been photographed in Eagles gear and was assumed to be fan before she started appearing at Chiefs games in Kansas City jerseys when she started her relationship with Kelce. That may have led to Eagles fans booing her, although others speculated some in the crowd were reacting to her support for Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.For his part, Barkley said he was delighted by the support he had received since joining the Eagles from their divisional rivals, the New York Giants, last year.“[Eagles fans] just shower you with love,” Barkley said. “And it’s been pretty cool for me and my family ‘cause kind of how things ended in New York. There was always love and support there, but things didn’t end off on a great note, I guess you could say.

But her acquittal underlines that the charges and court battle that followed were a waste of time and moneyWed 12 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 11.53 ESTShareAny woman who has been sitting in a cab and reached for the handle to find the door locked and felt their muscles instinctively tense for a split second until they hear the familiar clink of the car unlocking, even though they have been safely delivered to their requested destination, will have had an opinion onSam Kerr’s court case.Drunk or sober, when a woman gets in a taxi at night, they are keeping a close eye on the route being taken, sharing their live location, messaging friends and/or partners and sharing trip details, watching the driver. In an Uber watching the driver go off the recommended route on your phone? Watching out the window as a driver turns off the route you know makes the most sense? Logical answers flash through your mind – there must be traffic, perhaps there are road closures, maybe there’s been an accident – but they do not quell a rising fear that puts you on high alert.Sam Kerr trial: how a drunken night out revealed questions of race, power and privilegeRead moreIt’s not just in cabs either. Every woman who has walked down a street after dark has at some stage taken a longer route to stay on more populated roads, has taken a different route to stay under streetlights, has either removed their earphones or turned them off so that they can be alert to everything and everyone around them, has clasped their keys in their hand in case they need some kind of weapon.Every woman will have mentally listed the items in their bag according to how useful they could be in an emergency, will have thought about the clothes they’re wearing and what they look like that day to determine whether they might be at a higher risk, will have crossed the street when they don’t need to to check whether someone they suspect of following them does the same, will have watched their shadow to make sure no other shadows creep silently closer.These are just some of the many examples of the unspoken things women instinctively do to stay safe. There are also many examples of unspoken things people of colour and members of the LGBTQI+ community do to protect themselves at night too.I and a friend were followed home from school by three men when we were 11. We were acutely aware of it, managed to stay calm and waited until there was enough distance between us, and we had turned a corner and were out of sight before running. Each morning as a teenager, I and friends used to choose which of the two routes to school we wanted to take, one which took us down the nicknamed “Paedophile Lane” and the other down the nicknamed “Rapist Road” . I won’t go into the many examples that have followed.How often does a straight, white man consider these things? This is the question an intoxicated Kerr was attempting to ask of PC Stephen Lovell when she was sat in a police station telling him to “put your shoes in a female’s shoes. We were trapped for 20 minutes in this guy’s car.”2:37Police footage shows officer dismissing Sam Kerr claims before arrest – videoThe Chelsea player added: “You have to understand the emergency that both of us felt. Look at what happened last time when a woman accepted a police officer’s help in Clapham and got raped and killed.”Kerr and her fiancee, Kristie Mewis, said in court that they felt like they were being kidnapped by the taxi driver when he rerouted from driving them home to a police station after Kerr had “spit-vomited” out the window. He did so without telling them, they alleged.They also said that it was in fear for their lives that Mewis kicked a window out with the doors locked and the driver refusing their requests to stop. They claimed the taxi driver’s allegations of fare dodging were fabricated and that he was driving erratically. They said they had called the police themselves and had been hung up on. They questioned why, despite Mewis admitting it was her who kicked out the window, they were both charged with criminal damage. This is what preceded Kerr’s inappropriate and poorly articulated rant, which she conceded was embarrassing. “You guys are stupid and white, you guys are fucking stupid and white,” she said. “I’m looking you in the eyes, I’m looking you in the eyes, you guys are fucking stupid.”The prosecution argued that all that preceded those words was irrelevant because what she has said was there for everyone to see on video.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Start with the Metropolitan police, which was found to be institutionallyracist, misogynistic and homophobicin a report less than two years ago and has a history (including a very recent history through the murder of Sarah Everard) of failing women, seemingly ignoring two women in significant distress. They were intoxicated but that does not mean they should not have their concerns taken seriously.As Kerr and Mewis were sitting in the police station their claims were dismissed without investigation. The police did not subsequently request copies of emergency service calls, speed cameras and ANPR records were not checked, the taxi driver was taken at his word that he did not have a recording device in the vehicle and this was not checked. The taxi driver was not arrested or interviewed despite detaining the women in the taxi to drive them to the station (an action explicitly advised against in theTaxi Drivers’ Handbookwhich states: “Detaining passengers against their will in the back of a taxi over an unpaid fare, including locking the passenger in and driving to a police station, is not condoned by police and could get you in trouble.”) In addition, when the police saw a woman climbing out of a broken taxi window, they did not see the need to switch on body cams.Meanwhile, PC Lovell failed to mention any upset caused by Kerr’s “stupid and white” comments in his first statement. The Crown Prosecution Service initially decided that the evidence against Kerr did not meet the required threshold. Then, 11 months later he submitted a second statement saying he had been left “shocked, upset and humiliated”.In his closing statement, the prosecutor, Bill Emlyn Jones KC, asked the jury: “The fact you will be able to think of much worse examples of racial aggravation is irrelevant. Would we consider this a racially aggravated insult if she had said stupid and black? Of course you would, it wouldn’t even be contestable.”View image in fullscreenSam Kerr celebrates opening the scoring in Chelsea’s 2023 FA Cup final victory over Manchester United.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAExcept, that feels like a straw man argument. The likelihood of Kerr calling a black police officer “stupid and black” was and is close to zero. Had she been talking to a black male officer, who does not benefit from the same privilege as a white man, race would probably have not been brought into the equation even in a drunken rant. It’s reasonable to speculate that had a black man been in that room interviewing Kerr her concerns as a woman of colour might have been taken more seriously. And had a woman, of any race, been in the room interviewing Kerr, the likelihood is her concerns as a woman would have been taken more seriously too.What will the impact of this case be on Kerr and her very valuable image? Hopefully, not significant. People make mistakes that they may not be proud of, and Kerr certainly won’t be proud of the widely watched footage of events in the police station, but being dragged through a jury trial charged with racially aggravated harassment was an unnecessary trauma to inflict and a waste of time and money.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrMetropolitan policePoliceAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

The other eight teams will be wildcard entries.The US Open said the changes were made after the success of the “Mixed Madness” exhibition event held before last year’s tournament, which paired up a number of high-profile singles players into teams.“Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,” Italians Errani and Vavassori, who beat Taylor Townsend and Donald Young to lift last year’s mixed doubles title, said in a statement on Tuesday.“In the last few weeks we received the news that the US Open mixed doubles tournament will be completely turned upside down, cancelled and replaced with a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show.“We see it as a profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players. We don’t know at the moment if we’ll have the chance to defend our title but we hope this remains an isolated case.“The United StatesTennisAssociation said it understood the feedback from doubles players.“We acknowledge that change is difficult, however overall we believe this reimagined mixed doubles championship will elevate mixed doubles with a bigger spotlight and provide a greater opportunity to inspire more people to play and grow the sport,” it added.Poland’s Jan Zielinski, a mixed doubles winner at last year’s Australian Open and Wimbledon, said on Instagram that the decision had been taken without “any consultation with the players and based strictly on profit“.Australia’s Ellen Perez, a former world No 7 in doubles, criticised the format changes in a post on X.“Tell us that you think doubles players are trash, that tradition is overrated and job opportunity is a thing of the past without actually saying it,” she wrote.Explore more on these topicsUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

No giant schnauzer had ever won America’s most prestigious dog show in the 95 years since the breed was first entered in 1930.Monty the giant schnauzer named Westminster’s best in show – as it happenedRead moreMonty, whose official champion’s name is Hearthmore’s Wintergreen Mountain, was the last dog standing on a snowy night in midtown Manhattan after a winnowing-down process that began on Monday morning with more than 2,500 canines in over 200 breeds and varieties hailing from all 50 states and 12 other countries, including Canada, Japan and South Korea.“Winning best in show is a dream come true,” said Katie Bernardin, Monty’s handler and co-owner, who became overcome by emotion almost immediately after Nykiel’s verdict. “I won best junior handler at this dog show when I was 18 and I always used to sit up in the rafters and watch and just want to be them. All those people were my idols and then I got to be them and be down there and get to win the big ribbon.”Monty’s rise in the sport has been meteoric. He had won best in group at Westminster and reached the last seven in both 2023 and 2024, only to come up short in the final round, and entered this year’s contest as the top-ranked dog in the country based on points compiled across previous shows. The third time proved the charm as he became the first dog from the working group to win the big prize since aNewfoundland named Joshin 2004, ending a two-decade hoodoo that represented the longest active drought of any group.View image in fullscreenBourbon, a nine-year-old whippet that came out of retirement after winning reserve best in show in 2020 and 2021, was forced to settle for second yet again.Photograph: Heather Khalifa/AP“He thrives off this environment and he’s just so much fun to show in these situations,” the 39-year-old Bernardin said. “Because he just knows it’s important.”Asked what was going through her mind as she took her final lap around the green-carpeted ring before the judge’s decision, Bernardin said: “That it would probably be our last lap together. And I just wanted him to enjoy it and I wanted to enjoy it.”2025 Westminster Kennel Club dog show – in picturesRead moreBourbon, a nine-year-old whippet handled by Cheslie Pickett Smith who came out of retirement after winning reserve best in show in 2020 and 2021, was forced to settle for second yet again at the oldest continuously held sporting event in the United States after the Kentucky Derby.A total of 201 breeds and varieties were represented at this year’s show, from affenpinschers to Xoloitzcuintlis. Some had better odds of advancing than others: only one bluetick coonhound, Dandie Dinmont terrier and Belgian laekenoi apiece were entered, compared to 52 dachshunds, 44 poodles, 40 French bulldogs, 39 Chihuahuas, 38 golden retrievers, 34 Rhodesian ridgebacks and 33 Labrador retrievers.Breed judging took place during the day at the nearby Javits Convention Center, with the breed winners advancing each evening to the finals at Madison Square Garden, home to Westminster for all but 12 of its 149 years (and back after a five-year absence prompted by the coronavirus pandemic). There’s no prize money for winning, but owners of champions can demand top dollar for breeding rights.View image in fullscreenDogs and their handlers compete during Tuesday’s group judging at Madison Square Garden.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images“Monty is special,” Bernardin said. “I saw him when he was a puppy and I knew he was special. He slept on my stomach when I was pregnant. He slept under [my daughter’s] bassinet when she slept in a bassinet.“He’s just our dog. He’s just … we all love him. He’s our family dog, whether it’s me, my husband, the kids that work for us, my best friends. He gets excited when anyone comes and sees him. They go, ‘Hey, Monty,’ and Monty explodes because Monty loves his family. And I think that’s so special about Monty. Through the years, he is just so loyal to his people.”The immediate aftermath will include the traditional Wednesday media blitz, a whirlwind itinerary that includes TV appearances on the morning shows and a photo-op atop the Empire State Building, before resuming life as “just our family dog” in Chaplin, Connecticut. Asked how she thinks Monty will take to his newfound celebrity, Bernardin didn’t hesitate.“Oh, he’ll love it,” she said. “He’ll love it. It’s all about Monty. Just ask him.”Explore more on these topicsWestminster Dog ShowUS sportsDogsShareReuse this content"

The return leg next week looked ­little more than a box-ticking exercise.What happened next was as ­curious as it was intriguing. ­Daizen ­Maeda’s header affordedCeltichope to the extent that they actually ­finished as the stronger side. ­Bayern, once so vastly superior, started to rock. Vincent Kompany’s team will still be the heavy favourites to progress from this playoff but Celtic will believe they can cause a shock.Celtic 1-2 Bayern Munich: Champions League playoff round, first leg – live reactionRead moreIt was testament to the attitude of Celtic that they did not wilt against one of the favourites for the competition. Indeed, there was intelligence and bravery on show.“I think it is a really good result,” Kompany said. “The fans here don’t see many losses so we can ­appreciate the importance of victory. We are at home now and we are also pretty decent at home.” Before that ­second leg, ­Bayern have an ­important Bundesliga game against Bayer Leverkusen.Brendan Rodgers wants his Celtic players to leave Munich with “no regrets”. The manager said: “We are still right in the tie.” That much is undeniable.A series of strong home European performances – Celtic were unbeaten in six – had raised confidence levels before Bayern’s visit. Within 30 seconds, an already fevered atmosphere had been raised a further notch as Nicolas Kühn cut in from the left and unleashed a low shot past Manuel Neuer. The problem was, Adam Idah had moved into an offside position directly in front of Bayern’s veteran goalkeeper. The goal would not stand.Bayern heeded the warning. They dominated possession for the remainder of the opening period, Leroy Sané proving a particular ­menace to the Celtic defence.Michael Olise was the first to properly test Kasper Schmeichel after a one-two with Harry Kane. Schmeichel subsequently dived to bat away a teasing Kane cross. In the stands, the vociferous Bayern contingent unveiled banners that appeared to take aim at their own club for not donning their traditional red and white strip. Bayern’s away colours were on display here. Uefa had apparently deemed the writing on Bayern’s home kit to be unreadable. Strange business.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane wheels away after scoring what proved to be the winner for Bayern Munich at Celtic.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersAlso peculiar was seeing Celtic restricted so heavily on their own pitch. Bayern’s passing, movement and physicality was a joy to behold at times. Not that they created loads by way of clear cut opportu­nity in the opening 45 minutes. Schmeichel saved excellently at point-blank range from Kane but there was an ­offside in the build‑up. In ­organisational terms, Celtic had been excellent; it was just that­crossing the halfway line was a novelty.Kane should have sent Bayern in front three minutes before the break. Instead, the England captain headed into the side-netting from Olise’s corner. Just as Bayern’s lack of ruthlessness threatened to be costly, Olise opened the scoring in emphatic style. The 23-year-old lashed a terrific, left-footed shot from 16 yards high beyond the despairing Schmeichel right on half-time. Olise had earlier benefitted from the break of the ball on the angle of the penalty area. ­Bayern fully merited their lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was to atone for it, ­peeling away from the Celtic defence to meet an inswinging Joshua Kimmich corner. Kane’s volley hit the net as Schmeichel hit the turf. This was the striker’s 29th goal of the campaign. It was also his 19th against Schmeichel. With 40 minutes of the first leg still to play, the hosts had to somehow alter the sense that the tie was over.Officialdom almost gave Celtic a helping hand. There was no appeal for a foul on Arne Engels inside the Bayern penalty area and the assistant referee originally flagged for an offside. The VAR decided that Jesús Gil ­Manzano should review the matter. After what felt an interminable delay, the Spanish official decided there was no cause to award a penalty. Replays did suggest Dayot Upamecano took the ball before minimal contact with Engels. It was puzzling, in fact, that the VAR got involved at all.Schmeichel produced a fine low block from Serge Gnabry, on as a substitute, as Bayern chased a third. Neuer’s failure to meet a back‑pass allowed Maeda an opportunity, which the Japanese forward flashed across goal.Maeda made no mistake with his next chance, affording Celtic unlikely salvation in the process. An Engels corner was met by Auston Trusty and Yang Hyunjun before landing right on the head of Maeda. He converted from close range. This time, Celtic survived a VAR check for offside.Alistair Johnston stung Neuer’s palms as seven minutes of stoppage time got under way. By the time that concluded, applause filled the air. Celtic had earned their ovation.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueCelticBayern MunichEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

YES JACK. Who knows? Maybe he’s just wondering if he should have worn the quilted over-gown after all.Even Total Haaland cannot stop Manchester City’s continuing nightmare | Barney RonayRead moreBut it wasn’t hard to take a best guess at Guardiola’s thoughts on Tuesday night as he caught a first glimpse of the petty, harmless but also oddly revealing tifo banner draped across the south stand before kick-off.This was a really big night for City’s manager. There has been talk of Guardiola feeling “invigorated” bythe trip to Orientat the weekend, revived by the source‑energy of the FA Cup, the entire trip a kind of Rocky Balboa training regime, Pep out there pulling a sledge full of rocks down Leyton high street, high-fiving passersby. But Real Madrid in a knockout tie: this is home, clarity, first principles, a chance to refocus every drop of mental energy at the level that defines his professional existence.Except, suddenly someone is waving a massive pre-match internet-bantz flag mocking the opposition over a bullshit individual award via the use of Oasis lyrics (Stop Crying Your Heart Out; release date 2002; peak chart position in Spain, six). And mocking specifically Madrid’s most dangerous player, who will in a few minutes be sprinting directly into the arc of a full-back Pep knows is held together with glue and string.Pep is obsessed with details, and this is at the very least one of those, and a strange one too. As City’s season continues to narrow before the second leg in Madrid next Wednesday, welcome to Anatomy of a Tifo, and what it tells us about this most confused and confusing of super-clubs.To be clear, it really doesn’t matter in itself. This is not a big deal. It’s a big piece of material. With some words on it. No lines have been crossed. Fans can say stuff. Yes, Rodri may have been surprised to find himself up there gloating at his Spanish friends and colleagues over an award received at the time with winning humility. Hmm. About those image rights.Also yes, it makes the champions of England look small and overly fixated on someone else’s reaction to your own nice moment. Even if Real Madrid started this by behaving like deranged toddlers whenRodri received the gongahead of Vinícius Júnior. And yes it looks bad on the newly founded Stay Humble Scale when you end up collapsing like a damp sheet of newspaper andlosing 3-2 at home.But it is also just some words. Football has always been a place to shout and mock and taunt people. Pep probably didn’t even notice. The Madrid players, who have six of these golden balls in the past 12 years, won’t have cared at the time. It took Vinícius an hour to find the right angles and begin the process of torturing City’s replacement right-back. He wasn’t running on banner energy.On the other hand if the Titanic has taught us anything it is to beware of constructing powerful self-propelling metaphors of doom. The tifo is significant solely because it seems to capture a moment. And to capture also the scene of an organisation slightly losing the run of itself, and in areas that actually matter.View image in fullscreenManchester City’s failure to strengthen when it was clear the squad was growing thin has left Pep Guardiola reliant on a few very good players.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAWho authorised this banner? Generally these things are created by supporters. It is unclear at the time of writing whether the club have a sign-off on content. Either City did know and thought this was a good message, which is a bit weird. Or they just let their fans decide what message to present to the watching world, which is also odd.Even this wouldn’t really matter if City were currently a happy, functioning club, redolent with good choices from top to bottom. But in a place defined, suddenly, by defeat, bad decisions and a strain of trapped internal rage, it becomes a thing. If only because City’s problems on the pitch are a product of other bad decisions, a rare and surprising loss of focus on the detail.It might be tempting to present recent on-field collapses as a product of existential angst, era decay, systems rot. But the panic spending of the January window points to a more prosaic truth, a simple failure of recruitment over the past two years. The failure to strengthen when it was clear the squad was growing thin has left Guardiola reliant on a few very good players. The Rodri tifo could equally have been a message to City’s hierarchy. Cry now. This is what you’re missing. This is what happens when you fail to buy a back-up. City have never really let the playing culture drift. It seems like a significant oversight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe tifo also speaks to a wider energy and culture, an institution stuck fighting wider corporate wars, that has become, in the process, a little unhappy. What image of a champion club does that banner project? Paranoid, angry, obsessed with trivia? Are these good things?Defiance has been part of the character of the club in its old and new eras. For decades City were blue-collar underdogs. To present yourself, still, as outsiders, when you have spent close to £2bn in the past 10 years and reshaped the ecosystem of English football, when you’re owned by an autocratic monarchy using the club and English football as a propaganda tool; this requires a genuine degree of cognitive dissonance.Is it good for the soul to live out this illusion for too long? Victimhood and conspiracy theory have stalked some parts of the fanbase for the past few years. The atmosphere inside the stadium is in danger of reflecting it. And that strangeness, the rage, the sense of aggressive victimhood flows right from the top.There is something paradoxical about the way City and Madrid perceive themselves. Here they come, rebel emperors, railing against the injustice of commercial rules (also known as: sport) or imagined notions of bias, kings of a world they still want to tear down. Digesting the defiant club statements, the talk of bondage within a rigged system, feels a bit like hearing Prince Andrew has got himself a smash the state tattoo and is out there moaning about nepo babies.These are the two richest clubs in the world, at a time when football has never been so rich. What is it for, this angry acquisitiveness? What is it serving when you no longer win, or play beautiful football, or create an exemplary structure? City have always been a cold project to the outsider. That sense of galvanising rage is in danger of becoming their defining energy.There is also an opportunity here for some of the club’s fans to question, just a little, the aggression of their owners; the need to takedestructive legal actionagainst your own structure; the corporate line of victory at all costs, more lawyers, total commitment to the “freedom” of very rich people to control a sport. Will it be taken up?At least the flag doesn’t matter. Flags are flags. It is in the end just noise. The most worrying sign on Tuesday was the wider, amplified sense of distraction, of a place that feels for the first time as if it is slightly losing its own strict and hugely impressive sense of order.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaBallon d'OrReal MadridcommentShareReuse this content"

The Saints haven’t made the playoffs since the 2020 season – the last of Brees’ career.Their interest in Moore became increasingly evident as the club waited longer to fill its vacancy than any otherNFLteam seeking a new coach this year.White cornerback, Black QB: did Eagles grab ultimate DEI Super Bowl win?Read moreMoore was the only assistant coach on either Super Bowl team to be interviewed by New Orleans and thus the only candidate who, under league rules, could not be hired until after Sunday’s title game was played. The Saints announced their agreement with Moore on Tuesday.Their decision mirrors that of several teams that have found success after hiring relatively young offensive coaches. They included the Los Angeles Rams with Sean McVay, Green Bay with Matt LaFleur, Miami with Mike McDaniel and Minnesota with 2024 AP Coach of the Year Kevin O’Connell. All four of those coaches were hired while in their 30s.“I look forward to embracing the challenges ahead and am eager to get started,” Moore, whose formal introduction is scheduled for Thursday, said in a statement released by the club.A standout college quarterback at Boise State, Moore had a six-year career as a practice squad or reserve QB with Detroit (2012-2014) and Dallas (2015-2017). He played in just three regular-season games, all with the Cowboys in 2015.He moved into coaching in 2018 as a quarterbacks coach and was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2019. He left Dallas to join the Los Angeles Chargers in 2023 before moving to Philadelphia in 2024.While Moore tended to favor pass-heavy schemes in his early years as a coordinator, he adapted when he joined the Eagles.Recognizing Philadelphia’s strength as a running team – with its big, physical offensive line, star running back Saquon Barkley and mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts – Moore oversaw the NFL’s second-ranked ground game in 2024.The Eagles rushed for a franchise-record 3,048 yards, with Barkley gaining 2,005 of that before adding an additional 499 yards in four playoff games. And when the Chiefs limited Barkley to 57 yards rushing in the Super Bowl, Moore responded with well-timed passing plays that included touchdowns of 46 yards to DeVonta Smith and 12 yards to AJ Brown.Moore takes over an offense featuring versatile running back Alvin Kamara and receiver Chris Olave.While in New Orleans for the Super Bowl this past week, Moore discussed how he tries feature the strengths of available personnel in his play-calling.“You have certain things that you have strong feelings about from a coaching perspective – certain philosophies – but I think it’s important to do what your players do best,” Moore said. “Going from Dallas to LA to Philadelphia, we’ve certainly played three different styles, and it’s fun when you team up with people just building it however we want to.”Saints quarterback Derek Carr has two years left on his contract, but his future with the Saints is cloudy following a pair of non-playoff seasons with the club.Moore will become the Saints’ second head coach since Payton briefly retired following the 2021 season, during which New Orleans went 9-8 and narrowly missed the playoffs.That was the first of what is now four straight seasons without a playoff berth.Payton’s former defensive coordinator, Dennis Allen, took over in 2021, only to go 18-25 during two and a half seasons before being fired following a seven-game skid.Darren Rizzi, who was a special teams coordinator under both Payton and Allen, took over on an interim basis and went 3-5.He wanted to remain with the Saints and interviewed for the full-time job after this season. New Orleans also interviewed Miami Dolphins coordinator Anthony Weaver, New York Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka, Detroit defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn and Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Brady.Former Dallas and Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy also was expected to interview with New Orleans, but withdrew his candidacy on Jan. 28, just days after Brady withdrew.Eagles coach Nick Sirianni has lost a key assistant from his staff for the second time after the team reached the Super Bowl.Defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon left after the 2022 season when he was named head coach of the Arizona Cardinals. He is 12-22 in two seasons with Arizona.Offensive coordinator Shane Steichen left in the same time period when he was named head coach of the Indianapolis Colts. He is 17-17 in two seasons.Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans SaintsNFLPhiladelphia EaglesUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Thefinal $100m was paidin December and raised his share­holding to 27.7%. It is understood United’s cash reserves would have run dangerously low without that.This difficult financial position is the reason why the Glazers, the majority owners,announced a stra­tegic reviewin November 2022. A club statement at the time said: “As part of this process, the board will consider all strategic alternatives, including new investment into the club, a sale, or other transactions involving the company.”This led to Ratcliffe’s purchase of a share in United and he has driven a series of measures to bring down costs. Last summer and autumn hemade about 250 employees redundantand he is driving the plan for this round of about 200 job losses.Ratcliffe, the founder and chairman of the petrochemicals firm Ineos, understands his decisions are unpopular but feels there is a lack of awareness outside the club regarding the full picture of United’s situation.The balance sheet is severely stressed because of what some United insiders regard as years of poor financial management but Ratcliffe is optimistic that if these painful measures are taken, United will be in secure financial health in about two years.Moves to reduce costs and restructure are designed to make United strong, financially stable and able to compete again at the top of ­English and European football. The ambition is to invest in improved facilities for players and supporters.Additional cost-reducing ­measures taken by ­Ratcliffe includeending Sir Alex Ferguson’s ambassadorial roledespite the Scot being United’s most successful manager during a 26‑and‑a‑half‑year tenure. He was paid about £2m annually.Bryan Robson, Andy Cole and Denis Irwin, prominent players under Ferguson, will reportedly have their salaries as ambassadors lowered, and Jackie Kay, the head of team logistics and an employee for three decades, is set to lose her job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The system uses ­camera footage and tracking software to calculate the position of players at the moment of a potential offside, removing the need for VAR teams to manually add lines to still images. VARs may still be required to assess offside decisions in the event of a goal being scored, depending on the complexity of the assessment.Clubs voted unanimously to introduce the technology at a Premier League meeting last April, and have been frustrated by the delay. The Premier League will inform clubs of the trial at its shareholders’ meeting in London on Thursday.Scholes said last week that he had been concerned about the relia­bility of the technology until recent improvements.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such a power is commonly used by law enforcement agencies to seize documents related to an investigation.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Under existing rules, clubs are expected to give “full, complete and prompt assistance” to any Premier League inquiry, but should this fail to happen the league must resort to fines, a tribunal or the Football Association to resolve the problem.Premier League sources played down any suggestion that such powers would be the equivalent of a dawn raid. Clubs would be given notice and any intervention would be at an agreed time, they said. However, the powers the league is seeking to acquire would be stronger than those proposed for the Indepen­dent Regulator for English Football, which must, under the current drafting of the bill, request a warrant from a tribunal or court before taking action.Debate over the SCR rules has heated up before the latest Premier League shareholders’ meeting in a central London hotel on Thursday. Last week the Professional Footballers’ Association wrote to the league and its 20 clubs warning of possible legal action were the rules to be voted through at the meeting.The letter, which was first reported by PA Media, argued the union had not been given timely access to documentation and claimed the “withholding of relevant documentation per­taining to the proposals is clear evidence of [the league’s] failure to comply with its duties”. The letter also suggested the league had failed in its obligations to properly discuss the measures through the professional football negotiating and consultative committee (PFNCC), which comprises representatives of the PFA, EFL, Premier League and FA.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not 100% necessary. And you know if, if you want to drink when you leave, after you leave, you’re welcome to. But at the moment, we don’t have alcohol.”Fifa rejects request for monitoring of migrant workers’ conditions in Saudi ArabiaRead moreThe Guardian haspreviously reportedthat Fifa has decided not to press local organisers to sell beer inside stadiums during the World Cup, mindful of the embarrassing reverse that took place in 2022 when Qatari officials pushed back against beer sales at matches.There has, however, been much speculation that the Saudi state will look to roll back its even stricter laws on drinking, by perhaps allowing tourists to drink in international hotels, as they can in much of the rest of the Gulf. Prince Khalid appeared to reject that possibility in the interview, however, although he did so using the present tense.“There’s no alcohol at all,” he said when asked about hotel bars. “Rather like our weather, it’s a dry country. Everyone has their own culture, and we’re happy to accommodate people within the boundaries of our culture, but we don’t want to change our culture for someone else, OK? And I mean, really, you can’t live without a drink?”Homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia and people can be imprisoned for “promoting the vice and practice of homosexuality”. Before the QatarWorld Cup, organisers responded to questions over possible discrimination by saying “everyone is welcome” at the event, a tone reprised by Prince Khalid when asked about the subject in relation to 2034.“We will welcome everyone,” he said. “You saw that recently this was an issue in the World Cup in Qatar. There were no issues there. You know, this is a special event. It is not a Saudi event. It is a world event. And to a large extent, we will welcome to everyone who wants to come.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2034World CupSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

Scan results are understood to have confirmed Havertz is unlikely to play again this season. It has yet to be decided whether surgery is required.The latest hamstring injury in the squad represents another headache for Arteta, who expressed disappoint­ment that Arsenal did not bring in reinforcements ­during the January transfer window after long‑term injuries to Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus. They are also expected to be without Gabriel ­Martinelli for several weeks after the Brazilian injured a hamstring in the defeat by Newcastle in the Carabao Cup semi-final last week.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It leaves Arteta with only three fit senior forwards but none of Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling or Ethan Nwaneri favours a central role. Nathan Butler‑Oyedeji, a 22‑year‑old academy product yet to score a league goal after loans at Accrington and Cheltenham, could be an option. But But Arteta has hinted previously that Nwaneri, the 17‑year‑old who has scored seven goals in a brilliant breakthrough season, may be his preferred choice.“I think he can develop into a No 9,” Arteta said in December. “He has got the goal in front of him and he looks at the goal and he has a ­tremendous ability to put the ball in the back of the net.”Only last week Arteta had praised Havertz’s “robustness” and ­dismissed concerns that the 25‑year‑old may have to play every game given Arsenal’s failure to sign a striker in the January window.“Genetically, he is a powerhouse,” Arteta said. “He is so well built. He is a player that anything you ask him, he is happy to do: to run, to be very robust, to make long distances. His body absorbs everything and then he really looks after himself. We know how to manage him and we believe that when he says something it is for the right reason, not because he wants to avoid something.

Rubiales has always denied wrongdoing andsays the act was consensual.View image in fullscreenHermoso after testifying in the first session of the trial last week.Photograph: Chema Moya/EPA“It was an unwanted kiss: I believe that after the examination carried out [during the trial], there is no doubt, or at least not sufficient reasonable doubt,” the public prosecutor, Marta Durantez Gil, told the court before repeating the sentencing demands.There was no history of animosity between Hermoso and Rubiales that could have led the player to “not tell the truth about what happened at the time of the kiss”, Gil said, adding there was “total consistency between the facts she recounted and her immediate and subsequent behaviour”.Rubiales told Spain’s national court on Tuesday he was “totally sure” Hermoso consented to the kiss during the medal ceremony after the final. “She squeezed me very tightly under my armpits, she lifted me, and when I came down I asked her if I can give you a kiss, and she said: ‘OK.’ That’s what happened,” he said.Rubiales conceded he had made a mistake on the podium and that his behaviour was not appropriate, saying he should have “been in a more institutional role”, but denied any offence had been committed.Hermoso told the opening day of the trial she felt “disrespected” after a non-consensual kiss that “should not happen in any social or work setting”.The player, who plays club football for the Mexican side Tigres, has since appeared for Spain, but the scandal cast a shadow over the team’s World Cup victory.The high-profile trial, which got under way in San Fernando de Henares, near Madrid, on 3 February, is expected to wrap up on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsSpain women's football teamWomen's footballSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Five minutes of added time had been signalled.Everton’s Tarkowski thwarts Liverpool as final Goodison derby ends in brawlRead moreWhen the final whistle eventually blew after two VAR reviews, Doucouré celebrated in front of theLiverpoolfans. A furious Jones grabbed the Everton midfielder and sparked a melee between both sets of players and staff.The Liverpool head coach and his assistant were then dismissed by Oliver for protesting against the decision to allow Tarkowski’s last‑gasp equaliser to stand.Slot was unable to conduct post‑match media duties because of Premier League rules that prevent a manager who has been shown a red card from speaking. But the Liverpool captain made his feelings clear.“It was a very big provocation from one certain player,” Van Dijk said. “We all saw it and reacted as a team as we were able to do. You know what happens nowadays, it becomes one big tussle. Then it is not me who has to deal with it, it is the referee and today I am not sure he had it fully under control.”Liverpool would have gone nine points clear of second-placed Arsenal with victory and Van Dijk admitted: “To concede an equaliser that late is always disappointing.“We saw the celebrations they had in the end so we know how much it meant for them but the fact is it was disappointing for us. We kept fighting but in the end it wasn’t enough to get it over the line.”David Moyes insisted Everton deserved a point from the final Goodison derby and the post-match red cards should not detract from the togetherness shown by his team.The Everton manager said: “It was mayhem all game, a bit of an old‑fashioned throwback. The bit after the game is not really what we should be talking about. I am disappointed with Doucouré getting a red because we are short of players as it is.

Fritsche was given a two-year suspended sentence at Wuppertal district court.The trial, which began in December, heard that more than 1,500 images, videos and confidential medical records were downloaded from a computer.The sensitive data was given to Fritsche, who passed them to Tozturkan. Tozturkan told the Schumacher family he would “upload them on to the dark web” unless money was paid, the court heard.Tozturkan had denied blackmail and insisted they were offering the family a “business deal”.Before the verdict was announced, Tozturkan, who is in jail on an unrelated crime, told the court: “I’m very sorry and ashamed for what I have done. It was a very disgusting thing. I take full responsibility.”During the trial, the family expressed concerns that one hard drive containing sensitive material had not been recovered despite repeated searches of the defendants’ properties.Thilo Damm, the Schumacher family lawyer, said they planned to appeal against the “lenient sentences”.Damm added: “We do not agree with everything the court said. You can rest assured that we will exhaust all legal possibilities at our disposal.“We don’t know where the missing hard drive is … so there is the possibility of another threat through the back door.”Schumacher, 56, a seven-time Formula One world champion, has not been seen in public since a ski accident in 2013 in the French Alps where he suffered severe head injuries.He was put in an induced coma and brought home in September 2014, with his medical condition since kept private by his family.Prosecutors previously told the court the Schumacher family received an email containing samples of the stolen material from the perpetrators.The family alerted authorities in Switzerland, who traced the plot to Germany through the phone number used to contact the family.In September, German prosecutors said they were bringing charges against the three men arrested.Explore more on these topicsMichael SchumacherGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

But onthe New Heights podcasthe co-hosts with his brother, Jason, Kelce was more circumspect.“I know everybody wants to know whether I’m playing next year and right now, I’m just kicking everything down the road. I’m kicking every can I can down the road. I’m not making any crazy decisions,” Kelce said.Patrick Mahomes was chasing Super Bowl history. He left humbled and harassedRead more“I’ve been fortunate over the past five, six years, I’ve played more football than anybody. It’s because of the people that are in that building. The fact that we keep going to these AFC championships and these Super Bowls, that means I’m playing an extra three games more than everybody else in the entire league. That’s a lot of wear and tear on your body and it’s a lot of time spent in the building, focusing on your craft, focusing on the task at hand and every challenge that you set up for yourself.”Kelce is already a lock for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He is a 10-time Pro Bowler, has the most postseason receptions of anyone inNFLhistory and the most career receiving yards of any Chiefs player. His four catches for 39 yards on Sunday gave him another NFL record: the most career Super Bowl receptions, overtaking Jerry Rice, the greatest receiver of all time. However, in 2024 he had the fewest receiving yards and touchdown receptions since his rookie season in 2013, when he appeared in only one game.“As you see yourself or not feel yourself have the success you once had, it’s a tough pill to swallow,” said Kelce. “For that not to be there in the biggest moments, knowing your team’s counting on you, those are all extremely hard things … it’s just a tough reality.”Kelce has several other interests outside football not least the New Heights podcast, which earned he and Jasona $100m deal. He said that he will return if he believes he can play football to the best of his abilities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It seems unlikely, but it could happen. Born in Basildon and raised in New York since the age of three, newManchester Citysigning Christian McFarlane has already made regular appearances for the England youth teams from Under-16s to Under-18s and is very much part of the England youth national team pipeline.McFarlane developed partially in the youth academy ofNew York City FCin Major League Soccer, where he attracted interest from English Premier League clubs as well as teams in continental Europe. He chose to stay within the City Football Group, joining Manchester City in the 2025 January transfer window having just turned 18. It’s a move which further attaches him to the England setup and automatically raises his profile.Last year, while making his initial appearances with the NYC FC first team, McFarlane was featured on theGuardian’s Next Generation 2024which listed 60 of the most promising young players in world soccer.Atlanta United break MLS record to sign striker Emmanuel Latte LathRead moreNYC FC can take a lot of credit for McFarlane’s rise. TheMLSteam and the city itself have played roles in a development pathway that has taken him from youth soccer on Long Island to one of the biggest clubs in the world.“I think he’ll surprise people,” says NYC FC sporting director David Lee. “He’s been training with a senior men’s team since he was 15 and 16 years old. There are not many, even 17 or 18-year-olds, for whom that has been their daily environment. He’s been able to take every next step we’ve thrown at him and I’m sure he’ll be able to do that again with whatever his pathway looks like in Manchester.”McFarlane joined NYC FC aged 11 and in the U-12 team played every position except goalkeeper. He regularly played years above his age group when coming through the ranks, and it didn’t take long for him to become earmarked for a first-team role as a left-back, signing a homegrown professional deal aged just 14.“His ability to adapt to the level, whatever the age group, set him apart,” said NYC FC second-team coach Matt Pilkington when McFarlane’s move to Manchester was announced. “Regardless of his age, regardless of who he was training or playing with, he would adapt to the level of play.”Before making his first appearances in MLS in 2024, McFarlane played for NYC FC’s second team in MLS Next Pro – a USSF Division III-sanctioned league, and a professional environment meant to help young players get used to senior football.“I think [the creation of] Next Pro has been a really good development,” adds Lee, who has worked at NYC FC since 2014 and has witnessed McFarlane’s rise through the ranks. “I don’t think Christian would be a first-team player without the opportunities Next Pro offered. You need those minutes and those professional opportunities at the right age to be able to challenge you, and I think he got that.”McFarlane joins the likes of James Sands, Gio Reyna and Joe Scally as a former NYC FC academy player to have made the move to one of Europe’s top leagues. He’ll initially join Manchester City’s Elite Development Squad, and how much first-team action he gets remains to be seen, but the move gets him closer to the England youth setup and a pathway to a senior national team that is lacking reliable left-back options.But even if a place with the Three Lions doesn’t come to fruition, McFarlane has options: he is eligible for Jamaica as well as the United States. There would be some precedence for a switch to the latter; Another English-born US dual national left-back, Antonee Robinson, is now a standout for the United States national team and Fulham in the Premier League. For now, though, England is his home as well as his choice of national team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now you can open the door to recruit from inside MLS.“Being able to use cash for those players opens up the possibility for DP [Designated Player] investment and acquiring DPs from other MLS teams, but I also think it opens up possibilities for players within the salary cap.

Down in the chopped-and-screwed streets of Houston, Ime Udoka is rewriting his own myth, defying the Icarus curse. Aftera headline-making fall in Boston, he’s back recharged and ruthless, orchestrating a comeback with the Houston Rockets that has him leading the pack for the NBA’s coach of the year.In his first year in charge of the Boston Celtics, Udoka led the team to the 2022 NBA finals – an extraordinary achievement for a rookie head coach. But after that finals appearance,he was suspended and eventually let goafter accusations of an improper relationship with a female Celtics staff member. However, unlike Icarus, he has risen anew. In his second season with the Houston Rockets, he is rebuilding his career after what many see as significant moral failure. After three losing seasons, the Rockets are fourth in the Western Conference and looked to be headed for the postseason.Despite the controversy surrounding his departure from the Celtics, Udoka was hired by the Rockets in April 2023. This decision raised eyebrows across the league, with many questioning whether a coach tied up in allegations of ethical failure deserved another chance so quickly. But Udoka’s off-the-court issues have not been an issue in Houston. His attention has seemed to be solely on the team. Considering the reports of why he left the Celtics, it’s notable that Udoka was hired to instill leadership and accountability in a team that had hit rock bottom.Udoka inherited a talented group of swashbuckling youngsters – lottery and first-round picks brimming with talent but lacking cohesion. Fortunately, that situation plays to one of Udoka’s strengths. In Boston, he established a hierarchy the team had long struggled to define, centering Jayson Tatum as the first option. Jaylen Brown slotted into the No 2 role, where he thrived, while every other player accepted that playing defense was a prerequisite for staying in the rotation.Before Udoka’s arrival in Houston, Turkish enigma Alperen Şengün was considered a “baby Jokić”, a soft, defense-averse big man with tremendous passing and scoring ability. Udoka committed Sengun to defense, evolving him into not just a first option but a playmaking hub who makes sure everyone around him eats, too. The 22-year-old made his first All-Star Game this season, while averaging 19.0 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 4.9 assists. In Sengun’s first two seasons, his Defensive Box Plus Minus was 0.6 and 0.4. Under Udoka, he has posted 1.7 and 2.0. His Defensive Win Shares are also up, from 1.3 and 1.8 to 3.1 and 2.7.As even Udoka would admit, he’s not perfect. He’s not a strong play-caller, especially out of timeouts and at the end of games. He has struggled to find a consistent role for young phenom Cam Whitmore. And Udoka’s infatuation with small-ball lineups has raised more than a few eyebrows, especially given how often they’ve been a liability. Those “fully switchable” lineups, ones without both traditional centers Şengün and Steven Adams, have gotten cooked. It’s not a one-off thing either; the data backs it up. Since 1 December, these no-Şengün/no-Adams lineups have been hemorrhaging points to the tune of -13.0 per 100 possessions.View image in fullscreenJalen Green of the Houston Rockets speaks with Ime Udoka during a December game.Photograph: Alex Slitz/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, lineups with Adams on the floor do OK, posting a +3.8 per 100 possessions, and even Sengun, despite some struggles, is still a better bet at -12.7 than those tiny lineups. You can point to any number of games where a quarter implosion, with a ton of points given up, directly correlates with Udoka going small, like giving up 46 points in a single quarter, where the “fully switchable” lineup coughed up 1.8 points per possession in just six minutes. It isn’t working. Neither does his reluctance to put the ball in Şengün’s hands in crunch time. While there’s a hierarchy on defense, the offensive side is evolving. While it has led to late-game losses, it’s typically a work in progress, one that has to happen for a team to become a contender.Udoka’s job of turning the Rockets’ defense into a contender isn’t done. Despite a respectable 8-7 record over their last 15 games, the Rockets remain among the league’s worst regarding ball movement – raising questions about when Udoka will emphasize a more fluid offense. The numbers paint a stark picture: the Rockets rank dead last in assist percentage (30th), near the bottom in assist ratio (29th), passes made (29th), assist-to-turnover ratio (28th), potential assists (27th), and points created off assists (26th). While their talent and defense have kept them competitive, their stagnant offense suggests a pressing need for a shift toward greater playmaking and unselfishness. The team continues to struggle with ball movement, a persistent issue reflected in their declining potential assists ranking over the season. After briefly peaking at 17th in November, they have hovered near the bottom of the league, ranking 24th in February, 25th in January, 26th in December, and 28th in October.But what can’t be denied is the Rockets have an identity. One built on discipline, effort, respect, and defensive commitment. Udoka is, without a doubt, a leader of men. The biggest off-the-court issue has been idle gossip around Jalen Green’s relationship with Draya Michele, a woman 17 years his senior. None of the demons that haunted Udoka in Boston seemed to be an issue in Houston, a city that has plenty of dubious distractions if someone wants to find them.The Rockets are young, and recentNBAchampions have been anchored by stars in their mid-to-late 20s, from Tatum and Brown in Boston to Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray (26) in Denver. Meanwhile, Şengün, Green and Amen Thompson are all 22. This team is still in the early stages – talented but not yet built for a deep playoff run. For the Rockets to leap to true contender status, they need to sharpen their half-court offense and knock down more threes. Right now, they rank dead last in assisted field goals and sit near the bottom in both three-point attempts (28th) and points from beyond the arc (25th), relying too much on fast-break scoring (third in the league). Their ceiling remains limited until they develop a more fluid, efficient offense in the half-court and stretch defenses with consistent perimeter shooting. Seeing what Udoka has already done for Houston, the path forward is clear and attainable.All the pieces are there. And as he showed in Boston, Udoka gets the best out of his players – young and grizzled alike. Most importantly, Houston, one of the best basketball cities in the world, the home of Phi Slama Jama, DJ Screw, the Geto Boys, Frenchy’s, Beyoncé and two NBA championships with Hakeem Olajuwon, has got its groove back. Next time you’re in Houston, step out in the evening and you can hear the horns and choir vocals of Houston’s song, UGK’s Int’l Players Anthem: “Don’t be a lame, you know the game and how it goes, we tryin’ to get chose!”Explore more on these topicsHouston RocketsNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.After five years,Appleis back with a full revamp of the earbuds that put its Beats headphones brand on the map for athletes and sports people: the Powerbeats Pro 2.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Designed to hook on to the ear and stay put without wires, the original Powerbeats Pro werethe best earbuds for working outand were worn by sports superstars including LeBron James and Anthony Joshua.For 2025 Apple has taken all the good bits of the originals and refined the fit, slimmed down the bulk, and added noise cancelling and heart rate monitoring for £250 (€300/$250/A$400), aiming to retake the premium workout earbuds top spot.The overall shape of the earbuds has stayed the same. A flexible silicone wire hooks over the back of the user’s ear while an arm connects it to an earbud that sits in their ear. The fit is lighter but no less secure than their predecessors: comfortable for extended listening sessions on the commute while not budging at all during vigorous exercise.View image in fullscreenEach earbud has a multifunction ‘b’ button for playback and noise cancelling control, plus a volume rocker for easy adjustment during workouts.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe earbuds last about eight hours of playback with noise cancelling (10 hours without it) and charge in a good flip-top case that contains enough juice for 3.5 full charges of the earbuds. The case is 30% smaller than before but it is still quite large, fitting easily in a bag but only in a pocket at a push.The Powerbeats Pro 2 have the same H2 chip and connectivity asApple’s AirPods Pro 2, which means a seamless connection with various Apple gear, including spatial audio for movies and music, audio sharing, Siri support and lossless audio when used with anApple Vision Pro.But the earbuds also support advanced features on Android too, using the Beats app for one-touch pairing, customisation, updates and other functions, making them much more flexible than other Apple earbuds.Great Beats sound and effective noise cancellingView image in fullscreenYou can adjust noise cancelling and other bits in the iPhone Bluetooth settings or with the Android Beats app.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe H2 chip gives the Powerbeats many of the top-class features of the AirPods. That includes active noise cancelling that is almost as effective as Apple’s top buds, able to significantly reduce outside sounds and only falling slightly behind by letting a little more of higher tones break through, such as chatting or clicks.The earbuds handle wind noise well and have a best-in-class transparency mode, which is excellent while out walking or in the gym. While running it accentuates your own footsteps a little and reduced my awareness slightly compared with bone-conduction headphones, but was perfectly usable in environments such as parks and safer streets.The new Powerbeats are easily Beats’ best-sounding earbuds, producing a balanced sound with great separation of tones, well-controlled punch in the low end and plenty of detail with high notes. They do justice to pop, hip-hop and big rock tracks while remaining rounded enough for more nuanced genres such as classical or jazz. They aren’t quite as good as the AirPods Pro and have no ability to adjust how they sound, which can be a little too clean and controlled for some tracks, lacking a little energy in dance tracks, but they are far better than most workout buds.The Beats also have Apple’s personalised spatial audio system with head-tracking for immersive movie sound with Apple devices, similar to AirPods, and excellent call quality for both ends of calls.SpecificationsConnectivity:Bluetooth5.3, SBC, AAC, H2 chip, HR sensorBattery life:8 hours ANC playback (36 hours with case)Water resistance:IPX4 earbuds (sweat resistant)Earbud dimensions:45 x 41 x 24mmEarbud weight:8.7g eachCharging case dimensions:75 x 66 x 34mmCharging case weight:69gCase charging:USB-C, Qi wirelessHeart rate monitoring in your earView image in fullscreenThe optical heart rate sensor sits just inside your ear next to the silicone tip.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Powerbeats have optical heart rate sensors that can monitor your pulse through your ears similar to Sennheiser’s recent Momentum Sport earbuds. The sensors are on the part of the earbuds that touches the inside of your tragus, and in theory can match or better the accuracy of optical heart rate monitors on watches. The sensors only work when wearing both earbuds, which compare the data between your ears before sending out a reading via Bluetooth to a connected phone or device every five seconds.In testing they were similar in accuracy to aGarmin Fenix 8smartwatch and stayed in place, but an appropriate app is needed on Android or iPhone to connect to the earbuds. Neither Beats nor Apple make a workout app for them and only a small number of apps work out of the gate on an iPhone, including the popular Runna, Peloton and Nike Run Club apps, the latter of which worked seamlessly.On Android, any app that works with heart rate devices such as Bluetooth chest straps should work with the earbuds, including Strava when tested.Heart rate data is stored in the Health app on an iPhone or in the connected workout app for Android users.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe case for the Powerbeats Pro 2 is smooth and solid, charging via USB-C and Qi, but is quite large and not water resistant.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries, but they should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of their original capacity.The earbuds contain recycled plastic in some internal components. They are not repairable but Apple will offer individual replacements for lost or damaged parts. It does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.PriceThe Powerbeats Pro 2 cost£249.99(€299.95/$249.99/A$399.95).For comparison, theBeats Fit Procost£219.99, theBeats Studio Buds +cost£179.99, theBeats Solo Budscost£79.99,Apple’s AirPods Pro 2cost£229and the Sennheiser Momentum Sport cost£199.VerdictThe Powerbeats Pro 2 are an upgrade to just about every aspect of the originals, making them some of the very best premium workout earbuds available.The fit is super-secure but surprisingly light, holding themselves in place for vigorous workouts without the pinching force many similar alternatives with ear hooks require. They sound great for powering through workouts but have enough nuance to be daily earbuds for all sorts of music genres too. The effective noise cancelling helps with commutes or quietening busy roads. The very good transparency mode is miles better than most competitors, but still diminishes your awareness compared with open-ear headphones so best saved for workouts in safer spaces.Built-in heart rate monitoring in earbuds is still a novelty. The sensors worked well in my ears, but they rely on third-party apps to work, which are in short supply with an iPhone. That’s not a problem for Android users who can use Strava and most heart-rate compatible apps from the off.At £250, Beats is certainly asking a lot for a set of workout buds. But unlike many fitness rivals the Powerbeats Pro 2 are good enough to be the only earbuds you might need, particularly if you’re an iPhone user who get on with the fit of Apple’s AirPods – these are not going to fall out.The biggest disappointment is that the battery is still not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable andlosing a star.Pros:great sound, very good noise cancelling and transparency modes, very long battery life, secure and comfortable fit, excellent controls, spatial audio, great call quality, cross-platform compatibility with enhanced features for iPhone and Android.Cons:expensive, case still not very pocketable, not many compatible apps for the heart rate feature on an iPhone, no multipoint connectivity, battery can’t be replaced making them disposable.View image in fullscreenThe sensors on the underside of the earbud pause the music when you take off the Powerbeats Pro 2.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsAppleHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I saw the real cost of outsourcing digital labourSonia KgomoTech firms must invest in and respect the people who filter social media and label the data that AI relies onSonia Kgomo is an organiser with African Tech Workers Rising; she spoke at the AI Action summit this weekWed 12 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 07.15 ESTShareMark Zuckerberg might be done with factchecking, but he cannot escape the truth. The third richest man in the world announced that Meta willreplaceits independent factchecking with community notes. I went to the AI Action Summit in Paris this week to tell tech execs and policymakerswhy this is wrong.Instead of scaling back programmes that make social media and artificial intelligence more trustworthy, companies need to invest in and respect the people who filter social media and who label the data that AI relies on. I know because I used to be one of them.A mum of two young children, I was recruited from my native South Africa with the promise to join the growing tech sector in Kenya for aFacebooksubcontractor, Sama, as a content moderator. For two years, I spent up to 10 hours a day staring at child abuse, human mutilation, racist attacks and the darkest parts of the internet so you did not have to.It was not just the type of content I had to watch that gave me insomnia, anxiety and migraines, it was the quantity too. In Sama we had something called AHT, or action handling time. This was the amount of time we were given to analyse and rate a piece of content. We were being timed, and the company measured our success in seconds. We were constantly under pressure to get it right.You could not stop if you saw something traumatic. You could not stop for your mental health. You could not stop to go the bathroom. You just could not stop. We were told the client, in our case Facebook, required us to keep going.This was not the life I imagined when I moved to Nairobi. Isolated from my family, my only real community was my colleagues at Sama and other outsourcing companies. When we gathered, our conversations always circled back to the same thing: our work, and the way it was breaking us.The more we talked, the more we realised something was happening that was bigger than our personal stories. Every content moderator, data annotator and AI worker we met had the same stories: impossible quotas, profound trauma and a disregard for our wellbeing.It was not just a Sama problem. It was not just a Facebook problem. It was the way the entire tech industry operated – outsourcing the most brutal digital labour and profiting from our pain.These issues are currently the subject of a class action lawsuit in Kenya brought by 185 former content moderators against Sama and Facebook’s owner, Meta, asreported by the Guardian. When approached for comment, Sama said that as of March 2023, they were no longer involved in content moderation and no longer employ content moderators. With regards to the current litigation, the Kenyan court has requested that the parties not speak with media regarding the case, they added.I left Sama two years ago. Since then, the problems have got worse. I know this through helping data supply chain employees working for other outsourcing companies organise in Nairobi throughAfrican Tech Workers Rising. Workers are still traumatised, and the work is more intense. Content moderators are having to watch videos at 2x or 3x speed on several screens at once. The pay and conditions are not better, with wages for some data workers being as low as US$.89 (70p) an hour and content moderators getting US$2.Things cannot continue as they are, but Zuckerberg’s approach of weakening protections is the wrong course. This work needs to be professionalised. We need standards for workers such as content moderators that recognise the difficulties of the work and respect our rights. This means training and real health and safety protocols like in any other profession. This means ensuring a living wage and setting reasonable work quotas. This means creating a framework that respects our humanity and dignity. This means having a union.Meta declined to comment on the specific claims while litigation is ongoing, but said it required outsourcing firms to offer counselling and healthcare, and pay above local industry standards – and said it provided technical solutions to limit exposure to graphic materials, such as blurring and an opt-out of the autoplay function, whereby videos or pictures are played in a nonstop stream.We cannot wait for tech companies to fix this problem. African Tech Workers Rising is organising for better wages, mental health protections and professional standards in Kenya and beyond. We are doing this because AI is not magic. Behind every algorithm are thousands of hidden workers labelling, training and moderating data under precarious conditions. The labour powering AI remains invisible because many would rather focus on technological innovations rather than the supply chains sustaining them.If you believe in a safer, more ethical internet, stand with us: support our organising efforts, push policymakers to regulate big tech and demand that AI and social media companies respect all their workers. Change will not come from above – it will come from us. That is the truth.Sonia Kgomo is an organiser with African Tech Workers Rising, a project supported by UNI Global Union and the Communications Workers Union of KenyaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

[Baker] did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.”Video game performers in the SAG-AFTRA union have been on strike since July, the major issue being the use of generative AI in the games industry. The union wants members to be compensated when AI performances are generated from their work, and demands consent and transparency around Gen AI technology. Major video game publishers such as Activision Blizzard, Disney, Warner Bros and Electronic Arts are involved in the dispute, and several recent titles including Destiny 2: Heresy and Genshin Impact have been affected, with English-language voice performances missing. AI voice synthesis isbeing touted as a means of cutting costsin an industry where game budgets are spiralling, but such technologies imperil actors’ livelihoods while relying on their work to seed virtual performances. Plus, the budgetary benefits of the tech are still in question.Experienced voice actor Sarah Elmaleh, who has appeared in games such as Fortnite, Halo Infinite and Gears 5, is chairing the SAG-AFTRA committee negotiating with the game industry. She sees in Ford’s statement a key underlying message: “What I hear is Mr Ford rightly pointing out that it is both more creatively valuable and more financially viable and efficient, especially for the whole of a major performance like this, to direct a talented human than to wrestle with an AI replica and its interface. The human-to-human interface of creating games performance can already be shockingly fast, when game actor and director are talented and experienced.”Many video game developers are willing to meet the union’s demands. According to Elmaleh more than 160 video game productions have signed interim or independent agreements with AI protections in place, ensuring that voice and motion capture work cannot be used to seed synthesised AI actors without permission. But major publishers are still holding out: a representative for the companiesrecently told Polygonthat they had put forward a proposal that includes “industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games”.However, in a document sent to members, SAG-AFTRA claims that the companies are seeking a variety of loopholes, including the classification of motion capture work as “data” rather than “performance”, and limiting protections only to performance work carried out after a new deal has been ratified. “It turns out the employers would like to be able to use all past game performances, and any external material, without consent or compensation,” says Elmaleh. “That means anything else you’ve performed in, TV or film-wise, anything you’ve put on social media, any interviews, anything they can ingest that’s already out there on the internet – all of that could be fair game. This fight certainly affects all actors, no matter the category …“If we don’t right now reject the assertion that performance as a concept can be flattened and dissolved into ‘data’, then the environment will be all the richer for abuse and exploitation across the board. Can you imagine telling Charlie Chaplin he wasn’t giving a performance – that he was just [creating] film, the material he was captured on? It sounds absurd in that context, but because digital tools and language are novel and abstract and often mysterious to people, bosses will say such things with an absolutely straight face.”Ford’s intervention has at least put the spotlight on the actors who aren’t household names, but whose onscreen video game characters definitely are. “No company in their right mind would tangle with Mr Ford’s team, or the bad optics of replicating him without any consent or compensation,” says Elmaleh. “But that’s what the bargaining group is trying to get away with for workaday actors.”Explore more on these topicsGamesHarrison FordUS unionsArtificial intelligence (AI)ShareReuse this content"

My head fears Trump might like an ally controlling the key AI companyWed 12 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 08.53 ESTShareElon Musk and Sam Altman aren’t exactly the best of friends. The two had a blowout argument over the future direction ofOpenAI– the company they came together to found in 2015 – with Altman seemingly content to pursue a for-profit approach and Musk feeling that was forswearing the founding principles of the firm as well as its name. OpenAI couldn’t be open, he reckoned, if it was closed off and trying to make money rather than better humanity.So it’s no surprise that Musk, who lodged an audacious bid to take over Twitter a little more than two years ago, which ended up with his ownership of the platform now called X, has sought to put a spoiler in two years of near-untrammelled growth forOpenAI.Musk – who is currently overhauling (to his supporters; “tearing down” to his opponents) the US government to be, as he would describe it, leaner and more efficient while also devastating important programmes such asinternational aidand cutting-edgescientific research– has lodged anear $100bn bidfor OpenAI’s non-profit arm. “It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,” Musk said in a statement supplied by the lawyer shepherding his bid. “We will make sure that happens.”The attempt was rebuffed today. “No thank you but we will buy Twitter for $9.74bn if you want,”Altman responded. It is hard to believe matters will end there.To take Musk at his word, the bid is an attempt to wrest back control of OpenAI to ensure it is developing AI for the benefit of society rather than to line the pockets of investors who have pushed the firm’s valuation up tonearly $300bnin the last week. Yet that’s tricky to do, based on past precedent.What’s most likely is that Musk has seen another opportunity to be a wrecking ball against an opponent who hasbecome a sworn enemy. Musk and Altman have tussled over an on-off lawsuit about the way in which that original founding agreement for OpenAI back in 2015, when Musk bankrolled its creation, was allegedly reneged on. By putting in a bid to take over the non-profit arm, Musk may think he has managed to increase the price Altman will have to pay to roll the non-profit into a profit-making entity. For more than a decade now, Musk has seen a for-profit model for OpenAI as a bad idea, and may think the best way he can try to stop it is to highlight that OpenAI may be selling its non-profit rights on the cheap.View image in fullscreenElon Musk and Donald Trump, Washington, 19 January 2025.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersHow else to explain the bid, which is significantly less than the overall valuation of OpenAI? With Musk, there are always other options – both frivolous and potentially more serious.Musk sees himself as a troll, and the idea of lodging a bid just to make headlines and cause trouble could well be at the front of his mind. Take hisinitial bid to buy Twitter for $43bn,at $54.20 a share, which – with the inclusion of the digits 420 (a reference to a trope for smoking marijuana) – many received as a wink-wink reference to that practice.The price he’s willing to pay for OpenAI’s non-profit branch, $97.4bn, could be chosen equally carefully in jest. The best theory so far is that it’s a reference to 974 Praf, a character in Iain M Banks’Look to Windward, part of a sci-fi novel series that Musk has long loved (he has named multiple SpaceX rockets after starships that feature in the series of novels).Elon Musk-led group makes surprise bid of nearly $100bn for OpenAIRead moreThat’s the jokey theory. The more sinister one is that the bid is serious – or at least serious enough that Donald Trump might take a fancy to it. Musk has served Trump well as his right-hand man leading the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) with his suite of cost-cutting measures that have echoes of how Musk chopped Twitter to the bone immediately after his purchase was finalised. Trump clearly sees OpenAI as a national champion that ought to be cherished – he put it front and centre of his $500bn project to cement the United States’ supremacy in the AI race announced in the first week of his presidency,Stargate.Putting a trusted deputy in charge of arguably the most important AI company in the world would make sense for Trump. And making clear his preference for business deals that suit him first – and the country last – is par for the course for the man and hisArt of the Deal.My heart says the bid is nothing more than Musk attempting to cause mischief. But my head says there’s a small chance there could be a twist in the tale that results in Musk’s xAI and OpenAI merging in the future. It’s a concept that would have been inconceivable just a few months ago, but these are no ordinary times. They are extraordinary for sure, and not in a good way.Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite AppExplore more on these topicsOpenAIOpinionElon MuskSam AltmanArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

With unfair expectations, it’s the niche and left-field titles that will sufferKeza MacDonaldWed 12 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 10.02 ESTShareBack in 2013, having bought the series from Eidos, Square Enix released a reboot of the hit 1990s action game Tomb Raider starring a significantly less objectified Lara Croft. Iloved that game, despite a quasi-assault scene near the beginning that I would later come to view as a bit icky, and I wasn’t the only one – it was extremely well received, selling 3.4m copies in its first month alone. Then Square Enix came out andcalled it a disappointment.Sales did not meet the publisher’s expectations, apparently, which raises the question: whatwerethe expectations? Was it supposed to sell 5m inone month? If a book sells 10,000 copies in a week it’s considered a bestseller. Even at the height of its popularity in the 90s, no Tomb Raider game ever sold more than a few million. Square Enix’s expectations were clearly unrealistic. It wouldn’t be the last time; in a 2016 interview with Hajime Tabata, Final Fantasy XV’s director, he told me that game needed to sell 10m to succeed.Last week in an earnings call, EA’s executives had to explain a shortfall in profits. It was driven mostly by EA FC, the ubiquitous football series whose revenue was down on the previous year, but CEO Andrew Wilson also singled out the long-awaited RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which came out last October. “Dragon Age had a high-quality launch and was well reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market,” he said.Dragon Age has “reached 1.5 million players” in the months since launch, which presumably includes people paying via subscription services as well as direct sales. If 3.4m was a disappointment for Square Enix in 2013, you can only imagine that 1.5m was a disaster for EA in 2024, when games cost multiples more to make.However, as Polygon’s Maddy Myers points out ina detailed analysis of comparable games, 1.5m is more than Metaphor: ReFantazio (1m), and not much less than the second part of the Final Fantasy VII remake (2m) over comparable time periods. Dragon’s Dogma, the genre’s breakout hit last year, sold 3.3m over six months.View image in fullscreenA breakout hit … Dragon’s Dogma 2.Photograph: CapcomIn those terms, Dragon Age was certainly not a flop. I can only come to the same conclusion as Myers: EA’s expectations were unrealistic. The company was expecting an instant mega-hit from a game in a series that had sat dormant for 10 years. The Veilguard had been rebooted and reworked several times over a tortuous development period, during which time BioWare struggled enormously. Having previously made standard-setting role-playing games in Mass Effect, Dragon Age and Star Wars: The Old Republic, its only releases since 2014 were Mass Effect: Andromeda (disappointing) and mech shooter Anthem (broken). Meanwhile, a different developer hadan enormous hitwith a series that BioWare itself established: Baldur’s Gate, which sold 15m.The developers at BioWare have suffered the fallout from this. The studio is now down to a relativelybare bones staff of 100, and it seems EA will not be giving it the chance to build on what it achieved with The Veilguard. It’sa miracle that game existsat all.I’ve written a lot in this newsletter about the ridiculously high stakes of modern video game development; it’s clear that a more sustainable path needs to be forged. But in 2025 as in 2013, short-termism and unrealistic expectations on a corporate level stand in the way. That Tomb Raider reboot ended up selling more than 14m over time, more than any other game in the series. First-quarter sales cannot be used as the first and final measure of a game’s success. Nintendo’s principle of selling the same games for literally decades has meant that plenty of mid-selling titles have become million-sellers over time.There was also a point in EA’s history – indeed in most publishers’ history – where the portfolio was more important than each individual game’s profitability. The likes of EA FC and Call of Duty were the bankable successes that could fund the rest of the slate, allowing those publishers to make room for thenextsurprise success. Not every game released in a year by a given company was expected to be a mega-hit. As long as the overall slate was profitable, there was space for the critically acclaimed or fan-pleasing games that didn’t break out of their niche.The space for those games now appears to be confined to independent developers and the smaller publishers that overtly support them. Mike Laidlaw, the director of the first three Dragon Age games, left BioWare in 2017 and formed a new studio in 2020; its first game, Eternal Strands, came out last month and is picking up great word-of-mouth buzz. By all accounts it’s a banger – and its team haven’t had to labour under the expectation of instant success.What to playView image in fullscreenWhy are we waiting … While Waiting’s gameplay.Photograph: Optillusion Games/SteamWhile Waitingcame out a few days ago, an unusual game that feels like a playable version of those slice-of-life newspaper cartoons.

In our system of government, it’s up to thecourtsto determine whether the president is using his power “legitimately”, not the president.Consider Trump’s freeze on all federal spending. Article I, section 8 of the constitution gives Congress the power to appropriate money, not the president.So far, two federal judges have ordered Trump’s freeze on spending stopped, pending full hearings on the lawsuits. But Trump is ignoring these court decisions and continues to freeze funds Congress has appropriated.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, says the freeze will continue even though Trump’s office of management and budget (OMB) has withdrawn the memo implementing it.Today, federal judge John L McConnell Jr ordered theTrump administrationto comply with what he called “the plain text” of an edict he issued last month to release billions of dollars in federal grants.It’s the first time a judge has expressly declared that the Trump White House is disobeying a judicial mandate.Last week, US district judge Loren AliKhan reprimanded the OMB for disregarding a similar order:It appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without actually ceasing the challenged conduct. The court can think of few things more disingenuous.On Saturday, federal district court judge Paul A Engelmayer temporarily denied Musk’s young recruits access to the treasury’s payment and data systems, finding a risk of “irreparable harm”. The judge ordered anyone who had been granted access to the systems since 20 January to “destroy any and all copies of material downloaded” from it.Another federal judge, John Coughenour, has blocked Trump’s executive order altering birthright citizenship, calling it “clearly unconstitutional”. The judge didn’t pull any punches:It has become ever more apparent that, to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals. The rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or simply ignore, whether that be for political or personal gain.Meanwhile, in a lawsuit filed on Friday, several “sanctuary” cities and counties are challenging both Trump’s executive order withdrawing federal funds from places that refuse to help carry out his immigration agenda and his justice department’s threat to prosecute any jurisdiction that refuses to comply.Plaintiffs are seeking to “check this abuse of power” by asking the courts to declare the Trump regime’s actions unlawful and prevent their enforcement.The law is clearly on the plaintiff’s side. The supreme court has repeatedly held that the federal government cannot force cities and states to adopt laws or to enforce federal mandates.But Trump isn’t budging.Over the next months, these and dozens of other federal cases will be appealed to the supreme court – either by the plaintiffs arguing that Trump is ignoring lower-court decisions, or by Trump’s justice department appealing those decisions.Then what?You have every reason to be cynical about the current majority on the supreme court. But the cases I’ve just cited, along with many others, are based on the supreme court’s own precedents that say that Trumpcannot legally do what he’s doing.The Roberts court has shown itself willing to reverse its prior opinions (see: Roe v Wade), but my betting is that at least on some of these issues the high court will rule against Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Robert ReichFree newsletterGet Robert Reich’s latest columns delivered straight to your inboxEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAll of which raises a final, perilous question: What if the Trump regime ignores the supreme court just as it has ignored lower courts?In his 2024 year-endreporton the federal judiciary, Chief Justice John Roberts anticipated this possibility, noting that judicial independence “is undermined unless the other branches [of government] are firm in their responsibility to enforce the court’s decrees”.Roberts mentioned defiance by southern governors of the supreme court’s 1954 ruling in Brown v Board of Education. Their defiance required that federal troops enforce the supreme court’s decision.Roberts then commented on more recent defiance:Within the past few years … elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings. These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.There’s no secret whom Roberts was referring to. His first initials are JD and he ought to know better. Vance graduated Yale Law School Class of 2013, and his wife, Usha, clerked for Roberts from 2017 to 2018.Yet Vance said on a 2021 podcast: “When the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say: ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’”Here’s Vance in a February 2024interviewwith ABC’s George Stephanopoulos:Vance: “The president has to be able to run the government as he thinks he should. That’s the way the constitution works. It has been thwarted too much by the way our bureaucracy has worked over the past 15 years.”Stephanopoulos: “The constitution also says the president must abide by legitimate supreme court rulings, doesn’t it?”Vance: “The constitution says that the supreme court can make rulings, but if the supreme court – and, look, I hope that they would not do this – but if the supreme court said the president of the United States can’t fire a general, that would be an illegitimate ruling, and the president has to have Article II prerogative under the constitution to actually run the military as he sees fit.”In other words, if the US supreme court rules against Trump on an important issue, there’s a fair chance the Trump-Vance-Musk regime will thumb their nose at it.What then? Impeachment isn’t a possibility because Republicans run both chambers of Congress and haven’t exactly distinguished themselves with integrity or independence.If Trump simply ignores the high court, is that the end of law?Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

It will end in many tearsWed 12 Feb 2025 12.35 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 18.51 ESTShareYou would be forgiven for thinking we were back atthe Bullingdon Club, in the company of Jonty, Munty, Stiffy, Kipper, Chugger and, to use the polite version, Pig Botherer – only in this case it’s Big Balls and a guy with a history of racist tweeting. This is the sudden, startling emergence into American political life of a type deeply recognisable to Brits: that is, jaunty young men with juvenile nicknames and a firm belief they should be running the world.This being America, the class signifiers are slightly different from those in Britain. But in most regards, the cohort of young men hired byElon Muskfor his cost-cutting taskforce, the department of government efficiency (Doge), will be familiar to anyone who lived through the era of Boris Johnson’s weapons-grade flippancy or reports of David Cameron’s youthful hijinks. (Donald Trump is very flippant, of course, but his style skews locker room rather than debate chamber – or, in this case, maths olympiad.) And while politics has always run on young, volunteer energy, less common in the US, perhaps, is the imperial swagger, the sheer frivolous entitlement accompanying a crowd that has seemingly been given the keys to the kingdom.Let’s look at the lineup. The youngest of Musk’s Doge hires, Edward Coristine – online username, Big Balls – is a 19-year-old former intern at Neuralink, Musk’s neurotechnology company, who until recently appeared to be a first-year student at Northeastern University in Boston. Luke Farritor is a 23-year-old former SpaceX intern. Marko Elez, 25, used to work for X and SpaceX, and was revealed by the Wall Street Journal to have authored several since-removed tweets asserting, among other things, “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.” (Elez briefly resigned before Musk announced he’d reinstate him.)And Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old whoboosteda post on X by thewhite supremacistNick Fuentes, and whose newly launched Substack this week highlighted the perils of skipping freshman English 101 with a post entitled “Why DOGE: Why I gave up a seven-figure salary to save America.”Between them, these men have gained access to federal premises and staffing systems that govern agencies including USAid, the Department of Health and Human Services, the education and energy departments, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and contain sensitive information relating to millions of Americans. Elez was, reportedly, erroneously given overwriteaccess to the Treasury department’spayment system before it was yanked back to read-only.Of course, given thatDoge has not responded to questionsabout what, if any, security clearance these young men have gone through, read-only is bad enough. The head of Doge, hiring in his own image, has turned to young, male software engineers with startup energy and the conviction that if you understand coding, you understand life. They’ve established sleeping pods in spare offices at the federal agencies they have been engaged to gut or dismantle, so that while Musk goes on X to mock federal employees for not working at weekends, his mini-mes work round the clock.This feat would be more impressive if their online remarks and bios didn’t flag what might diplomatically be called large gaps in their skill-sets. Musk, a man with the emotional maturity of a cartoon bank robber, is leading a group of men most of whom have no government or management experience whatsoever, let alone expertise in fields governed by the agencies they have been tasked to reform. The whole scene is reminiscent of the 90s boom in management consultancy, during which new graduates stared with frank disbelief at anyone who was over 35 and still breathing. And sure enough,as reportedin the New York Times, young engineers have been overheard referring to federal employees as “dinosaurs”, who have in turn called the guys in baseball caps “Muskrats”.On X, meanwhile, Muskamplified a postpitching “autistic tech bros” against “non-binary Deep State theater kids”, and another that said what’s happening in the US right now is equivalent to “the yearbook committe and theater kid types getting rocked by a football team and chess club alliance”. Theatre kids and chess nerds are, traditionally, both categories of social death in high school that are targeted by queen bees and jocks, a case of Musk siding with the oppressor that’s even sadder when you consider that Trump isn’t even a real jock. (For a full account of Trump’s hilariously mediocre sports career relative to his claims about it,read Lucky Loserby Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig.)Anyway, we know how this ends. In the largest sense, with the cancellation of programmes mandated democratically in Congress by a bunch of unelected goons in puffer vests. And in the smallest sense, with one of these 22-year-old jerks spilling his Big Gulp cup of Mountain Dew over a keyboard at the Treasury and wiping the social security data of 70 million Americans. I look forward to watching as Big Balls and co find new ways to tank an economy even more efficiently and irreversibly than Brexit.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDogeOpinionElon MuskUS politicsUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

Finally, a disillusioned electorate cry: after all, two-thirds of UK voters believeLabour feels like“more of the same” compared with the previous disastrous Tory government, includingnearly halfof Labour voters. Perhaps the plan includes radical proposals to deal with Britain’s unprecedented cost of living crisis – not least given that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation projectsreal disposable incomes will fallunder Labour rule? Perhaps there’s a recognition that Britain’s crumbling public realm can never be fixed without meaningful tax hikes on the thriving well-to-do?Alas, no: the plan is “kick migrants more, just harder”. Labour has decided to lift the policies and approach of Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. It will plough up to £392m intodeporting undocumented migrants, enough money totrain more than 10,000 new nurses. The Home Office is offering migrant-bashing porn, by publishing footage of migrants being deported, and hasissued guidanceall but forbidding refugees who have taken a “dangerous route” from ever getting British citizenship, in violation of the UN refugee convention. Rhetoric is being toughened up.All of this is a panicked response to Reform UK surging in the polls. Park the moral bankruptcy of exploiting the basest prejudice of voters for political expediency. Labour is adopting a strategy that has repeatedly been proven to be disastrously counterproductive. Remember what seems like a distant universe, the coalition era? David Cameronrelentlessly pilloried immigration, stating “for too long, immigration has been too high”, blaming the failure of migrants to integrate for causing “discomfort and disjointedness” in communities.The thenLabourleader, Ed Miliband, made repeated tortured speeches about tackling immigration, rather than offering a compelling, coherent vision of how Labour would fix the country’s problems. Both succeeded in pushing up the salience of immigration, boosting Ukip, which in turn convinced Cameron of the necessity of a referendum on EU membership. That entire plebiscite revolved almost entirely around immigration, and years of poison about foreign arrivals from politicians laid the foundations for the triumph of leave. The destruction of Cameron and Miliband’s political careers had much to do with their posturing on migration rebounding.Note, too, how Rishi Sunak’s “stop the boats” campaign inevitably failed, but helped frame the national political conversation on Farage’s terms. Rather than burst theReform UKbubble, it helped deliver that party more than 4m votes in the general election.Look across the continent. In France, “centrist” president Emmanuel Macron thought he could bring Marine Le Pen’s far right to heel by raiding her policies and rhetoric. Refugees’ tents were torn down, to thecondemnation of human rights organisations. Hisinterior minister suggestedLe Pen was in fact “too soft on immigration”. But when Macron’s prime minister suggested the French felt “submerged” by immigration, that wascorrectly describedby Le Pen’s movement as evidence it had “won the ideological battle”. Le Pen and her acolytes are closer than ever to forming France’s first far-right government since Marshal Pétain.Austria’s traditional conservative People’s party became ahardline anti-migrant party, introducing aggressive preventive detention measures for asylum seekers – along with its Green coalition partners – and then making pledges to tighten asylum laws and clamp down on undocumented migrantsthe centrepiece of its election campaignlast year. The result? The far-right Freedom party – more extreme than ever – came top, with 30% of the vote, and is now set to head the government. In Germany, the shift of both government and opposition parties to embrace xenophobia culminated in the centre-right conservatives joining forces with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland toback a motionadvocating anti-migrant policies. The AfD is now second in the polls. The same story can be found in, say, the Netherlands, where the far right leads a governing coalition.Keir Starmer is in a tight spot, but a ‘Trump, baby, Trump’ strategy just won’t work | Marina HydeRead moreIndeed, which mainstream party has actually succeeded in seeing off its radical-right challengers with this approach? The reasons for its failure are straightforward. Pursuing this strategy pushes political discourse on exactly the terms desired by the hard right. Its rhetoric and policies are legitimised, but the rightwing insurgents can always outbid the mainstream and seem more authentic. Because this approach is a substitute for dealing with many of the grievances that trigger anti-migrant scapegoating – such as stagnating living standards or failing public services – the electorate is left without an inspiring alternative. If voters march to polling stations thinking about, say, immigration, rather than policies that might actually improve their lot, the anti-migrant right prospers.Data analysis has found that anti-migrant sentiment correlates most strongly not with increasing numbers of arrivals, but tabloid coverage that isnegative about immigration. That coverage, of course, is in turn fed by politicians’ statements and actions. Labour’s advisers have already illustrated their penchant for self-defeating strategies. Witness how – after Labour’s election win – Keir Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, resorted tospeeches promoting doom and gloomabout the economy. They thought this would buy public acquiescence for cuts, like the winter fuel payment, itself an example of catastrophic political rebounding.Instead, it helped suck business and consumer confidence out of the economy, helping to plunge the government into crisis. Put simply, given the absence of any clear vision for the country, Labour is floundering, its advisers offering no evidence that they know what they are doing. Bashing migrants might seem terribly clever to them, but it merely offers Farage vindication. The electorate can smell the panic, and the stench will only grow.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They include not only three Conservative prime ministers, but also his immediate predecessor asLabourleader and countless others who failed to realise how ruthless Starmer can be until – for them – it was too late.And yet, despite such salutary examples, it hasbecome fashionableonce again over recent days to portray the prime minister asa bit-part playerin his own story, or even thefigurehead of a shipbeing steered by others who mightthrow him overboardif the waters get much choppier.The reason for this has been the publication ofGet In, by Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, two serious journalists who have provided an extraordinarily detailed and sometimes bloodstained account of Labour’s transformation over the past five years, from which Starmer himself is often notably absent. Instead, the book revolves aroundMorgan McSweeney, the strategist who masterminded the party’s election landslide in July.In part, this is a function of the authors’ sources, and a genre of “inside-the-bunker” political writing which elevates the role of advisers such as Dominic Cummings above that of elected leaders who are necessarily less accessible to journalists. But even Starmer’s closest friends would also recognise this ostensibly unpolitical politician has a tendency to subcontract some of the most unpalatable aspects of a profession he entered only in middle age to people who have known little else in their lives.Starmer’s dislike of real politics is plain to see. It’s why his government has no direction | John HarrisRead moreMany of these intensely political aides and advisers instinctively cluster around McSweeney who, though not as vain or self-publicising as Cummings, has developed something akin to a cult-like status among some of them. For instance, the latest edition of my biography of Starmer describes how his admirers at party HQ began queueing outside a south London sandwich shop during the election campaign when they found out it was where their hero bought his lunch.McSweeney understands the danger of all this, not least to himself. He is particularly unhappy about quotes attributed to him comparing his boss to “an HR manager, not a leader” – or those of an unnamed adviser suggesting Starmer is merely a pretend driver sat at the front of a vehicle controlled by similarly unseen hands. The chief of staff has been at pains to point out to anyone who will listen that he only serves at the prime minister’s bidding and that this latest job is his sixth, each tailored to “different circumstances and different electorates”, for a leader whose demands of him have changed with the times.Such an analysis, however, only opens a familiar and much bigger question: if this government is not defined by the internal battles which made Labour electable, nor the campaign which won the election, for what purpose exactly was it elected?It is Starmer himself, not any backroom adviser or Labour faction, who must provide the answer. His task of building a coherent governing strategy is, of course, made more difficult by the ground shaking beneath his feet. From Donald Trump’s seismic activity on the other side of the Atlantic to the surging support here for Reform’s own rightwing populism in those “red wall” working-class seats that McSweeney had so effectively targeted during the campaign.Last week, there was some excitement when Starmer railed against the complacency of “progressive liberals” as he told cabinet colleagues they must be “the insurgents and disruptors” on behalf of working people left behind by globalisation.Some might interpret this as a sign that the government is preparing a lurch into its own kind of “Blue Labour” populism, confusing admiration for Trump’s boldness in rolling out policy with approval for content that trashes everything from net zero to the rule of law. Then, right on cue, there was a fresh wave of the orchestrated briefing Starmer loathes, this time against energy secretary Ed Miliband and the attorney general,Richard Hermer, who are among the very few in politics who the prime minister counts as friends.View image in fullscreenMorgan McSweeney in Downing Street, 10 October 2024.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockBut what was not reported from Starmer’s remarks to the cabinet last week was what he went on to say. He talked about how Britain may be the last G7 country still to have a centre-left government in the next few years and how they had a responsibility to prevent this era being “defined by rightwing populists” preaching “nonsense” about making people pay for healthcare or introducing flat-rate taxes. He emphasised the need to show “respect” to ordinary people who feel looked down upon, like his own father had been, as a necessary condition to restoring faith in the ability of progressive government to deliver real improvement in real lives.For all the focus on Brexit-backing voters, most ministers would recognise the government won’t get the economic growth it so desperately needs to achieve anything unless it does more to mitigate the deep damage done by leaving the EU. Nor, if it wants to be re-elected, can it afford to take for granted middle-class remain voters in the same way the last Labour government did with its working-class support 25 years ago.Although the government must address angerabout levels of immigration, it would be utterly counterproductive to do so by depriving British businesses and public services of skilled staff recruited from abroad. More than anything, it has to deliver on health, housing and living standards at a time when there is little money to spend and the world outside is on fire.This feels more like the authentic and necessarily nuanced voice of Starmer. Recognising the complexity and difficulty of the challenges ahead doesn’t stop the government from being “insurgent” and “disruptive”, but instead requires it to be so. His impatience for change reflects the connection he has to the real world from his own life that, unlike most of those who work for him, has mostly been spent outside politics.It is this resilient, relentlessly determined personality that now needs to become the character of the government. Starmer himself can provide the direction his government needs. And no one, whether they watch from outside Downing Street or work within it, should make the mistake of underestimating him.Tom Baldwin is the author of Keir Starmer, The BiographyExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

It was colder than I was used to, and a thick coat was one of the first items I bought. I knew no one, everyone I loved was thousands of kilometres away, somewhere sunnier and warmer.Without the promise of work, home or livelihood, I had packed up my life in coastal Sydney and moved toBirmingham– dubbed the “Venice of the north” for the canals snaking through the city and its suburbs.I soon found myself out of my depth, working a job I was not entirely qualified for, without friends to lean on and paying bills and rent for the first time in my life. When the sun started setting at half past four and the chill sapped the joy from everyone’s lives, I wondered why on earth I made this choice.In moments like those, I remembered that more than 40 years ago my dad had left on a one-way journey from his motherland,Vietnam, to come to Australia. He trekked through the Cambodian jungle, evading soldiers, to reach a refugee camp in Thailand. Meanwhile, my mum stepped on to a plane at 17 to leave her home forever. Her brother had set sail years earlier on a boat some would say was unfit for the open ocean, but he had made it thankfully intact to a safer place; he said life in Australia was good and so she followed.View image in fullscreenBertin Huynh’s father, Ve Trien Huynh.They were all strangers in a strange land. My dad told me how they once went into a supermarket just to gawk at all the things they could not afford to buy. They wore big thick jackets because these young Vietnamese men from the tropics had never experienced temperate weather. The store thought they wanted to steal.The language was by far their biggest challenge. Just as I have been stumbling on Bicester (which I swear is pronounced: Bye-chester), Beauchamp (which has to be: Boh-champ) and Ruislip (I have been told but I still don’t remember: Roos-lip? Roo-y-slip? Rus-lip?), my parents contended with mouthfuls like Sydenham (they pronounce it: See-nem-HAM), Parramatta (PAA-laa-maa-TA) and Cabramatta (Cah-lah-ma-ta).Of course, our struggles have been different in many ways – I have had an education, which my parents never got the opportunity to pursue. Because of them, I had a life with enough time and comfort to discover who I am, and to read about everything from Veronese and Van Gogh to the Romans and the Renaissance.They learned English – their fourth language – on the fly, with its tenses and conjugations, not present in Cantonese or Vietnamese. While I may still say soccer instead of football, I didn’t need my 12-year-old to read my letters and I never confused “you” and “your”.So whenever my job gave me anxiety or life was grey like a Brummie winter, I remembered my parents did a lot more with a lot less.They raised children, started a business, sold that business and bought a home. They did all of that while being told their arrival meant Australia was now being“swamped by Asians”and they should go back to where they came from.View image in fullscreenBertin Huynh’s father (left).Photograph: Supplied by Ve Trien HuynhA missed deadline seems far more surmountable next to the mountain my parents conquered. Contending with office politics or the pressure to hit your KPIs is a far cry from washing dishes in a French restaurant or cleaning industrial equipment like my dad once had to. All while the people around didn’t understand you.Resilience is perhaps the most important lesson I’ve learnt from my parents.It’s impossible to know whether their lives would have been better had they stayed in Vietnam. When I took my dad back to Vietnam on a holiday, I could see him imagine what it would have been like, as he saw the sprawling modern city Saigon has become. But what is undeniable is that their migration changed them and created a beautiful albeit tough life.As refugees, my parents lost their place in the world but, in taking a chance in a new home, they found themselves – as parents, as factory workers, as bank tellers, as Aussies.For me, moving overseas has showed me that I know what I want out of life. I’ve met colleagues I can count as friends for life and had the privilege to travel and see things that my parents only ever read about. I’ve discovered the delights of a Punjabi mixed grill at a Desi pub and gained a taste for haggis and orange chips. I’ve wandered the Palace of Versailles and imagined extravagant balls, I’ve peered up at the architectural wonders of Antoni Gaudí, I drank mead on the Holy Island of Lindisfarne, and sailed along the fabled canals of Venice.Becoming a migrant was the best thing I’ve ever done, and I was lucky to have the choice.Bertin Huynh is a multimedia journalist and producerExplore more on these topicsMigrationOpinionVietnamBirminghamcommentShareReuse this content"

The third richest man in the world announced that Meta willreplaceits independent factchecking with community notes. I went to the AI Action Summit in Paris this week to tell tech execs and policymakerswhy this is wrong.Instead of scaling back programmes that make social media and artificial intelligence more trustworthy, companies need to invest in and respect the people who filter social media and who label the data that AI relies on. I know because I used to be one of them.A mum of two young children, I was recruited from my native South Africa with the promise to join the growing tech sector in Kenya for aFacebooksubcontractor, Sama, as a content moderator. For two years, I spent up to 10 hours a day staring at child abuse, human mutilation, racist attacks and the darkest parts of the internet so you did not have to.It was not just the type of content I had to watch that gave me insomnia, anxiety and migraines, it was the quantity too. In Sama we had something called AHT, or action handling time. This was the amount of time we were given to analyse and rate a piece of content. We were being timed, and the company measured our success in seconds. We were constantly under pressure to get it right.You could not stop if you saw something traumatic. You could not stop for your mental health. You could not stop to go the bathroom. You just could not stop. We were told the client, in our case Facebook, required us to keep going.This was not the life I imagined when I moved to Nairobi. Isolated from my family, my only real community was my colleagues at Sama and other outsourcing companies. When we gathered, our conversations always circled back to the same thing: our work, and the way it was breaking us.The more we talked, the more we realised something was happening that was bigger than our personal stories. Every content moderator, data annotator and AI worker we met had the same stories: impossible quotas, profound trauma and a disregard for our wellbeing.It was not just a Sama problem. It was not just a Facebook problem. It was the way the entire tech industry operated – outsourcing the most brutal digital labour and profiting from our pain.These issues are currently the subject of a class action lawsuit in Kenya brought by 185 former content moderators against Sama and Facebook’s owner, Meta, asreported by the Guardian. When approached for comment, Sama said that as of March 2023, they were no longer involved in content moderation and no longer employ content moderators. With regards to the current litigation, the Kenyan court has requested that the parties not speak with media regarding the case, they added.I left Sama two years ago. Since then, the problems have got worse. I know this through helping data supply chain employees working for other outsourcing companies organise in Nairobi throughAfrican Tech Workers Rising. Workers are still traumatised, and the work is more intense. Content moderators are having to watch videos at 2x or 3x speed on several screens at once. The pay and conditions are not better, with wages for some data workers being as low as US$.89 (70p) an hour and content moderators getting US$2.Things cannot continue as they are, but Zuckerberg’s approach of weakening protections is the wrong course. This work needs to be professionalised. We need standards for workers such as content moderators that recognise the difficulties of the work and respect our rights. This means training and real health and safety protocols like in any other profession. This means ensuring a living wage and setting reasonable work quotas. This means creating a framework that respects our humanity and dignity. This means having a union.Meta declined to comment on the specific claims while litigation is ongoing, but said it required outsourcing firms to offer counselling and healthcare, and pay above local industry standards – and said it provided technical solutions to limit exposure to graphic materials, such as blurring and an opt-out of the autoplay function, whereby videos or pictures are played in a nonstop stream.We cannot wait for tech companies to fix this problem. African Tech Workers Rising is organising for better wages, mental health protections and professional standards in Kenya and beyond. We are doing this because AI is not magic. Behind every algorithm are thousands of hidden workers labelling, training and moderating data under precarious conditions. The labour powering AI remains invisible because many would rather focus on technological innovations rather than the supply chains sustaining them.If you believe in a safer, more ethical internet, stand with us: support our organising efforts, push policymakers to regulate big tech and demand that AI and social media companies respect all their workers. Change will not come from above – it will come from us.

Last week,at a press conference in London, the outcomes of a review of the cases by an international panel of 14 experienced clinicians, of which I am one, were released. We identified issues at the level of individuals and teams, and systemic issues within the NHS, but our conclusions were that there wasno evidence of malfeasance, and there were highly plausible causes of death or deterioration in each of the cases that either went unrecognised or were managed suboptimally. We provided examples of these likely causes of death or deterioration, and will be providing full details relating all the cases to Lucy Letby’s legal team.The implications of these diametrically opposed conclusions have left the nation with adeep sense of unease. My anxieties were first raised when I was contacted during the trial by several journalists who asked my opinion on the alleged causes of death. I was then invited by Dr Shoo Lee to jointhe international panel, and on being formally instructed received full details of all the cases. The story that emerged from reading the medical records and witness statements was hugely concerning, and quite different from that presented in court. That miscarriages of justice occur is a matter of record; think ofSally Clark,Andrew Malkinson,Hillsborough, and thefalsely convicted sub-postmasters. Could Letby be another addition to a distressing roll call, and if so, how could this have occurred? Certainly, there appear to have been a series of errors, each following on from the previous one.The Countess ofChesterneonatal unit was a level 2 service, in other words, not staffed or equipped to deal with the most seriously ill babies. Guidance about admission is usually based upon the likelihood of a baby needing intensive care, and hence the degree of prematurity or the presence of a complex condition. As the need for intensive care cannot be predicted precisely, judgment is often required when planning place of birth.However, as some of the cases involved high-risk pregnancies, it is legitimate to ask why these babies were born at the Countess of Chester when best practice would have been a transfer to a level 3 centre prior to delivery. Were discussions held between obstetric and neonatal teams about the plan for delivery, and were the parents involved in the decisions? Regardless of the answer, what transpired was that the consultants and other neonatal staff were faced with having to provide care for complex neonatal cases outside their experience. Their contemporaneous notes in the babies’ case records reveal errors in the recognition of problems and their management. However, to their credit, the Countess of Chester paediatricians were the first to draw attention to deaths that to them appeared inexplicable.In situations of unexpected or inexplicable medical occurrences, standard procedure is to conduct a detailed case review involving all of the speciality disciplines involved (obstetricians, neonatologists, nurses, radiologists, clinical chemists, surgeons, pathologists and so on), as well as independent clinicians with the requisite expertise. This was one of the recommendations of an investigation of the Countess of Chester neonatal service carried out by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in 2016. I was president of the Royal College at the time but was unaware of this recommendation or any of the findings, as the reviews are confidential and not made known to anyone outside the investigating and client teams. Several reviews did apparently take place but the depth and breadth of experience and expertise of the persons involved is unclear. Had sufficiently detailed case reviews with suitably experienced clinicians and other experts taken place at the outset, I believe it is likely that conclusions consistent with those of the independent, international panel may well have been reached.Instead, because the local paediatricians were unable to identify reasons for the deaths and deteriorations, they began,in their words, to “think the unthinkable” and the matter was referred, after considerable delay, to the police. In assembling their case, the police relied principally on the opinions of Dr Dewi Evans, a long-retired consultant paediatrician with experience of neonatology who wrote to the National Crime Agency to offer his services.In the view of our panel, he drew selective conclusions which were not consistent with the full range of evidence. (Since the press conference, Evans has said he was not selective and that he identified “several problems” in the care of the babies.) Other experts were instructed to “peer review” his opinions. They were not all asked to gothrough the cases in detail. It requires specialist knowledge to judge the experience or expertise of medical practitioners, and neither the police nor legal teams are necessarily in a position to do so. Had they taken advice or had guidance available to them on how to assess the suitability of an “expert”, it is possible that they would have sought alternative opinions that could have reached different conclusions.I don’t know if Lucy Letby’s convictions will be upheld, but I know we all have a stake in the outcome | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThe defence team inexplicably called no expert witnesses to give evidence, and although the judge wasadvised by Letby’s barristerthat the prosecution lead witness was unreliable, it was nonetheless his opinion that formed the basis of his summing up. The jury were told that the babies were mostly healthy and well and that the deaths and deteriorations were unexpected. This is not the case; the babies were either overtly unwell, or at high risk of developing complications. Further, the significance of crucial information from the medical records and postmortem examinations was not recognised. The jury therefore reached their verdict on the basis of information that was incomplete and misleading. This cannot be any basis for a fair trial.This tragic case calls for national reflection on multiple counts. How can the NHS be restored to its previous position of pre-eminence among global health systems? What institution or organisation is best placed to advise on the competency of medical experts, and will they rise to this responsibility? A court of law is no place to determine complex issues of medical causality, nor are victims or accused served well by an adversarial process.So, how can multidisciplinary expertise be convened to advise on such matters directly to the court, and not on behalf of either prosecution or defence? The parents of the babies have been through almost a decade of uncertainty, distress and grief. So too have Lucy Letby’s parents. Their daughter, a young woman, has been jailed, her life destroyed, and is now at risk of self-harm. Where does responsibility lie for the duty of care owed them? We each and every one of us wants and needs to be able to trust our legal processes, hence the possibility of a horrific miscarriage of justice should be faced with honesty and tackled quickly. A further wrong will not make a right.Neena Modi is professor of neonatal medicine at Imperial College LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

My head fears Trump might like an ally controlling the key AI companyWed 12 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 08.53 ESTShareElon Musk and Sam Altman aren’t exactly the best of friends. The two had a blowout argument over the future direction ofOpenAI– the company they came together to found in 2015 – with Altman seemingly content to pursue a for-profit approach and Musk feeling that was forswearing the founding principles of the firm as well as its name. OpenAI couldn’t be open, he reckoned, if it was closed off and trying to make money rather than better humanity.So it’s no surprise that Musk, who lodged an audacious bid to take over Twitter a little more than two years ago, which ended up with his ownership of the platform now called X, has sought to put a spoiler in two years of near-untrammelled growth forOpenAI.Musk – who is currently overhauling (to his supporters; “tearing down” to his opponents) the US government to be, as he would describe it, leaner and more efficient while also devastating important programmes such asinternational aidand cutting-edgescientific research– has lodged anear $100bn bidfor OpenAI’s non-profit arm. “It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,” Musk said in a statement supplied by the lawyer shepherding his bid. “We will make sure that happens.”The attempt was rebuffed today. “No thank you but we will buy Twitter for $9.74bn if you want,”Altman responded. It is hard to believe matters will end there.To take Musk at his word, the bid is an attempt to wrest back control of OpenAI to ensure it is developing AI for the benefit of society rather than to line the pockets of investors who have pushed the firm’s valuation up tonearly $300bnin the last week. Yet that’s tricky to do, based on past precedent.What’s most likely is that Musk has seen another opportunity to be a wrecking ball against an opponent who hasbecome a sworn enemy. Musk and Altman have tussled over an on-off lawsuit about the way in which that original founding agreement for OpenAI back in 2015, when Musk bankrolled its creation, was allegedly reneged on. By putting in a bid to take over the non-profit arm, Musk may think he has managed to increase the price Altman will have to pay to roll the non-profit into a profit-making entity. For more than a decade now, Musk has seen a for-profit model for OpenAI as a bad idea, and may think the best way he can try to stop it is to highlight that OpenAI may be selling its non-profit rights on the cheap.View image in fullscreenElon Musk and Donald Trump, Washington, 19 January 2025.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersHow else to explain the bid, which is significantly less than the overall valuation of OpenAI? With Musk, there are always other options – both frivolous and potentially more serious.Musk sees himself as a troll, and the idea of lodging a bid just to make headlines and cause trouble could well be at the front of his mind. Take hisinitial bid to buy Twitter for $43bn,at $54.20 a share, which – with the inclusion of the digits 420 (a reference to a trope for smoking marijuana) – many received as a wink-wink reference to that practice.The price he’s willing to pay for OpenAI’s non-profit branch, $97.4bn, could be chosen equally carefully in jest. The best theory so far is that it’s a reference to 974 Praf, a character in Iain M Banks’Look to Windward, part of a sci-fi novel series that Musk has long loved (he has named multiple SpaceX rockets after starships that feature in the series of novels).Elon Musk-led group makes surprise bid of nearly $100bn for OpenAIRead moreThat’s the jokey theory. The more sinister one is that the bid is serious – or at least serious enough that Donald Trump might take a fancy to it. Musk has served Trump well as his right-hand man leading the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) with his suite of cost-cutting measures that have echoes of how Musk chopped Twitter to the bone immediately after his purchase was finalised. Trump clearly sees OpenAI as a national champion that ought to be cherished – he put it front and centre of his $500bn project to cement the United States’ supremacy in the AI race announced in the first week of his presidency,Stargate.Putting a trusted deputy in charge of arguably the most important AI company in the world would make sense for Trump. And making clear his preference for business deals that suit him first – and the country last – is par for the course for the man and hisArt of the Deal.My heart says the bid is nothing more than Musk attempting to cause mischief. But my head says there’s a small chance there could be a twist in the tale that results in Musk’s xAI and OpenAI merging in the future. It’s a concept that would have been inconceivable just a few months ago, but these are no ordinary times. They are extraordinary for sure, and not in a good way.Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite AppExplore more on these topicsOpenAIOpinionElon MuskSam AltmanArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

Ten people were shot dead and many more wounded before the gunman shot himself. A week on from the atrocity in Örebro, about 125 miles west of Stockholm,Swedenis soul-searching for answers that are not easy to find.The suspect, a 35-year-old white man, was initially described by authorities as “a lone wolf”. He may or may not have had an ideological motive.But we now also know that most of those killedhad an immigrant background. And it is hard to believe that the target of this violence was not political: Campus Risbergska, where the shooting took place, is an education centre for adults, many of whom were enrolled on a language programme called “Swedish for immigrants”. The centre is a remnant of the once vast nationwide public network of well-funded institutions for continuing education and after-school programmes to help recently arrived people to assimilate.Local people describe the centre as a warm and welcoming place for people who did not always feel an immediate sense of belonging in Örebro. The young poetAya Kanbartook classes there, and after the massacre, she recalled the institution in a moving article, calling it a haven for immigrants.“These were people who had immigrated from all corners of the world, and it was so nice to witness the sense of community among them. How the language brought them together – their Swedish, still in its embryonic stage. Their desire to belong to a society that is so often described as cold and alienating.” Now, she wrote, it is a place of “bottomless sorrow”.So far, we have no evidence that the Örebro killer explicitly targeted immigrants. In the immediate aftermath, the police sent out a statement claiming that nothing pointed to this. They said everything suggested he was a non-ideological killer.This drew heavy criticism from across the political spectrum – from leftwing columnists to conservative editorial writers. It would have been more honest of the police to say they simply didn’t know, and it is hardly far-fetched for experts on mass shootings to point out that many similar events have been committed by white supremacists – even when they were erroneously described as lone wolves initially.The news channel TV4 obtained a recording, allegedly from the scene, in which a man’s voice is heard shouting: “You should be gone from Europe”, seconds before shooting starts. We don’t know whether the voice is that of the killer. What we do know is that the massacre has left many immigrant communities in Sweden feeling terrified and vulnerable.Sweden has many other schools and education centres where young immigrants still get a chance to learn Swedish. Many of these students say they are too afraid to return to class. The question must now be asked, is anyone in elected office willing to openly address migrants’ fears?In one generation, Sweden has changed into a polyglot and cosmopolitan country, as ethnically diverse as the UK. In the same four decades, roughly encompassing my lifetime, we have also seen a terrifying wave of white supremacist violence, racist mass shootings and serial killers, oftentargeting immigrants.But over the past 10 years, the ruling conservatives (the Moderate party) and the centre-left opposition have mostly avoided saying anything that might be perceived as accommodating to, let alone in defence of, migrant communities. Instead, they have gradually embraced a morecombative rhetoric, linking immigrationto crimeandgang violence. Just three days before the massacre in Örebro, the conservative prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, went on TV to explicitlyblame crime rates on migrants.The centre-left opposition, so eager to win back voters from the far right, tends to run from any opportunity to call out racism or protect migrants, in order to avoid being attacked as “naive” by nationalists. A rising star of the centre-left Social Democrats, Lawen Redar,recently braggedabout the party’s new platform not being very “woke”.Meanwhile, the rightwing nationalist Sweden Democrats tried to fit the massacre in Örebro into an existing narrative of chaos and crime enveloping the entire country, as though immigrants were somehow culpable, even when they were the victims.The governing coalition, which relies on the support of the far right, focused its immediate response on gun laws and restricting access to semi-automatic weapons.Sweden, it seems, has no vocabulary to talk about its problem with xenophobia, or the racist violence that often follows it. Instead, there is a deep bipartisan consensus that migrants are the problem, and that previous immigration policy was too generous. When Magdalena Andersson, the former Social Democrat prime minister, visited Örebro after the massacre, a woman came up to her and pleaded: “Can you please say something nice about immigrants now?” Other survivors of the attack, and relatives of the victims, have told Swedish media that they have long felt like “moving targets” in an increasingly hostile and xenophobic country.The prime minister, probably responding to public pressure,addressed the nationin a televised speech on Sunday, in which he pleaded for unity: “At the end of the day, there’s only one Sweden. Not us and them. Not young or old. Not born here or abroad. Not city or country. Not right or left.” It was a significant shift in tone but, for many foreign-born citizens, it was too little, too late.When a far-right extremist killed 77 people in Norway in 2011, 69 of whom were at a Norwegian Labour party youth camp in Utøya, many in the Swedish media quoted experts on terrorism, who confidently proclaimed that this must have been committed by Islamist extremists. One survivor, the leftwing politician Ali Esbati,now tellsthe Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that this follows a disturbing pattern, where acts committed by white supremacists are “individualised”, whereas violent acts committed by racialised minorities lead to blanket blame of the entire group.One of the cruellest aspects of racism is precisely the way in which it turns victims into perpetrators. When refugees from Syria or Sudan escape war or violent terrorism, they arrive in countries where too many associate them with the very violence that they have fled. It is as though they have to carry the burden of the perpetrator’s crimes, as well as the trauma of survival.The massacre in Örebro led to predictable calls for unity and solidarity in Sweden, but something more than that might be required. For everyone in Sweden to feel safe and harmonious, the dehumanisation of immigrants as a group must also stop.Martin Gelin writes for the Swedish newspaper Dagens NyheterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Across Europe and the US, defenders of democracy have mobilised every precedent to warn against a slide into authoritarian rule. They have underlined every rhyme and assonance in the rhetoric of today’s far-right movements to highlight echoes of past atrocity. It isn’t working.Evidence of the old virus spreading stimulates vigilance in people who are already alert for the signs, activating the immunity of people who are well vaccinated. They aren’t the ones who need convincing.Not long ago the smarter kind of nationalist felt obliged to disavow notoriously vicious expressions of their creed. Marine Le Pen’s campaign to decontaminate France’s Front National once required estrangement from her Holocaust-denying father. In 2015, Jean-Marie Le Pen was expelled from the party he founded – since renamed Rassemblement National – for claiming the Nazi occupation of France had “not been particularly inhumane”, among other offences.All was forgiven when Le Pen seniordied earlier this year. His daughter said she bitterly regretted his ostracism. The RN is the largest party in France’s fractious parliament and has a decent chance of capturing the presidency in 2027.The creeping normalisation of far-right politics cannot simply be attributed to ignorance. The number of living witnesses shrinks with the passage of time, but the story of Europe’s collapse into the abyss has been retold for subsequent generations with ample moral urgency. The wickedness of the Third Reich has hardly been neglected in the classroom or under-reported in popular culture.Germany used to be held up as a model of collective atonement – a case study in the successful application of history to invigilate political moderation. That has not thwarted the rise of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), a party with well-exposed neo-Nazi connections and a 20% share – second place – in opinion polls going into federal parliamentary elections later this month.The AfD plays artfully on the boundary between what is banned by German law and merely taboo when it comes to public representations of national socialism. One poster in last year’s regional elections depicted a young blond couple with one outstretched arm each, either side of three blue-eyed children, under the slogan “we’ll protect your children”. The party said the parents’ pose represented domestic security in the shape of a roof. It just happened also tolook like the Nazi salute.No wonder Elon Musk is a fan. The billionaire tech industrialist, no stranger to that infamous gesture, routinely boosts the AfD from his X platform. He called the party the “best hope for the future of Germany” in avideo link to an election rallylast month. He has said that “only the AfD can save Germany”, and argued that one of the party’s co-chairs, Alice Weidel, cannot possibly belong to the same political tradition as Hitler because she is in asame-sex partnershipwith someone from Sri Lanka.View image in fullscreenPeople attend a protest against the migration plans of the CDU party leader, Friedrich Merz, and the AfD in Berlin, 2 February 2025.Photograph: Christian Mang/ReutersMusk has commercial and ideological incentives to meddle in German politics. The onlyTeslaplant in Europe is in Brandenburg, just outside Berlin. The AfD is committed to low taxes and deregulation, as well as mass expulsion of migrants and rapprochement with Russia.The fit with a Trumpian worldview is natural, but that doesn’t fully explain Musk’s compulsion to boost the party. He seems especially attracted to the far right inGermanyprecisely because that is where a breach of the cultural firebreak has the most symbolic potency. Getting the AfD over the line into the German mainstream is the ultimate stress-test of historical conscience as inoculation against extreme nationalism.Release from the collective burden of 20th-century history is a significant part of the AfD’s appeal. Germans whose living standards have stagnated, whose bills have gone up and who nurture so many of the other economic and cultural grievances that drove US voters to supportDonald Trump, want to make Germany great again. And they want to be able to say so without the cringing caveat of apology for the second world war.“There is too much focus on past guilt,” Musk declaimed to his audience of AfD activists. “We need to move beyond that.” This is the ideological bridge between Old World European nationalism and the new Trumpian crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which also seek redress for historical prejudice and injustice. The common theme is a celebration of virile white folk and a morbid dread that their long run of supremacy (entirely earned by merit, of course) is being sabotaged. The instruments of its decline are mass migration and emasculation through doctrines of gender fluidity.The ambition to rewrite history and erase its inconvenient chapters is common to all revolutions. They tell the same story: all that is rotten about the present is a legacy of decadence that must be purged without mercy so the brighter new future can arise.This strain of thinking was present in Trump’s first term, but it is more pronounced and more extreme this time thanks to the prominence of Silicon Valleytech-utopian machismoin the mix. The spirit of this new era was expressed by Peter Thiel, billionaire co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, in a semi-coherent but wholly sinisterop-edpublished in the Financial Times on the eve of Trump’s second inauguration. Thiel compared Joe Biden’s administration to the ancien regimeof Louis XVI and, having hinted at various conspiracy theories ranging from Covid-19 to the Kennedy assassination, declared that “there will be no reactionary restoration of the pre-internet past”.Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, made the same point more succinctly last week when commenting onMusk’s slash-and-burn tacticsas Trump’s commissar for government efficiency. “There’s a revolution,” he said. “Some people are going to get their heads cut off.”These people are not ignorant of history. They are threatened by it, and their default solution to any threat is deletion. They control powerful levers for directing the global flow of money and information. They are not hiding their view that the past, as traditionally narrated to warn against the very thing they represent, should be recoded. And they find a receptive audience in people who also know some history and are tired of being rebuked for it; people who are happier to believe that therealenemies of freedom and democracy are the hypocrites and scolds who censure and censor them with moralising parables about their great-grandparents.That doesn’t make it any less important to teach the lessons of history. But it does suggest that the usual way of imparting those lessons has stopped working, which means – and I really want to be wrong about this – they will have to be relearned the hard way.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionThe far rightGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)Trump administrationMarine Le PenNazismcommentShareReuse this content"

As Christina Hendricks plays a Hollywood mogul, she talks about the whirlwind of fame – and what happens when it stopsWed 12 Feb 2025 11.39 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 12.55 ESTShareIt would be too much of a spoiler to reveal the dark secret at the heart of the new comedy drama Small Town, Big Story, but I can say that it’s huge, weird and unbelievable. In the six-part show,Christina Hendricksplays Wendy Patterson, a Los Angeles TV producer who is back in her small home town in Ireland to shoot a big Hollywood production. She has returned, successful and glossy, to the place where that weird experience changed her life – not least because nobody believed her and she was laughed out of town.Hendricks plays Wendy spiky and tough. “She’s got a real defence mechanism,” she says. “Something extraordinary happened to her and no one has ever believed her. She’s built up a wall, not letting people get too close, because then she’d have to reveal this big secret that, again, they are not going to believe.”For a decade, every weekend was a photoshoot, a premiere or an award showWritten and directed by Chris O’Dowd, Small Town, Big Story is a fun, eccentric show, full of misfits, beautiful Irish scenery and great characters. Paddy Considine plays Seamus, the local GP, who was Wendy’s teenage boyfriend and the only person, she thinks, who will reveal the full truth of what happened. “He’s one of those interesting actors that you see a lot in dramas,” says Hendricks, “so it’s fun to see him in this lighter, quirkier role.” She met Considine years ago, when he was about to direct a film. “He ended up not doing it, which I told him made me feel better that he didn’t cast me,” she says with a laugh.We’re talking over Zoom, Hendricks at her upstate New York home by the woods (you can follow its renovation on Instagram – all whimsical wallpaper, quirky antiques and heritage paint). There has been, she says, “a lot of nomadic living recently. I’m starting to wonder where I live.” She filmed this show in Ireland for five months, then spent five months in Scotland where she was making the Apple TV+ period romcomThe Buccaneers. Her husband, cinematographer George Bianchini, and their dog travel with her. “That makes all the difference. I have my little family unit, which makes it an adventure. If I was alone, it would be a little bit heartbreaking.” She’ll soon be back at their other house in Los Angeles.View image in fullscreenHomecoming ... as a TV executive returning to Ireland in Small Town, Big Story.Photograph: Bernard Walsh/SkyHendricks was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. In her early life, because of her father’s job in the US Forest Service, she moved around a lot. “I think it prepared me, or trained me, and gave me a respect for new places – I’m a guest, and try to fit in and contribute, rather than ruffle. Many actors will say they moved around a lot – so their job was to fit in quickly, to find friends.” By the time she was 18, Hendricks was working as a model in New York. After living in London for a while, she spent her 20s building up her acting work, before getting her big break in 2007 as confident, smart office manager Joan inMad Men, the hit period drama about advertising agencies.Did she base Wendy – who is handling the shoot by herself – on any of the Hollywood executives she has worked with? Not really, says Hendricks, although maybe in elements of her resilience. “Hollywood is still very much a boys’ club – changing hopefully more rapidly now. But Wendy has that toughness, to prove that she can take the role a man would normally have and hold her own. I’ve certainly seen that in Hollywood.”Although it’s quirky and funny, underlying the show is a serious thread about how damaging it is to not be believed. “When you are gaslit, you start doubting yourself, because it’s such an outrageous experience,” says Hendricks. “It’s a very uncomfortable thing to think about. I think it comes out in snarkiness and Wendy displaying her authority to gain strength and respect – an exhausting way to live.”In flashbacks, teenage Wendy is a goth – a look based on Hendricks’ own school years when she dyed her hair black. Red is not her natural colour, although she is now entirely committed to it. “Any time I try to change it, to go back to blond, I like it for a month or two, then I don’t feel like myself, which is the weirdest thing. I’ve always felt like a redhead.”View image in fullscreen‘An absolute whirlwind’ … with Jon Hamm in Mad Men.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyHendricks, 49, wanted to be a ballerina first. “I studied for a long time and realised I was probably never going to be good enough. It was also incredibly masochistic and brutal on your body, your mind, everything.” Discovering community theatre, she realised she could sing and dance in musicals instead, but then she became a model. Doing this, instead of going to college, was “a great disappointment to my family, mostly to my father. I felt I had to prove that I was making the right decision, that I knew what I was doing. And the only way to do that was if I was really professional and worked really hard.”Now that so many women have spoken out, that era seems rife with danger for young actors and models. “I was young and travelling alone – always had my spidey senses up,” says Hendricks. She felt lucky to have been around people who “had no other agenda but to give me good advice and help me navigate”. Moving into acting, she was again fortunate, quickly finding a part in a series: for two years in the late 1990s, she was in Beggars and Choosers, a comedy about network TV.“I didn’t have to go to as many auditions and have as many of those experiences that left me in a vulnerable place,” she says, “so in a way, I avoided some of that stuff, but I was incredibly aware of it – the comments, the power differences and all those things. It’s such a part of everyday life as a woman growing up.”When Hendricks got the Mad Men role that would change her life, she was in her early 30s. Would it have been harder to have had that sudden fame if she had been 10 years younger? “No, I would have loved it!” she says with a laugh. “I feel like my 30s were all about Mad Men. I would have loved it to have happened sooner – I would have had more opportunities.”Has anything of Joan remained in her? “I think so – a confidence I got to appreciate through Joan. Also, I saw so many women around the world speak about, and tell me, how she influenced them and gave them strength. It was the character that moved them, but hearing their stories emboldened me and made me feel more confident and proud.”View image in fullscreenScottish shoot … in The Buccaneers.Photograph: Angus Pigott/Apple TV+Still, it felt strange to become so recognised. “No one teaches you how to be famous,” says Hendricks. “No one tells you how to be or act or answer questions, or how to not fall on your face. You just have to learn how to stay above water. And then no one teaches you how to not be famous after you were famous. There’s a lot of ebb and flow. You really have to ride that river, because it’s ever-changing and you can’t count on anything.”During the Mad Men years, things were definitely in full flow: “There was a decade where every weekend was a photoshoot, a premiere or an award show. It was an absolute whirlwind. And then the show stops, and all that stops, and you adjust to your new and different life. Sometimes you feel blindsided, sometimes you miss certain things and sometimes you’re relieved.”These days, the people who approach her are just as likely to talk about Good Girls, the comedy series in which Hendricks plays one of three mums turned criminals. Are we now beyond wondering if there are enough interesting roles for women in their 40s and beyond? “There’s so many wonderful roles these days,” she says, “and more and more developing.”Mad Men allowed Hendricks to break out of the “cute” roles she had often been lumped with. “I think there was a ‘sweetness’ to me,” she says. “People didn’t think I had this strength, so that opened up for me. And what Good Girls did is get me a lot of comedic roles.” She is sure that’s how she landed Wendy in Small Town, Big Story, a part she now says she was craving. “It was just my weird cup of tea.”Small Town, Big Story is on Sky Atlantic/Now from 27 February.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionChristina HendricksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was looking for a mink that had been killing his eider ducks. This image opened doors for him, leading to advert and movie work’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 12 Feb 2025 10.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 10.34 ESTShareIfirst met Guðjón Þorsteinsson through my work as a photographer for the Icelandic daily newspaper Morgunblaðið. He and his older brother, Óskar, ran a farm above the peninsula of Dyrhólaey, a couple of hours’ drive from Reykjavík. A raging storm had broken lots of power lines so the farm had no electricity. I’d heard the brothers were having to milk their cows by hand and thought I might be able to get a good picture for the paper.When Guðjón opened the door, he just said: “What do you want?” He wasn’t very friendly, though I sensed this was an act. He invited me in for coffee and I ended up getting the shots I wanted, but after they ran in the paper, someone complained that the cows looked dirty and they were taken away. Feeling it was my fault, I went back to the farm to apologise. Guðjón said: “I’m glad – I didn’t want to milk them anyway.”We became friends, and I would always stop if I was travelling past his home. On the day this was taken, in 1995, we were walking on the black volcanic beach below the farm with Guðjón’s dog, Gái. Guðjón was looking for a mink that had been killing his eider ducks. There was a moody atmosphere, it was windy and there was salty spray flying everywhere. Dyrhólaey has ahuge rock archthat you can see in the background here. I had a plane and had once flown through that hole in the cliff with a friend. Óskar wasn’t impressed by that – he said we’d encourage others to try to do the same and they’d kill themselves.He could not believe how much he got paid for acting. He called me and said: 'I have some money for you'When I looked at Guðjón, it was like seeing a whole nation in one face, right back to the Vikings. He was kind of angry that day, concentrating on finding the mink, and I was able to photograph him off guard, which is what I’d wanted. This moment just happened. He was distracted and being completely himself. I saw the shot and managed to catch the waves in the background hitting the rocks.The photograph kind of breaks the rules of framing, but it works. It was a turning point in my career. Until I took it, I felt a little like Robinson Crusoe stuck on my island. I’d try to interest editors and publishers in my work outside Iceland and they didn’t want to know. But even now, whenever I have exhibitions, curators want to include farmer Guðjón. I carried on visiting him until his death in 2006, when he was 81. I still took photos but not many, because I felt I had already captured him. I often talk about this picture in terms of songs: this was my Yesterday, and I wasn’t going to top Yesterday. I wanted to move on to my Let It Be, my Hey Jude and my Here Comes the Sun.The image opened doors for Guðjón, too. Once his face became known, he was hired for some advertisements and as an actor in a couple of movies. After doing one of them, he called me and said: “I have money for you.” He couldn’t believe how much they’d paid him. I told him: “It’s your money, not mine.” He was very happy about it, because by that stage his brother had died and he’d been living alone for a while, so he was kind of lonely and glad to have something to do. They’d made a great double-act, those brothers. Sometimes I went there just to listen to them argue. It was so much fun: they were likethe two old guys in the balcony seatson The Muppet Show.I worked for the Morgunblaðið for 44 years and only left in 2020, to concentrate fully on documenting people in the Arctic regions and the effect the climate crisis is having on their ways of life. I’ve been visiting these places for decades and photographed generations of families. As with Guðjón, I find the best pictures happen when I’ve become so familiar that these friends of mine forget what I’m doing. Then I can photograph them like I’m not really there.Ragnar Axelsson’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn:Iceland, 1958.Trained:Morgunblaðið newspaperInfluences:“W Eugene Smith,Mary Ellen Mark, Henri Cartier-Bresson,Don McCullin, the Beatles, Caravaggio, Rembrandt.”Low point:“I don’t think about things that didn’t go well in the past, that is not where I am going.”Top tip:“Follow your instincts, do your own thing, believe in your dreams.”Ragnar Axelsson’s Behind Mountains is available for pre-order fromQerndu Gallery & Publishing.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyIcelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Could it be to show how vastly superior the Courtauld’s own works are?Jonathan JonesWed 12 Feb 2025 12.51 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 12.53 ESTShareThe bland title of this show reads a bit like a confession, in terms of how little it has to say. Goya to Impressionism – so? Why do we need to see the troubled Spanish painter of war and witchcraft juxtaposed with soft scenes by Renoir and Sisley? No reason, except they all belong to a collection whose home in Winterthur, Switzerland, is closed for renovation, meaning the Courtauld can borrow them as a job lot. The trouble is that the Oskar Reinhart Collection is too similar to the Courtauld’s own to be an overly exciting proposition.Both hoards were gathered in the early-20th century by wealthy private collectors with a penchant for French art of the late 1800s, yet by and large Samuel Courtauld got the best stuff. Reinhart’s Manets are minor compared with the dazzling masterpieces owned by the Courtauld. This is also true of Renoir. The Courtauld owns La Loge, Renoir’s scintillating early painting of modern love, but Reinhart’s row of soppy, second-rate Renoirs live down to every stereotype of this big impressionist softy.View image in fullscreenArtistic despair … A Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Rank, Théodore Géricault, c1819-22In fact, it’s almost possible to believe the whole exhibition is a sly way for the Courtauld to swank about the superior class of its own treasures. But you can’t just throw some unconnected paintings together with no theme, argument or narrative and expect it to thrill.The problems start with the single Goya at the start, but not because it is weak. The work is so drop-dead brilliant it brings all the other “masterpieces” here into question. What is art for? What is the point of it? You feel Goya asking himself these uneasy questions, as he paints Still Life With Three Salmon Steaks. The thick cuts of salmon touch each other on a grey tablecloth, their pink interiors turned upward with holes where the vertebrae were, and silver and black scales on their sides. The spine-holes are sinister, like eye-holes in a skull. Deep red blood drips out of one steak in a gory stain on the cloth. The colour of salmon flesh seems reminiscent of pink human bodies. It’s like I’m seeing my own mortality on a tabletop.View image in fullscreenA labour of looking … Still Life with Faience Jug and Fruit, Paul Cézanne, c1900It’s a stunning, dislocating work that makes you wonder why the other revered paintings here don’t worry away at existence in the same unguardedly honest way that Goya’s does. Why, I found myself asking, has Cézanne bothered arranging all those apples and peaches on a tabletop when he doesn’t seem to see any meaning in them? Are they just food for his formal preoccupations? Yet, Cézanne’s Still Life With Faience Jug and Fruit is a revolutionary masterpiece of modernism dating from circa 1900. Nevertheless, here it seems complacent and makes the labour of looking at it dutiful. It is partly Goya’s baleful despair infecting your eyesight, showing up the lack of metaphysics in all these lovely French paintings. With their dedication solely to the visual, they are strikingly devoid of human stress.But wait – here’s a fierce painting of a massive wave, a wall of blue water heading straight for you, before curling into explosive white foam near the shore. It’s byGustave Courbet, who seems to be looking at his own fate in that merciless sea. And Géricault, who depicted a social world going insane on the open seas in The Raft of the Medusa, here concentrates on a single patient in a mental hospital: his portrait, A Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Rank, gives this suffering soul a sad dignity yet also makes you feel the artist’s terror of losing his own grip on reality. These earlier 19th-century paintings are extraordinary and, in fact, the Reinhart Collection has plenty more pre-modernist art that could have been loaned, including masterpieces by Bruegel and Cranach. So it seems a cheap choice to focus on impressionism.View image in fullscreenMini-me … The Clowness Cha-U-Kao, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1895Van Gogh is also among the ill in two paintings here, both done in hospital. The Ward in the Hospital at Arles is a compassionate scene of patients gathered round a stove: he looks at them with love and sympathy, forgetting his own troubled condition. But again, the Courtauld seems to be merely mirroring its own collection in a narcissistic way, for of course it owns Van Gogh’s most sensational depiction of his despair, Self-Portrait With Bandaged Ear.This treatment of Oskar Reinhart’s collection as the Courtauld’s mini-me is even more pointed in the caption for Toulouse-Lautrec’s The Clown Cha-U-Kao, which points out that in the background you can see the distinctive profile of the dancer Jane Avril, who, we are reminded, appears in its own greatest work by this artist. Indeed she does and, needless to say, the Courtauld’s painting is better.The final painting is Picasso’s blue-tinged portrait of the sculptor Mateu Fernández de Soto, done in 1901 as they mourned the suicide of their friend Carles Casagemas, for whom the wild life of Paris bohemia proved fatal. It’s a powerful conclusion to the thread of artistic despair and insanity that haunts this otherwise drearily grand exhibition.The Courtauld proudly tells us its scientific research has revealed that Picasso painted it over a portrait of a woman – perhaps to save canvases as an impoverished young artist. But I can’t see her. And you can’t see her, either.

SNL, gushedNew Yorkmagazine, “feels unbound by time, as if it had always existed and always will”. The New Yorker said ithad “reinvented television”.‘It’s the moment when genius comes into the universe’: the film recreating SNL’s chaotic first nightRead moreThe show’s longevity and reinvention is certainly noteworthy. Its staying power in part a result of its true variety, it represents many things to many people: a frat house for silly bits and occasional surrealism; a backdrop for prickly political impressions; a place for experimentation in short film that presaged YouTube and TikTok; an eager stage for paradigm-shifting musical performances; and a launchpad like no another in entertainment that has anointed an impressive roster of stars.But whether the show produces anythingcloseto consistently amusing comedy has always been debatable. Like any TV show, Saturday Night Live has its stable of diehard defenders, but it has also drawn criticism for its pedestrian and underwhelming humor. We hear lots of its greatest moments, but far less about the wearisome fare that bulks the show to its 90-minute runtime – a Mikey Day-led talking-head interview with two “Nintendo developers”, one of whom has suffered a recent scrotal injury, say, or “Gen Z Hospital”, a true nadir in which an extremely wooden Elon Musk plays a doctor fielding inquiries from cast members conversing in TikTok-ese. “Gang gang”, Bowen Yang intones gravely.Since 1975, SNL has claimed to be a haven for scrappy outsiders and the kind of cutting-edge comedy that’s beholden to nothing and no one. But despite its superficial patina of underdog spikiness, throughout its history SNL has tended towards sympathy for the powerful and the influential.The show’s philosophy has almost everything to do with its creative director and showrunner, Lorne Michaels. How far the show can go,who it casts, and where its comedic sensibilities lie have always (aside from a five-year blip in the 80s) been dictated entirely by him.“Lorne’s father died when he was a teenager, and it plunged the family into financial precarity,” the critic and journalist Seth Simons said. “Lorne took away from that that he never wants to be poor again. In Lorne, [a forthcomingbiography of Michaels] it makes clear that he is very much a member of the upper class, and SNLfunctions as a way of ushering people into the upper class.”In the biography, Tina Fey, who based the character of Jack Donaghy in 30 Rock partly on Lorne, says that Lorne teaches you how to live your life. “He tells his employees to make sure that they take vacations in suitably luxurious, expensive locales. He gives advice to people like Jeff Bezos and David Zaslav,” says Simons. “I think there is no other figure like him who has had the job that he has had for as long as he has had it, and that has changed culture so radically.”Lorne gives great freedom and levity to the show’s writers, but he still shapes the politics of the show in his image. The former cast member Taran Killamrecalledon the podcast I Was There Too that Michaels told his charges not to “vilify” the then presidential nominee Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election. “He’s like any New York taxi driver. I know him, I’ve seen him around at parties for years and years, and he just says whatever it is he’s thinking, and that’s his thing,” Killam says Michaels said. “You have to find a way in that makes him likable.”Not all staffers were on board. According tonew reports, the SNL writer and comedian Tim Robinson said at the time: “Lorne has lost his fucking mind and someone needs to shoot him in the back of the head.”“At the end of the day, Lorne Michaels is very close to a lot of people in power, and he plays this really big role in all kinds of comedy entertainment,” saidSteven Thrasher, a journalist, academic and former SNL writer.“The first year I worked at SNL was also the first year that Jimmy Fallon was a cast member. And of course, Jimmy Fallon goes on eventually to host The Tonight Show. When [Fallon] had Trump on just a week before the election, and he grabbed [Trump’s] hair to show it wasn’t a wig, that was a major rehabilitation moment,” Thrasher said. “I think that shows not just whatSNL does directly, but the role that Lorne Michaels has in creating an entire media environment through which a person likeDonald Trumpis rehabilitated.”Thrasher was an SNL staffer during the Monica Lewinsky era of the Clinton presidency. In one episode, Lewinsky herself, in a heroic display of good sportsmanship,made an appearancein a sketch alongside Tim Meadows that was rife with sexualized double entendres. “It was a strange thing because she was, in ways I think we can see much more clearly now, being really abused in the public eye,” Thrasher said.SNLdidn’t seek to subvert this narrative but rather to reinforce it, at the expense of both a vulnerable Lewinsky and the viewers at home. “The laugh is on the audience,” Thrasher said. “That’s something I felt often when I worked there. A lot of the writers went to Harvard, and a lot of them just had outright disdain for the people that they were making the show for.“There would be things in the scripts that would just outright make fun of people. They’d say, ‘The NBC audience, like lambs to the slaughter, will laugh at this joke.’”SNL maintains its image in the public imagination as a site of good-natured chaos, where temporary creative snafus always give way to a good laugh, and where nourished performers always win the day.“During my first two years there, the average work week was around 90 hours,” the former head writer Adam McKay, now best known for his directorial efforts,wrote in 2015. “There were times we basically didn’t leave the office except to grab five hours of sleep. On Tuesday, you write all day and all night. I once wrote for 20 straight hours and got dizzy because I had forgotten to eat.”McKay called this “comedy heaven” and the cheerful, if grueling, workplace narrative has tended to endure, but many haven’t felt the same way. Janeane Garofalo called her years on SNL “the most miserable experience of my life”, comparing it to “fraternity hazing”. Per Julia Louis-Dreyfus, it was “a very sexist environment”. The show’s disproportionate majority of white male comics and writers led to women and cast members of color having to fight harder to be heard and seen; and when they were in front of the camera, the joke was often on them.Jane Curtin, the first woman to anchor SNL’s “Weekend Update”, joined the show in 1976 and had a front-row seat to the show’s bedrock sexism. “It was stunning because in the improv group I came from in Cambridge, [Massachusetts], there was no sexism,” Curtin told theHollywood Reporter in 2019. “We were all equals; we all respected each other. We talked about the importance of the Equal Rights Amendment [ERA]. But by the time I got to Saturday Night Live the ERA didn’t pass, which was stunning to me. And I go into this world where they hadn’t even discussed an ERA. It wasn’t a part of their life; it didn’t affect them.” Curtin would soon get her biggest laughs being called “an ignorant slut” in a joke that skewered sexism. She says she found it funny at the time, but the line “still haunts” her.On the occasions thatSaturday Night Liveperformers have managed to speak truth to power, they have often experienced heavy consequences.On the 3 October 1992, in a moment cemented in the halls of pop culture history, the Irish pop singer Sinead O’Connor performed a Bob Marley song and ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II while singing the word “evil”, an act O’Connor committed in protest of child sexual abuse perpetuated by the Catholic church. At the end of the song she declared: “Fight the real enemy.”O’Connor was banned for life from performing on SNL or NBC ever again, she laterrevealed in her memoir; not that she minded too much.“A lot of people say or think that tearing up the Pope’s photo derailed my career,” she wrote. “That’s not how I feel about it. I feel that having a number-one record derailed my career and my tearing the photo put me back on the right track.”O’Connor also explained that the photo she ripped up belonged to her devoutly Catholic mother, who the singer claimed emotionally and physically abused her as a child. O’Connor wrote that she brought the photo “everywhere I lived from that day forward”, with the intent of eventually destroying it, “because nobody ever gave a shit about the children of Ireland”.‘I was a coke fiend, I made a lot of bad choices’: Garrett Morris on SNL’s early days – and how the show lost its courageRead moreBut the artist’s impassioned intent mattered not at all to Saturday Night Live at the time, which made quick work of undermining O’Connor in the aftermath. The following week, the Goodfellas star Joe Pesci hosted, and held up a taped-together photo of the pope. “She was very lucky it wasn’t my show,” Pesci said,referring to O’Connor. “If it was my show, I would’ve gave her such a smack.”Lorne Michaelstold Spin in 1993that he thought O’Connor’s “behavior was inappropriate”, and that he was “shocked, the way you would be shocked at a houseguest pissing on a flower arrangement in the dining room”. Decades later, in the new documentary 50 Years of SNL Music, the boss revealed he hadsoftened. “There was a part of me that just admired the bravery of what she’d done, and also the absolute sincerity of it,” Michaels said, rewriting the record.Legend also has it that the viciously funny cast member Norm Macdonald was booted from the show after taking one too manycracks at OJ Simpson, a close personal friend and golf buddy of the NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer; who was not amused by Macdonald’s persistence.Rage Against the Machine, acclaimed distributors of communist-flavored nu metal, werebanned from SNL foreverafter draping their amps in upside-down American flags during their sole performance on the show in 1996. No one at home even saw their protest, but the attempt was enough to confirm their banishment.While it has balked at its performers punching up at powers that be,SNL has been more comfortable with guest hosts and hosts that punch down – as far back as the earliest days of SNL, you could find white stars like John Belushi embodying Asian stereotypes; in 1985 Dana Carvey played a Chinese shopkeeper in a sketch called “Ching Chang in Love”. Chevy Chasesaid the N-wordon national television. Countless other sketches have aged just as horribly: Fallonhad to apologizefor performing in blackface in a Chris Rock impersonation in 2000.SNL also helped the explosion of the career ofAndrew Dice Clay, offering him a hosting slot just as his rampantly misogynistic comedy made him a 90s pariah.It has given a similar boost to billionaire businessmen in more recent years, invitingElon Muskand Trump to host.Musk, notorious for his affinity for stale meme humor and, more recently, gestures thatlook likeNazi salutes, stuck to safe humor about his Asperger’s and his son X’s weird name when he hosted in 2021. But he had already been spreading doubt about Covid vaccines when he assumed the stage in a bandanna covering his mouth and nose: a perfect cypher for SNL’sno-stance centrism.Trumphosted SNLin 2015, months after he announced his first candidacy for president, which many argued after his victory was ultimately tantamount to an endorsement. “People think I’m controversial,” Trump – who inarguably has good comic timing, said in his monologue. “But the truth is, I’m a nice guy. I don’t hold grudges against anybody.”Garrett Morris, the first Black performer on SNL,told the Guardianlast year that when he joined the cast, he observed the show’s fundamental issues first-hand: “I will say to the end of my days: Lorne’s writers had a lot of racism going on.”“I would call SNL conservative conservative in the way that liberalism is conservative,” Thrasher said. “Liberalism includes Barack Obama laughing with Donald Trump. Liberalism includes numerous senators voting for various Trump nominees, even if they don’t vote forallof them. For the most part, it’s not challenging power.”SNL is many things, but a beacon of fearless outsider comedy is not one of them. And that’s fine: but the rest of us should stop pretending otherwise.Explore more on these topicsSaturday Night LiveTV comedyComedyTelevisionSinéad O'ConnorDonald TrumpElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s perhaps notable forHarrison Fordplaying a US president for the first time since Air Force One in 1997, but now with secret health worries and liable to succumb to a terrifying rage which turns him into Red Hulk (Red State Hulk?) who is the ultimate disruptor, putting his great big red fist through the West Wing.A novelty there, maybe, though he conforms to the time-honoured Hulk tradition of somehow having miraculously stretchy trousers so that the Red Hulk genitals are not exposed. As for the apparent Maga implications, Mr Ford has himself denied them, and the MCU is as cautiously apolitical as ever, though Ford’s character is certainly keener on international cooperation than the current real-life incumbent.Supersoldier Captain America is the title now conferred on Sam Wilson, played by the personable Anthony Mackie; the previous holder Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) having stepped down and gone back in time to his 1940s heyday. Wilson is astonished to receive an invitation to a reception at the White House, now presided over by the ex-general turned commander-in-chief Thaddeus Ross (Ford) – an enemy of the Avengers who is regretfully tormented by the thought that he has alienated his daughter Betty (Liv Tyler) on account of her relationship with Bruce Banner.Captain America shows up to the shindig with his buddy and protege Joaquin Torres, or Falcon (Danny Ramirez) and Korean war veteran Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly), who is bitter at his former imprisonment as a mistrusted supersoldier. The reception ends in violent chaos, connected with a sinister plan to exploit the powerful new element Adamantium recently discovered in Japanese waters, and to create warlike division between Japan and the US who might otherwise sign a treaty guaranteeing international ownership. Captain America and President Ross are going to have to put aside their differences to battle this new threat to the Pax Americana, which might have something to with the awful scientist Dr Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) whose shocking appearance perhaps indicates thatno one on this production got the memo about stigmatising facial deformation.And so this convoluted green screen digital contrivance finally snakes its way to a suspended episode-conclusion; the action is moderate and it’s lacking in the steam-heat, humour and the surreal energy of superhero movies past. Mackie has charm and presence, and it would be great to see him at the centre of something more satisfying.Captain America: Brave New World is out on 13 February in Australia, and 14 February in the US and UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuperhero moviesMarvelHarrison FordreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bear in mind, the last he played in the area, in June 2022, was at the nearby MetLife Stadium with its 82,000 capacity. But for this special engagement, just 575 people would come together to watch the music icon at the comparatively minuscule Bowery Ballroom.‘The whole human condition is encased in the story’: why Beatles films just keep comingRead moreNaturally, tickets disappeared immediately, with stories of hopeful attenders physically running (yes, running!) down to the venue for box office-only sales. And lest you think Macca would use the opportunity to line his coffers, think again: tickets were sold for just $50 a pop, the price of a beer and a snack at most concerts.Doors opened at 5pm with a promised showtime at 6.30, with many attenders milling about, still bleary-eyed and in shock. Was this really about to happen? Perhaps it’s some trick? A fellow writer I ran into stayed up all night working and assumed he was about to get some shuteye when he heard about the show. Sleep can wait. Perhaps the biggest irony for the audience was that for what would be such a little-seen show, it’d be the perfect set to record every aspect of it – but no luck: as wristbands were given out, everybody’s phones were locked in pouches.By 6.20pm, the tiny space began to buzz and remixes of McCartney songs began playing over the loudspeaker to warm up the crowd. The venue was by no means packed: acts with barely any following have had more attendance in this particular venue. Among the crowd, ticket holders included the Apple Music maven Zane Lowe and a host of lucky fans. A smattering of grey hair mixed with a healthy dose of gen Z faces peppered the crowd, proving McCartney’s universal appeal.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: MJ KimThen he appeared as the crowd screamed: dressed in navy slacks with a black corduroy jacket over a pinstripe blue shirt, donning a slight stubble and long hair, a buoyant energy from the start. Surrounding him was a seven-piece band, including a three-piece horn section. This wasn’t going to be a stripped-down set. Paul’s guitar pick was in his mouth before switching to his hand, and he lifted his brown Höfner bass (could it bethe one he was reunited withlast year?).At 6.45pm, the familiar opening chord of A Hard Day’s Night rang out into the venue, with McCartney hitting that Höfner just as he did on the original recording (it was Beatles bandmate George Harrison who handled lead guitar duties on that one, with McCartney keeping up the tradition tonight). Letting Go, a 1976 cut from his Wings Over America album, and Got to Get You Into My Life followed in quick succession. “I can’t quite believe we’re here doing this. But we are here, doing this,” he said at one point.From there, McCartney in no way downsized his set or presence for the small venue, with the audience screaming, yelping and hanging on to every word. One of the major questions going into the surprise gig was:why?What was the point of all this? Was this to herald the start of a new era? Was it being filmed? Did they just want to put together a live rehearsal? Early on, he seemed to answer that query: “So, here we are,” he said mischievously. “Some little gig.New York. Why not?” Enough said, Paul.Interspersed in the music, he shared little stories: nothing earthshaking to serious fans of his work, but nonetheless compelling to hear them live. Before appropriately playing My Valentine considering the week, he talked about how that ballad was inspired by a soggy vacation with his late wife Linda. (What if it rained? She didn’t care.) When he played the seminal Beatles classic From Me to You, McCartney discussed how in the early days of the band he tried to write more personal songs with specific “I”, “me” and “you” words, as if he was directly reaching out to the fans: LoveMeDo,IWant to Hold Your Hand,ISaw Her Standing There,IFeel Fine.Halfway through his set, the band departed the stage, leaving McCartney solo in a spotlight with his acoustic guitar. He relayed a story of watching the Little Rock bus boycotts on TV back in England and writing Blackbird as a tribute to the civil rights movement. Later, he was set to play a gig down south with the Beatles but they were informed it was segregated, which the Fab Four thought was simply stupid. They wound up demanding the show be integrated and he heard years later a Black woman told him that gig was the first time she sat in an audience with white people. From there, McCartney said they “wound up writing it into our contracts” to never play a segregated venue. With that, he played the familiar, luscious opening chords of Blackbird, a chill-inducing moment if there ever was one.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: MJ KimHe also couldn’t help acknowledge his late friend John Lennon and how enamored his fallen frontman was with New York City. “Let’s hear it for John,” he said at one point as the crowd cheered and he played the Beatles’ most recent song Now and Then, the recording of which won best rock performance at the Grammys earlier this month. Elsewhere he spoke about playing a gig in Kyiv, Ukraine, noting it was a joyful show full of freedom. “Let’s hope it gets back to that soon.”At a certain point the distinct smell of marijuana wafted into the air, which he also couldn’t help but notice and said his guitar player has been sober for many years, but with the smell, McCartney joked now he’ll “have to call his sponsor”.The vigor of an arena show was on full display in performances of songs like Jet (with its distinctive horns) as well as an Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da sing-along with the audience (first guys, then girls). Then he sat at a piano to bring it all home: busting out passionate versions of Lady Madonna, Let It Be and Hey Jude. The audience wanted more, as someone yelled he should “play all night”. Ever the realist, McCartney shook his head disapprovingly.But the joke was on us, as he came back out for an encore of Golden Slumbers and the Abbey Road ending of Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight and, fittingly, The End. “And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make,” he sang into the microphone.Then the band took a bow and he and his band disappeared from the stage two hours after that first chord. The audience just stood there, some staring off into the distance processing what just happened. That sense of disbelief followed the crowd as they walked outside the doors and into the cold. On the street as snow was falling, a gaggle of news cameras and spectators huddled in front of the venue.It was a full-circle week, considering two days earlier was the 61st anniversary of the Beatles performing on The Ed Sullivan Show, which occurred uptown in this very same city. Decades may have passed, but whatever magic happened there that night remains. “That was a Beatles scream!” McCartney said at one point after someone in the crowd reacted with a yelp. “OK, let’s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.”But that wasn’t the end of the surprise: McCartney is set to hit the stage at the Bowery again, tonight.Explore more on these topicsPaul McCartneyNew YorkThe BeatlesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hiseviction on Saturday night of two overenthusiastic audience membershas raised more stink than most such encounters. Why? I think it’s because of the brutality of this kicking-out – and how jarring that is in relation to Kay’s lovable image, and to the nature of his comedy too.The prime offender at Kay’s gig on Saturday night was a man shouting out the comic’s most famous catchphrase, “garlic bread”. This is not an unusual thing to do at a celebrity comedy show, where joining in on the catchphrase is often encouraged as all part of the communal fun. I’ve seenthe show in question, which Kay premiered – after a long absence from the stage – more than two years ago. It is, in a sense, more catchphrase than comedy, fashioning TV themes, advertising jingles and the most popular routines from Kay’s career into one intense hit of relatability and fellow-feeling. If you don’t find yourself joining in, Pavlov’s doggy style, you’re not watching it properly.No doubt this particular punter went too far – and Kay is well within his rights to eject an audience member who is ruining others’ fun. But did he have to do it so cruelly? “There was a nastiness to his voice,” one of his two victims protested afterwards. This woman was thrown out for chiming in with a “we love you, Peter” while the previous heckler was being dealt with.“It was like he was trying to get the crowd against me,” she later complained. “It just wasn’t nice, to be honest.” She’s not wrong.Video of the encounter(illicitly filmed, of course – another example of audiences going rogue!) reveal Kay gloating over his hecklers’ eviction, encouraging security to be as rough as possible, and rallying his crowd to jeer the evictees.This is where the story turns from your regular comic v heckler fracas to something uglier – the more so because Kay’s brand is bloke-next-door homeliness, not Jimmy Carr malice. “It’s not something you ever want to do,” Kay told reporters afterwards – and this would be a non-story had he seemed, onstage, to not want to do it. That’s usually how comedians deal with these situations: with a joke or two, but businesslike, and with a tinge of regret. It’s the sadistic relish that’s shocking here. Perhaps there’s an element of glee in the coverage, too, that the mask has slipped, that the steelyPeter Kay, long suspected as lurking behind the cuddly facade, has finally been revealed.It’s hard not to consider this incident in the context of recent developments in live comedy – developments which may have crept up on Kay, so distant now from the grassroots of standup. Butthe status of heckling, of comedians’ interactions with their crowd, is never settled. Dealing with interruptions used to be a badge of honour. Then, as the art form gentrified, heckling fell out of favour. But now, thanks to social media – where comedians sell their shows on the strength of their “crowd work”, and indeed orchestrate audience participation for just that purpose – the cut-and-thrust of comic/crowd backchat isback in vogue.In a world where younger comics study how to do it just right, this crass instance of crowd work on Kay’s part looks all the more of a misstep. He will survive it. We’re not in Michael Richards territory here – the Seinfeld star having sabotaged his standup career witha racist riposte at hecklersat a gig in 2006. But Kay’s man-of-the-people reputation – the comic we’d all love to break bread with, garlic or otherwise – will be tainted.Explore more on these topicsComedyPeter KaycommentShareReuse this content"

With unfair expectations, it’s the niche and left-field titles that will sufferKeza MacDonaldWed 12 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 10.02 ESTShareBack in 2013, having bought the series from Eidos, Square Enix released a reboot of the hit 1990s action game Tomb Raider starring a significantly less objectified Lara Croft. Iloved that game, despite a quasi-assault scene near the beginning that I would later come to view as a bit icky, and I wasn’t the only one – it was extremely well received, selling 3.4m copies in its first month alone. Then Square Enix came out andcalled it a disappointment.Sales did not meet the publisher’s expectations, apparently, which raises the question: whatwerethe expectations? Was it supposed to sell 5m inone month? If a book sells 10,000 copies in a week it’s considered a bestseller. Even at the height of its popularity in the 90s, no Tomb Raider game ever sold more than a few million. Square Enix’s expectations were clearly unrealistic. It wouldn’t be the last time; in a 2016 interview with Hajime Tabata, Final Fantasy XV’s director, he told me that game needed to sell 10m to succeed.Last week in an earnings call, EA’s executives had to explain a shortfall in profits. It was driven mostly by EA FC, the ubiquitous football series whose revenue was down on the previous year, but CEO Andrew Wilson also singled out the long-awaited RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which came out last October. “Dragon Age had a high-quality launch and was well reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market,” he said.Dragon Age has “reached 1.5 million players” in the months since launch, which presumably includes people paying via subscription services as well as direct sales. If 3.4m was a disappointment for Square Enix in 2013, you can only imagine that 1.5m was a disaster for EA in 2024, when games cost multiples more to make.However, as Polygon’s Maddy Myers points out ina detailed analysis of comparable games, 1.5m is more than Metaphor: ReFantazio (1m), and not much less than the second part of the Final Fantasy VII remake (2m) over comparable time periods. Dragon’s Dogma, the genre’s breakout hit last year, sold 3.3m over six months.View image in fullscreenA breakout hit … Dragon’s Dogma 2.Photograph: CapcomIn those terms, Dragon Age was certainly not a flop. I can only come to the same conclusion as Myers: EA’s expectations were unrealistic. The company was expecting an instant mega-hit from a game in a series that had sat dormant for 10 years. The Veilguard had been rebooted and reworked several times over a tortuous development period, during which time BioWare struggled enormously. Having previously made standard-setting role-playing games in Mass Effect, Dragon Age and Star Wars: The Old Republic, its only releases since 2014 were Mass Effect: Andromeda (disappointing) and mech shooter Anthem (broken). Meanwhile, a different developer hadan enormous hitwith a series that BioWare itself established: Baldur’s Gate, which sold 15m.The developers at BioWare have suffered the fallout from this. The studio is now down to a relativelybare bones staff of 100, and it seems EA will not be giving it the chance to build on what it achieved with The Veilguard. It’sa miracle that game existsat all.I’ve written a lot in this newsletter about the ridiculously high stakes of modern video game development; it’s clear that a more sustainable path needs to be forged. But in 2025 as in 2013, short-termism and unrealistic expectations on a corporate level stand in the way. That Tomb Raider reboot ended up selling more than 14m over time, more than any other game in the series. First-quarter sales cannot be used as the first and final measure of a game’s success. Nintendo’s principle of selling the same games for literally decades has meant that plenty of mid-selling titles have become million-sellers over time.There was also a point in EA’s history – indeed in most publishers’ history – where the portfolio was more important than each individual game’s profitability. The likes of EA FC and Call of Duty were the bankable successes that could fund the rest of the slate, allowing those publishers to make room for thenextsurprise success. Not every game released in a year by a given company was expected to be a mega-hit. As long as the overall slate was profitable, there was space for the critically acclaimed or fan-pleasing games that didn’t break out of their niche.The space for those games now appears to be confined to independent developers and the smaller publishers that overtly support them. Mike Laidlaw, the director of the first three Dragon Age games, left BioWare in 2017 and formed a new studio in 2020; its first game, Eternal Strands, came out last month and is picking up great word-of-mouth buzz. By all accounts it’s a banger – and its team haven’t had to labour under the expectation of instant success.What to playView image in fullscreenWhy are we waiting … While Waiting’s gameplay.Photograph: Optillusion Games/SteamWhile Waitingcame out a few days ago, an unusual game that feels like a playable version of those slice-of-life newspaper cartoons. You play through the life of an incredibly regular guy, from birth through waiting for exam results through all the banal moments of his existence at the doctor’s surgery, crossing the road, waiting for new software updates to finally finish their endless install cycles. You can do absolutely nothing, or mess around in each scene to amuse yourself. It’s an interactive version of the adage that life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans, a small celebration of embracing the mundane.Available on:PC, Nintendo SwitchEstimated playtime:5 hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lars is doing well under the circumstances,” she added, lamenting the “need to pass on very personal information” following speculation in the Danish media.Lars von Trier on filmmaking and fear: ‘Sometimes, alcohol is the only thing that will help’Read moreVon Triermade publichis diagnosis in 2022, when he was aged 66. Thedirector sparked outrageby telling a 2011 Cannes film festival press conference for his film Melancholia that he was a Nazi who understood Adolf Hitler and sympathised “with him a little bit”.He was immediately banned, but his film remained in competition and its star Kirsten Dunst won an award for best actress. He later apologised for the comment.Von Trier had previously won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2000 for Dancer in the Dark.The father of four wrote in a now-deleted Instagram post in 2023 that “with any luck I should still have a few decent movies left in me”.In September, a project von Trier was set to direct, titled After, had been granted 1.3 million Danish kroner ($192,000) by the Danish Film Institute (DFI), according to a listing published by the DFI.Explore more on these topicsLars von TrierParkinson's diseaseCannes film festivalnewsShareReuse this content"

This merchant did not engage in authentic commerce practices and violated our terms.”On Monday, the talent agency representing West removed him from their roster. Daniel McCartney of 33 & West wrote in a statement that his working relationship with West was over, “effective immediately … due to his harmful and hateful remarks that myself nor 33 & West can stand for”.On Tuesday, a former staff member for West’s company – anonymised as Jane Doe – filed a lawsuit against him in Los Angeles superior court, alleging wrongful termination, and gender and religious discrimination.The woman, who is Jewish, alleges a series of incidents between January and June 2024, including that he fired her after sending her a text message reading “Hail [sic] Hitler”.Another alleged text message read: “Welcome to the first day of working for Hitler.” The woman’s lawyer, Carney Shegerian, described “a relentless and deliberate campaign of antisemitism and misogyny” from West.West has not commented on the lawsuit, nor the actions of Shopify and 33 & West. The Guardian has contacted his management for comment.Over the weekend, X allowed the antisemitic slurs to remain on its site, but later intervened when West began posting links to pornographic videos on his account.Elon Musk, the owner of X, commented: “Given what he has posted, his account is now classified as NSFW [not safe for work]. You should not be seeing that any more.” West deactivated his X account later that day, writing: “I’m logging out of Twitter. I appreciate Elon for allowing me to vent.”West has made antisemitic remarks for several years. In October 2022, he said he was “going death con 3 on Jewish people … You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda.” After widespread condemnation, the sportswear brand Adidas cut ties with him, ending their lucrative partnership on Yeezy-branded trainers.West continued to make antisemitic comments, telling rightwing pundit Alex Jones: “There’s a lot of things that I love about Hitler.” On X, he posted an image of a swastika intertwined with a Star of David. In response, X suspended his account for eight months.The then US president Joe Biden put out a statement shortly after the comments, though without naming West, saying: “The Holocaust happened, Hitler was a demonic figure.”In 2023, West apologised, writing in Hebrew on social media: “I sincerely apologise to the Jewish community … It was not my intention to hurt or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused.”But at the weekend, West wrote: “I’m never apologising for my Jewish comments … I’m calm as ice this is how I really feel.”Earlier this month, West made a controversial appearance alongside his wife Bianca Censori at the Grammy awards, where he told her to remove her fur coat, revealing a sheer minidress that left her essentially naked. Referring to the stunt, West write on X: “I have dominion over my wife.”The rapper recently told a podcast host he had been diagnosed as autistic, and misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder.He is due to release his next album Bully in the summer. His last two, Vultures 1 and Vultures 2, released in 2024, reached No 1 and No 2 in the US chart respectively.Explore more on these topicsKanye WestAntisemitismRapnewsShareReuse this content"

The band are resume performing this year.Photograph: Yonhap Handout/EPAThe aggressive purchase of entertainment stocks has also been driven by expectations that K-pop is about to enter another boom period.BTS, whose members have been performing compulsorymilitary service, are due to resume their music careers this summer, while the girl bandBlackpinkwill start a world tour in the second half of the year.“The entertainment sector stands to gain significantly from the return of major intellectual properties like BTS and Blackpink, as well as minimal impact from US tariffs,” Shinhan Investment and Securities researcher Ji In-hae told the Korea Times.Signs of a revival in cultural ties between South Korea and China will also benefit theHallyuwaveof Korean cultural content.China was responsible for about a fifth of South Korean entertainment companies’ revenue in 2016, according to the Korea Times, but sales have stagnated since Beijing imposed restrictions on Korean cultural imports the following year.That could be about to change, thanks to a surge in the merchandise market in China and the decision last year to allow South Koreans to enter China without visas – a move that is expected to lead to more concerts and music sales.Along with film and TV dramas, cuisine and cosmetics, K-pop is one of South Korea’s most successful cultural exports, earning the country almost $900m in 2023 – an increase of more than a third on the previous year – according to the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute.Businesses in other sectors are nervous, however, about the possibility Trump will expand his tariff regime to include vehicles and semiconductors, which together account for more than 40% of South Korea’s exports to the US.South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, is to hold a meeting next week to discuss his administration’s response to Trump’s tariff on steel and aluminium, including possible countermeasures.“Uncertainty in the global trade environment is increasing,” Choi said during a meeting with ministers this week, according to the Yonhap news agency.Explore more on these topicsK-popDonald TrumpPop and rockSouth KoreanewsShareReuse this content"

Kandinsky theatre company’s bruising sci-fi drama sweeps us thrillingly from 1803, when scientists electrocute a corpse to simulate stuttering new life, to 2074, when private tech companies experiment with downloading brain scans of the dead to infallible new bodies. A smartly composed exploration of greed, loss and the loneliness of eternity, More Life is an incredibly human play about technology.Victor (Marc Elliott) is our futuristic Frankenstein, a bulldozing consultant obsessed with progress, preservation and a dead woman he hopes will be the first success in his company’s experiments. As Vic brings Bridget (Alison Halstead) to a kind of life, the wonderfully precise ensemble watches as she tries on her new body. Under James Yeatman’s delicate direction, the voice is dislocated, alienating the physical form. Halstead is wonderful here, estranged from her own body, limbs suddenly stiff and unknown.Shankho Chaudhuri’s set, surprisingly chameleonic for something so orange, resembles what someone in the 70s would imagine the future to look like. We are surely foolish to think we can predict our future more accurately today. Written by Lauren Mooney (dramaturgy by Mooney and Gillian Greer), the story is inspired by the investments of Silicon Valley tech bros, but the ensemble’s squabbles over details reveal how uncertain we remain about what lies ahead.Most of Kandinsky’s work began at New Diorama under David Byrne, now artistic director of the Royal Court. More Life is a bright indication of the vision he brings with him. The pace drops in the second half, but there’s so much to engage with. Beyond intellectual and ethical debates, this play stabs at the heart. Tim McMullan roils as Bridget’s husband, unable to cope with the shock of her return. He gazes at her as one would an old videotape. Helen Schlesinger is softly stern as his second wife, host to this uncomfortable reckoning and aching for her own eternity.The show’s working title was Meat Sacks,a phrase transhumanists useto refer to our material forms. By interrogating the possibility of cheating hunger, pain and death, Kandinsky illuminate what we lose in conquering immortality, and reveal a kind of wonder in these saggy, exhausted, ravenous meat sacks of ours.At theRoyal Court, London, until 8 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Court theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The contrast gets turned up during this impressive show, which charts just how far he’s come; after more than a decade of releases, he has matured into a charismatic, Jarvis Cocker-esque performer at the edge of the big time.After a quick introductory bow, Hawk leads his band breathlessly through A Firmer Hand’s opening four songs. His body tenses as he struts the stage, and his fierce glare only breaks when a raunchy one-liner – “I felt him fit me like a glove” he croons on Machiavelli’s Room – propels his eyebrows upwards. Save for a couple of playful touches – the “uh-huh” in Machiavelli’s Room comes an Elvis lip-curl, and the “playground jazz” in Big Cat Tattoos with a flash of jazz hands – this opening run is poised, serious business. When Hawk finally addresses the crowd – “there’s nowhere we’d rather be,” he beams – the sudden warmth comes as a shock.His character similarly softens during older songs, smiling and dancing gently. When the line “is there anyone listening” on Elvis Look-alike Shadows is met with cheers, he lets out a surprised laugh. It’s closer to the Hawk we get between songs: funny, bashful, eager to please. That’s not to say the tougher, bolder performances of songs from A Firmer Hand feel contrived – rather that Hawk seems to inhabit them differently. It makes for a Jekyll & Hyde act, in which both new and old songs shine.View image in fullscreenA Jekyll & Hyde act … Hamish Hawk.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe singer’s powerful baritone is complimented by the physicality of his band, elevating tracks such as Nancy Dearest. When he strips things back for a solo, acoustic performance of Catherine Opens a Window, from 2018’s From Zero to One, it feels out of place: a conspicuous relic from his early development.These sides of Hawk’s early catalogue finally reach some closure with a storming performance of Heavy Elevator’s Caterpillar. Seen live, it suddenly feels like it could have appeared on A Firmer Hand – that his intensity on this new album was, perhaps, always there.Hamish Hawk plays Digital, Newcastle upon Tyne, 12 February; then touring the UK until 22 February.Explore more on these topicsIndiePop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

But all is not what it seems in Elric Kane’s clever supernatural forayPhil HoadWed 12 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 08.02 ESTShareAghosting story as much as a ghost story, this film sees twentysomething office drone Alex (Blu Hunt) strike gold on dating app called Friktion. Uncannily attuned to her emotions, hunky barista Kyle (Ben Smith-Petersen) appears to be the elusive perfect match. So after several blissful hook-ups, Alex can’t believe it when he suddenly blanks her messages – and is appalled to walk into a bar to witness him use the same line on another date: “We don’t really need to talk, do we?”After making inquiries regarding his whereabouts in the intervening time, Alex learns something shocking: that apparently she matches with dead people. With Kyle’s amnesiac revenant now haunting Alex, director Elric Kane deftly modulates this mashup of state-of-dating drama, erotic thriller and light supernatural foray. In the initial stages, he maintains a mood of uneasy languor as blase Alex navigates her carousel of sexual possibilities. But he switches to a mode of abrupt Lynchian dislocations and ruptures as the increasingly bunny-boilerish Kyle monopolises her life.Maybe the outwardly perfect Kyle, and Alex’s spiralling obsession with him, represents the algorithmic death-drive underlying the hunt for love on the apps. With Kane’s talent for ambience, it’s a point most seductively made in film’s earlier sections, with his protagonist unravelling in the hands of her mysterious reconstituted lover, like a gender-flipped Vertigo. But the slasher-type direction increasingly taken by the film – as various other paramours, including Alex’s snarky co-worker (John Karna), are targeted by Kyle – is a bit silly and awkwardly executed. This is where the film’s Lynchian effects seem most cut-and-pasted.Hunt, though, gives an excellent performance in the lead role, agilely running the gamut from deadened admin serf and hipster-bar dating veteran, to infatuated young lover, to abuse victim. She brings emotional suppleness and complexity to what is – despite some flaws – a bold and stylish take on the endless samsara of digital romance.The Dead Thing is on Shudder and AMC+ from 14 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsRomance filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The teenage priest – later known as Emperor Elagabalus – brought his cult’s sacred stone with him to the capital, where he gave it a goddess for a bride, built it an enormous temple on the Palatine Hill, and ordered Romans to worship it above all other deities. His rule was brief. After four wild years, he was beheaded by his own soldiers and his body was dumped in a sewer. As for the stone, its final resting place is unknown.Rocks, minerals, metals – these materials from the depths of the Earth and from distant space – have inspired reverence and horror, wonder and greed. They have power over us, and they give us power. It’s likely that the first murderer used a rock. So did the first artist. Our connection with the mineral world is bone deep.In Under a Metal Sky, travel writer Philip Marsden follows the seam of this story from the defunct tin mines around his Cornish home to the untapped gold deposits of Svaneti, high in the Caucasus. How, he asks, have the materials we shape, shaped us? And what lies behind our often impractical desire to dig, chisel, smelt and collect?For Marsden, it all started with gravel. He tells of a boyhood spent on his parents’ driveway sifting for shiny nuggets. And later, with hammer and chisel in hand, collecting “muddy lumps of rock which when broken open revealed sparking geodes … quartz in a dozen shades, tourmaline, jasper, gypsum, agates, gleaming galena … Their presence in my room, where I endlessly inspected them, left me with an enduring sense which only later was I able to articulate – that another world lay hidden inside this one.”Marsden is an intrepid guide: abseiling off cliffs and down abandoned minesFor our species, Marsden argues, it began with ochre, a ferrous rock that, if ground and mixed into a paste, can be painted on to almost any surface – art’s foundation stone. “Some cosmic shift took place in that action,” he writes. “Change had always been external, day and night, weather and seasons, rivers and tides, life and death. Now with the use of its own material, the Earth could be subtly remade and modified and abstractions created. Dirt was made precious, stones did tricks, rock became transcendent.”Travelling east through Europe, Marsden lays bare the Earth’s revelations, from silver to radium, aerolite, mercury, copper, gold and lithium, showing how each has had an alchemical effect on us. He is an intrepid guide: abseiling off cliffs and down abandoned mines, kayaking across the Netherlands, rattling through Georgia in a clapped outmarshrutka.He rummages through Goethe’s mineral collection and licks the white fluff growing from the wall of a Slovenian mercury mine. His enthusiasm for the subject is contagious, and he writes with a rock-collector’s eye for glittering details. One senses this is a book he has been longing to write for years.Are the Earth’s resources gifts or loans? Are they even ours for the taking at all? In earlier times, there was some evidence of reciprocity: the human sacrifices sunk in peat bogs; the deliberately broken and buried swords and spears of the bronze age. A healthy vein of guilt ran through ancient Iranian, Egyptian and Greek beliefs about metals – that they are the flesh of the gods, and to extract them is to tear the divine body. But such ideas were short-lived, and Under a Metal Skyis littered with the toxic tailings of uninhibited greed.Today’s emperors look once more to rocks from space but, as Marsden observes,their gaze is far from reverent. The internet billionaire Naveen Jain has one of the largest collections of meteorites in the world. “Every single thing we value on Earth,” he has said, “is in abundance in space.” His company, Moon Express, has acquired lunar exploration rights. Why not dig up the moon? Or hoick an asteroid out of the sky? Right now, there’s one floating somewhere between Mars and Jupiter that, if it fell to Earth, would deliver enough precious metals to make everyone on the planet a billionaire. The only problem?

Our critic sees a spine, a hand, an owl, a sea monster – or does he?Jonathan JonesTue 11 Feb 2025 19.01 ESTSharePsychedelic art has an image problem. Picture it and you may see tie-dyed fabrics, muzzy portraits of Jimi Hendrix, endless vistas of magenta. By the end of the 1960s, the wave of drug experimentation that started with Aldous Huxley and the beat generation had inspired a lot of great music – but very little good art.The writer and artist Henri Michaux had several advantages that helped him transcend all that mediocrity. He was born in Belgium – not California – in 1899 and lived an avant garde life in Paris where in the 1920s he was photographed by Claude Cahun and hung out with the surrealists. He inherited a tradition of bohemian drug experimentation that went right back to poet Charles Baudelaire and his fellow members of the Hashish Eaters Club, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas.View image in fullscreenSublimely suggestive … Michaux’s Untitled, 1966.Photograph: ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2025So in 1955, when Michaux tried mescaline, derived from the Peyote cactus, he approached it as a surrealist creative technique, not a search for self-expansion. He shut himself up, ate a special diet, then let the drug wear off before he tried to capture in drawings what he had experienced.The results, on show in the Courtauld’s drawings gallery, where you’d normally expect to see Old Master sketches, are addictive wonders of abstract art. Graphically precise yet sublimely suggestive, these works were first unveiled in a 1956 book called Miserable Miracle. They have the intensity of Jackson Pollock, but on a much smaller scale. They can also save you money and protect your health and sanity – for Michaux gives such a convincing visual account of what mescaline did to his brain that you can feel it work on yours. These artistic miracles don’t just describe a drug experience. They set off a fizzing delirium in your own mind’s eye.It starts gently. Soft horizontal black lines hover on a sheet of paper, interrupted by more heavily inked eye-like shapes, almost like musical notation. This delicate drawing beautifully suggests an oscillating chord or an underwater pulse. Michaux said he was expressing the tingling state the drug left him in. It’s as haunting as the ping at the start of Pink Floyd’s Echoes.Of course, you don’t create a work of art as poetic as this just because you took a drug. Michaux had a long artistic life behind him that included using surrealist techniques to release spontaneous images. From these he graduated, like other artists after the second world war, towards abstraction, whose high priests had been the rationalist and geometric Mondrian and Kandinsky. But in the 50s abstraction went wild, improvisatory, expressive, and its hero was the alcoholic American Pollock. What mescaline gave Michaux is the freedom to be a French Pollock.What mescaline gave Michaux is the freedom to be a French PollockHis lines lead you into knotty forests, throbbing mazes. He never loses a sense of perspective but uses it to give his visions a reality in space. In one drawing, a shimmering network of reverberating lines recedes into the distance to resemble an aerial photograph of a giant prehistoric earthwork. In another, the entire paper is covered with entwined tubular forms in black and red ink, their surfaces dotted and flecked to create a texture like elephant hide.What is this wood of symbols? It could be vegetation, or arteries, or the brain’s neural network. As a surrealist Michaux was accustomed to seeing images in random marks. It’s a process that touches on how the brain works – and maybe mescaline intensifies it. As you gaze into these drawings, they seem to shape themselves into images, only for the images to slip away, mere phantoms of the mind.View image in fullscreenSee many things … Untitled, 1956.Photograph: ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2025I think I see a spine and a skeletal hand and sometimes Michaux sees them too and sometimes he doesn’t. In one drawing, an owl or a ghost might be peeking out, but any landscape I grope for in the mayhem of its great neighbouring sketch is obviously an illusion. This dark, rough surface is not any one thing even if it can make you see many things.Michaux takes you to the depths of your own mind where reality and fantasy interbreed. But the more you look, the more violence intrudes. Images turn gory – these include dismembered bodies and, in my eyes anyway, a rattlesnake. Has the Mexican Peyote awakened primal memories of Aztec sacrifices? It’s more likely these cultural associations are hovering in his thoughts – and mine. I am the lizard king, I can do anything.Michaux’s drawings have the conviction of a Holbein portrait. He believes he is drawing the truth, even if it is inexplicable. This is what makes them uncanny. And like all the most memorable records of psychedelic experiences, they have a disturbing, disillusioned edge. After all Michaux drew them after the mescaline had worn off. In one drawing, a sea monster with squid-like tentacles floats in crystal clarity. Did he really see this? Would you want to? Michaux broke through the doors of perception so you don’t have to.

To a Land Unknown is a drama-thriller with real suspense, but also a melancholy showcase forMahmoud Darwish’s poem Praise for the High Shadow.The setting is modern-day Athens, where Chatila (Mahmood Bakri) is a watchful Palestinian refugee, with enough money from the Greek state to eat and charge his phone, drifting on the margins of crime and dreaming of escaping to Germany with the wife and son he left behind in Lebanon. Bakri’s excellent performance shows Chatila to be smart, personable, manipulative and ruthless, always on the lookout for ways to get money for a fake passport. He uses his pal Reda (Aram Sabbah), a fellow Palestinian refugee, in scams to rob people, and also relies on the money that Reda makes cottaging with Athenian guys; he is disgusted by consensual sex work, but stealing old ladies’ handbags is quite all right. He is also casually racist towards Greeks because they are not like the proper white northern Europeans he longs to live among in Germany, an attitude which betrays a strange self-hate: “The Greeks … they look like us Arabs.”With a hustler’s predatory instinct, Chatila flirts instinctively with a lonely Greek woman called Tatiana (played by Greek star Angeliki Papoulia, fromYorgos Lanthimos’s Dogtooth), and befriends Malik (Mohammad Alsurafa), a 13-year-old kid from Gaza, convincing himself and Reda that he is genuinely concerned for this little boy. Chatila cooks up a plan for Tatiana and Malik to put themselves in danger so that he and Reda can get money from Malik’s aunt in Italy and live in Tatiana’s Athens flat, a plan that evolves into betraying and brutalising his fellow refugees. People are there to be used and forgotten about: cleverly, Fleifel allows us to invest in characters who are to disappear from the story, so we too can experience the emotional wasteland in which Chatila lives.This is what his eternal stateless condition has brought him to; this is what a survivor does. But if, even now, he is not yet callous enough to succeed, then perhaps it means his success isn’t compatible with his humanity, battered and eroded as that now is. A smart, well-made film.To a Land Unknown is in UK cinemas from 14 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPalestinian territoriesGreeceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

A painter is murdered with a hammer blow to the head and a chisel to the heart. It looks as though someone has painted over a section of the frescoes he has been labouring on for years at the church of San Lorenzo. But who could have killed old Jacopo da Pontormo, and why?So begins this historical epistolary detective novel, stuffed with real-life Renaissance artists behaving badly. Investigating the murder at the behest of the duke, Cosimo de’ Medici, is Giorgio Vasari, painter and author of The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects. Not exempt from suspicion is Agnolo Bronzino, commissioned here (as in fact) to finish his deceased master’s frescoes, since lost. In their time they drew comparisons to the Sistine Chapel, and indeed one of Vasari’s penpals is the great Michelangelo himself, resentful at being stuck in Rome building the dome of St Peter’s. “These are cruel times, my friend, for the defenders of art and beauty,” Michelangelo writes – as they always have been and shall remain.Pontormo’s much-abused two assistants are initially the prime suspects: they are attending secret meetings in an attempt to unionise all the downtrodden amanuenses of great artists. (They call each other “comrade” and speak of a “spectre” haunting Italy.) The duke’s daughter, meanwhile, is writing to her aunt, Catherine de’ Medici (Queen of France), about a hunky page who has been giving her the glad eye. As the investigation proceeds we learn of secret passages, a missing pornographic painting, international intrigues and an annoying group of nuns who moan about not being given enough wine. One duke writes a letter to another, resisting attempts to marry their children in a hurry, in tones of exquisite sarcasm. An anonymous letter denouncing one artist for sodomy concludes in words that perfectly sum up the curtain-twitching bigot throughout history: “I am simply a faithful and obedient subject who would like to be able to sleep at night without being disturbed by the sounds of bestial, unnatural copulation, and I can assure you that all the respectable people on this street think the same.”The star of the show is sculptor and author Benvenuto Cellini: in Binet’s ventriloquism he is brave, catty and absurdly conceitedThe star of the show, however, is Benvenuto Cellini, goldsmith, sculptor, adventurer and author (his autobiographyin real life is much admired): in Binet’s ventriloquism he is brave, catty and absurdly conceited, and gets to hide in cupboards and evade guards with irrepressible elan. “My movements,” he boasts in one report of his actions, were “too quick for the human eye”. Sam Taylor’s translation, superb throughout, reaches its apogee in Cellini’s joyously scandalous voice. The first line of his wonderfully impudent letter to the Queen of France reads: “God must love you, Madame, for he has placed me upon your path.”The novel was originally published in France with the title Perspective(s), which makes more obvious the fact that, as well as its crowd of characters with their own points of view, it is also about the artistic technique of foreshortening. There is a very funny scene in which one artist manages to shoot an assassin with a crossbow because, as he explains in needless detail, his understanding of perspective helps him aim properly; while others speak in more serious tones about the way the vanishing point in a composition can make “infinity” visible to mortal man.But this is not primarily a postmodern treatise on the philosophy of art; indeed, French reviewers complained both that the book was not as cerebral as Binet’s previous ludic successes such asHHhHandCivilisations, and that it was too difficult to follow the plot. One critic, offended by the total of 20 correspondents, blurted: “This is no longer an epistolary novel, it’s a WhatsApp group.” Another complained about anachronisms, as though Binet had his unhappy art-world labourers explicitly foreshadow Marx’s rhetoric without quite knowing what he was doing.Perhaps those first readers were simply miffed that Binet had taken time out to write an entertainment (as Graham Greene called those too‑thrilling books of his he didn’t consider “novels”), but fans of the early Arturo Pérez-Reverte orGilbert Adairshould experience no such disappointments. Primarily, Perspectives aims, modestly  and with thorough success, to be a dazzling romp.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

If you’re wondering where to tuck in, try these hot picksAilsa SheldonWed 12 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 02.04 ESTShareEdinburgh is having a foodie moment. Last week it was named the Most Exciting Food Destination for 2025 by The Good Food Guide. This week, the Michelin Guide Ceremony (Great Britain and Ireland) – held in Scotland for the first time – saw new stars awarded toLylaandAvery, and new Bib Gourmand awards forArdfernandSkua.The city is not immune from hospitality sector pressures, but there has been wave after wave of new openings recently, from casual cafes, pizza and taco bars to fine-dining, and everything in between.After seven years reviewing restaurants in the city, it’s hard to narrow down my favourites … but here are 10 places that I’m always thrilled to eat at, for every budget.The PalmerstonFew restaurants have claimed the heart of Edinburgh residents quite like The Palmerston. It’s a bright airy space, a former bank branch transformed into an elegant easy-going restaurant. Sustainability and local produce guide the menus, with proper starters, mains and puddings. Settle in with a large plate of baked Berkshire pork shoulder, swede mash, January King cabbage, cider and sage (£27) with a glass of something delicious from the cellar. The weekday set lunch (Tues-Fri) is a steal (two courses £21, three courses £24).1 Palmerston Place,thepalmerstonedinburgh.co.ukArdfernView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AwAyeMediaThis relaxed all-day cafe and wine bar from Edinburgh-born, award-winning chef Roberta Hall-McCarron is next door to her flagship restaurant The Little Chartroom. While the Chartroom is dreamy for a special occasion, Ardfern has become part of the fabric of Leith. The day begins with good coffee and fresh doughnuts (£4.50), pork belly brioche buns (from £6.50), and stacked hash browns (£8). Later, order barbecue aubergine tacos with sweetcorn, fermented chilli and feta (£13) or braised beef pie with beans (£20).10-12 Bonnington Road,ardfern.ukPomeloView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christina LeahyOn cold days I daydream about hot hand-ripped noodles at Pomelo: chewy, spicy and singing with Sichuan peppercorns (£11.50). Chef Jun Au’s vibrant take on modern Chinese cooking is fresh and fun with a small changing menu. Come for the noodles at lunchtime, or in the evening for family-style dishes to share (from £8.50). The windows steam up and you’ll bump elbows with a neighbour, but I promise you won’t care.27 Sciennes Road,pomelocafe.co.ukLeftfieldView image in fullscreenEvery neighbourhood deserves a restaurant like this: one where you feel like an invited guest on every visit. This intimate family-run bistro has gorgeous views over Bruntsfield Links towards Arthur’s Seat. On the menu you’ll find the freshest Scottish seafood, cooked with creativity and care. Start with Shetland mussels (£12), then try sea trout with broccolini, olives, and wild garlic butter sauce (£20).12 Barclay Terrace,leftfieldedinburgh.co.ukKa PaoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianWhether perched at the bar or tucked into a booth, Ka Pao feels like somewhere you can stay all night. Experimental small dishes are inspired by the flavours of south-east Asia, using Scotland’s larder. A favourite is Arbroath smokie miang, with galangal, spinach and peanuts (£7.50) and the corn ribs with salted coconut, shrimp and lime are messy but addictive (£7). Take friends for the sharing menu to try as many dishes as possible (£30.50pp).St James Quarter,ka-pao.comHarajuku KitchenView image in fullscreenThis bistro sets high standards for Japanese food in Edinburgh. There’s a rustic feel to the space: exposed brick walls, rattan lights and fabric screens echoing ryokan walls. The food is incredible, the sashimi is light and delicate, arranged with precision and care, and always the highest quality (from £7). The £14.90 weekday lunch menu (and served 5pm-6pm) is unbeatable.10 Gillespie Place,harajukukitchen.co.ukMontroseView image in fullscreenSister restaurant to the Michelin-starred Timberyard, Montrose offers the same experimental approach to Scottish ingredients at a more affordable price. The award-winning drinks list includes low-intervention wines, and homemade bitters, liqueurs, vermouths and soft drinks. In the wine bar, order oysters and olives, then playful dishes like suyo cucumber, burnt vegetable dressing and egg yolk (£8). The weekend set lunch is a delicious demonstration of this kitchen’s creativity (£20/£25 for two or three courses). Upstairs the restaurant is a more formal affair, also delightful (set menu £80).1-7 Montrose Terrace,montroserestaurant.coLylaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Murray OrrIf you’re going to blow the budget in style: go to Lyla where Stuart Ralston – executive chef and owner of four restaurants in the city – is at the peak of his powers. Expect 10 delicate-but-dazzling seafood-focused courses from the open kitchen. A year since eating here I still recall tender cured plaice decorated with radish flowers, an individual exmoor caviar pearl in every bud; cured trout sashimi fanned into petals on smooth salty chawanmushi, with marigold, lemon and nori, and a fat langoustine wrapped in crisp pastry strands, dunked in burnt apple and sorrel ketchup. (dinner £165, lunch £65/£95 for five to seven courses).3 Royal Terrace,lylaedinburgh.co.ukKitchen Table by Twelve TrianglesView image in fullscreenEdinburgh does cafes really well, with dozens of lovely spaces to while away an afternoon. Kitchen Table is one of the best, run by early Edinburgh sourdough pioneers Twelve Triangles. Pull up a mismatched wooden chair and order granola for breakfast with homemade yoghurt, berry compote, nut butter, and fresh fruit (£8.50), later perhaps a huge focaccia sandwich with black garlic roast aubergine, hummus, salsa and zhoug (£12.50). Co-owners Emily Cuddeford and Rachel Morgan have a cookbook out this spring and I dearly hope their Basque cheesecake (£6.50) has earned a page.22-24Easter Road,twelvetriangles.co.ukEleanoreView image in fullscreenThere’s a soft minimal design to the interior at Eleanore, helping this small restaurant feel calm and relaxed rather than crowded. Think sleek lines, handmade ceramics and thick curtains, all allowing the focus to rest on the food, which is outstanding. There’s a set menu, though do add the oysters. Recently, I loved a main of cod au poivre with creamed spinach and sweet roscoff onions, followed by Eleanore’s cult Tirami-choux bun. (set lunch £38, dinner £70).30-31 Albert Place,eleanore.ukExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh holidaysRestaurants (Travel)Food and drinkUnited Kingdom holidaysFoodRestaurants (Food)Top 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When it comes to a romantic meal, we can plan ahead, make an effort and present something a bit special or, more often than not, it’s a mad dash to the kitchen and a ready, steady, cook approach.Ducklegs will probably require a trip to the butchers, but the potato hash can be made with things you probably have at home already (or can easily find at the corner shop). Whatever your approach, the result must be delicious enough to say those three precious words: I love you.Duck legs with pear and swede (pictured top)Deeply savoury duck marries perfectly with sweet pears and slightly bitter swede.Prep10 minChill6 hr+Cook1 hr 40 minServes21 tsp table salt1 tsp Chinesefive-spiceFinley grated zest and juice of 1 orange2 duck legs(500-600g)1 swede, peeled and cut into 6 chunks (400-500g)1 firm pear, quartered and cored1 tsp sugarStart the day before. Mix the salt, five-spice and orange zest in a small bowl. Put the duck legs on a plate, scatter the spice mix over both sides, then cover and chill overnight, or for at least six hours.Twenty or 30 minutes before you want to start cooking, take the duck legs out of the fridge, uncover and set aside so the skin dries – this will help it crisp up nicely.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and put the duck legs skin side up in a small roasting tray or skillet. Roast uncovered for 25 minutes, then baste with whatever liquid has accumulated in the bottom of the tray. Lift out the duck, add the swede to the tray and stir so the chunks get coated in the duck juices. Put the duck legs on top of the swede, then return the tray to the oven for another 15 minutes. Baste again, add the four pear wedges to the tray, then turn down the heat to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, cover the tray and roast for another 30 minutes.Scoop three or four tablespoons of the duck roasting juices into a small bowl, add the orange juice and a teaspoon of sugar, and stir so the sugar dissolves. Pour this all over the duck legs, roast uncovered for a final 15 minutes, then serve.Greek potato hashView image in fullscreenHoney & Co’s Greek potato hash.When the salty feta melts on to the tomatoes and the egg yolk drapes over the potatoes, something very special happens.Prep10 minCook30 minServes21 lemon2 tbsp olive oil2red or maris piper potatoes, washed and diced into roughly 2cm cubes (about 400g)Flaky sea salt and black pepper1 tsp dried oregano1 red onion, peeled and diced (about 120g)2garlic cloves, peeled and halved250ml chicken stock,or 1 tsp chicken stock powder dissolved in 250ml boiling water1 large plum tomato, diced (about 130g)2 eggs100g feta1 handfulfresh basil leavesCut two thick slices off the unpeeled lemon, and save the rest for later.

Thecaneléde Bordeauxis a prime example of such understated genius. An inexperienced eye might well miss these squat little Doric columns amid the glitz and glaze of a French patisserie, but as my friendNicola Lambputs it, discovering them“is like being in a secret club, a club that all shares a valuable piece of knowledge: the canelé is the pastry GOAT”. That unassuming mahogany shell should shatter into caramelised shards to reveal a rich, almost custardy vanilla- and rum-scented interior.View image in fullscreenLabour of love: Felicity’s prototype perfect cannelés. All thumbnails taken by Felicity Cloake.Not that many people who’ve tried making cannelés at home would call them simple; rarely have I sifted through so muchagonised discussion and mournful photosof failed attempts that have mushroomed out of their moulds or failed to brown on top. Many thousands of words have been devoted to the correct way to season bespoke hand-tooled copper cannelé moulds with beeswax, the precise temperature of the milk, the optimum time to age the mixture, all creating almost as much mystique around what is basically a batter pudding as there is around its origins. For all the talk of 17th-century nuns with a glut of egg yolks from the local winemaking industry, the first mention of cannelésdates from 1937. In fact, they did not become widely available even in Bordeaux, where they are now omnipresent, until the establishment in 1985 of the Confrérie de Canelé, the organisation that dictated that authentic Bordeaux cannelés should be distinguished by being spelled with just the one n. Henceforth, therefore, I will revert to the original spelling of cannelé out of respect for the Brotherhood, and because such a simple recipe cannot possibly be in the least authentic, however delicious the results.The batterView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s version turns out to be the testers’ favourite.Cannelé batter – a mixture of milk, eggs, butter, sugar and flour – is not dissimilar to that used for clafoutis (or indeed sweet Yorkshire pudding), save for the fact that it features fewer eggs and more milk. I am neither a professional chef nor a chemist, so here I will quote directly from Lamb, a pastry chef and author of theaward-winning Sift, who credits this low flour, high liquid content for the cannelé’s distinctively moist yet springy interior. The “high proportion of liquid set [is] thanks to a mixture of starch gelatinisation and egg coagulation,” she writes on her Kitchen Projects baking newsletter. “The thick, browned crust is thanks to a strong browning reaction from the milk solids. Here’s my theory: as the canelés [sic] go into the oven, the batter heats up. As it passes 70C, the starches and egg begin to set, but it remains a flexible network due to the high proportion of liquid. As the batter continues to heat, water in the milk and eggs evaporates via steam, resulting in the custardy, holey network we know and love.”The precise ratio is a matter of hot debate, though most of the recipes I try operate in a fairly narrow window, with ratios of flour to milk ranging from 1:3.6-1:5, flour to sugar 1:1.6 to 2 and flour to butter from 1:0.2 to 0.5 (though that 0.2 isa recipe from American baker Erin Jeanne McDowell, who uses heavy [whipping] cream as well as milk, which will make up the fat content). I find that those with the most milk (French pastry supremoPierre Herméand the legendary American food writerPaula Wolfert) also have the dampest interiors, those with the least butter (Wolfert and McDowell) have the most delicate flavour, and the recipe with the highest total number of egg yolks (Hermé again) is the richest.View image in fullscreenPaula Wolfert’s cannelé has a somewhat ‘damp interior’.Even within eggs, though, there’s little consensus: Hermé, McDowell and the Bordelais bakeriesla Toque CuivréeandBaillardranuse a mixture of whole eggs and egg yolks; while Lamb, Wolfert andDominique Ansel(in whose bakery Lamb once toiled filling a hundred cannelés every morning) work with just yolks. The higher water content of the egg whites is (I assume) what gives the former group’s bakes a slightly taller, springier texture, so I’ve hedged my bets and gone for a yolk-heavy mixture plus a single egg white. You, however, may prefer to stick with four yolks for a denser cannelé, or two yolks and two whole eggs for a lighter one. My recipe below is based on my testers’ most popular cannelés, which come from Lamb, but with a couple of Hermé-inspired tweaks,visthe extra egg white and the use of icing sugar.Indeed, Hermé is the only recipe to call for icing rather than caster sugar: Ansel even goes so far as tocaution againstthe use of icing sugar, saying that the cornflour that stops it caking together causes the mixture to “puff up excessively”. I don’t find that to be the case, and Hermé’s cannelés also boast a distinctively crackly crust, which, in the absence of other clues, I put down to the powdered sugar’s ability to melt more quickly before caramelising on the hot metal of the moulds. If anyone can supply any other, better founded suggestions, I’d be delighted to hear them.View image in fullscreenVanilla and dark rum are the traditional flavourings, and I see no reason to deviate; you could, if you like, save yourself some money and a little work by swapping the vanilla pod for a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and stir it in along with the rum, in which case there’s no need to infuse the milk. Though not “correct”, as the French would say, whisky or brandy would do instead of rum, if that’s all you have; alternatively, leave out the booze altogether and replace it with the same amount of milk.The methodA lot, apparently, rests on the method when it comes to cannelés. Bakery bloggerElan Kogan describes them on the Iron Whisk as potentially “France’s, and perhaps even the world’s,most complicated pastry”, though Rory McDonald of the Institute of Culinary Education says the cannelé recipe itself is “relatively simple”, with the technique and execution being key. “Egg yolks, flour, butter, salt and milk are mixed together in a very specific order and left overnight so the flour can absorb the milk and hydrate before baking.”Good pastry chefs are always concerned with the minutiae, but having made five versions with as many different formulae for success, I can tell you that, as cannelé amateurs, we felt that almost all of them worked a treat. Wolfert whizzes the chilled butter, sugar and eggs into the flour like a cake mixture before beating in hot milk, while Lamb whisks melted butter into flour. McDowell melts the butter in the milk until hot, then beats the two into the eggs, flour and sugar. The easiest, however – which is, of course, the one I have borrowed – comes from Hermé, who combines everything cold, whisking the sugar into the eggs, then stirring in the remaining ingredients.View image in fullscreenAnne Willan’s cannelé is a bit of a ‘faff’.The only failure I have is withAnne Willan’s recipe, which uses a method from her friend “Chef Chambrette, now in his 80s”, who believed the secret was to “cook the egg-and-milk mixture until it curdles like overcooked crème anglaise”. Not only is this a bit of faff, but, perhaps because the batter isn’t allowed to rest, the cannelés balloon up and then sink, giving them huge pockets of air in the middle. I have no doubt that the venerable chef and Willan herself can turn out perfect cannelés using this method, but I find it difficult to master.The salutary lesson I take from this disaster is that the single most important thing with cannelés is to minimise the amount of air in the batter. To this end, it’s vital to rest the batter to allow the flour to hydrate, which will yield a denser, but more evenly risen result. However, it’s fine to hand-whisk the batter to combine it (and much easier than barely stirring it and pushing the resulting lumps of flour through a sieve, as some recipes recommend). . I also suggest tapping the tin on a work surface a couple of times before baking, to eliminate any lurking air bubbles, and keeping an eye on the oven, so you can puncture any mushrooming tops before they get out of hand.The tin(s) and the temperatureView image in fullscreenFirst things first: if you want to invest £100 on copper moulds, be my guest – they certainly look very pretty, and traditionalists insist they are the only way to bake cannelés – but please know that you can get very decent results with thick, nonstick metal moulds. Silicone, in my opinion, is never much good for anything crunchy and, honestly, you shouldn’t have a problem with the cannelés sticking so long as you brush the moulds with melted butter or, my own preference, baking spray (easily found online). If you do use copper, you can also have a go at seasoning them with melted beeswax, which imparts a lovely, shiny finish and, it’s claimed, has a subtle flavour of its own. But frankly, life is too short and it’s difficult for me to take a tradition seriously when it’s probably younger than I am.Opinions also differ as to the best temperature for perfection: Wolfert freezes the tin before use, Lamb heats it so the batter sizzles as it hits the metal, and Hermé fills it cold. Unexpectedly, having tried both temperatures with the same batter, I find I get a better crust from a cold tin and a steady temperature of 200C (180C fan) gas 6, rather than starting the cannelés off very hot, then turning down the heat. How long you leave them in there for, though, is up to you. Hermé believes that “When it’s black, it’s cooked. I sometimes see bakers cook them only to golden, and that’s no good. A cannelé has to be black.” Rory McDonald (a south-London boy originally) notes that “having lived in the US for a long time, I don’t think this would work here. Customers will either think the pastry is burnt or a chocolate flavour. Either way, it has to be baked lighter for this market.”View image in fullscreen‘When it’s black, it’s cooked,’ says Pierre Hermé.I, however, think the bittersweetness of burnt sugar is one of the cannelé’s principal charms. However far you char, take them out of the tin immediately and leave to cool to warm before serving. They’re at their best by far eaten on the day of baking, but they can be perked up by being put in a warm oven the day after.Perfect cannelésPrep10 minInfuse30 minChill4 hr+Cook90 minMakes121 vanilla pod400ml whole milk50g butter, plus extra, melted, to grease (or use baking spray)1 egg3 egg yolks200g icing sugar⅛ tsp fine salt50ml dark rum100g plain flour, siftedView image in fullscreenSlit the vanilla pod down its length and scrape out the seeds.Put both in a small saucepan, add the milk and bring slowly to a simmer.Turn off the heat and leave to infuse until cool.

(If you are using copper moulds, season them according to the instructions.)Take the batter out of the fridge half an hour before you’re planning to bake. Put a baking tray on a lower shelf of the oven and heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Stir the batter again until smooth.View image in fullscreenGrease your moulds well with melted butter or baking spray, then pour in the batter to fill them ½cm from the top. Tap the moulds on a work surface to get rid of any bubbles, then put them on the hot tray and bake for 70-90 minutes, depending on how dark you like them. Keep an eye on them, though: if the cannelés puff up, swiftly prick with the tip of a knife, but be careful not to let too much heat out of the oven as you do so.Take out of the oven and quickly unmould from the tins (a butter knife helps here), then leave to cool on a rack – the cannelés will crisp up as they cool.
