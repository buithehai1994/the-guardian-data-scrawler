The White House said Trump had promised to help with a Ukrainian request to source more air defence batteries for Kyiv.The last encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy ended in an angry exchange of words between the two presidents and the US vice-president, JD Vance. It marked a low point in US-Ukrainian relations and spooked other allies that Washington may be about to abandon Kyiv.‘As real as it can get’: EU to loan €150bn for European defence from invasionRead moreSince then, Zelenskyy has been eager to get relations with Trump back on track. His readout of Wednesday’s call thanked Trump multiple times, and he said he had signed on to the ceasefire plan.“We instructed our teams to resolve technical issues related to implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram after the call.Previously, Ukrainian and US negotiating teams had agreed on a full ceasefire, but Putin turned that down suggesting instead pausing mutual strikes on energy infrastructure and a ceasefire in the Black Sea.Trump, posting on Truth Social, described his talk with Zelenskyy as a “very good telephone call” that lasted around an hour. “Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia andUkrainein terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track,” he wrote, in language that was noticeably less hyperbolic than some of his pronouncements on the conflict.In a Zoom call with journalists late on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he had “felt no pressure” from Trump, adding: “It was a fruitful conversation, perhaps the most fruitful we have had, the mood was positive.“We have received signals from the United States that we are talking about the ceasefire on energy facilities, so not to attack energy infrastructure, and we are also talking about the civilian infrastructure facilities.”Zelenskyy said his team would draw up a list of the kind of facilities they felt could be included and would present them to the Americans at upcoming negotiations.The Ukrainian leader also said that he and Trump had discussed the US proposal to take ownership of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south Ukraine.“We talked only about one power plant, which is under Russian occupation,” he said.In a sign that European leaders are closely watching the discussions between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy, the Ukraine president answered a phone call while speaking with reporters on Wednesday evening and promised to call back. Returning to the briefing, he said: “That was President Macron, we have a conversation on average once a day, he’s helping a lot. I will call him back.”Ukrainian officials say that they believe their relations with the Trump administration are now on sounder footing.“It was a fairly emotional conversation in the Oval Office, and it showed that contradictions had built up,” said Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak, in an interview in Kyiv earlier on Wednesday. He claimed, however, that the two administrations quickly “found a synchronised position”, as demonstrated by the agreement in Saudi Arabia.Nonetheless, much of the rhetoric from many in the White House continues to alarm Kyiv’s European allies. On Wednesday, Trump’s negotiating envoy Steve Witkoff described the call between Trump and Putin as “two great leaders coming together for the betterment of mankind”.Podolyak said he was “relaxed” about the Trump administration’s strategy of “soft communication” with Russia. “They believe that this softer rhetoric, many personal connections, will enable them to find a level of trust. Although when I put the words ‘trust’ and ‘Russia’ together, it looks fantastical to me,” he said.A deal onUS access to Ukraine’s mineral wealthis still awaiting signatures. Trump’s suggestion that the US could take over Ukrainian power plants “would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure”, according to a White House statement.There was some confusion over what exactly had been said on the call between Trump and Putin, as Moscow and Washington gave very different readouts in the aftermath.Trump, in an initial post on Truth Social, said the partial ceasefire would apply to “energy and infrastructure”, giving the impression that it would extend to all civilian infrastructure. Zelenskyy, after his call with Trump, spoke about “ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure”.However, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday that the ceasefire would only apply to the energy sector, and a White House statement on Wednesday also referred only to energy, leaving the details of the ceasefire unclear.Additionally, the Kremlin said in a statement that a requirement for serious peace talks would be “the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyiv”.Trump, speaking on Fox News, denied this had ever come up: “No, we didn’t talk about aid, actually, we didn’t talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things but aid was never discussed,” he said.However, Peskov directly contradicted Trump, when speaking to reporters in Moscow: “The need to halt arms supplies to Kyiv was discussed during Putin and Trump’s conversation,” he said. Ceasing military aid would be “high on the agenda in negotiations between Russia and the US, but the topic will not be discussed publicly”, Peskov added.Ukrainian officials dismissed the demand as unrealistic.“It’s a very strange demand, of course,” said Podolyak. “He wants Ukraine to give up its army, to give up security guarantees, to give up its right to be in alliances, and to give up on various territories. This is what he’s been fighting for for three years, and he couldn’t do it militarily … And now that’s what he wants from the negotiations process,” he added.There remains no indication that Putin has abandoned any of his most hardline objectives in the war in Ukraine. Kommersant, a well-connected Russian newspaper, reported on Wednesday that Putin told a meeting of senior business leaders on Tuesday that he intends to continue the fighting until he gets full control of, as well as international recognition over, the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

It awarded Energy Transfer at least $660m, according to calculations from Greenpeace.The environmental group, which had expressed concerns before the trial about getting a fair hearing in oil and gas country, said that a loss and an enormous financial award could bankrupt their US operation. Energy Transfer sued three Greenpeace entities, claiming that they are a single organization rather than independent members of the Greenpeace network.Greenpeace will appeal the decision, the organization said.The case has been closely watched by the wider non-profit community and first amendment experts amidconcernsover how it could affect activism.“What we saw over these three weeks was Energy Transfer’s blatant disregard for the voices of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. And while they also tried to distort the truth about Greenpeace’s role in the protests, we instead reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to non-violence in every action we take,” said Deepa Padmanabha, Greenpeace’s senior legal adviser.“We should all be concerned about the future of the first amendment, and lawsuits like these aimed at destroying our rights to peaceful protest and free speech. Greenpeace will continue to do its part to fight for the protection of these fundamental rights for everyone,” Padmanabha said.Greenpeace International was one of the three entities sued by Energy Transfer. Its general counsel, Kristin Casper, said the organization’s fight would continue: “Energy Transfer hasn’t heard the last of us in this fight. We’re just getting started with our anti-Slapp [strategic lawsuits against public participation] lawsuit against Energy Transfer’s attacks on free speech and peaceful protest. We will see Energy Transfer in court this July in the Netherlands. We will not back down, we will not be silenced.”Energy Transfer thanked the judge and jury in a statement, saying: “While we are pleased that Greenpeace has been held accountable for their actions against us, this win is really for the people of Mandan and throughout North Dakota who had to live through the daily harassment and disruptions caused by the protesters who were funded and trained by Greenpeace. It is also a win for all law-abiding Americans who understand the difference between the right to free speech and breaking the law. That the disrupters have been held responsible is a win for all of us.”Trey Cox, Energy Transfer’s counsel for the case, said the jury’s verdict was “resounding” and showed Greenpeace’s actions had been unlawful. “It is also a day of celebration for the constitution, the state of North Dakota and Energy Transfer,” he said.During jury selection, potential jurors appeared to largely dislike the protests, and manyhad ties to the fossil fuel industry. In the end, more than half the jurors selected to hear the case had ties to the fossil fuel industry, and most had negative views of anti-pipeline protests or groups that oppose the use of fossil fuels.“Today’s verdict is not a reflection of wrongdoing on Greenpeace’s part, but rather the result of a long list of courtroom tactics and propaganda tricks that Energy Transfer used to deny Greenpeace its right to a fair trial,” said Kirk Herbertson, a New York attorney and the US director for advocacy and campaigns for EarthRights International. “We hope that the North Dakota supreme court will question why this case ever made it to trial in the first place.”Concerns over finding an unbiased jury plagued the case even before it began, given the rightward political leanings of Mandan, North Dakota, and the distaste for the protests among local residents. Mysterious rightwing mailers, made to look like a newspaper called “Central ND News”, that contained articles slanted against the pipeline protest or in favor of Energy Transfer were also sent to residents in recent months, which Greenpeace alleged could taint the jury pool.Greenpeace sought to move the trial to another venue in North Dakota multiple times, but was shot down by the county court and the North Dakota supreme court. The judge, James Gion, who was brought in to preside over the case after all Morton county judges recused themselves, denied requests for livestreaming, which the state supreme court also denied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These cases, even when the entities suing lose, cause significant legal costs for defendants and can have a chilling effect.Most jurors in US pipeline case against Greenpeace have fossil fuel industry tiesRead moreThe five-week trial saw Energy Transfer attempt to tie a host of misdeeds or disruptions caused by the protests to Greenpeace, which has maintained that its involvement was small and at the request of the Standing Rock Tribe.Standing Rockreleased a statementafter the trial began affirming it had led the protests and claiming the tribe had had ongoing issues with getting safety information from Energy Transfer. The pipeline company was “frivolously alleging defamation and seeking money damages, designed to shut down all voice supporting Standing Rock. The case is an attempt to silence our Tribe about the truth of what happened at Standing Rock, and the threat posed by DAPL to our land, our water and our people. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will not be silenced,” the tribal chairperson, Janet Alkire, wrote.In the final days of the case, Kelcy Warren, Energy Transfer’s billionaire founder and a major donor toDonald Trump, said in a video deposition that his company had offered financial incentives – including money, a luxury ranch and a new school – to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to stop the protests, which the tribe declined,according toa group of monitors attending the trial because of concerns over its fairness. Warren said he believed the tribe refused the offer because it was offered more by Earthjustice, which has served as a legal representative of the tribe.The trial-monitoring committee released a statement after the verdict saying that the trial had been “deeply flawed” and denied Greenpeace the ability to present a full defense. The committee monitored every part of the trial and concluded the jury had been biased in favor of Energy Transfer and the judge lacked full legal knowledge of the complex issues at hand.Marty Garbus, a longtime first amendment lawyer who is part of the monitoring group, said: “In my six decades of legal practice, I have never witnessed a trial as unfair as the one against Greenpeace that just ended in the courts of North Dakota … Greenpeace has a very strong case on appeal. I believe there is a good chance it ultimately will win both in court and in the court of public opinion.”The trial came after Energy Transfer first filed a Rico lawsuit in federal court in 2017. The federal racketeering case was dismissed on 14 February 2019, but seven days later Energy Transfer refiled a virtually identical suit in North Dakota state court.Explore more on these topicsGreenpeaceDemocracy and justiceNorth DakotaFossil fuelsEnvironmental activismOil (Business)Oil and gas companiesOil (Environment)newsShareReuse this content"

It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe.”Dark energy was discovered in the late 1990s when astronomers used distant supernova explosions to investigate how the rate of cosmic expansion has changed over time. The expectation was that gravity should counteract the expansion that has been underway since the big bang, but instead, the supernovae indicated that the rate of expansion was accelerating, propelled by some unknown forcethat scientists called dark energy.Dark energy has been assumed to be a constant, which would imply the universe will meet its end in a desolate scenario called the “big freeze”, when everything is eventually so far apart that even light cannot bridge the gap between galaxies. The latest findings, announced on Thursday at the American Physical Society’s GlobalPhysicsSummit in Anaheim, California, challenge that prevailing view.Desi uses its 5,000 fibreoptic “eyes” tomap the cosmos with unprecedented precision. Its latest data release captures 15m galaxies, spanning 11bn years of history, which astronomers have used to create the most detailed three-dimensional map of the universe to date.The results suggest that dark energy reached a peak in strength when the universe was about 70% of its current age and it is now about 10% weaker. This would mean the rate of expansion is still accelerating, but that dark energy is gently lifting its foot off the pedal.Scientists hail ‘avalanche of discoveries’ from Euclid space telescopeRead moreProf Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at the University of Durham and member of the Desi collaboration, said: “What we’re finding is that, yes, there is something pushing galaxies away from each other, but it is not constant. It is declining.”The results do not meet the so-calledfive-sigma thresholdof statistical certainty that is the gold standard in physics for claiming a discovery. But many in the collaboration have shifted in recent months from a position of scepticism to confidently backing the finding.“I’m not on the fence,” said Frenk. “I’ve looked at the data carefully. To me, this is a robust result. We’re witnessing the overthrow of the old paradigm and the emergence of a new paradigm.”Prof John Peacock, a cosmologist at the University of Edinburgh and a Desi collaborator who voiced scepticism about evolving dark energy at a Royal Society meeting last year, has been similarly persuaded. “Extreme claims require extreme evidence,” he said. “There’s almost nothing in science that I would bet my house on. But I would put £1,000 on this result.”Others continue to reserve judgment. Prof George Efstathiou of the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the findings, said: “My take-home from this analysis is that the … measurements do not yet provide decisive evidence for evolving dark energy. They may do as Desi accumulates more data.”If dark energy keeps decreasing to the point where it becomes negative, the universe is predicted to end in a reverse big bang scenario known as the big crunch.Scientists do not know why dark energy, which is generally estimated to account for about 70% of the universe – with the rest made up of dark and ordinary matter – might be waning or whether this would indicate the laws of physics are changing or that a crucial component is missing from them.Prof Ofer Lahav, an astronomer at University College London and Desi collaborator, said: “It’s fair to say we have no idea what dark matter or dark energy is. The constant dark energy [theory] is already sufficiently challenging. I feel like: ‘As if things were not complicated enough.’“But you can also look at it more positively. For 20 years we’ve been stuck with dark energy. Now physicists have new questions.”Explore more on these topicsAstronomySpacePhysicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They will be announced a week after ministers unveiled about£5bn worth of cuts to benefit payments, most of which are going from payments to disabled people.Analysis by the Resolution Foundation thinktankhas found that some disabled people could lose nearly £10,000 a year in benefits by the end of the decade under the reforms announced on Tuesday.Labour MPs now worry that next week’s additional spending cuts will put further pressure on Britain’s poorest families.One Whitehall source said: “The government has been clear that departments will have to find more efficiencies. That is why Wes Streeting [the health secretary] has cut NHS England, that is why Liz Kendall [the work and pensions secretary] has made reductions to welfare payments.”Another said: “I don’t know how much longer we can go on pretending this is not austerity, when the reality is we’re making cuts to vital public services such as police and prisons.”Ben Zaranko, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said: “The government will be hoping that the short-term cash injection provided last year, and efficiency improvements as public services continue to recover from the pandemic, will be enough to deliver service improvements even if money is tight.“But we’re in a very different world to 2010 and, even though the pace of cuts would be substantially slower than in the peak austerity years, it would still represent the steepest cuts since 2019.Rising bill for benefits has wreaked ‘terrible human cost’, says Keir StarmerRead more“It is difficult to see how this could be delivered without some adverse impacts on public services and those who rely on them.”Treasury officials say last year’s budget fulfilled many of the wishes of Labour MPs, with big rises in taxes and borrowing to pay for £70bn worth of additional spending a year.The chancellor’s statement next week was originally supposed to involve a straightforward update to the official economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).The British economy has struggled since last year’s budget however, with borrowing costs having risen and growth proving more sluggish than expected. Labour has blamed global turmoil for the economic malaise, but the Conservatives say it is a result of the major tax hike Reeves imposed on businesses last November.The worsening outlook has left the chancellor looking for additional money to avoid missingher fiscal targets.The OBR will hand her its final forecasts on Friday, including its assessment of how close she is to breaking her promises to have a balanced day-to-day budget by 2029-30 and to have debt falling by the same time.Government sources have told the Guardian Reeves will not announce any tax rises next week, despiteConservative claimsthat she is planning to introduce a stealth income tax raid by freezing the threshold where people start paying it. The chancellor has not ruled out making such a move later in the year, should the economy continue to struggle.Officials are not denying reports that they could seek to increase Whitehall budgets by an average of 1.1% a year after 2025-26, rather than the 1.3% announced last year.Given that much of this money will be taken up by expected rises to budgets in areas such as the NHS, schools and defence, the IFS calculates this would mean other departments – such as justice, the Home Office and local government – falling by about 1.9% a year, or 7% over the rest of the parliament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Several – including Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, and Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary – voiced their concern about the cuts last week during whathas been describedas the most “tense” cabinet meeting of this government.A Treasury source said: “Last year’s budget delivered £40bn of additional cash into our public service, including the largest real-terms growth in day-to-day NHS spending outside of Covid since 2010. On top of that we unlocked more than £100bn of investment into our schools, hospitals and national infrastructure.“The Tories would have let our public services collapse: we are taking action to rebuild them.”Reeves will on Wednesday announce the average level of spending across Whitehall over the next few years, but will only reveal what it means for individual departments at the spending review in June.As part of the spending review process, departments have been asked to model cuts of up to 20% of day-to-day spending.The scenario is so severe that departments are having to plan for cuts to projects which have recently been announced by this government.The Department for Transport, for example, has submitted plans for cuts to the proposed rail line between Oxford and Cambridge, which Reeves herself confirmed funding for justtwo months ago. Officials have also suggested using private investment to build the long-delayed Lower Thames Crossing – a planned£9bn road tunnellinking Essex and Kent.A spokesperson for the transport department said: “This is speculation. East West Rail is already well underway with the infrastructure now in place on the first phase of the line for services between Oxford and Milton Keynes.”The cuts Reeves will unveil next week are likely to cause further unease among Labour MPs who are already reeling from recent cuts to international aid and welfare.One MP said: “Increasingly I’m trying to figure out what we’re doing that the Tories wouldn’t be if they were in power.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyPublic services policyRachel ReevesLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The Met Office meteorologist Simon Partridge said Thursday will be generally dry and fine with plenty of sunny spells, adding: “It will be a little warmer too”.He said: “The highest temperatures are expected in an area from London and the home counties to southern Midlands. Here we are likely to see 19C or 20C widely, with one or two spots likely to reach 21C.”The expected rise in temperatures coincides with the spring equinox, which is the first day of astronomical spring. Parts of the UK may be hotter than Barcelona in Spain and Athens in Greece, where highs of 15C and 12C are forecast respectively.The highest recorded UK spring equinox temperature was 21.5C in 1972, and the Met Office spokesperson, Stephen Dixon, said 2025’s highest temperature is unlikely to top that.This year has so far peaked at 19.7C in Crosby, Merseyside, on 9 March. Wetter weather will move in on Friday and the weekend will be more unsettled.Higher pressure to the east of the UK is currently helping to draw warmer air north across the country, Dixon said, adding that the sunshine on Thursday will be only broken by some fair-weather cloud in central parts of England.Friday will remain warm for many but some rain is expected to move in from the south-west. Showers are forecast to start in Cornwall and gradually travel north-east during that day into parts of Wales and central and southern England. Rain is then expected for much of the country throughout the weekend.Meteorological spring always starts on 1 March while astronomical spring, or the equinox, begins around 20 March each year.The other equinox is in September and both mark the sun crossing the equator, rather than being at an angle. Day and night are therefore about the same length.Explore more on these topicsUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

I tried to move myself up in the bed slightly so there would be distance between our genitals, but then his penis was touching me in between my legs right at the entry of my vagina.“He was so close that I recall being worried in case he moved in further or ejaculated. I don’t remember how many takes we did of this scene, in the various camera angles. There may have been four or five takes in each angle. His erect penis remained touching me in the same place throughout all of these takes.”Philip Williams, representing Clarke, who is suing the Guardian over publications from 2021-2022 accusing him of sexual misconduct, put to her that the incidents could not have occurred as other people would have witnessed them. But Penelope, giving evidence via videolink, said they would not have been able to see. She also rejected Clarke’s contention that he was wearing a patch and nylon sock, telling the court he had told her he wanted to “keep it natural”.Williams suggested that she did not tell anyone at the time because it did not happen but Penelope told the court it was because she felt “shock and shame” and “it was a really horrible thing to experience”.Writing in her witness statement about the promotion she did for the film, she said: “I was under an obligation to promote and sell the film. It was not an option to say something negative. For many years after I did not tell people what had happened because I had not come to terms with it myself and I didn’t want people to think badly of me. I carried a deep sense of shame.”Thalia Hambi-Fisher, a choreographer and dance teacher, who also gave evidence on Wednesday, told the court about a business meeting with Clarke the day after he received the Orange rising star award 2009 from Bafta.“When we had finished the lunch, I got up to go to the bathroom,” she said in her witness statement. “Out of the blue Noel asked me, since I was going there, to take a photo of my ‘pussy’ – for him. He said he loved photos of women’s vaginas.”Williams said Clarke had a witness statement by the former EastEnders actor, Nabil Elouahabi, who did not give oral evidence, saying that Hambi-Fisher had flirted with with Clarke on a previous occasion.Hambi-Fisher denied doing so and when it was put to her that the writer-producer of the Kidulthood trilogy was not attracted to her, she replied: “Well, he was interested in one part of my body.”Accused by Williams of “jumping on the bandwagon”, she said: “I have nothing to gain from this at all.”The court also heard from Hugh Sherlock, whose witness statement states that he saw Clarke put his hands on the hips of a woman called Isla* while filming in a pub. He said Clarke “pulled her into him and started saying ‘I know what you want, you want my dick inside you’. He started fondling her breasts. She was visibly uncomfortable. Noel looked over at me and said ‘that’s what they all want, they want my dick inside them.’”Williams accused Sherlock of wanting to “stick the knife in” because he does not like Clarke. Sherlock accepted that he does not like Clarke but denied that was his motivation for coming forward.The trial continues.*Not their real namesExplore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Here are some of the people he could be referring to.Jordan PetersonAlongside Tate, the conservative Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson is one of the more established names seen to be promoting sexist and anti-feminist ideas on YouTube as part ofthe “manosphere”– though he has denied being a misogynist.‘We see misogyny every day’: how Andrew Tate’s twisted ideology infiltrated British schoolsRead moreHe has 8.64 million subscribers to his account, which advocates against gender equality and in favour of traditional roles on the grounds that men and women are fundamentally different. He has also argued that trans activism is “sexist and delusional”, as well as a denial of science.Debbie Ging, a professor of digital media and gender at Dublin City University, said herrecent studyof toxic masculinity noted that he advocates “traditional masculine values of courage, self-discipline and order as an antidote to the alleged chaos and narcissism of ‘woke’ modernity”.Anotherrecent studysuggested that Peterson’s popularity had contributed to the rise of boys and men who believe that feminism has done more harm than good.Peterson hassaidin a video that the “Andrew Tate phenomenon” is a result of Tate becoming “a voice” offering “forthright aggression” as an alternative to “cringing defeat”, a perspective which he said he “had sympathy” for, although he added he was not “particularly impressed” by some of Tate’s work.Adin RossRoss is a longstanding Andrew Tate collaborator, as well as a self-proclaimed admirer of his content. His own output has been described as misogynistic, transphobic, homophobic and racist.Ross, who is American, started as a gaming streamer on Twitch, but gradually evolved to espouse misogynistic views after inviting Tate to join his Twitch stream in 2022.The pair soon began streaming together regularly, during which Tate took on a coaching role, advising Ross on how to achieve “success”, including suggesting his girlfriend had left him because he had not yet become “a formidable force of man”.Ross has since been banned from Twitch for showing unmoderated hateful comments in his live stream chat, and now streams games on Kick, as well as posting YouTube videos on his channel, which has 4.54 million subscribers.His channel features an interview with Tate from five months ago, while anearlier clipincluded the claim that women are bad drivers and should avoid going to clubs alone to prevent abuse.Ross has also travelled to Dubai to meet Tate in person, and continued to support him afterhis arrest in Romania, questioning the validity of the charges brought against him.SneakoView image in fullscreenSneako rejoices as Donald Trump is announced as the winner of the 2024 presidential election.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamySneako is often described as an Andrew Tate imitator. He started out as a YouTuber posting gaming, motivational advice and man-on-the-street interview videos, but was later banned from the site. He has since moved to the alternative video-sharing platform Rumble, where he has 416,000 followers.Anda Solea, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth, noted that Sneako has “shifted toward making misogynistic and hateful content as well as collaborating with white supremacists and Nazis”.He is a frequent guest on the Fresh and Fit podcast, where he has belittled women alongside the hosts Walter Weekes and Myron Gaines.He is also known for his interest in far-right white supremacist ideology, antisemitic views,“red pill” misogynistic ideologyand promotion of conspiracy theories.Sneako, who is also American, has posted controversial ideas such as discussing “female privilege”, suggesting that “feminism is about taking all the power while men are struggling”, “feminism turns women into men”, and “a woman’s worth is what she looks like and a man’s worth is your masculinity, is your respect”.Recent posts include a video expressing admiration for theUnabomber’s manifestoand a video titled: “All women are gold diggers.”Fresh and Fit (Walter Weekes and Myron Gaines)View image in fullscreenFresh & Fit – Walter Weekes (right) and Myron Gaines.Photograph: Fresh & FitWeekes (nicknamed “Fresh”) and Gaines (“Fit”) are US podcast hosts who push alpha male ideology and dating strategies that are criticised for being misogynistic.Their eponymousYouTube channelhas more than 1.5 million subscribers tuning in to its “females, fitness and finances” focus, though this includes misogyny and racist views. Gaines is the author of the book Why Women Deserve Less.The Fresh and Fit account posted on X, formerly Twitter, says that “simps, the government and society as a whole pedastalizes [sic] women for having a vagina. Give them less so they respect you and give you more. Everyone else gives them more so you don’t have to.”The hosts, who are both black, have said they would refuse to date a black woman.They also frequently invite women on their podcast to humiliate and belittle them. This includes feminists as well as OnlyFans performers, some of whom appear to be drunk or high, with the aim of the hosts “demolishing”, “destroying” or “owning” their arguments.Recent videos suggest that “men don’t want to date” single mothers, that women going on female-only holidays with their friends is a “red flag” in a relationship, and modern women cannot date men.They have invited Tate on to the podcast on multiple occasions and have claimed he is innocent of charges of human trafficking and other offences since his arrest by Romanian authorities.In 2023, YouTube demonetised the podcast owing to tension between the guests and hosts. The pair have since moved their show to Castle Club, an independent subscription-based hosting site.Ging’s study found that the Fresh and Fit podcast featured heavily in the content recommended to male teenagers’ accounts.Hamza AhmedView image in fullscreenHamza Ahmed, a British ‘manosphere’ influencer.Photograph: InstagramThe British YouTuber Hamza Ahmed is the most prominent “manosphere’” influencer in the UK, with 2.28 million people following his controversial advice on dating, health and making money.Recent videos warn that men are “more feminine than ever” and suggests that men “should not show emotion”, suggesting in it that a “feminine woman always needs a masculine man” and that women respect emotional men less.He has charged hundreds of pounds for online courses offering dating, social skills and fitness advice.He runs an online community called Adonis School to help those men who are seeking to become “a top 1% man”, and charges$999 (£770) for a lifetime subscription to videos on how to become a content creator.Solea said Ahmed expresses his views “more covertly”, reflecting the pickup artists’ ideology, which portrays women as sexual objects that need to be conquered through various tactics.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaWomenAndrew TateJordan PetersonInternetInternet safetyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The target was signed into law in June 2019 by her predecessor Theresa May, the then prime minister. So what arguments did Badenoch make for reversing?Net zero by 2050 is ‘impossible’ without ‘bankrupting the country’Badenoch has cited no evidence to support this claim.Analysis by theLondon School of Economicshas found that, though reaching net zero by 2050 initially costs between 1% and 2% of GDP a year, it will save money by about 2040. To put that into context, the UK spends about11% of GDP on healthcare, and 10% on social security including pensions. The money spent on reaching net zero is also an investment, according to themost recent carbon budget; for example, upgrading the electricity grid or updating homes.A former minister made this pointin parliamentin 2022: “Our latest estimates put the costs of net zero at under 2% of GDP – broadly similar to when we legislated for it two years ago – with scope for costs of low-carbon technologies to fall faster than expected.” Wise words from Badenoch herself.TheOffice for Budget Responsibilityhas analysed the Climate Change Committee’s plans and found: “From 2040 onwards, net operating savings are projected to outweigh investment costs. And by 2050, the CCC projects a £19bn annual saving relative to its baseline emissions scenario.” If similar savings of the same size continued in the years beyond 2050, investment costs would be completely offset by 2070. The same report found “unmitigated climate change would ultimately have catastrophic economic and fiscal consequences for the UK”.‘No one knows why’ the target is 2050The Conservative leader incorrectly claimed “no one knows why” the target for net zero is 2050.In fact, the IPCC reported in 2018 that in order to limit global heating to no more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels – a habitable temperature – and to stop catastrophic climate breakdown, global carbon emissions should reach net zero around mid-century. This means that developed nations such as the UK should meet the target by 2050, and developing countries have set targets in the 2050s and 2060s.This is legally binding for the UK because under the Paris climate treaty, which it signed in 2015, it agreed to keep the rise in global temperatures “well below” 2C and to “make efforts” to keep it to 1.5C.Theresa May, who signed the target into law, responded to Badenoch, on social media saying that the target “is supported by the scientific community and backed by the independent Climate Change Committee as being not just necessary but feasible and cost-effective”.The UK is only responsible for 1% of global emissions and so can slow downThe UK has managed to decarbonise quickly so far this century, but is stillamong the top emitting countries(No 21 in 2022). On top of this, we are historically a big emitter. ACarbon Brief analysis in 2021found that the UK was the eighth largest country in terms of cumulative emissions. It would be very difficult in climate negotiations to make the argument that countries which are still developing should avoid the fossil fuels that we exploited and benefited from during our Industrial Revolution, if the UK is no longer trying to reduce its emissions in the present day.Energy and Climate Intelligence Unitanalysis has found that every country totalling between 0% and 1% of global carbon emissions – which includes many of the world’s richest countries – adds up to 29%. That’s more than China, which totals 27%.Net zero ‘was decided in 90 minutes without a single vote’There could have been a vote if MPs who attended the debate called for one. Badenoch wasthere in 2019when Chris Skidmore, the then energy minister, introduced the target in parliament. Because no objections were raised, there was no vote.InMay last year, Badenoch told parliament the target “happened under a previous Conservative government, but with the consent of the whole house”.The target is ‘impossible’Again, Badenoch has not set out why she believes the target is impossible to meet. The experts on the independent Climate Change Committee set out potential pathways to meet net zero by 2050 earlier this year, describing it as challenging but possible.The CCC said its seventh carbon budget was “an ambitious, deliverable pathway for the UK to reach net zero by 2050, based on detailed modelling of cost-effective, feasible decarbonisation options”.‘Even if we hit absolute zero, we will not have net zero around the world, if other countries are not following us. And they are not’This is untrue. The large majority of the world is signed up to net zero targets: 142 countries covering 76% of all global emissions, 78% of global GDP, and 84% of the world’s population. China and India are accelerating investment in renewable energy, as is the EU, and the the International Energy Agency’sWorld Energy Investment reportsays: “The world now invests almost twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels.”There has ‘never, ever been a detailed plan’ to reach net zeroThe Climate Change Committee, established in 2008, puts out carbon budgets every five years which set out detailed pathways to reach net zero by 2050. The government must respond each time with its plan.The Tory government’s 2021 strategy, for example, was ruled unlawful for failing to properly and in a detailed way set out how it would reduce emissions. It subsequently published more than 3,000 pages of documents detailing the net zero plan. The Labour government is due to submit its next plan by spring 2026.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochClimate crisisConservativesParis climate agreementanalysisShareReuse this content"

Here is a pointless new live-action musical version of theSnow Whitemyth, a kind of un-Wicked approach to the story and a merch-enabling money machine. Where other movies are playfully reimagining the backstories of famous villains, this one plays it straight, but with carefully curated revisionist tweaks. These are all too obviously agonising and backlash-second-guessing, but knowing that at some basic level the brand identity has to be kept pristine. This is particularly evident in the costume design, with which the wicked witch gets a pointy dark crown and skull-hugging black balaclava and Snow White is lumbered with a supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders. Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot are now forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives.Traditionally, the heroine’s name refers to her skin, with lips red as blood and hair dark as ebony; now it refers to the snowstorm that accompanied her birth. Zegler’s Snow White had loving parents in the King and Queen but after her mother’s death her father becomes infatuated with a witchy new noblewoman at court; Gadot’s lips are at all times seductively and contemptuously pursed. But later the King simply vanishes from the story and the script ties itself into a few pretzels explaining what is supposed to have happened to him and when. The stepmom-witch keeps Snow White in Cinderella-style serfdom below stairs where the poor child wanly sympathises with the population’s poverty. As Snow White grows up, the magic mirror breaks the bad news about a change in the prettiness-ranking; Snow White is then forced to flee to the forest and stay there once the huntsman has lied to the witch about killing her. And then she meets her seven new best friends …There are some changes: the hero is no longer a prince, but a more democratic citizen who leads a Robin Hood type insurgency from the forest against the witch’s tyranny with SW joining in on a Maid Marian basis. But he still gets to do the controversial non-consent kiss once our heroine has gone into her picturesque coma. But the dwarves? Will this film make them look sort of like everyone else, like the Munchkins in Wicked? No. This Snow White feebly makes them mo-cap animated figures, but it also – heartsinkingly – duplicates their presence by giving the prince his own gang of seven live-action bandits, in which people with dwarfism are represented. This fudged, pseudo-progressive approach is so tiring you’ll want to put your head in your hands.Admittedly, the basic story has a strangeness of its own. The wicked queen tries to kill Snow White by getting the huntsman to stab her, and then tries again by feeding her a poisoned apple which has an, erm, antidote in the form of a true love’s kiss … and then leaving the corpse in the company of people who love her? Weird.This new Snow White has one or two nice musical moments, but it’s basically in the unhappy tradition of revisionist-lite rebootsMirror MirrorandSnow White and the Huntsmanwith Julia Roberts and Charlize Theron respectively as the witch – and theequally ropey prequel The Huntsman: Winter’s War. Hollywood could in theory reinvent Snow White with some passion; instead, the only decent revival has beenPablo Berger’s surrealist Blancanievesfrom 2013. This feels like a very hard day’s work in the IP diamond mine.Snow White is out on 20 March in Australia and on 21 March in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsFamily filmsMusicalsFilm adaptationsWalt Disney CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not a pretty sight, I grant you, but stick with me. Maybe the Philpster suffers from chafing. Maybe he’s just very insecure and territorial.Either way, his thighs are getting wider apart by the day. Too much farther and he will dislocate his hips. God knows what his shadow cabinet colleagues make of it. By now they must be drawing lots to keep their distance.All of this rather leavesKemi Badenochin no man’s land. She is the rapidly disappearing leader of the opposition. Almost invisible. It’s all somewhat confusing because KemiKaze has a reputation for being combative. Only all the fight appears to have gone out of her. She can’t even be bothered to take herself on. She just sits, slumps, like a sullen teenager. The model of passive aggression.You could be forgiven for thinking that she was on the verge of giving up on herself. That she had achieved what she wanted in becoming Tory leader, but now she’s in the job has found it’s not as much fun as she thought. Too difficult. Too much trouble. No glory.She has even embarked on a programme of self-sabotage. Three times now she has made what she called “keynote speeches” – on defence, borders and net zero – on days when she would have known that everything she said would largely go unnoticed because of other news events. It’s almost as if she wants to fail.Nor is there any sense of direction to the Tories under her leadership, other than to make a vague pitch to Reform voters. She remains blissfully unconcerned about those seats she lost to the Lib Dems.Her only policies – other than ditching net zero commitments – appear to be to have no policies. No wonder so many of her MPs are actively trying to find a way of replacing her. Scheming to get Honest Bob Jenrick in situ instead.Thatdesperate. Perhaps all they need to do is just ask Kemi. They may be pushing at an open door.Not thatKeir Starmeris complaining. He might be making a name for himself on the global stage, but things aren’t going so well on the domestic front. So it helps that he doesn’t have much to worry about in terms of the Tories keeping him busy. He’s got enough trouble on his own backbenches over his planned benefit cuts.Thank God, then for Lee Anderson, providing some light relief in what had been a largely forgettable half-hourIt’s fair to say there wasn’t much warmth coming from his own MPs on Wednesday. The best you could call it was a depressed acceptance. Silence. Not even the toadiest toady could bring themselves to welcome the cuts. No one was putting their head above the parapet to welcome Starmer’s new moral universe. Even theLabourfrontbench faces looked unusually glum. This wasn’t what most of them had come into politics to do.Fail. Fail again. Fail better. Kemi has taken Samuel Beckett’s words to heart. In her first few PMQs she failed badly. Scattergun rambling questions that went nowhere. A month or so in she was still failing, choosing her topics from whatever mad conspiracy theory had happened to grab her attention.Now she has learned to fail better. Failing about as well as anyone could reasonably expect of her. Keeping things short. Choosing questions that were more or less sensible. Though unfortunately not ones that were necessarily to her advantage.Better, yes. But still failing. She began with wondering why we were having an emergency budget next week when Rachel Reeves had described last October’s as a once-in-a-lifetime event. Starmer didn’t demur. He could have pointed out that it was normal to have a spring statement.And so it went on. KemiKaze has yet to realise that the economy is not safe ground for her. Labour might not exactly be turning things around as they had hoped, but no one is yet in the mood to forget that it was the Tories who were responsible for the damage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Looks at her with contempt as he repeats his “£22bn black hole” and “Liz Truss” mantras. By the end, Kemi looked defeated. Couldn’t wait for her allotted six questions to be complete so she could slump back in her seat for another week. That’s if she could manage to squeeze in next to the Philpster.The real danger came first from the SDLP’s Colum Eastwood, who was incandescent about the welfare cuts, citing one disabled constituent who was going to get her benefits cut. What was the point of getting rid of the Tories, he asked, if Labour were going to do this?Starmer doesn’t do shame. Doesn’t do guilt. Everything is squared away in his legal brain. Guilty. Or not guilty. And Keir tends to find himself not guilty. In time, Eastwood’s constituent would come to realise she had been done a favour.Then there wasDiane Abbott. Could we call a spade a spade, she asked? Stop talking about the benefits cuts as a moral crusade? This was all about helping the Treasury to balance its books.Again, Starmer didn’t skip a beat. He had reconfigured the world to suit his own conscience. It was a total coincidence that the cuts would raise £5bn. What really mattered was that morality was being restored. People would rise from their sickbeds and work.Thank God, then for Lee Anderson, providing some light relief in what had been a largely forgettable half-hour. Lee insisted he was the one person to ask a sensible question, only to immediately identify himself as a quarter-wit by wondering how much cooler the world would be if we met our net zero commitments.Fair to say that climate science isn’t his specialist subject. Assuming he has one. But he had one admirer. Kemi couldn’t help but wish she had asked that question herself.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchLabourKeir StarmerChris PhilpConservativesDiane AbbottBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

The hyper-feminised character she projected was like a riposte to the male violence’Interview byAmy FlemingWed 19 Mar 2025 11.06 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 11.07 EDTShareIloved growing up inBelfastbecause it was wild. You’re not supposed to say that, but even though I was working class and we were in the thick of it, I didn’t experience any violence directly. I experienced the warmth of working-class communities on both sides, Catholic and Protestant, and the power of community in the fight for things like justice, fairness and equality. I learned about those principles mostly through women.Belfast was a very patriarchal place, but women always seemed to be the ones making the most sense. If you look at UN statistics for when women are at negotiating tables, the chances of reaching peace agreements are much higher. Then, if they stay at the table, the peace agreement lasts longer. In different parts of the world that I’ve been commissioned to shoot, like Sudan or Beirut, I’ve met many different women but they all have the same ability to cut through the shit, yet they’re not given any power.This was taken in 2023 when I was back in Belfast working on a show of 21 portraits for Ulster museum calledPrincipled and Revolutionary: Northern Irish Peace Women. It was to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. I wanted to capture the often untold stories of the women who were influential to peace-building in Northern Ireland, to pay tribute to their work.If I have an idea for a female protagonist, I go out into the world and hope our paths crossWhile I was there, in my head I was carrying this image with a mural that I kept suppressing, because it’s a tourist image in a way. My process is that if I have an idea for a particular female protagonist, I will go into the world and hope our paths will cross. I was in a vintage shop and this girl walked in looking exactly as she looks in the picture. She seemed so strong, so forceful to be going through Belfast dressed like this, and probably putting up with a lot of shit from the street because of it.I thought: “You’re amazing.” Projecting this hyper-feminised character, she was a real “Fuck you” to the male violence and oppression. I gave her my card, told her how much she’d get paid, what the picture would be about, and to go home and look me up and think about it. But she said yes right away. The next day, we walked around Belfast and talked about her life, and she was everything that I was projecting on to her. She wasn’t afraid of authority, like me when I was young. I think that might be quite a Belfast, Northern-Irish thing.A touch of class: an authentic glimpse of Britain – in picturesRead moreEventually, I decided I needed a mural, because the image I wanted to create was about male aggression and control. We went to an area called Sandy Row, which used to be a very Protestant area. The mural was on the wrong side of the street, because I knew I had to point the camera in the direction of those dark skies, with the sunlight and then the seagulls coming from the port that, for me, is Belfast. I knew this was a lucky picture. When you’re making a picture, you’re hoping the gods of photography are with you. There’s a transcendence that happens. I chose the frame that seemed most strident – and then, in Photoshop, I lifted the mural from one side of the street and put it on to the other.I’m not a documentary photographer. I am interested in cinema and how you elicit emotion. I’ve always constructed images, to extend the narrative of the picture and remind the viewer that photography is a constructed medium. These pictures are exhibited large on a gallery wall. You can stand and look at all the details, and think about how you have derived meaning from these clues – and see how photography manipulates us.After the End of History: British Working Class Photography 1989 – 2024 is atStills Gallery, Edinburghfrom 21 March until 28 JuneView image in fullscreenPhotograph: @maureenpaleyHannah Starkey’s CVBorn:Belfast, 1971Trained:Edinburgh Napier University Edinburgh, Royal College of Art London.Influences:“Women and photography.”High point:“There have been many.

But there’s a grand tradition of leaving a restaurant with your leftovers.Maybe in the US, where portions are traditionally larger. But they’ve never really caught on in the UK.Why is that?Well, it could be down to a number of factors. First, there’s the intrinsic shame of asking a waiter to put your leftovers in a box.What else?It just isn’t very romantic, is it? A good restaurant is as much about lighting and ambience and service as it is food. Going home with half a steak sloshing about in cold gravy in a polystyrene tray isn’t really the same.But I thoughtdoggie bags were back.That’s what they said a couple of years ago. Even high-end places such as the Fat Duck were offering leftovers to go in a bid to cut down on food waste. But when was the last time you saw people leave a restaurant with their food in a bag?Good point.Anyway, the US – the spiritual home of the doggie bag – seems to be falling out of love with the practice too.A recent piecein the New York Times claims fewer people are asking to take their food home.Why?Some say that it’s a generational thing, with food-ordering services meaning that people are less inclined to eat day-old food. Others suggest that if large groups of people share food, then deciding who gets to take what home becomes a logistical nightmare.But what about the food waste?Well, that really is a problem. It’s estimated that the average American leaves 24kg of food on their plates every year, at a cost of $329 (£254).So you agree,doggie bags are a good thing after all.Well, perhaps. Even France – a country that doesn’t have a French name for “les doggie bags” – is trying to encourage their use to cut down on waste.Glad we’re on the same page.Another way to cut down on waste would be to just make each serving small enough for a person to eat in a single sitting.Where’s the fun in that?Listen, some of us know our own limits. We don’t rock up to restaurants with the expectation that we’re about to Man v Food our way to a clogged colon.Speak for yourself.You’re disgusting.Do say:“Package up my leftovers, please.”Don’t say:“Please make it extra congealed.”Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsPass notesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After having a baby during the pandemic, the data analyst from the north of England is now expected to spend 40% of her working week in the office, a rule enforced by her employer since January.“I’m struggling with the requirements for office time and it’s meaning I have much less free time and am feeling constantly stressed,” she said. “The reality is that I’d need to leave my job if I had to be in the office full-time.”Despite working part-time, combining a long commute with nursery drop-off and pickup is proving tricky, especially as her husband’s job is not flexible.Even though her manager is pleased with her performance, he is unable to change what he considers a “stupid policy”, which Jessica views as “an arbitrary rule imposed by senior leaders who have very different roles”.Over the past few years, Jessica and millions of other office-based workers like her have benefited from the post-pandemic rise in home working, and are now grappling with employers’ enforcement of office attendance or fresh return-to-office mandates.When thefirst lockdown was calledin March 2020, millions of office-based workers were hurriedly packed off home with their laptops, from where they would spend much of the next year carrying out their roles from their kitchen tables, spare bedrooms or even garden sheds.Thismay not have done wonders for workers’ backs(ONS data charts a big rise in the number of people found unfit for work because of neck and back injuries), yet for many the temporary measure has proved permanent.View image in fullscreenWorking from home has not been good for backs.Photograph: Guerilla/AlamyMany employers saw the proof that staff could work efficiently from home;productivity remained the same, or even increased at some organisations. Meanwhile, workers got a taste of life without the commute, enjoying more time for family or hobbies and a better work-life balance.While remote working is not possible for all professions – prompting warnings from analysts that Britain issplitting into a two-tier workforce– professionals who are able to carry out their jobs remotely for some of the week have come to regard this as a right rather than a perk.“Pre-Covid, people were at their wits’ end,” said Christine Armstrong, a researcher in the future of work. “In the last 20 years, office days have expanded, with laptops, BlackBerrys, mobiles, conference calls at 10 o’clock at night with international colleagues.”Enforced home working “showed people there was an alternative”, she said. “In almost every group of workers if there is the ability to have some flexibility they are keen to have it. Obviously it suits working parents, and particularly working dads.”Once the lockdowns were lifted, the vast majority of organisations settled in to a hybrid model – with the working week split between the office and home, or another location.While the proportion of people working only from home has dropped from its lockdown peak – 37% in February 2021 to a third of that figure in late 2024 – the proportion of people hybrid working has remained relatively stable at 28%.WFH chartHybrid working is now more common for certain groups, including people with higher qualifications, those working as managers or professionals, parents, and people aged over 30.Research by the commercial property analytics company CoStar found that in the early months of 2020, offices were as full as they had been in more than a decade, with 4.5% of office space vacant. By winter 2024, this number had nearly doubled to 8.6%. The highest rate of vacancies is in London and Scotland, where 10% of office space is empty, according to the report.Vacant office space graphThe “working from home debate” seemed settled: the future was hybrid. Then, last summer, came a flurry of return-to-office mandates from a string of large corporatesincluding Asda, BT andKPMG. Amazonwent one step furtherand hauled staff back to their desks five days a week.This sparked enormous tension in the workforce, said Armstrong, as the bosses calling for office attendance stressed how cooperation and collaboration was fostered by bringing teams together under one roof.So far, a refusal to return to the office has not faced many legal tests, and few analysts expect employers to fire reliable workers over the issue. In the race for talent, recruiters report that those employers demanding higher office attendancereceive fewer candidates for vacancies, or have to pay a premium.The balance of power between leaders and their staff may, however, shift further underLabour’s employment rights bill, which could make flexible working the default option for workers from day one on the job.For many workers, less frequent office working equals less money spent on commuting, which became vital for some during the cost of living crisis that followed the pandemic.View image in fullscreenCommuters on a London underground train.Photograph: John Williams/AlamyHowever, cheaper fares don’t appear to hold the key to enticing more workers back to their desks. Transport for London’s2024 trial of charging off-peak only faresall day on Fridays across London Underground and other rail lines was deemed to have made no noticeable difference. TfL wanted to know if cheaper tickets would boost passenger numbers – and the capital’s economy – after the Friday morning rush-hour had remained stubbornly quieter than other weekdays since Covid.Office workers’ desire tobookend a “core” week in the office– Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays – with home working on either side has also had an impact on city centre pubs, bars and restaurants.Walk past many central hospitality venues on a Thursday evening, and it’s clear the traditional Friday night drink with colleagues, once the entry to the weekend, has been swapped for aThursday post-office get-togetherbefore the final commute home of the week.“Something really dramatic happened to change consumer behaviour during Covid in a way that I have never seen in the last 30 years, and a big part of it was the ability to work from home,” said entrepreneur Sarah Willingham, who previously owned the Bombay Bicycle Club chain of Indian restaurants.View image in fullscreenSarah Willingham, hospitality entrepreneur and owner of Nightcap.Photograph: Nicky JohnstonShe launched her latest venture, the Nightcap hospitality group – owner of bar chains including The Cocktail Club and Dirty Martini, as well as Brighton’s i360 tower – during the pandemic, and has witnessed the ensuing “revolution” in how customers socialise.Socialising chart“We can see it in the bars, Thursday night is much bigger than it used to be, but Friday night is still bigger,” she said, adding this was particularly evident at City of London venues.Another unexpected Covid hangover for hospitality is customers’ desire to reserve a table in advance, Willingham said, rather than spontaneously turning up at a venue.While eating and drinking with friends remains as popular as it was before the pandemic, smaller numbers of people are hitting the dancefloor. Thefinal song has been played at hundreds of nightclubsover the past decade, leaving 831 venues across Great Britain in September 2024, almost 1,000 fewer than in 2013. The pandemic sped up their decline, causing more than a third of Britain’s clubs to fall silent, the Night Time Industries Association has said – although recent figures suggest the picture could be improving, with 14 cities seeing an increase in numbers between December 2023 and December 2024.Nightclubs chartMore than 17,000 of the UK’s licensed venues, including pubs, restaurants and hotels, were unable to survive the months of enforced closure, or the subsequent repayment of Covid-era loans, closing their doors for good during the five years after December 2019, according to analysts CGA via NIQ for their hospitality market monitor. The number of new venues being opened each year has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.The hospitality sector was “devastated” by Covid, according to Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade body UKHospitality, and has fought hard to meet its customers’ changing needs.Throughout the tumult of the past few years, consumers’ desire to socialise with colleagues or friends has not diminished. “But hospitality has had to adapt to changing working patterns and consumer behaviour to ensure it is delivering for the public, who still list eating and drinking out as one of their priorities,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUK newsHow Covid changed usWork-life balanceWork & careersWorking from homeHospitality industryCoronavirusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Worried about the animal’s proximity to humans, plans for translocation were made: removing it to an undisturbed forest habitat, far from human settlements, where it could peacefully live in the treetops. But when they finally identified the 20-year-old male, they found it had been relocated before, but, instead of settling in the new site it had travelled about 130km (80miles) away.Researchers are starting to realise that many great apes struggle when they are moved far from their homes, despite well-intentioned efforts to protect them.Orangutans are commonly moved by authorities inMalaysiaand Indonesia if they are judged to be threatened by forest fires, damaging crops or in danger from human development. But a new study of nearly a thousand translocations in Indonesia between 2005 and 2022 has raised fears that the practice is doing more harm than good, often leaving orangutans lost, hungry and in conflict with incumbents. Many make the journey home, travelling more than 100km back to the places they grew up.View image in fullscreenA sedated adult male orangutan is transported through a palm oil plantation by staff from the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Program in 2012.Photograph: Paul Hilton/AFP/Getty Images“Some of these animals are really old. In one instance, a 60-year-old male was moved. To you and me, that’s like if someone kidnaps your grandpa and knocks him out, blindfolds him, drives him miles away from his neighbourhood, and then drops him off in some city he’s never seen, where the people are unhappy to see him and might be aggressive,” says lead author Julie Sherman, the director ofWildlifeImpact.‘Humans everywhere’: lions cling on in Ethiopia’s last patches of wildernessRead moreThe analysis has found that nearly a third of captured orangutans make their way back to their original capture site. Mothers and their infants are sometimes separated, threatening the survival of young orangutans that spend up to nine years as a dependant, according to the study published in the journal Plos One. More than 80% of animals were healthy when captured, scientists say, raising concerns about whether many translocations were necessary in first place.“Moving animals away and out of sight may be convenient for humans but it is taking its toll on these majestic animals,” says Serge Wich, a professor of biology at Liverpool John Moores University and an author on the study.View image in fullscreenBorneo orangutans amid fallen trees on a Salat island Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, amid smoke from forest fires in September, 2019.Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Getty ImagesOrangutans are among our closest relatives in the natural world, and were once widespread across southeast Asia. The last of the great apes are now found on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, clinging on in the remaining fragments of forest and classified as critically endangered. Amid fears of a fresh wave of palm oil plantation expansion in the region, conservationists are working out the best methods to protect the three orangutan species: Bornean, Sumatran and Tapanuli. While all have experienced dramatic declines in recent years, the Bornean is the most common, withabout 105,000 remaining. There are about 14,000 Sumatran orangutans, and the Tapanuli orangutan is the most endangered great ape in the world, numbering just 800 in an isolated part of Sumatra.The researchers reviewed news stories, government reports and scientific research to make the assessment. They warn that the policy of moving the great apes – sometimes far from their original territories – was disrupting orangutan social structures. Females typically live in small rainforest territories of about 8 sq km (3 sq miles). Males have larger territories, visiting several females, and are often solitary. When moved to unfamiliar areas, orangutans sometimes struggle to find food and are immediately in competition with unfriendly neighbours, according to the study.View image in fullscreenA wild orangutan is spotted in a tree during a rescue and release operation for orangutans trapped in a swath of jungle by forest fires in Sungai Mangkutub, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2016.Photograph: Dita Alangkara/APMore than 75% of orangutans live outside protected areas, and can exist happily between fragmented areas of forest, cropland and plantations, meaning that people sometimes stumble upon them in unexpected places. In Indonesia, the government and wildlife sanctuaries oversee the capture and movement of the animals. The Indonesian government did not respond to request for comment from the Guardian.Wich says that more effort is required to encourage people living on forest edges to coexist with the great apes instead of moving them to unfamiliar areas.“It is really key that we work with local communities and companies to find a solution for this. This is not a sustainable way for the future. We can’t capture all the animals that are on the edge of the forest. There’s going to be more and more forest edges, unfortunately, as development continues and roads come in. We need to find a way to keep animals where they are and manage them in a matrix of forest, oil palm and community gardens. Otherwise, we’ll end up with very small populations in bits of forests,” says Wich.View image in fullscreenCaptured orangutans , which entered a village looking for food, are tied to the ground as people look on in Sungai Pinyuh, Indonesia’s West Kalimantan province, November 2010.Photograph: Stringer Indonesia / Reuters/ReutersSeparate modellingabout the impact of translocations and killings has raised fears about the future viability of orangutans over the next 250 years. They are slow to reproduce, with females reaching sexual maturity at between 10 and 15 years, typically having babies every decade. The combination of moving adults and killing them could result in large population falls, researchers warn.Sherman says inspiration could be drawn from an unlikely source. “We [need to] make it feasible for people and orangutans to coexist alongside each other, akin to how it is with foxes in the UK,” she says. “You could kill them all, move them all. Or, find a way to coexist with them – because they’re happy using the spaces that we are in.”Explore more on these topicsAnimalsThe age of extinctionConservationEndangered speciesEndangered habitatsWildlifeIndonesiaMalaysiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was very depressed. It was all going to end very badly indeed for me.” Banfield – who has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and autism, and was being bullied at school – thought of taking her life. But then, aged 13, she was enrolled by her mum in a six-week surfing course run bythe Wave Project, which helps to improve children’s confidence and ease their anxiety through riding breakers. It was a pivotal moment, not least because Banfield was about to be excluded from school.Her first surf class was a disaster, though. “I ran away and locked myself in the car. I had a phobia of water. I couldn’t stand it on my skin.” But something – perhaps the sense that there was “no pressure” – brought her back. “When I went up on my first wave, I felt free for the first time in my life.” This liberation turned her life around. “I went back into education and, though I left school with no GCSEs, I got a masters in marine biology.Surfinggave me confidence.”There aren’t many sports where you could be eaten by a wild animalIt gave her more than that – it gave her gold. Banfield’s medal-winning achievement is celebrated in Surf! 100 Years of Waveriding inCornwall, an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall (NMMC) in Falmouth, her home town. “It was an honour when I won a gold and beyond an honour to get mentioned in this museum,” says the 26-year-old as we chat in its cafe. “I used to come here on school trips. I remember hiding from teachers in the boats on display.”Although surfing dates back thousands of years, and is particularly associated with Polynesians who settled in Hawaii about 400AD, the pursuit has become as much part of Cornwall’s heritage as pasties, piracy and painting. There is a Cornish word that helps explain why: “mordros”, meaning the ever-present sound of the sea. You don’t get that in Wolverhampton. Then there’s the light. “In Cornwall,” writes geographer Dr Sam Bleakley, “we are bathed in reflected light from the Atlantic.”View image in fullscreenHang 100 … the record-breaking surfboard at Fistral beach in 1999.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/Bleakley, a European longboard champion and senior lecturer in cultural tourism at Falmouth University, curated the show at the NMMC. He says surfing is different in Cornwall, thanks to the soft sandy beaches that dot its 422 miles (680km) of surfable coastline from Bude to Falmouth. “You can ride in the shallows in a way that is different from the surf breaks of Polynesia,” he says. What’s more, this county is wide open to the Atlantic swell all year round. One of the great pleasures, says Cornish-born former pro Robyn Davies, is rising up on a wave that has travelled 4,000 miles across the ocean before smashing into Porthleven, Porthmeor, Penzance or Perranporth.The history the show tells is of a Cornish surf culture rising on a tide swollen by foreign influences. What Bleakley calls the “tin-mining diaspora” witnessed surfing in Tahiti, Hawaii, west and south Africa – not least off Muizenberg near Cape Town, where Agatha Christie reportedly surfed in 1922. Boards and the surf bug came back with these travellers and, by 1937, the railways were advertising glorious, sun-drenched surfing holidays in the West Country.During the second world war, US troops stationed at RAF St Mawgan near Newquay reportedly enchanted locals with their daredevil techniques. But it was four Australian lifeguards – Bob Head, Ian Tiley, John Campbell and Warren Mitchell – who revolutionised surfing in Cornwall when they arrived 63 years ago, astounding Newquay locals with their “hotdog surfing” on fibreglass longboards. To the sound of the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean playing from pirate radio stations, surfing became part of the swinging 60s.View image in fullscreenUnique light … professional longboarder Izzy Henshall at Cornwall’s Sennen Cove.Photograph: Luke GartsideSurfboard artisans sprang up, their slick creations now celebrated in the show. Among them is Chris “CJ” Jones who sculpted boards from wood, carbon fibre, paint and even recycled plastics. “They were and remain works of art,” says Stuart Slade, NMM’s director as he shows me around.By the late 1960s, Newquay was being branded as Surf City – and Cornwall as Britain’s California. That said, surfing was once banned after feuding gangs of bodyboarders and longboarders (surfing’s equivalent of mods and rockers) brawled on the beaches of Newquay. Ostensibly the most chillaxed of pastimes, surfing became regarded by some as a violent threat to public order.This is one of the many tensions explored in the show. Surfing is both a tourist money spinner and counter-cultural lifestyle. It has also involved the Californication of Cornwall, pitting swinging surfers against strait-laced stuffed shirts. Ever since surfing became an Olympic sport in 2020, another tension has become clear. Is waveriding, like skateboarding or BMX-ing, fundamentally a sport whose essentially rebellious nature can only get lost in the competition for medals or world records?Whatever the answer, Cornwall has become a breeding ground for world champions and industries that recognise surfing’s therapeutic benefits and wish to make it a sport for all. On that last point, I am struck by the displays of surf couture in the show, from wet suits so tight they’re almost fetish wear, to a loose-fitting, body-covering surfing hijab designed by local firm Finisterre.View image in fullscreen‘Times seems to extend’ … Cornwall’s Robyn Davies rides waves in the Indian Ocean.Photograph: Courtesy O’Neill © T. GibaudBleakley’s nicest conceit is to tell the story of the past 100 years through 100 surfboards. One is a coffinboard, so named because in the 1920s the first bodyboards were made by carpenters who specialised in coffins. There’s a photo of one being held by a female surfer at Fistral beach in 1926, sticking it to West Country patriarchs who deemed surfing unsuitable for women.By contrast, there’s a wall of gleaming lacquered boards, one designed by Damien Hirst, whose former partner, California-born Maia Norman, is a keen surfer. Hirst’s designs were auctioned in 2003 for the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage. Nearby, we encounter a surfboard found in a Newquay garden and dusted off for the show. Once the world’s longest board, it’s 37ft long and looks like the kind of thing Team GB would use if the six-person bobsleigh ever switched to the sea.For all the show’s surf positivity, Banfield’s rise suffered setbacks, not least in 2021 when a seizure hit during a surf competition in California. “It was so humiliating,” she says. “I was underwater for a minute and couldn’t move. My body felt so heavy. I had to be helped by another surfer.”View image in fullscreenSticking it to West Country patriarchs… female surfers in Watergate Bay in 1950.Photograph: courtesy of Alex Williams collection.Worse was to come. “I was banned from competition until I got my epilepsy under control. That made me incredibly depressed. I went to a very dark place. I tried to take my own life. It was very clear to me that the ocean had kept me sane. When I go in the water, my mind becomes completely calm.”Happily, with some coaching and medication adjustments, Banfield was able to start competing again. Last year, she won another gold at the world championships. “I still have bad days,” she says. “When I do, I get my surfboard, get my wetsuit, get in the car and go.”Davies, many times national surfing champion, echoes this sentiment. “Surfing’s almost a spiritual experience. It’s humbling – because you find out very quickly that you can’t master nature. But the very present danger is also an adrenaline rush. The epitome of this is when you get barrelled.” Eh? She cups her fingers to show me: barrelling means riding inside a hollowed-out breaking wave. “Time seems to extend. You feel like you’ve been in there for ages when it’s scarcely been seconds. It’s pure stoke. Epic.”I hit bottom and pushed off with my feet – only to hit rock. I thought I was going to drownIt also sounds quite dangerous. “It is – but then surfing is dangerous and exhilarating at the same time. There aren’t many sports where you could be eaten by a wild animal. I’ve seen sharks, which is scary. And, in Mexico, I’ve been very close to whales breaching.” This is when they propel their bodies out of the water and land back on the surface with explosive force. Davies lists more dangers: “Seals have nibbled my toes.” That doesn’t sound too scary, I say. “They were really big seals,” she replies.Then there was the time she wiped out at Pipeline in Hawaii, a reef break notorious for rip currents and underwater caves. “I hit bottom and pushed off with my feet – only to hit rock. I thought I was going to drown, until I saw a gap and managed to swim to the surface.”A car crash ended Davies’s competitive career, but she still longboards and insists that it’s never too late to learn. “I taught an 80-year-old woman whose dream it was to stand on a board. She did it! I’m not saying it’s easy, though. When you swim out to where the waves are, through foaming white water, it’s hard – but it’s worth it. I’ve never felt a connection with nature like it. I’ve never felt so good as when I’m surfing.”Surf!is at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, Falmouth, 28 March to January 2027.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Here’s all the stuff you need – and the bits not worth wasting your money on.Everything you need to start knittingYarnIt’s easy to get overwhelmed when it comes to yarn: which fibre? How thick? What colour? Superwash (this means the natural fibre has been chemically treated to withstand gentle machine washing without felting or shrinking) or not?Different types of fibre feel different to work with. For instance, plant-based fibres such as cotton and linen have little elasticity and can be hard on the hands. Sheep’s wool has more give, but depending on the breedand how it’s spun, it has varying levels of softness. Alpaca yarn has plenty of give and is buttery soft, but can be a bit slippery to work with. When starting out, sheep’s wool is your friend.‘Knitting is a lifeline’: young people turn to craft to cast off gloomRead morePrices vary wildly. As a beginner, you don’t need to splurge out. Knitwear designer Enya Ødegaard suggests affordable woollen yarn for beginners because it “can be ripped back [undone] many times easily without damaging the yarn, whereas hairy and delicate yarns such as mohair are harder to undo, and the yarn will not be as nice afterwards”.All yarn comes with information about what needle size is recommended, so try to find a DK (double knit) weight, which requires a needle size of approximately 4mm. It’s thick enough to show clear stitch definition and easy to handle.Drops LimaandMerino extra fineare affordable choices with a good colour range, as isCaMaRose Hverdagsuld.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Wool WarehouseBeginners’ yarns£3.35 at the Wool Factory£4.50 at Loop KnittingNeedlesMost people think knitting is done with two straight needles, but the circular needle – that is, two needles joined by a cable – is more popular within the knitting community. This is because they allow you to make flat pieces of fabric and tubes, such as for hats, mittens and socks.A 4mm or 5mm circular needle with a 40cm cable will cover most beginners’ needs. With that, you can make sample squares, hats, scarves and mittens. Bamboo needles are less slippery than metal, so there’s less chance of dropping stitches. Metal needles are good for fast knitting as there is less friction between the yarn and the needle, but they’re better suited to more experienced knitters.KnitProBasix Birch orKnitPro Symfonie40cm needles are good circular choices.

They also come in handy for more advanced techniques such as the sewn tubular castoff, a type of castoff that’s sewn rather than knitted, giving edges more stretch and a neater finish.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Wool WarehouseTapestry needle set£1.69 at Wool Warehouse£1.99 at McIntoshOther inexpensive useful tools such as stitch markers (I have a personal preference forgourd safety pinsbecause they’re cheap and removable) are helpful to keep count of your stitches and to mark different sections.

But these aren’t essential for beginners. You also don’t need stitch holders (used to hold live stitches) or cable needles(used to make cables in knitting) at first.What to makeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: My Favourite ThingsI would recommend simple but small patterns, such as tiny scarves. TheSophie scarfby PetiteKnit is a popular choice for a reason: it’s a simple garter stitch scarf (this means you only use the knit stitch, no purls) with tapered ends, which is relatively speedy to make and requires less than one ball of yarn. Other designs includeScarf No 1 by My Favourite Things(above), a triangular scarf with some simple lace, andLe Bandana by Aimée Gille, a triangular bandana that can be customised with stripes of different colours.Purl Sohohas a good range of free beginner-friendly patterns.Tips and tricksView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Purl SohoIt takes practice to get even tension (all the stitches of an even size) when you’re starting out. Beginners often knit tightly, but as you get more confident and relax into the repetitive motion of knitting, this will improve. All knitting patterns are made with two basic stitches: the knit and the purl. Armed with these two stitches and a few simple techniques for increasing and decreasing the number of stitches, you can do a lot.Mistakes are inevitable, but luckily they are (almost) all fixable. Even experienced knitters drop stitches, knit instead of purl, or forget an increase here or a decrease there. Understanding how to read your work and fix errors is not always easy when you’re new, but try to look at your knitting and identify which stitches are knits, which are purls and why they look different.Most knitting patterns will refer to gauge at some point. This refers to the density of stitches and rows, and it’s important to follow if you want a pattern to fit properly, but less important for items such as scarves and blankets.ResourcesRavelryis a social platform for knitters and crocheters, with a database containing millions of patterns. You can browse other people’s projects, see what yarns are good for a pattern, and join groups and communities.YouTube is an invaluable resource to get started.Very Pink KnitsandNimble Needleshave many clear tutorials with good explanations.Elise Damstra is an obsessive knitter, knitwear designer and podcaster behind thePurls Before Thymepodcast.

I am writing to you from a detention facility in Louisiana where I wake to cold mornings and spend long days bearing witness to the quiet injustices under way against a great many people precluded from the protections of the law.Who has the right to have rights? It is certainly not the humans crowded into the cells here. It isn’t the Senegalese man I met who has been deprived of his liberty for a year, his legal situation in limbo and his family an ocean away. It isn’t the 21-year-old detainee I met who stepped foot in this country at age nine, only to be deported without so much as a hearing.Justice escapes the contours of this nation’s immigration facilities.‘I am a political prisoner’: Mahmoud Khalil says he’s being targeted for political beliefsRead moreOn March 8, I was taken by DHS [the Department of Homeland Security] agents who refused to provide a warrant, and accosted my wife and me as we returned from dinner. By now, the footage of that night has been made public. Before I knew what was happening, agents handcuffed and forced me into an unmarked car. At that moment, my only concern was for Noor’s safety. I had no idea if she would be taken too, since the agents had threatened to arrest her for not leaving my side. DHS would not tell me anything for hours – I did not know the cause of my arrest or if I was facing immediate deportation. At 26 Federal Plaza, I slept on the cold floor. In the early morning hours, agents transported me to another facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. There, I slept on the ground and was refused a blanket despite my request.My arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza, which resumed in full force Monday night. With January’s ceasefire now broken, parents in Gaza are once again cradling too-small shrouds, and families are forced to weigh starvation and displacement against bombs. It is our moral imperative to persist in the struggle for their complete freedom.Judge orders Mahmoud Khalil case to be moved from Louisiana to New JerseyRead moreI was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria to a family which has been displaced from their land since the 1948 Nakba. I spent my youth in proximity to yet distant from my homeland. But being Palestinian is an experience that transcends borders. I see in my circumstances similarities to Israel’s use of administrative detention – imprisonment without trial or charge – to strip Palestinians of their rights. I think of our friend Omar Khatib, who was incarcerated without charge or trial by Israel as he returned home from travel. I think of Gaza hospital director and pediatrician Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, who was taken captive by the Israeli military on December 27 and remains in an Israeli torture camp today. For Palestinians, imprisonment without due process is commonplace.I have always believed that my duty is not only to liberate myself from the oppressor, but also to liberate my oppressors from their hatred and fear. My unjust detention is indicative of the anti-Palestinian racism that both the Biden and Trump administrations have demonstrated over the past 16 months as the US has continued to supply Israel with weapons to kill Palestinians and prevented international intervention. For decades, anti-Palestinian racism has driven efforts to expand US laws and practices that are used to violently repress Palestinians, Arab Americans, and other communities. That is precisely why I am being targeted.While I await legal decisions that hold the futures of my wife and child in the balance, those who enabled my targeting remain comfortably at Columbia University. Presidents [Minouche]Shafik, [Katrina] Armstrong, and Dean [Keren] Yarhi-Milo laid the groundwork for the US government to target me by arbitrarily disciplining pro-Palestinian students and allowing viral doxing campaigns – based on racism and disinformation – to go unchecked.‘I could be next’: international students at Columbia University feel ‘targeted’ after Mahmoud Khalil’s arrestRead moreColumbia targeted me for my activism, creating a new authoritarian disciplinary office to bypass due process and silence students criticizing Israel. Columbia surrendered to federal pressure by disclosing student records to Congress and yielding to the Trump administration’s latest threats. My arrest, the expulsion or suspension of at least 22 Columbia students – some stripped of their BA degrees just weeks before graduation – and the expulsion of SWC [Student Workers of Columbia] President Grant Miner on the eve of contract negotiations, are clear examples.If anything, my detention is a testament to the strength of the student movement in shifting public opinion toward Palestinian liberation. Students have long been at the forefront of change – leading the charge against the Vietnam war, standing on the frontlines of the civil rights movement, and driving the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. Today, too, even if the public has yet to fully grasp it, it is students who steer us toward truth and justice.The Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent. Visa holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs. In the weeks ahead, students, advocates, and elected officials must unite to defend the right to protest for Palestine. At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all.Knowing fully that this moment transcends my individual circumstances, I hope nonetheless to be free to witness the birth of my first-born child.This statement was originally publishedhereExplore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilOpinionTrump administrationUS immigrationIsrael-Gaza warUS campus protestsUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

And here I am, booming out from the radioWed 19 Mar 2025 12.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 13.05 EDTShareThe sound of the penny dropping was so loud it hurt. This was upon learning how noise knackers you, mentally and physically. Charlotte Clark, a professor of environmental epidemiology, didn’t put it quite like that, but I heard her loud and clear. She points out that our emotional response to sound is an aspect of our fight-or-flight response, evolved to get us up to speed when danger announces itself. A big noise equals big danger, possibly.Back in the day I suppose this might have amounted to a lion roaring, or an angry neighbour clubbing the door to your cave, swearing vengeance about nicking his kindling or something. I can’t think of many other loud noises our ancestors would have had to endure. Thunder must have scared the bejesus out of them – but otherwise, when it came to noise, I think they had it rather easy.I’d like to see them give modern life a try. The noise, the sheer racket, the crashes, bangs and wallops, the engines, the yelling, the bings and bongs of phone alerts. Oh, we’re alert, all right – don’t worry about that. We are all, as my Jewish friends might put it, on shpilkes. On shpilkes all day, every day.And no wonder, because into our ears all these cursed sounds go, torrents of them rushing into our amygdalas, the bit of our brains responsible for deciding whether the panic button needs to be pressed. And this, logically enough, asProf Clark told James Gallagherof the BBC World Service, means: “Your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones.”Equally logically, this isn’t good for you. “If you’re exposed for several years, your body’s reacting like that all the time,” she says. “It increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes.”Maybe this is part of getting old. I don’t recall feeling this way when I was youngerI knew I found noise annoying; I didn’t realise it might be making me ill. If I was Prof Clark, to hammer this point home I’d assemble a huge tower of Marshall speakers and boom out the message: the din is destroying us. The planet needs shushing.Our world’s getting noisier. Population growth and urbanisation are factors. Literally, as well as metaphorically, we’re shouting over each other. And I don’t discount my own contribution. I’m told my voice carries a long way, at a volume inversely proportionate to the importance of what I have to say. Furthermore, I’ve had the temerity to boom out from televisions and radios all these years. Sorry about that.Noise begets more noise. It’s as if we’re all in one of those bars or restaurants that, like most, has dispensed with soft furnishings. Everywhere is wood and metal. Even when these places are quiet, they’re noisy. The scrape of a chair goes right through you. Then the people arrive and it gets really noisy, really quickly.It only needs a handful of people to raise their voices a little and everyone else has to raise theirs. The shouting match is under way. Before long, the cave dwellers deep inside us are losing their minds. I say bring back the carpets and the curtains. We need the chintz back in play to help us pipe down.Should I worry about noise pollution?Read moreI acknowledge the possibility that all this is part of getting old. I don’t recall feeling this way when I was younger, at least consciously – maybe the caveman inside me had his fingers in his ears even then. But as far as the conscious me was concerned, I think noise spoke of life, of energy, of things happening, of excitement, of possibilities.It’s a strange young man indeed who goes round saying that all he really wants is a bit of peace and quiet. That’s the kind of thing my grandparents said, although by then, to a lesser or greater extent, they were miserably hard of hearing – that most unwelcome late-life access to a little more silence. And it’s no wonder that’s how we end up, given the hammering our ears and brains have to take all our lives. I’ll shut up now. I’ve done enough shouting.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionPollutioncommentShareReuse this content"

But eligibility for the benefit will be severely tightened. It is thought the move will deny support to about 1 million disabled people, including those who need help with washing, dressing themselves and ­eating.The long-hated work capability assessment will be scrapped, with all extra health support to come via Pip. The basic rate of universal credit (UC) will be raised for those able to seek work, while the highest level of UC – for the most disabled or ill people who have been found not fit to work – will go down for new claimants. New claimants with “the most severe, lifelong health conditions”, who will never be able to work, will see their incomes protected through an additional premium as well as an end to reassessments – but young people under the age of 22 could miss out on the health top up payment entirely.Added up, the package amounts to £5bn worth of cuts – the largest since George Osborneslashed benefits supporta decade ago.With the benefits bill rising and a record number of people off work owing to long-term illness, the government is banking on all this sounding reasonable. Surely everyone who can work should? But expose the plans to the most basic facts and they’re rotten with contradictions and cruelty.Even with the U-turn, the bulk of the cuts will fall on the Pip budget, despite the benefit having nothing to do with employment. Indeed, removing Pip – which is often used to pay for taxis, mobility aids and care staff – is more likely to push disabled people out of employment. Pip is also a “gateway benefit”, and ministers are yet to address whether those losing it could see their families lose vital carer’s allowance too.Meanwhile, the plan to reduce UC for thewhole “unfit to work category”will hit many severely ill and disabled people who will not be protected by the new premium. Ministers say this will “incentivise” people to stay in the work-search group, as if the reason a teacher confined to bed with ME quit her job is that she’s just not incentivised enough.This is austerity dressed up as reform, where the government cuts the money disabled people need to live on in order to balance the books, while claiming it’s all being done to help them.We have been here before. Over the past 15 years, successive coalition and Conservative governmentsrepeatedly targeted disability benefitsandother supportdisabled people rely on. I have documented the toll in these pages: thedistress, thedestitutionand thedeaths.Many of the same people reading headlines today about how their income will be stripped have already had theirMotabilty cartaken away,lost their adapted hometo the bedroom tax or beenpushed into debtto pay rising social care fees. If the lines you hear ministers parrot on their media rounds to justify these latest cuts sound familiar – that there is no money, that the genuinely disabled will be helped, that there is a duty to work – it is because you have been hearing them off and on for more than a decade. The difference this time round is it is a Labour government saying them.2:05Liz Kendall unveils Labour's 'action to fix the broken benefits system' – videoWe know from the last time we were here that low benefit rates do not get disabled people into work – they just get themto the local food bank. We know divisive rhetoric from politiciansincreases hate crimesagainst disabled people, just as we know austerity doesn’t save the economy money –it actually loses it. Making disabled people poorer or forcing them into work has, funnily enough, never made them better.Pat McFadden, the minister who oversees the royal family’s multibillion-pound estate,remarked on Tuesdaythat “you can’t tax and borrow your way out of the need to reform the state”. But you can tax the super-rich and use the cash to invest in disability support – Labour has simply chosen not to. It is a choice that is bordering on zealotry at this point, a“moral” missioncontrary to theadvice of economists.No Labour MP expected to vote the cuts through in the coming months can pretend they do not know where all this ends: the rules for Pip alone could see up to 1.2 million people lose between £4,200 and £6,300 a year,according to the Resolution Foundation, the majority of whom are already in some of the poorest households in the country. As one reader wrote to me last week: “I [pay a carer] to get help washing my hair and I couldn’t afford this without Pip. I’m so scared of losing support and any dignity and enjoyment in my small life.”Turning on the lights is a luxury in my family. These benefit changes will push us even closer to the edge | BrianRead moreBenefit cuts with a red rosette are in many ways no different from those stained blue. Joints still throb when the heating has to be switched off in winter. Stomachs still pang with hunger when there is only a biscuit for tea. And yet cuts signed off by aLabourchancellor are in a sense particularly brutal. They come with a tinge, not just of fear, but despair and betrayal. There is a feeling that, if this is life under the “good guys”, there really is no hope that anything will get better. Politicians, it turns out, really are all the same. That is the sort of loss that can’t be measured by a Treasury spreadsheet. It is also something that – once lost – is deeply hard to get back.The consequences of this will be a conversation for another day – think growing disfranchisement or ever-declining mental health – but for now, as the announcement of the cuts settles, let us return to what we know. People in this country who are already suffering will be going to bed with more worry tonight. Families who are struggling to pay the bills now will be pushed further below the breadline. Others who have long beenexcluded from everyday lifewill be more isolated and segregated.That it is a Labour government making “the moral case” for taking disabled people’s benefits is as perverse as it is shameful. Change, it turns out, is not coming for everyone.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist. Her latest book,Who Wants Normal?

Khalil, who helped lead the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia university last year, was targeted for his politics. His unlawful arrest by the US immigration enforcement agency comes amidst relentless smears lobbed at protesters of Israel’s war on Gaza. This McCarthyite abduction of a Palestinian Green Card holder is a trial balloon, a test of what society might tolerate and a threat of more to come. And the added horror-show twist to this assault on free speech is that it is being done in the name of Jewish people under the pretence of tackling antisemitism.Such egregious claims are easily refuted. Most American Jews didn’t vote for Trump and don’t back his crackdowns. As Amy Spitalnick of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, one ofmultiple Jewish groups opposing Khalili’s detention, said: “The Trump administration is exploiting real concerns about antisemitism to undercut democracy.” Meanwhile, it is grotesque to pretend that Team Trump, home to antisemitic conspiracy theories,Nazi salutesandHolocaust denialism, is fighting antisemitism, rather than actively reproducing it.But while Khalil’s arrest fits into longstanding attempts to silence pro-Palestine protesters, it is also part of a wider global authoritarianism. US students protesting Israel’s decimation of Gaza have faced relentless bi-partisan furore over antisemitism claimed to be rife within such movements. And pro-Israel groups have lobbied hard to provoke these accusations. But to locate Trump’s crackdown purely within this political arena is to misunderstand the full force of far-right ideology in all its mechanisms.That pro-Israel Jewish groups, or the Israel government are cheering this assault on free speech does not substantively change the dynamics of power at play here. This is not about the impact of pro-Israel Jewish university funders, or aggressively anti-Palestinian alumni groups, or even the prominent Anti-Defamation League. We can – and should – criticise their actions and theirabject moral failurein lining up with Trump. But we can do so without inflating their influence to suggest that authoritarianism in supposed defence of Jewish people is actually being led by Jewish people. For that would be to fall into a divisive trap set by Trump and the global far-right.A key element here is that the far-right has found in its pretend fight against antisemitism the perfect political strategy, a way to divide progressives while at the same time clobbering them. The far-right is using this wedge not just to shut down voices critical of Israel’s serial violence against Palestinians and a war on Gaza described by experts as genocidal, but also to attack so-called wokeism, critical race theory, Black Lives Matter, diversity, equity and inclusion programmes, ‘liberal elites’at universities– in short, all the political enemies in its constructed culture wars.This has long been clear across Europe, where far-right figures from Hungary’s Victor Orban to France’s Marine Le Pen have rehabilitated their political fortunes in part by performatively proclaiming tocare about Jews. This has been achieved by best-friending Israel, bear-hugging its prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a shield against accusations of antisemitism. Wrapped in the Israeli flag, far-right parties with fascist roots and current displays of antisemitism cast themselves as defenders of Jews against an antisemitism claimed to be coming from Muslims and migrants.It’s a terrifically self-serving formulation, since hating Muslims and migrants is the main ideological obsession and rallying cry for the resurgent far-right. We see the same brush strokes in the Heritage Foundation’s Project Esther, a blueprint for Trump’s repressive crackdowns starting with pro-Palestine protesters,penned by Christian Evangelistsand in a claimed defence of Jewish communities.Rolling out this McCarthyist crusade carries an additional and dangerous undercurrent. By stating that authoritarian measures are deployed to fight antisemitism, Trump is scapegoating Jewish people. Creepily, the White House announced its detention of Khalil on X using the Hebrew for goodbye in the all-caps message: “Shalom, Mahmoud.” This narrative, with those in power deflecting blame onto Jewish people, is itself characteristic of antisemitism. And if repressive measures are supposedly about protecting Jews, it inevitably risks generating resentment of Jewish people. All of which is more reason for progressives to not lose sight of who is both instigator and executor of this current crackdown.Jelena Subotić, a professor of political science at Georgia State university who has written aboutfar-right pro-Israel antisemitism, told me that Khali’s detention is “incredibly pernicious because it is pitching Jewish students, or faculty, or anyone identified as Jewish, as the cover for totalitarianism. It is splitting groups along identity lines and dividing people who should be allies.”In the midst of a multi-spectrum assault on democracy, this tests the cohesion of progressive movements. It calls for a firm stand in solidarity with Palestinians while resisting attacks on all minorities, even while one racialised community is set up as the ‘good’ minority in need of protection from the others. As Subotić puts it: “Nobody wants to be the model minority for a fascist regime.”Progressives must now grapple with the way both antisemitism itself and the fight against various political movements labelled as “antisemitism” is being used by the far-right, thereby countering anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and anti-migrant hatred, while also combatting antisemitism. It’s a lot. But every part of it is essential to building an inclusive progressive tent. And keeping everyone together, inside the tent, a mosaic of forces pushing in one direction, is the only rational way to combat fascism.Rachel Shabi is the author of Not the Enemy – Israel’s Jews from Arab Lands and Off-White: The Truth About AntisemitismExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

How convenientRhiannon Lucy CosslettInstead of dismissing huge swaths of the population, how about a nuanced conversation about neurodivergence and mental health?Wed 19 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 04.24 EDTShareIs “overdiagnosis” the new culture-war buzzword of choice? I had been wondering this for a while, and then Wes Streeting claimed on Sunday that there is an “overdiagnosis” of some mental health conditions. Now I am certain it is.I first noticed the term being used in relation to anxiety and depression, then attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and most recently autism. Two books on overdiagnosis, Suzanne O’Sullivan’sThe Age of Diagnosisand Searching for Normal by Sami Timimi, have garnered attention across the media, adding fuel to a new fire that we might characterise as “Bloody everyone has a label these days, don’t they?”.This is not to say that these authors and medical professionals don’t have valid points, or that the medicalisation of societal issues isn’t of concern. We all know how “therapy speak” has leached into public discourse, how teens are now throwing around terms such as “trauma response” and “stimming” – lifted from earnest TikToks – with a confidence that must seem startling to some of their elders, who grew up with the idea that you only went to a shrink or a counsellor if there was something “wrong” with you, or you were about to get divorced.There is a generational aspect here, though really the divide is determined by our openness to examining our mental health. In some households, a faultline can develop between those who have had a diagnosis and therapy (often younger), and those who won’t countenance it (often older). Just look at Prince Harry, whose determination, after extensive therapy, totalk about the traumaof his mother’s death was considered ghastly and exhibitionist by those used to the stiff-upper-lip attitude of previous generations of royals. Post-traumatic stress disorder – a diagnosis I have had in the past – is another one of those conditions people like to claim isn’t real.We have all noticed that the autism spectrum has widened massively in the past three decades, partly owing to the removal of theAsperger’s diagnosis. When my brother was formally diagnosed at four years old, in 1997, you usually had to be what they then called “severe”. Nowadays, there are children who are verbal and able to be in mainstream school who have diagnoses. This surge deserves examination, too. However, I am not one of the people saying this must mean that those people aren’t autistic, or that they don’t face enormous challenges. Heterogenous and multifactoral disorders tend to be that way.It isn’t the existence of books on overdiagnosis that perturbs me. I have a lot of respect for the opinions of doctors, especially those who ask vital questions about how we treat patients with chronic illness, mental distress and neurodivergence. What is alarming is how the concept of overdiagnosis is being deployed by culture warriors as a battering ram to beat ill and disabled people with, to cast doubt on their diagnoses, to mock them and, inthe case of politicians, to justify further punitive cuts to their support systems.Take this paragraph from aSunday Times reviewof Timimi’s book: “Instead of operating on the Socratic principles of doctors talking with patients to find the emotional and historical source of their unhappiness, too many have pivoted to treating mental health like physical health. They diagnose their patients with a ‘disorder’, slap them with a pathologising label (ADHD, autism etc) and medicate them.”Where to start? The fact that autism andADHDaren’t mental illnesses? Autism and ADHD are neurodevelopmental disorders (they can both co-occur with mental-health issues). But what I find most troubling is the suggestion that doctors are slapping diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders on to patients willy nilly.Presumably we must now mistrust the neurologists, the developmental paediatricians, the psychiatrists, the geneticists and the speech and occupational therapists involved in a diagnosis? The parents who have noticed that their child is struggling to meet their milestones, the school special educational needs coordinators, and the GPs and health visitors who refer?I believe Labour cares about those in need, but it must show that. It can’t go on like this  | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe wait for anNHS autism assessment– and the meagre support that may result from it – is more than four years in some trusts. No one is simply “slapping” an autism diagnosis on anybody, at least not in the NHS. I do worry about the private market for diagnosis, though it is worth noting that in order for these diagnoses to be of any use, many boroughs require that they be reviewed by a panel of NHS experts.Amid all this ill-informed noise about overdiagnosis, there has been little discussion about what it is about Britain that makes so many people struggle to function within it, no real admission of the fact that this country has become quite a depressing place to live, or what has been done to an education system within which anxious and neurodivergent children are simply the canaries in the coalmine.This culture war places the onus on the individual to function within a brutal society that makes little effort to include or support them. It demonises patients as a starting point, and has real-world effects on people’s lives. It means people having to repeatedly justify their diagnoses or those of their children, even to others in their families. It means people having tofight harder for supportfor themselves or their children. It means being confronted with people parroting lines like: “ADHD? What he needs is a good smack.” It means a general atmosphere of ignorance and contempt.Sick people, disabled people and the parents who advocate for their children, as well as the professionals who support them, deserve far better than this unkindness. The measure of our society lies in how we treat our vulnerable. As it stands, it is downright nasty.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

By stocking up on the key item most preppers forgetEmma BrockesWith France about to advise its citizens on how to survive an ‘imminent threat’, it’s time to wise up to what the real essentials areWed 19 Mar 2025 12.13 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 14.05 EDTShareIt’s a fairly strong indication that your US presidency is not going well when, within three months of you taking office, one of your closest allies feels the need to issue its entire population with a manual on how to survive an “imminent threat”. According toFrench media reports, that is what the French government is planning in the form of a 20-page booklet to go out to its citizens this summer. And while it’s intended for use against natural disaster or medical threat, we all know what we’re really talking about here. The French government would like to remind its people that, in the event of a nuclear attack, they must remember to close the doors and windows.My dad recalls Buckinghamshire county council issuing a similar pamphlet in the 1980s, for when Russia dropped an atomic bomb on Aylesbury. My family didn’t need the advice, as it happened; in the event of the collapse of civil society, my mother’s Tupperware and plastic-bag reserves that filled an entire floor-to-ceiling cupboard would’ve pushed us to the top of any barter-based value system. Plus, for at least a week, we could have lived like kings on decades-old gravy and bolognese sauce loosened from the permafrost of the chest freezer in the garage like the body of a caveman after an ice age.To my mother’s disappointment, this opportunity to be vindicated in the face of my dad’s occasional efforts to have a clearout never came to pass. My own history as a prepper, meanwhile, shows definite signs of generational decline. In New York, I lived through the incredible two-and-a-half-hour blackout of 2019, in which the lights of Broadway went out and people kept themselves together by singing old-timey songs and wondering if it was OK to order in pizza. (The answer to that was, slightly shockingly, yes.) Back then, I had an outdated emergency bag in the closet stocked with baby formula and tiny bottles of water and I made a promise to myself that night: that in the event of another disaster, I would not be reliant on a torch in the shape of a ladybird, or use my last 2% of phone battery to look at Twitter.That promise needs refreshing. We live in a new world, now, one in which defence spending takes priority over foreign aid, Russia is once again a threat toEuropeand the US can’t be relied upon to save us. In the French government booklet there will, reportedly, be emergency numbers, radio channels and encouragement, should the need arise, to get involved in civil defence-type efforts including volunteer firefighting.This assumes that some semblance of order survives. My nearest London tube station is one of the city’s deepest, but I’ve seen enough apocalypse shows to know that hiding underground is not the answer; you have either to head north, to a national park where you can outrun the cannibals and hunt game, or barricade yourself in your apartment for three months until the initial anarchy has burned itself out and you can go on a scavenging run to the shops.And, of course, you must be prepared. After the blackout, I bought a torch so powerful it could double as Mace if you could get an aggressor to look straight into it, and I’m definitely thinking about finding the cable to charge it. I’m also starting to stock up, although it strikes me that the French have left out one important piece of advice from their booklet. A lot of people in New York have generational trauma from relatives who did, indeed, flee Europe decades ago, and the ones I know would point out that missing from the French guidelines is alcohol.This isn’t a joke. The shrewd prepper understands that if things collapse and money becomes useless, the value of alcohol – for anaesthetic, sterilisation, sedation – rises to the very top of the new currency system. You can pack your tiny bottles of water and buy your tins, but my advice to you, if prepping, is to stop off at the off-licence and grab three bottles of premium whisky and a bottle of Tanqueray – which you are absolutely not allowed to touch until the bombs start falling.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionFranceNuclear weaponsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

This is the UK’s largest supermarket chain by a distance, after all, and a business that runs on rails now that it has sold most of its foreign adventures to concentrate on the day job.Yet 13% is the fall in Tesco’s shares since last Friday when Asda said, in effect, it has had enough of being the industry’s punchbag andwill try to regain lost market share by cutting prices. Sainsbury’s shares are also off 8% in the same short period, and even Marks & Spencer’s, down 6%, have been caught byinvestors’ worries about a price war.Before shoppers mentally chalk up the savings in their grocery baskets, however, it’s worth asking if the stock market may be overreacting.Tesco, Sainsbury’s and M&S shares take £4bn hit amid Asda price war fearsRead moreAsda definitely needs to do something. The business underperformed for years under Walmart’s ownership. Then the Issa brothers, Mohsin and Zuber, and TDR, their private equity backers,loaded it with buyout debt in 2021and investment suffered again. Asda’s market share has declined from 15.1% to 12.6% over the past five years, according to the research group Kantar’s numbers.Nor should one doubt the credentials ofAllan Leighton, the new Asda chair. He was part of the team that hauled the business off the floor in the 1990s and the new plan is very like the old one: fix the basics, such as having enough staff in stores, and then concentrate on creating a bigger price gap with the main rivals. “The only way we have got to rebuild profit is through sales growth,” he says.Tesco share price chartIt’s just that there are several reasons to think the scrap may not turn into what City analysts, with their eyes fixed on share prices, call an “irrational” price war in which all participants lose in the form of lower profit margins.First, how much isAsdaplanning to throw at the struggle? Leighton didn’t say. Rather, he said there would “material reduction in our profit” this year. But there would probably be a reduction anyway because of higher employment costs, the packaging tax and other costs that all supermarkets have been grumbling about. The exclusively price-lowering element is unclear.Second, is the real ambition to regain all the lost market share, or just a bit of it? “It is far from sure that a meaningful programme of investment will not require an equity injection,” noted the Jefferies analyst Frederick Wild. Are TDR and the remaining Issa brother (Mohsin) up for injecting more cash? Maybe they are. But merely stopping the rot and stabilising trading trends may be all they require to trim borrowings and make their buyout arithmetic work.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aldi and Lidl are bigger forces in the land.Tescoand Sainsbury’s have better data-driven loyalty programmes in their armoury. From the point of view of Asda’s owners, launching – and, critically, then sustaining – a full-on price war against competitors with stronger balance sheets sounds a risky strategy.Leighton should certainly be able to run Asda more efficiently and sharpen the prices. The performance could hardly be worse – his predecessor, Stuart Rose, said he was “embarrassed”. The enormous £800m IT overhaul, to get off Walmart’s systems, should help. But the Barclays analyst James Anstead probably offers a fair assessment: “A more dynamic Asda is unhelpful for sentiment, but we question the inevitability of a UK price war.”In the meantime, as he notes, Tesco and Sainsbury’s are oozing cash. The former is predicted to return £4bn of its £22bn stock market value via dividends and share buy-backs in the next two years. At Sainsbury’s, it’s £1.36bn out of £5.5bn. Shareholders should worry if chunks of those distributions are diverted into fighting a reviving Asda.

It’s a crisis demanding real-world solutionsWed 19 Mar 2025 14.41 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 14.44 EDTShareBoys used to be raised by their parents. Now, as they grow up, an increasing number are coming under theinfluenceof toxic online figures who push a hollow, misogynistic version of masculinity. This isn’t helping their character or their relationships. But it does work for a digital world where worth is measured in money, status and appearance. Girls have long seen their mental healthsufferfrom social media comparisons and phone addiction. But that doesn’t make it any less troubling now that boys are being similarly affected.In hisRichard Dimbleby lecturefor the BBC, Sir Gareth Southgate made a cogent case that young men are being failed by modern society – not just by absent role models, but by a culture that doesn’t acknowledge failure and vulnerability while exposing them to damaging digital influences. Without real-life guidance, they can withdraw, becoming reluctant to talk or unable to express their emotions. Boys can fall into an unhealthy world of gaming, gambling and pornography.This void, the former England football manager warned, is also being filled by “callous, manipulative and toxic influencers whose sole drive is for their own gain”. They trickyoung meninto believing that success is measured by money or emotionless dominance. That seems hard to refute – and is affecting society for the worse. Polls suggest men and women belonging to gen Z are morepolarisedthan any other generation on questions about feminism, gender roles and women’s rights – with a clear increase in sexist attitudes. There must be a concerted effort to reverse such trends.That boys are now more likely to own asmartphonethan to live with their dad is striking. Politicians, enamoured with hi-tech progress, must reckon with the impact: it’s now easier to connect to a global network than to build a local community, easier to consume endless content than to find real-world mentors.Encouraging boys to be resilient, empathetic and capable of real relationships requires investment in families, schools and youth clubs that foster connection. They need space to be themselves – and the confidence to reject the empty validation of a social media feed. Resilience isn’t innate; it’s built through experience, effort and good example.Ifliterature– as evidenced by the young adult novels on the Carnegie medal shortlist – is beginning to explore the struggles of young boys, mainstream entertainment is exploring a darker narrative. The Netflix dramaAdolescence, about a teenage boy accused of murder, has had the country – from theprime ministerdown – glued to their screens. While the show has rightfully garnered rave reviews, boys should not be seen as dangerous or inherently suspect – they are children who need care and support just as much as girls do.Apple’s iPhonearrivedin 2007. Mobile social media apps followed, offering access and unimaginable connections to a new generation. But they didn’t just change masculinity – they monetised it. Instead of mentors, boys get marketers; instead of guidance, they get grifters; instead of role models, they get algorithms. Sir Gareth stressed the need to create a world where young people feel valued beyond just success. Because when society worships wealth and power, it is the young who suffer most from knowing they have neither.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Nearly six decades later, as the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic party (SPD)prepareto join forces across the right-left divide for the fifth time, following February’s snap election, the circumstances are superficially similar. The scale of the challenges, however – and the sense of jeopardy – are of a different order.As geopolitical events have undermined its trade‑led business model, the German economy has beenundergoingthe most prolonged period of stagnation since the second world war. Not unrelatedly, the extreme-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party – elements of which are judgeda threatto the democratic constitutional order by security services – has risen in the polls to become the second-biggest party in the EU’s most powerful member state. At the same time, a Putin-sympathetic Donald Trump is dismantling the transatlantic security guarantees on which Germany has relied in the postwar era.In response to this menacing conjuncture, German politics is reinventing itself at a vertiginous pace. On Tuesday, at the behest of the chancellor-elect, Friedrich Merz, the outgoing Bundestagvotedto change the country’s Basic Law to allow historic levels of public investment in defence, national infrastructure and the climate transition. The so-calleddebt brake– a constitutional restriction on borrowing that had come to symbolise Germany’s fiscal conservatism – is being unceremoniously sidelined.Mr Merzis a former investment banker and avowed economic liberal. His welcome conversion to the case for a proactive state, and a new leadership role for Germany in bolstering European security, has been one of the more eye-popping moments in recent political history. The scale of investment licensed by the Bundestag vote will need to be rubber-stamped by parliament’s upper house on Friday. But shares in defence companies and manufacturing giants such as Volkswagen are alreadyup, alleviating fears of deindustrialisation that were undermining national morale and fuelling the rise of the AfD.For both Mr Merz’s CDU and the SPD, this paradigm shift represents a bold and necessary leap into uncharted territory. In recent years, coalitions across the political divide have delivered stability but also, at times, an enervating impression of stasis. As Angela Merkel’s unhappy sidekicks in the 2010s, the SPDlosta sense of distinct identity and purpose, while blue-collar votersdriftedto the xenophobic far right in large numbers. Berlin’s insistentadvocacyof a fiscal orthodoxy unfit for the times contributed to a Europe-wide crisis of the political centre, manifested in the rise of rightwing populism across the continent.Liberated by this week’s groundbreaking vote, Mr Merz’s “grand coalition” is set to break that mould. Countries such as Britain and France, where prolonged economic underperformance has also been accompanied by the rise of the populist right, should be taking note. As politics in western liberal democracies has polarised, mainstream politicians have sometimes talked about the need for a “radical centre”. Much of the time that has amounted to a slogan without substance. But as the two traditional behemoths of German politics wake up to the need for urgent change, Mr Merz’s administration may prove to be the real deal.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But she neglects the fact that every piece of writing, film‑making or art created by artificial intelligence and then consumed by humans is one less piece of writing, film-making or art created by a human being that will have the chance to be read and enjoyed by humans.One can only wonder if Winterson would hold the same view were she now at the start of her career, rather than having 40 years of success behind her.We are already seeing creative jobs like editing and graphic design being outsourced to AI in dozens of industries. Is Winterson really so naive to think that the same won’t happen in literature if AI writing continues to be championed by influential people like her and published prominently in outlets like the Guardian?My question and challenge to the editor is simply this: when was the last time a short story written by a human being was published on your website in a position of such prominence? You have given a story written by AI a huge audience. Why not now do the same for an aspiring, young, human writer?Henry FutcherNorwichIt was refreshing to read Jeanette Winterson’s article about the creative potential of artificial intelligence. All literature expresses memory and is synthetic, drawing consciously or unconsciously upon human experience, culture and other literature. Neuroscience has shown that humans don’t “experience” experience as simply being present “in the moment” – it’s filtered by consciousness of earlier experience, expectation, memory and social context.So, even the “I” in lyric poetry may be read as the most unreliable form of intimacy – their “feelings” may move us, while being as “inauthentic” and “trained” as an algorithm. Literature asks an intriguing and elusive question: “What would it be like to be someone else?” How fascinating to have that question posited by a machine. AI may only be as “other” as we are to each other. Its creative processes and outputs will surely help to illuminate our own.Graham MortEmeritus professor of creative writing, Lancaster UniversityAs a writer of fiction, I read with interest, and unease, the opinions of authors I admire on the creative writing skills of ChatGPT (A computer’s joke, on us’: writers respond to the short story written by AI, 14 March). In my day job supporting neurodivergent students with academic skills, I suggest the use of AI as assistive technology – rather than generative, to actually write their essays.Recently, a student told me that he uses the “AI detector” GPTZero to ensure his written work does not register as AI-generated. I then tested this with a sample of my own work – the first paragraph of a novel. To my horror, it asserted that it was “moderately confident” that the text was “85% written by AI”.What if agents and publishers use this tool and fail to question its “judgment”? Can I reassure myself that GPTZero assessed my work as it did because the paragraph was well written? Was this a result of the fact that, after years of extensive reading, I am my own large language model, at least in the realm of fiction? Times are hard enough as a writer without being plunged into an existential crisis of this sort, so I am clinging to that last idea as the most reassuring.Cal Walters-DaviesAberystwyth, CeredigionHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Who’s to blame for its passing?, 18 March). My own tube station, Willesden Green, is an “above-ground” station with two wide exits at street level, beside one of which the bookshelf was situated, so even in the very unlikely circumstance of the books catching fire, there would be no danger to station users. And perhaps someone can explain why, if two dozen paperbacks constitute a fire hazard, large piles of free newspapers do not.The book-share at Willesden Green was a much-loved community resource, especially for the growing number who cannot afford to buy books these days. And our local library (like too many others) was closed long ago, so free books are valuable to many. I regularly saw elderly people browsing the shelves, as well as mothers with small children (children’s books were regularly deposited). I enjoyed passing on books I’d read myself – as well as serendipitously discovering new writers. So a rethink of the ban, at all those stations where books can be deposited safely, is needed.Gill SaundersLondonI was surprised that Zoe Williams was so accepting of the closure of the tube station book swaps. AsRay Bradburyrevealed, it is very challenging to set a closed book on fire (451F heat needed). At Oval, my local tube station, there are rarely more than 10 books on the shelves, such is the popularity of the scheme. Plus they are displayed in an open area, so not much of a fire hazard. Zoe misses how democratic the scheme is. A lot of people are intimidated by bookshops or libraries and they open for far fewer hours then the tube does.We know there is a literacy crisis in this country, and everything should be done to encourage book ownership. These books are free, often include children’s books, and there is no imagined judgment of your choice. They also lead to many quick conversations about the books, which can help to assuage loneliness. It is a wonderful scheme and I hope the fire officers’ concerns can be dealt with and the books returned.Veronica PorterLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Now, it’s about making sure we analyse the game right. We watch the game again and analyse the game with the players. I take responsibility for the performance and the result. I’m very hard on myself. My job tomorrow is to make sure we have a positive mindset going into the next two games. We’ve only lost one game in the season, it’s a big one, an important one, but it happens.”What strategy do you use in the second of four chess matches against the same opponent? Ultimately, with Miedema on the pitch, it doesn’t really matter.“I was confident tonight that if she got chances, she’d score,” said Nick Cushing, who was brought back in ahead of this run of four games between the sides following the ­sacking of Gareth Taylor.Cushing enjoyed celebrating with the fans on his first time back at the stadium since 2019. “She’s frustrated because she thinks she should have had a hat-trick.”City had caused Chelsea plenty of problems in their League Cup final defeat against Bompastor’s side at Pride Park, edging possession stats and accruing 36 touches in the opposition’s box to Chelsea’s 15; in Manchester those figures were reversed, Chelsea dominating possession and amassing 24 touches to City’s 14 but it meant little.If the odds were stacked in the unbeaten Chelsea’s favour before kick‑off, they were weighted ­further their way when the team news arrived. Cushing’s side were without the influential striker Khadija Shaw and Aoba Fujino, the scorer of City’s equaliser in their 2-1 defeat against Bompastor’s side in the cup final on Saturday. Meanwhile, the former Arsenal forward Miedema was named on the bench. That was “a bit of a gamble”, said Cushing.For Chelsea, players returned, with Keira Walsh and Aggie Beever-Jones named in the starting XI.City did well to contain Chelsea with their injury-hit squad – Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood long‑term absences. But this was a cagey encounter, Beever-Jones arguably the most dynamic player on the pitch in the first half, making a statement on the right and forming a c­ohesive partnership with the right‑back Lucy Bronze.There will naturally be a drop in intensity from a final over 90 ­minutes to a two-legged tie, but Chelsea’s ­failure to capitalise on a depleted City will be a concern. Bompastor had promised the London team would “attack the game” but they struggled in the final third. Mayra Ramírez, who scored the opener against City on ­Saturday and in the WSL in November, threatened but was profligate in the opening 45 minutes.View image in fullscreenVivianne Miedema (second left) celebrates with her teammates after doubling Manchester City’s lead late on.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAWith neither coach happy, there were changes at the break, Miedema returned to the pitch in place of the City youngster Lily Murphy and Wieke Kaptein replaced the USA plauyer Catarina Macario for the visiting team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kerolin, making her Champions League debut, sent in a cross that was narrowly missed by the head of Miedema in the first clear-cut chance after the break and suddenly the momentum was with the home team, the crowd roaring to life.Moments later the ball was in the back of the net. Chelsea cleared a corner only as far as Mary Fowler who pinged the ball back into the box, Laia Aleixandri powered it off the crossbar and Miedema was on hand to turn in. Three minutes later Miedema was testing Hannah Hampton again, her shot kept out by the goalkeeper.Quick GuideBarcelona outclass Wolfsburg with Pajor to foreShowBarcelona took a big step towards a third straight Women's Champions League title by beating Wolfsburg 4-1 away in the first leg of their quarter-final.In the first meeting of the two teams since Barcelona beat Wolfsburg 3-2 in the 2023 Champions League final, Barça  showed how the gap between the two teams has only grown. They dominated throughout and largely shut Wolfsburg's forwards out of the game as Ewa Pajor caused her old team plenty of problems.Barcelona took the lead when Pajor, who joined Barcelona from Wolfsburg last year, pressured defender Caitlin Dijkstra into conceding an own goal as she tried to stop Pajor connecting with Aitana Bonmatí's cross in the 26th minute.Two goals in the space of three minutes early in the second half took the game further away from Wolfsburg as Irene Paredes scored to finish off a short corner routine before Salma Paralluelo made it 3-0 soon after with a deflected shot.Wolfsburg had some hope of a comeback when Janina Minge scored a header from a corner, but Barcelona's 18-year-old substitute Sydney Schertenleib responded with a curled shot that went in off the crossbar.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The palpable tension in the crowd lifted with the goal from the Dutch forward, and the pace came out of the game a little as City stifled Chelsea’s attack over and over. As the clock ticked towards a first defeat under Bompastor, City still looked the more threatening side, every attack dangerous as Chelsea poured forward in search of the leveller.With 10 minutes remaining and Chelsea ­throwing everything at City’s back line, ­Rytting Kaneryd clipped an effort off the crossbar and Ayaka Yamashita smothered the follow-up effort from Hamano in their most potent attack.Miedema pounced again in the 89th minute to extend the lead and put Chelsea under real pressure going into Sunday’s WSL tie against City and the UWCL second leg next week, collecting Kerolin’s ball and rifling it into the bottom corner.Chelsea looked a little shell shocked. How will Bompastor’s side cope following defeat? Their record to this point remains hugely ­impressive, but we will find out amid the most gruelling run of games. Can they turn around the tie? “It will be difficult, but nothing is impossible,” said Bompastor.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueManchester City WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was about sticking together and being together as one, and speaking to people. Just talking and being on that same page, that makes a massive difference when you’re playing.“I know that first-hand. Being at the clubs I’ve been at, having the leaders I’ve had in dressing rooms and on the pitch, having that person speaking to you constantly certainly helps me. It helps you get through sticky moments.”Rogers said Tuchel had been “very clear and transparent” in a team meeting on Monday night. “The main thing I took from that was about the love and commitment he wants from us within, how he wants us to be a family, how he wants us to be close and connected,” the Aston Villa forward said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

CouldSebastian Coereally pull it out of the fire again? At the Moscow and Los Angeles Olympics he bounced back from defeat in the 800m to take 1500m gold. Then, against the odds in Singapore in 2005, he brought the 2012 Games to London ahead of Paris and Madrid.And now, in the final hours before Thursday’s vote for the nextInternational Olympic Committeepresident, he was busy pressing flesh and securing promises in the hope of a fourth Olympic win.Coe feels ‘momentum’ but IOC presidential race remains on knife-edgeRead moreHis supporters believe he can find a narrow path to victory. He has form, after all. In 2005 London won after a maximum four rounds of incredibly tense voting, beating Paris by 54 votes to 50. Yet amid the rumours, smears, and intrigue here in Greece, others pointed to a different campaign as a cautionary tale:England’s bid for the 2018 World Cup.The night before that vote, one British journalist said of the Russian bid “they’ve thrown in the towel!” when he heard that Vladimir Putin wasn’t turning up. The next day proved a sharp and painful rejoinder. As things stand, most IOC watchers make Juan Antonio Samaranch the favourite. But no one is counting out Kirsty Coventry, who is bidding to become the first woman to lead the IOC. Or indeed Lord Coe. But the fact it is a secret ballot only adds more uncertainty and intrigue.On the surface, everything appears cordial. The vote is being staged at the same five-star hotel where Christopher Nolan, Matt Damon and Anne Hathaway are staying while filming a version of Homer’s Odyssey. The resort has 131 infinity pools, six waterslides and a golf course designed by Bernhard Langer.Behind the scenes, however, two candidates have been subject to an internet smear campaign with scurrilous and baseless rumours about their characters, while there is increasing disquiet that the outgoing president Thomas Bach is pushing Coventry, even though it would seem to breach the political neutrality the Olympic movement holds dear. No wonder comparisons are frequently made with a papal conclave.Finding signal amid the noise is tricky given most voters are resolutely tight-lipped. At one point, the man from the BBC asked Princess Anne for her thoughts as she walked through the hotel. “No,” came the curt reply. Britain’s other IOC representative Hugh Robertson, who was walking with the Princess Royal, smiled at the exchange. “Nice try,” he said. Shortly afterwards Prince Albert of Monaco walked through, smiling but keeping his cards close to his chest too.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe and the culture secretary Tessa Jowell at London 2012’s Olympic bid launch.Photograph: Kieran Doherty/ReutersIt means that not even Samaranch can be sure he will be smiling when the vote takes place at 2pm. As he sagely put it: “Everybody has the right to keep his vote confidential, and it’s very easy in this world – and when it is so close – to confuse a smile for a vote, a friendship for a vote, a nice word for a vote. So all candidates have to be very careful in making that translation.”What makes the election even harder to predict is that the IOC is one of the world’s most exclusive private members’ clubs, with just 109 individuals and its own set of dynamics. To win, Coe will have to build a coalition from a combination of former athletes, politicians, royals, billionaires, and even an Oscar-winning actress, Michelle Yeoh – while Bach tries everything in his power to stop him winning.Coe’s task is made even harder by the fact he clearly upset some members – including Bach – with World Athletics’ decision to ban Russia from the Rio Games, while awarding£50,000 in prize moneyto every Olympic track and field gold medallist in Paris was far from universally welcomed either, especially as he didn’t tell other sports in advance.However no one in the field has a better CV than Coe. Not only is he a double Olympic champion, who ran the London 2012 Games and then became the president of World Athletics, he is a political heavyweight used to meeting senior leaders. In a discordant and uncertain world, where sport is increasingly weaponised and no one can be sure what the presidents Trump, Putin and Xi will do next, that is undoubtedly an asset.Samaranch, however, has an even greater advantage given he is the son of the former IOC president Juan Samaranch who ran the organisation for 21 years. Samaranch Jr might reject the idea that he is a nepo baby, but undoubtedly he has access to networks and loyalties, including with China, that other candidates do not have.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe (left) among the England delegation in Zurich in 2010 when Fifa announced Russia would host the 2018 World Cup.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PACoventry, who won two swimming gold medals for Zimbabwe before becoming her country’s sports minister, cannot be ruled out – even if there is some disquiet over her role in a government that Amnesty International says has imposed “wide-scale repression of dissent, including arbitrary detention and prosecution” and where “plainclothes state agents abducted political activists, tortured them, and killed one man”.So how might the vote go? Coventry’s hope is that Bach’s patronage allows her to win by a first- or second-round knockout by securing a majority of votes. While that isn’t completely out of the question, most onlookers believe it is unlikely and the vote will continue into the latter rounds.The Japanese candidate Morinari Watanabe, president of the International Federation of Gymnastics, is expected to go first, followed by the Swedish‑British businessman Johan Eliasch. The French head of the UCI, David Lappartient, is forecast to be next.Then it gets messy. Coe’s team, however, still believe that if they make the final two they can win. But soon they, and the other six candidates vying for the most powerful job in global sport, will face a moment of truth.How the seven candidates compareSebastian Coe, Great BritainThe double Olympic 1,500m champion, former head of London 2012, and current president of World Athletics is widely regarded as having the most complete CV in the field. The 68-year-old is running as the change candidate after the authoritarian reign of Thomas Bach and has promised IOC members more involvement in debates and decisions. Other planks of Coe’s manifesto include protecting women’s sports and pushing more for smaller sports. Has a chance. But he also knows that Bach is doing everything in his power to stop him.Kirsty Coventry, ZimbabweThe 41-year-old is bidding to become the first woman and African to lead the IOC in its 131-year history and, crucially, has Bach’s backing. Whether that will be enough is unclear, but it gives her a shot even though her manifesto was widely regarded as uninspiring and her policies are essentially continuity Bach. However she has grown on the campaign trail and will have the support of many of the athletes among the IOC membership.Johan Eliasch, Great BritainNo one expects the Swedish-born, British citizen president of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation to win. However the billionaire and former chief executive of Head has made his voice heard by insisting that sport has to do more to respond to climate change. His proposals include rotating the Winter Games among a group of permanent venues and ensuring that “only those who were born female can compete in women’s sport.”Prince Faisal al Hussein, JordanPrince Faisal, the younger brother of Jordan’s King Abdullah II, has enjoyed a well-run campaign in which he has stressed that sport can be a tool for peace between east and west, and called for better safeguarding. “I grew up in a family that knows all about service,” said Faisal, who previously served in the military. He is also a big fan of the computer game World of Warships. His candidacy is likely to be sunk by the fourth round of voting.David Lappartient, FranceThe 51-year-old has been president of the International Cycling Union since 2017. After overseeing a deal with Saudi Arabia for staging an Esport Olympics, with Bach’s blessing, his star was seen in the ascendancy. However the IOC president has instead chosen to throw his support behind Coventry in this election and as a result the Frenchman will struggle to get out of the early rounds.Juan Antonio Samaranch, SpainThe 65-year-old joined the IOC at the same 2001 meeting in Moscow where his father stood down after 21 years as president. He is well connected and has links with Russia, where his father was an ambassador, and China, where there is a Samaranch museum. A former banker, Samaranch is well-regarded and charming. His manifesto talks about protecting women athletes and giving members more of a voice – but, his critics argue, why didn’t he raise these issues before?Morinari Watanabe, JapanThe well-liked head of international gymnastics has no chance in the race. However he did come up with the most-talked about proposal of the seven candidates: staging the Olympics in five continents at the same time on a rolling 24-hour sports channel. Watanabe argues that such a proposal will add more sports and allow more and smaller cities to be Olympic hosts while meeting sustainability targets.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeSebastian CoeSport politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can’t help but want to go out on your bike.”The Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, described the spectacle of the race as “the only sports event made for people who don’t like sport” and recalled seeing riders applauding spectators in Yorkshire in 2014. “That’s very rare,” he said.There will be six Tour stages in total in the UK in 2027, three stages of the men’s Tour and three of the women’s race. “I think it’s brilliant,” Cavendish said. “Cycling’s been at the forefront of pushing equality.”The conversations between Edinburgh and Paris stretch back almost 20 years, but the project became more ambitious once the Tour de France Femmes was relaunched three years ago.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Kool celebrates victory in the first stage of the Tour de France Femmes, from Rotterdam to the Hague, in 2024.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/Shutterstock“We set out to host the Tour de France and Tour de France Femmes because we believe that live sport is a fundamental part of our country’s social fabric,” Simon Morton, director of events at UK Sport, said.“This will be the biggest free spectator event ever hosted in the UK, offering the public front-row access to world-class sport across villages, towns and cities.”The details of the men’s race are to be confirmed but Edinburgh, Glasgow, the Lake District, Manchester, mid-Wales and south Wales are all expected to feature.After a stage finish in Cardiff, the race convoy is likely to transfer from south Wales to continue the Tour on French soil.In 2014 more than 3 million spectators were estimated to have watched the men’s race as it headed to London from Leeds. That number will surely be eclipsed in 2027.The 2027 Tour de France Femmes is believed to be starting in Leeds. The Tour owners, ASO, remained coy about the details of the women’s race, although Prudhomme said the women’s race may fall a little later than usual to accommodate event logistics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You see the impact it has everywhere the Tour goes. You saw it in Yorkshire, a few years back, so it will be really special. It will give such a boost to cycling inScotlandand it gives me a lot of motivation to be there, to be part of that.”Pete Ellen, who runs the Cycling Academy for elite young Scottish road cyclists and who rides with the Edinburgh Road Club, one of the country’s largest, said the arrival of the Tour was “brilliant” for cycling in Scotland.“It’s incredibly well run, and they’re really good at getting community involvement,” he said. “It will get more people on their bicycles, riding around and having fun. The more people who are riding their bikes the better the world will be. It’s as simple as that.”The Aberaeron-born Josh Tarling, who is racing with Ineos Grenadiers, said the news that the 2027 Tour would visit Wales was “a proud moment”.The intention to bid for the Tour, as part of a £30m package for major events first announced in Rishi Sunak’s autumn budget in 2021, originally targeted a Grand Départ in 2026, but next year’s Tour will start in Barcelona.Further details of all the stages are expected to be announced in the autumn.Explore more on these topicsTour de FranceCyclingEdinburghScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Subway’s commitment is understood to be about supporting the growth of women’s football.In addition, it is understood that there are numerous options being looked at by the WPLL, which will consult clubs, the FA, fans and players on all alternatives under consideration.Chelsea secured their third League Cup title with a 2-1 victory against Manchester City on Saturday.The competition was launched in 2011 alongside the introduction of the WSL, with top‑tier clubs competing in the Women’s Premier League Cup before its launch. In 14 seasons only Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City have won the competition, with the Gunners picking up a record seven titles.The League Cup format has been questioned in recent years. The group stage format, which was introduced in 2016, is widely viewed as complicated, with teams split into regional groups and additional points available should a game end in a draw and go to penalties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think that’s maybe been missing in the past couple of months. I’m really proud of that. It’s just nice to win in two sets and less than two and a half hours.”Andreeva continues to defy odds of the modern teenage tennis prodigyRead moreAlongside Raducanu’s win came the revelation that she has already parted ways with Vladimir Platenik two weeks into their coaching trial.Raducanu has had to find a new coach since Nick Cavaday departed her team after the Australian Open because of health issues. She had been on a trial run with Platenik since he arrived at Indian Wells in time to watch her first‑round defeat against Moyuka Uchijima.The pair had been working together since her Indian Wells defeat, meaning his absence from her player box on Wednesday came as a surprise. She was instead supported by the LTA coach Colin Beecher and Jane O’Donoghue, a former player and family friend who has helped Raducanu out from time to time over the past three and a half years, alongside her fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura. After the match, a member of Raducanu’s team confirmed they had opted to part ways.Although their agreement was only a trial, Platenik had indicated in an interview in his home country with the Slovak newspaper Dennik N that they had planned to trial their partnership until the French Open. Instead, Raducanu will continue her search for a coach.On the court, Raducanu had a kind opening-round draw against a former top-five junior player who is still attempting to make the transition to the professional circuit and who remains quite far from competing regularly at the highest level. Ishii trains at the IMG Academy and received a wildcard in Miami; IMG owns the tournament.Ishii showed early glimpses of her potential, particularly her weighty forehand, lasering flashy winners as she retrieved a break and levelled Raducanu at 2-2. That purple patch did not last very long and her uncompromising aggressive approach led to a stream of unforced errors.To her credit Raducanu laid down a professional, steady performance that made clear the gulf in quality between the two players. All wins are valuable, particularly for a player in poor form. In recent weeks the world No 60 has endured one of the toughest periods of her career in terms of results, losing five of her previous six matches. There have been obvious mitigating circumstances behind her form, particularly herwell-publicised encounters with a stalkerwho followed her from tournament to tournament in Asia throughout February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Republic of Ireland midfielder is back with the under-21s, the side he led toa first European title triumphin 2023, before the finals in Slovakia in June.Thomas Tuchel: perfectionist, workaholic, disciplinarian … winnerRead moreCarsley is focused on winning a second successive title but he did not rule out a permanent return to the senior role. “It’s something that I enjoyed doing but ultimately, like I’ve said in the past, you’ve definitely got to earn the right to be in that position and I can only do my best,” he said. “I feel happy and trusted doing what I’m doing so we will see what happens in the future.”Asked whether the experience with the senior side had changed his approach, Carsley said: “No, not really. I tried to be myself, tried to do my best and enjoyed it. I didn’t enjoy it at times, but I enjoyed the majority. It was a great experience and I felt privileged and entrusted to be in that position.”He said he needed to deal better with the media: “I’m aware of that. If I’m going to do better in the future then I need to make sure I’m pushing myself. But I enjoyed it – the three camps were excellent.“To get the last win at Wembley [against Ireland] was a great feeling. It was a bit surreal then following that because I was coming off such a high and then going back to the day job.”Only four players who were part of England’s triumphant squad two years ago remain eligible for the under-21s, with Carsley drawing on a number of the under-19s side who became European champions in 2022, including the Ipswich forward Liam Delap and Bournemouth’s Alex Scott.Carsley’s assistant, Ashley Cole, was inducted into the National Football Museum’s hall of fame on Wednesday and he believes a squad that includes Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri, Harvey Elliott of Liverpool and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are capable of emulating their predecessors.“We’ve told this group they have left a legacy for you and we want to continue that and hopefully do well in the Euros and leave a legacy for the next generation,” Cole said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everyone has a role to play in protecting our oceans, and we urge the public to support stronger action against plastic waste, as well as cut down plastic from their everyday use.”A chart showing how many pieces of litter were removed on every 100 metres of beaches across the UK and Channel Islands.A global treaty on cutting plastic waste has yet to be completed after fossil fuel countries and industry lobbyists pushed back on cuts to global plastic production.Talks are due to resume in Geneva this August, where there are hopes thatmore than 100 countrieswill succeed in signing a treaty that includes caps on production.Among the most frequently recorded waste found on beaches last year were plastic caps and lids, which were collected from 88% of beaches, and plastic bottles and containers, which appeared on 71% of surveyed sites.The Marine Conservation Society said it was hopeful that the much-delayed plastic bottle deposit return scheme (DRS), due to startin October 2027, would help reduce the number of discarded plastic bottles and related waste in the future. The DRS was first promised in 2018 but successive governments have delayed its implementation.Last year more than 15,000 people took part in the beach cleanups across 92 miles of beaches in the UK and Channel Islands. The numbers of volunteers and hours were balanced out in order to calculate the percentage rise year on year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Seabirds, seals and fish often mistake plastic for food, leading to internal injuries, starvation and even death.Microplastics – tiny particles that come from broken-down plastic – are now present in the ocean and food chain, posing a long-term threat to wildlife and human health.

The EPA has also issued guidance directing that spending items greater than $50,000 require approval from Elon Musk’s so-called '“department of government efficiency”.Trump’s environmental rule-shredding will put lives at risk, ex-EPA heads sayRead moreThe Office of Research and Development – EPA’s main science arm – currently has 1,540 positions, excluding special government employees and public health officers, according to one memo. A majority of staff – ranging from 50% to 75% – “will not be retained”, the memo says.The research office has 10 facilities across the country, stretching from Florida and North Carolina to Oregon.The plan calls for dissolving the research office and reassigning remaining staff to other parts of the agency “to provide increased oversight and align with administration priorities,” the memo says. EPA officials have presented the plan to the White House for review.Molly Vaseliou, an EPA spokesperson, said the agency “is taking exciting steps as we enter the next phase of organizational improvements,” but said changes had not been finalized.“We are committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water and land for all Americans,” she said, adding, “While no decisions have been made yet, we are actively listening to employees at all levels to gather ideas on how to increase efficiency and ensure the EPA is as up to date and effective as ever.”California congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the science committee, said in a statement that the agency’s research office was created by Congress and “eliminating it is illegal.”Every decision the EPA makes “must be in furtherance of protecting human health and the environment, and that just can’t happen if you gut EPA science,” Lofgren said.“EPA cannot meet its legal obligation to use the best available science without (the Office of Research and Development) and that’s the point,” she added. President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser, Musk, “are putting their polluter buddies’ bottom lines over the health and safety of Americans,” Lofgren said.In his first term, “Trump and his cronies politicised and distorted science,” she said. “Now, this is their attempt to kill it for good.”Ticora Jones, chief science officer at the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump’s EPA “yet again is putting polluters over people.”She called on Congress to “stand up and demand that EPA keep its scientists on the beat so that we all can get the clean air and clean water we need and deserve.”Explore more on these topicsUS Environmental Protection AgencyClimate crisisTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 800,000 people were displaced and made homeless, the highest yearly number since records began in 2008.The report lists151 unprecedented extreme weather eventsin 2024, meaning they were worse than any ever recorded in the region. Heatwaves in Japan left hundreds of thousands of people struck down by heatstroke. Soaring temperatures during heatwaves peaked at 49.9C at Carnarvon in Western Australia, 49.7C in the city of Tabas in Iran, and 48.5C in a nationwide heatwave in Mali.Record rains in Italy led to floods, landslides and electricity blackouts; torrents destroyed thousands of homes in Senegal; and flash floods in Pakistan and Brazil caused major crop losses.Storms were also supercharged by global heating in 2024, with an unprecedentedsix typhoonsin under a month hitting the Philippines. Hurricane Helene was the strongest ever recorded to strike the Big Bend region of Florida in the US, while Vietnam was hit by Super Typhoon Yagi,affecting 3.6 million people. Many more unprecedented events will have passed unrecorded.View image in fullscreenA destroyed mechanic’s shop in downtown Swannanoa, North Carolina, US, December 2024, nearly three months after Hurricane Helene in late September.Photograph: Mike Belleme/The GuardianThe world is already deep into the climate crisis, with the WMO report saying that for the first time, the 10 hottest years on record all occurred in the last decade. However, global carbon emissionshave continued to rise, which will bring even worse impacts. Experts were particularly critical of thepurge of climate scientists and programmesby the US president, Donald Trump, saying that ignoring reality left ordinary people paying the price.“Leaders must step up – seizing the benefits of cheap, clean renewables for their people and economies – with newnational climate plansdue this year,” said the UN secretary general, António Guterres.Dr Luke Parsons, of the Nature Conservancy, said: “Every year, we venture further into uncharted territory, with 2024 the hottest year modern human society has ever experienced. Yet the coming decade is expected to be even hotter, pushing us deeper into this unprecedented climate.”Previous research determining the role of the climate crisis in what are now unnatural disasters has shown that at least550 heatwaves, floods, storms, droughts and wildfires had been made significantly more severe or more frequent by global heating.View image in fullscreenSuper Typhoon Yagi made landfall in northern Vietnam on 07 September 2024, killing four people and injuring 78 others, according to state media.Photograph: Luong Thai Linh/EPADr Brenda Ekwurzel, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, condemned the Trump administration’s deletion of online climate information. “Attempts tohide climate sciencefrom the public will not stop us from feeling the dire impacts of climate change,” she said. “This report underscores the urgency of world leaders meeting the moment, not slashing environmental protections and federal disaster aid,sacrificing public healthfor the fossil fuel industry’s private profit, and gutting agencies that help form the scientific underpinnings of our global climate knowledge.”“Global warming continues unabated, exactly as predicted correctly since the 1980s, [and] millions of people are increasingly suffering the consequences,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate in Germany. “We can only stop the warming trend by getting out of fossil fuels fast.”“We havethe solutions– but what stops us is the disinformation campaigns and lobby power of the fossil fuel industry,” Rahmstorf added. “Ignoring reality, denying the laws of physics and silencing scientists can only lead to harm, and ordinary people will pay the price for that.”Dr Davide Faranda, from ClimaMeter, said: “Every fraction of a degree matters. The choices we make today will determine the severity of climate impacts in the years to come.”The WMO secretary general, Prof Celeste Saulo, said the report was a wake-up call about the rising risks to lives and livelihoods. “In response, WMO and the global community are intensifying efforts to strengthen early warning systems and climate services to help society be more resilient to extreme weather,” she said. “Only half of all countries have adequate early warning systems – this must change.” She stressed that investment in weather, water and climate services was more important than ever.The Trump administration hassacked 1300 stafffrom the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one of the world’s leading weather and climate watchdogs, and 1,000 more are threatened. Experts estimate that every$1 spent on climate resiliencesaves $13 in damages and clean-up costs.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisExtreme weatherClimate scienceUnited NationsFloodingFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

Darzi also has an extensive portfolio of private interests in commercial medical companies.A Guardian investigation has found Darzi held shares and share options in four healthcare companies that he did not declare on hisHouse of Lordsregister of interests. The information was missing from the register when Streeting appointed him to lead the investigation into the state of the health service.Lawyers for Darzi said the omission was an “oversight”, and that some of the information had been publicly available in US stock market filings. They said he had written to the registrar of Lords interests to request his entry be corrected.The undeclared interests include $500,000 of shares and $800,000 of share options in Evelo Biosciences, a US-based healthcare venture where Darzi was a director. The shares were bought in 2022 and Darzi held them until June 2023, according tohis now corrected register. Darzi’s lawyers said he had never obtained benefit from the share options as he never converted them into shares.The Lords rules require peers, as lifelong members of the UK parliament, to be transparent about their commercial interests. Until September 2023, all shares or share options worth more than £50,000 were declarable. The threshold then rose to £100,000.Darzi’s share options in Evelo were above the registrable value for five years, from the start of his directorship in 2018, when his first remuneration package was $27,438 in fees, and $458,202 in share options, to June 2023 when he says his interest ended.Darzi resigned from the Evelo board in 2022, and the company went into liquidation last year.Evelo was a start-up backed by a US venture capital group, Flagship Pioneering, where Darzi has a paid role as chair of the “health security initiative” of its UK arm. Flagship was an early backer of Moderna, which became a multibillion-dollar company after its Covid vaccine sold around the world.Darzi declares on the register that he is a director at three other companies backed by Flagship: MontaiHealthInc, a molecular nutrition company; Harbinger Health, focusing on early cancer detection; and YourBio Health Inc, which has created a blood testing device that can be sold direct to the public.Unlike Evelo, these companies are not listed on any stock market, which means details about shareholders are not publicly available.Asked whether he had a financial interest in the three companies, lawyers for Darzi said he did. They said he held share options in all three companies above the £100,000 registrable value, and a holding of shares in Montai Health Inc since January 2022, also above the value requiring them to be registered. Share options give the holder the right to buy shares at a fixed price, and are usually converted into shares by the holder when their value rises above the fixed price.Dr Jonathan Rose, a political integrity expert at De Montfort University, said: “Breaches of the rules are corrosive to the trust that the public should be able to have in parliament. Given that the House of Lords specifically wants people with outside interests to use their knowledge for the public good, and given that people are appointed for life and can’t be removed by elections, it is critical that the rules are followed in full.”Darzi was appointed to the Lords and madea junior health ministerby Gordon Brown in 2007. He led a review of the NHS for the Labour government at that time. Darzi was a non-executive director of NHS Englandfrom 2020to 2022, and he currently chairs the NHS Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC), which negotiates deals with healthcare and life science businesses.His “rapid investigation” into the NHS for Streetingproduced a reportin September that found the NHS to be in “serious trouble”, and was highly critical of the Conservative government’s years of austerity and the 2012 reorganisation which produced NHS England. The report recommended a series of changes, including a “major tilt towards technology”, saying: “There is enormous potential … for life sciences breakthroughs to create new treatments.”Darzi’s lawyers told the Guardian the AAC role was explicitly a collaboration between the NHS and the life sciences industry, and he did not have a conflict of interest between his public roles and his directorships and share interests in private healthcare businesses. They disclosed he took a “leave of absence” from his paid role at Flagship Pioneering while he led the NHS review.They said: “Before accepting the appointment … our client disclosed his personal interests to [Streeting] (by sharing his House of Lords register of interests) and took a leave of absence from his position at Flagship while he was undertaking the NHS investigation and was not paid during this time. This was entirely at our client’s own behest and specifically to ensure that there could be no perceived conflict of interest.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Lord Darzi is a world-renowned cancer surgeon who has dedicated more than three decades of his life to the NHS and medical innovation.“All relevant due diligence processes were followed.”Darzi’s lawyers said he had not realised peers were required to register share options, and that his failure to do so was “an oversight”. He acknowledged that he should have declared them, and his shareholding in Montai.“Lord Darzi has devoted his life to the advancement of medicine and scientific discovery, and over the course of this he has worked both with government and industry to improve the health system and support the life sciences sectors in this country. He has gone to great lengths to ensure that there have not been conflicts of interests, perceived or otherwise,” the lawyers said.“It has recently been brought to Lord Darzi’s attention that the share options he was granted as part of his role as director of Evelo, Montai Therapeutics, Harbinger Health and YourBio Health and his subsequent personal investment to support Evelo and Montai Therapeutics’s scientific research exceeded the reportable threshold for the House of Lords register. He has acted immediately to rectify this oversight and update the entry on the register. Lord Darzi is very grateful to the Guardian for helping bring this oversight to light.”Explore more on these topicsAra DarziThe Lords debateHealth policyHouse of LordsLabourHealthPublic services policyNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

They are feeling isolated. They’re grappling with their masculinity and with their broader place in society,” he said. “And this void is filled by a new kind of role model who do not have their best interests at heart. These are callous, manipulative and toxic influencers whose sole drive is for their own gain.”A report by the Higher Policy Education Institute (Hepi) into educational underachievement of boys – who lag behind girls at every stage of their education – said the shortfall resulted in greater economic inactivity among young men and led to “a veering towards the political extremes, particularly among less well-educated men”.The Hepi report calls on the government to develop a strategy for men’s education, overseen by a new minister for men and boys.Southgate’s call to arms struck a chord with Labour MPs in the new group aiming to tackle toxic masculinity, said Shaun Davies, who represents Telford in Shropshire.“Southgate’s message absolutely underlines the work that we are doing in parliament and the work that we want the government to do, which is to provide positive role models to boys and also support for men to be better dads and better caregivers,” he said.“If we don’t get a positive message out there, unfortunately people who don’t have the best interests of boys and men at heart will be able to fill that void and exploit it.”There is growing momentum in Westminster around issues related to boys and men, boosted by the new alliance of about 30 male and female MPs. They include Gregor Poynton, MP for Livingston, Jon Pearce, who represents High Peak, and Luke Charters, MP for York Outer.Formed after a campaign group,the Dad Shift, wrote to Keir Starmer calling on him to improve paternity leave, members are coordinating debates, hosting meetings and meeting ministers.I’m delighted MPs are taking paternity leave – if only it were as easy for the rest of us | Tommer SpenceRead moreThe push also speaks to mounting concern within Labour high command about the threat of Reform UK, with anOpinium poll for the Observerlast month showingNigel Farage’s party neck-and-neck with Labour.There is a stark gender divide in support for Reform: 13% of young men aged between 18 and 24 voted for the hard right party compared with just 6% of women, according toresearch from King’s College London.Urging the government to overcome the “political snobbery” around issues that affect men, Davies added: “Reform and the Tories pretend to be pro-men, but actually they sell out men by not voting for policies like more flexibility at work. There’s a misrepresentation around what masculinity is, when … every bit of research shows that this generation of dads want to be with their kids.”Activists in the women’s movement have increasingly focused on better rights for fathers in recent years, seeing it as crucial for tackling gender discrimination. With only two statutory weeks of leave – paid at £184.03 a week – the UK has one of theworst paternityleave offerings in Europe, while recentresearchfound one in three UK fathers took no paternity leave after the birth of their child.Backbenchers including the prominent MP Stella Creasy – alongside pressure from campaigners – secured a government review of all parental-leave rights by next year in theemployment rights bill, after agitating for paid and protected leave for dads and partners.“At the moment the bill risks reinforcing the idea that it’s still a battle between the sexes,” said Creasy, MP for Walthamstow in east London. “Politicians are still behind the curve on this, and our constituents urgently need us to push for the world they want to live in.”The bill – which will bring an extra 30,000 fathers or partners into scope for paternity leave and make all parental leave a day one right – was “absolutely” giving a positive message to dads, said Lola McEvoy, the MP for Darlington. “The bill is a really great step, but we’ve got a new government, let’s go further,” she said.George Gabriel, co-founder of the Dad Shift, said men had so far not been sufficiently present in the fight for equality between the sexes, which had been weaponised in the culture wars.Researchlast monthsuggested that young men were less positive than young women about the impact of feminism, with 36% of 16- to 29-year-old men stating it had done more good than harm compared with 46% of women. Sixteen per cent of men from the same age group said feminism had done more harm than good, compared with 9% of women.“We urgently need to get the vast majority of equality-minded men speaking up, and the way to do that is to focus on issues – like paternity leave – that are good for men, good for women and good for society,” he said.Gabriel praised Southgate for becoming part of the “counter movement” against misogynistic influencers such as Andrew Tate. “We’re fed up of these dickheads claiming to speak for men and claiming to know what masculinity is, while punching down, while playing the victim and while breaking things they don’t understand,” he said.On Wednesday Starmer revealed that he was watching theNetflix drama Adolescence, which explores the insidious influence of “incel culture”, telling MPs that violence carried out by young men influenced by what they see online “is a real problem” and adding: “It’s abhorrent and we have to tackle it. This is also a matter of culture.”Explore more on these topicsMenLabourMaternity & paternity rightsReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Their murders were part of a wider plot to storm a morning assembly at his former primary school with a shotgun and “cause the biggest massacre of the 21st century”.He also admitted buying a shotgun without a certificate, possession of a shotgun with intent to endanger life and possession of a kitchen knife in a public place.Prosper initially refused to attendLutoncrown court on Wednesday but was ordered to appear by Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, causing the start of the hearing to be delayed. He kept his head in his hands as she read out her remarks and he refused to stand to hear his sentence.View image in fullscreenKyle Prosper, Juliana Falcon and Giselle Prosper.Photograph: Bedfordshire police/AFP/Getty ImagesAddressing Prosper, the judge said: “You intended to unleash disaster on the community of Luton. Your plans were intelligent, calculating and selfish.“Your ambition was notoriety. You wanted to be known posthumously as the world’s most famous school shooter of the 21st century.”Prosper’s plan failed when his mother confronted him after realising he was in possession of a gun. A lengthy, violent struggle followed that resulted in the entire family being shot dead.Cheema-Grubb paid tribute to Juliana, Kyle and Giselle, saying their “deaths are almost certain to have saved the lives of many children. The community owes them its gratitude and their memory should be honoured.”Her words were echoed by Raymond Prosper, the father of Nicholas, Kyle and Giselle, who said in a statement read by police: “We now see the deaths of Juliana, my son Kyle and daughter Giselle had much more meaning and importance.“Their deaths and the fast response ofBedfordshirepolice stopped any other family in the community going through the pain we have suffered.” He added he wanted people to remember “loving” Juliana, “kind and funny” Kyle and “exceptional” Giselle for who they were.View image in fullscreenNicholas Prosper.Photograph: ScreengrabDCI Sam Khanna, of Bedfordshire police, said he had never “encountered anyone capable of such horrific acts” throughout his entire police career.Khanna said: “I’ve been utterly shocked and appalled by the actions and plans of the offender in this case, and I’m pleased that this truly evil individual will serve a significant proportion of his life behind bars.”On Tuesday, Luton crown court heard how he had shot his family dead at their home in Luton after a violent struggle and how it was part of a wider plan to carry out a mass shooting at St Joseph’s Catholic primary school, where he and his siblings were pupils, to gain notoriety as a mass murderer.His plan was months in the making. Prosper surveilled St Joseph’s, taking images of staff and students from the school’s website and noting the times of lessons and assembly.The day before the murders, Prosper bought a shotgun from an online seller for £650 after he “made a high-quality forgery of a shotgun certificate or licence”.He had planned to murder his family while they slept on Friday 13 September, a date chosen on purpose, and then leave the home at about 8.30am to travel to St Joseph’s school to carry out the attack.His plans were disrupted when his family realised that something was wrong. After they challenged him, there was a violent struggle.The court heard that Juliana was killed by a single shotgun shot to her head but her hands and arms had “slash injuries and bruising as if she had been trying to ward off blows from a knife”. Giselle was killed with a single gunshot to her face. Her body was found underneath a dining table “as if she had been trying to hide there”. Kyle died after being shot twice. His body was found with more than 100 knife wounds.Neighbours called the police after hearing the sounds of frantic footsteps, shouting and gunshots. Prosper fled the home before officers arrived, holding a bag containing the shotgun he had used to murder his family. Alongside the gun were 33 cartridges, which he had planned to use at a morning assembly at St Joseph’s.View image in fullscreenImage from CCTV footage showing Nicholas Prosper carrying a shotgun in a large holdall.Photograph: Bedfordshire police/PA MediaAfter hiding for two hours and believing his plan was thwarted, as police swarmed the area, Prosper flagged down officers in a marked car and they arrested him.The court heard details of a note outlining Prosper’s plan. In it, he wrote the entire attack would be “one of the biggest events ever” and it included a diagram pointing to one of the early years classrooms at St Joseph’s and an arrow pointing to a second classroom. Beside the first classroom he had written: “Kill all.”Maureen Murphy, the headteacher of St Joseph’s, said last month that staff were “very shocked” to learn of the plan.Prosper has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. A doctor who assessed Prosper said his diagnosis did not explain his lack of empathy and remorse and said he had “psychopathic traits”.Cheema-Grubb said: “It is important to note that your ASD does not correlate to an increased risk of violence. Nor did ASD, in this case, impair your ability to understand the nature of your conduct, exercise self-control or form rational judgments when you decided to commit violent crimes.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeGun crimeEnglandLutonBedfordshirenewsShareReuse this content"

In a voicemail to the family she said: “We don’t even know what the charges are against us. We will hear the charges for the first time then.”The couple have been running projects in schools in Afghanistan for 18 years and decided to stay in the country afterthe Taliban seized power in 2021. One of the projects involved educational training for mothers and children in Bamiyan, one of the largest cities in central Afghanistan.There is a ban on women working and on female education beyond primary school, but their work had apparently been approved by the Bamiyan local authority.The couple’s daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the Guardian she feared her parents would not get a fair trial because their interpreter, Juya, who was arrested alongside them, is also due in court on Thursday and will not be allowed to translate during the proceedings.She said: “Mum is obviously extremely concerned that without a competent interpreter, their case cannot be accurately or fairly represented and [they] will not be able to properly follow or engage in the proceedings, in serious breach of their rights.”Juya has also been caring for her father who requires regular heart medication. At the weekend, Entwistle said herfather’s life was in danger after his health deteriorated.On Wednesday, she said: “We remain extremely concerned for Dad in particular. Without access to the medication he needs, his continued detention poses a serious risk to his life.”She said her parents were being held separately and had been denied access to each other for the last 10 days.The couple were arrested on 1 February with Juya and a American-Chinese friend, Faye Hall, who had rented a plane to travel with them.At the time an employee for Rebuild, the couple’s training company, was informed that their flight “did not coordinate with the local government”.Entwistle said: “Again, we ask the Taliban to release Dad, Mum, Faye and the interpreter as a gesture of goodwill during this season of Ramadan.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Sorry, but that was irresistible,” adding three laughing emojis.Although the targets of the remark are not explicitly stated, she appears to be referring to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who played Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley between 2001 and 2011, and with whom Rowling spectacularly fell out in 2020 aftershe published an essay about surviving sexual assaultin which she called transgender identity “deeply misogynistic and regressive”.All three actors respondedto the essay with statements supportive of trans rights.Radcliffe said: “Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people.” Watson,in a message on social media, said: “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned.”Ralph Fiennes, who played Voldemort, subsequentlyoffered support to Rowlingin an interview in the Telegraph, saying that “the verbal abuse directed at her is disgusting”, while Helena Bonham Carter, who played Bellatrix Lestrange,told the Times: “It’s been taken to the extreme, the judgmentalism of people. She’s allowed her opinion, particularly if she’s suffered abuse.”After the publication of theCass review of gender identity servicesin 2024, Rowling asserted that shewas unlikely to forgive Radcliffe and Watson, claiming they were “celebs who cosied up to a movement intent on eroding women’s hard-won rights”.In 2024, Radcliffe revealedhe had had no direct contact with Rowlingsince the row erupted.Explore more on these topicsFilmJK RowlingHarry PotterDaniel RadcliffeEmma WatsonRupert GrintTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “It is not the actions of Lucy Letby that I am scrutinising. It is the actions of all those who were in the hospital within the terms of reference whose actions I am reviewing: what they did at the time, in light of what they knew at the time and in light of what they should have known at the time.”Four of the hospital’s former bosses, including its ex-chief executive Tony Chambers,had also called for the inquiry to be paused, arguing that there was a “real likelihood” Letby was innocent.Thirlwall has been examining the circumstances of the deaths and non-fatal collapses since September and has received evidence from hundreds of witnesses. The senior appeal court judge is due to publish her report in November.The calls to pause the inquiry came after an international panel of experts convened by Letby’s legal teamsaid there was no medical evidenceshe had murdered or harmed any of the infants she was accused of attacking.The former children’s nurse is serving 15 whole-life prison terms after being convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill another seven in the year to June 2016.Letby, who has always protested her innocence, has lost two attempts to overturn her convictions at the court of appeal.TheCriminal Cases Review Commission(CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, is examining fresh material submitted by a range of experts on behalf of Letby last month.The families of the babies said the appeals – which came in the final week of hearings at Liverpool town hall – were an attempt by Letby to “control the narrative” and by the executives to avoid criticism.Thirlwall said in her ruling that Letby and the executives were asking for an “effective suspension” of the inquiry and that it would “appear to be a very lengthy one”.She said it would add to rather than reduce the cost of the inquiry – currently running at nearly £10m – and rejected the idea that publishing her report on the basis of Letby’s guilt would be unfair to the hospital bosses.Thirlwall said hospital staff and others had already made a large number of concessions, which amounted to an acknowledgment that there had been a “total failure of safeguarding at every level”. She said this would inevitably feature in her report.It is understood the hospital executives, who are expected to be heavily criticised, are unlikely to challenge the ruling, given the cost of launching a judicial review.Thirlwall said she had previously rejected an attempt to amend the rules of the inquiry to allow it to consider alternative causes of death, because it would have meant the proceedings were “used as a vehicle for a collateral attack on the convictions, cutting across the criminal justice system”.She said the attempts to pause the inquiry had been prompted by a press conference that Letby’s legal team held in February, when an international panel of experts set out the case against her convictions.She quoted Richard Baker KC, a barrister for the families of 12 of the babies, who said on Tuesday: “Whatever side of the debate people are on, people should remember that the dead and the harmed are not public property to be dissected on the television or on the internet.”Thirlwall had been urged to publish only certain parts of her report, such as her recommendations for changes to NHS rules and governance, but she rejected that approach. There was a danger, she said, that her findings would “lose their impetus for not being attached to the facts”.Mark McDonald, Letby’s barrister, said the inquiry’s findings may be seen as “wholly unreliable”.“There is now overwhelming evidence that Lucy Letby’s convictions are unsafe. I will continue to represent her without fear or favour and ensure the many flaws in the case are put before the court of appeal,” he said.“If the numerous experts who have come forward are right, a young innocent woman is in prison for crimes she has not committed.“It is a shame the inquiry have not taken this on board and paused and, sadly, despite millions of pounds being spent, any report and recommendations may be seen as wholly unreliable.”Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyCriminal Cases Review CommissionChesterHospitalsEnglandUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

The sanction applied to two of the three charges with no separate penalty for the remaining charge, which was said to overlap with one of the others.On the extent to which Sidhu acted in breach of a position of trust and authority, Waddicor said: “He did. He was mentoring her, she was a mini-pupil and he was a senior barrister. There was a significant disparity in seniority and experience between the two of them.“She was in her mid-20s and he was in his 50s. He was a senior silk and she had not had any experience of the bar before. The disparity could not have been more striking.”Waddicor added: “The victim was caused anxiety as a result of what happened and undoubtedly it had an impact on her wellbeing.”She also acknowledged the impact of the proceedings, and the publicity they received, on Sidhu, saying it had been “very painful” for him as well as “shameful and embarrassing”.Waddicor spoke of “very many good references” from both men and women who described Sidhu as a “valued mentor” and “a man of principle who has devoted his life to the bar”.Fiona Horlick KC, for the Bar Standards Board, argued for Sidhu to be disbarred.In written submissions, she said: “It is submitted that this case, serious sexual misconduct involving a very senior and well-known male silk committed against a young, vulnerable mini-pupil where he abused his professional position and abused the trust she had in him, must be marked by the most serious of sanctions.“Any sanction other than disbarment would send a signal that this type of misconduct could be consistent with a continued career at the bar for the barrister involved and that victims of sexual misconduct are not protected.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In oral submissions, he said the panel was not able to be sure that the sexual activity was “unwanted” by Person 2 and that while the incident had caused her anxiety, she did not say she was in fear or humiliated, and later stated that she chose not to pursue a career at the bar “for a whole host of reasons”.He accepted that Sidhu – who was a key figure in the strike over conditions and government-set fees for legal aid advocacy work in 2022, when he was the chair of the CBA – was a “prominent figure” in the industry and therefore his actions had an impact on public confidence in the profession.Williamson said what happened was a “one-off” incident with no repetitions since, and Sidhu has undertaken psychotherapy and not worked for 17 months. “To have the matters that have been discussed and dealt with … dealt with to such a great and public extent is a cause of huge shame for him,” he said.Sidhu has 21 days to appeal against the sanction.Explore more on these topicsBarristersEmployment tribunalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Darren Cormack, the chief executive of the demining charity Mines Advisory Group, said the Briton was among five people injured in the explosion.The Israel Defense Forces denied hitting a UN building, saying “there was no IDF operational activity” in the area of the UN compound and “the IDF didn’t strike” it.Israeli strikes latest bloody chapter in war of extraordinary civilian casualtiesRead moreA series of Israeli evacuation orders telling about 150,000 people in the north and east of Gaza to leave their homes to avoid being trapped in a combat zone suggested ground assaults in coming days, but seizure of the Netzarim corridor is the first major move to retake territory in Gaza since Tuesday’s airstrikes, which shattered a two-month-long pause in the hostilities withHamas.A private security company that had been securing checkpoints in the Netzarim corridor withdrew overnight and Israeli troops in armoured vehicles and tanks and on foot moved in at dawn on Wednesday, according to western aid officials.The Israeli forces are believed to have reoccupied four fortified bases there and closed off all access. Travelling from north to south Gaza is now impossible, the officials said.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has said the new offensive will continueuntil “total victory” is achievedover Hamas and the 59 remaining hostages held by the militant group are freed.As part of the ceasefire deal agreed in January, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor.Netzarim corridor mapSeparately, Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, threatened ordinary people in Gaza.Katz issued a “last warning” to Palestinians in Gaza on Wednesday, saying in a video statement that they should follow the recent advice of the US president, Donald Trump, to return Israeli hostages and remove Hamas from power.“Return the hostages and remove Hamas, and other options will open up for you – including the possibility of leaving for other places in the world, for those who want to,” Katz said.Hundreds of thousands returned to what remained of their homes and Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone around the edges of Gaza during the ceasefire, which began in mid-January.When the agreed first phase of the ceasefire ended 17 days ago, Israel reimposed a blockade on Gaza, cutting off all supplies.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned on Wednesday that medics were struggling to manage a sharp increase in casualties over the last 36 hours after the resumption of ground operations by Israel in the Gaza Strip.“Due to the recent suspension of humanitarian aid into Gaza, stocks of medical supplies have dropped significantly and on top of this, hospital staff are struggling to manage the sharp increase of casualties,” said the ICRC in a statement.The Guardian view on Israel breaking the ceasefire: destroying hope along with lives | EditorialRead moreIsrael and Hamas accuse each other of breaching the truce, which had broadly held since January and offered respite for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza.About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died in the shock Hamas incursion into Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict. About 250 hostages were also taken. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 49,000, also mostly civilians.Netanyahu and other Israel officials said the decision to renew attacks in Gaza came after Hamas rejected proposals for a 30- to 60-day extension of the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire.Hamas says it wants to conclude the phases of the ceasefire deal as signed.Israel has refused to enter into discussions about the second phase, which is intended to lead to a permanent end to hostilities, the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza, and the return of all the hostages in Gaza, of whom more than half are thought to be dead.“Hamas has not closed the door on negotiations, but we insist there is no need for new agreements,” Taher al-Nunu, a Hamas official, said on Wednesday.Nunu called on the international community to “take urgent action” to end the war, while accusing Israel of “violating the ceasefire agreement it signed”.Analysts said Israel had launched new strikes to “break an impasse”.Prof Danny Orbach, an expert in military history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said: “There was a very good reason Israel did not want to go to phase two [of the ceasefire agreement]. It would have meant Hamas staying in Gaza, staying in power and Israel having to lift its siege too … There was a complete disconnect between the interests of the two sides.”Critics in Israelhave accused Netanyahu of resuming the offensive toreinforce his coalition governmentbefore a crucial budget vote in parliament, to rally support for the war in the face of popular backing for a ceasefire, and to head off widespread public anger over his attempt to fire the head of the internal security service, the Shin Bet.Underlining the deep divisions in Israel, tens of thousands in Israel protested on Tuesday night and Wednesday against the renewed offensive and Netanyahu’s government. More demonstrations are planned in coming days.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warUnited NationsPalestinian territoriesHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A further 20 Palestinians died in further attacks on Wednesday, local health officials said.In a statement on Wednesday, Israel’s defence minister warned the military was preparing to intensify its new offensive.Israel launches ‘limited ground operation’ to retake Netzarim corridor in GazaRead moreIsrael Katz said: “Residents ofGaza, this is the last warning. Take the advice of the president of the United States.Return the hostages and remove Hamas, and other options will open up for you – including the possibility of leaving for other places in the world for those who want to.”It was not immediately clear which statement Katz was referring to.In al-Mawasi, tented encampments that had stretched along the entire shoreline emptied when the ceasefire was agreed. Almost half a million peopleheaded back to the north of Gazato try to rebuild their ruined homes. Many are now returning, pitching their tents once again on the dunes.“The worst thing is not the deprivation or the uncertainty. It is that the hopes we had with the ceasefire are gone. We thought our pains were over but it has just started again,” said Osama.Evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military on Tuesday, along with renewed airstrikes and tank shelling, are forcing thousands of Palestinians to return to makeshift camps where they sheltered for months last year.View image in fullscreenIsraeli strikes on Gaza have killed more than 400 people in the last two days.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPALeaflets dropped on Beit Hanoun, a once thriving town in northern Gaza, told residents that “staying in the shelters or the current tent puts your lives and that of your family members in danger” and advised them to “evacuate immediately”.There were similar scenes in towns close to Rafah and Khan Younis in the south, as well as Shuja’iya in the centre. The new orders mean more than 160,000 people have been now told to leave their homes.Earlier in the war, Israel used a complicated system of numbered zones to tell Palestinians where they would be safer. This system appears to have been abandoned.Many in Gaza say they are facing a daily challenge of surviving in the shattered concrete and twisted metal ruins that were once their homes, without running water, electricity or reliable communications.Staff at the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah said they had received a high number of patients.“Now, we can feel the panic in the air, the sound of ambulance sirens is a constant, and we can see the pain and devastation in the faces of those we are helping. People are scared and are again forced to think only of surviving the next hours,” said Fred Oola, a senior medical officer at the hospital.Israel re-imposed a tight blockade on Gaza 17 days ago, hours after the first official phase of the ceasefire ended. Prices of basic essentials immediately soared amid panic-buying, then calmed. Now they are spiking again, with a kilo of potatoes now costing the equivalent of $5 (£3.80), four times more than a week ago.“A lot of people simply can’t afford that, and there’s absolutely no fresh fruit or dairy however much money you have,” said one senior aid official.Aid distributions have already been cut to preserve stocks, and though 25,000 trucks entered the territory during the two-month pause in hostilities, supplies could start running out soon.“We have flour for a week or so, but not enough food to cover everyone with rations this month,” one senior aid official in Gaza said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said medical stocks are running lowAlmost everyone in Gaza has been displaced several times, often after evacuation orders from the Israeli military.“We were shocked by the orders. We began gathering our important belongings, some food, and evacuated immediately,” said Khatam al-Kafarna, a 28-year-old nurse who has moved from Beit Hanoun with her family to the coastal al-Shati camp area 6 miles (10km) to the west.“But the reality is harsh, and the conditions are difficult. There is no aid, no food, no bread, no water, no rest and no privacy,” she said.View image in fullscreenA home in the Sabra neighbourhood in Gaza is flattened after an Israeli airstrike.Photograph: APAImages/Rex/ShutterstockLike al-Mawasi, al-Shati camp is now filling again with newly displaced people. Aid agencies have been unable to prepare for the influx, and so lack almost all essentials.“It is miserable here. We used to live in a large, beautiful, safe and secure house with a big, beautiful garden. I had my own room. Now, we all share the same tent, and we share everything. We wait for death every moment. We barely survived the war by miracle, and we might not survive this if it continues,” al-Kafarna said.Netanyahu told Israelis in a televised address on Tuesday that he had ordered the new strikes because Hamas had rejected proposals for an extension of the ceasefire, which came into effect in mid-January.Hamas, which still holds 59 hostages of the approximately 250 seized in its 7 October 2023 cross-border attack, accused Israel of reneging on its earlier agreement to a three-phase truce leading to a permanent end to the war.About 1,200, mostly civilians, were killed in the 2023 attack. More than 49,000 in Gaza, also mostly civilians, have died during the Israeli offensive in the territory that followed.Umm Mujahid Abu Jrad, 31 and heavily pregnant with her fourth child, also left Beit Hanoun on Wednesday.“When I heard on the news that the ceasefire had been violated, I knew that we would be living the nightmare of war again. We have already been displaced eight times but we woke up to evacuation orders and so began to prepare our things to move to another area,” she said.“When I learned that the war had resumed, I felt a great anger. Why did they do this when everything was going as it should? What do they want from us after they destroyed our homes and made us homeless, turning Gaza into a ghost town? What more do they want?”Israeli military officials said the strikes on Wednesday were against “terrorist” targets including a “Hamas military site in northern Gaza where preparations were being made to fire projectiles” and “several vessels in the coastal area of the Gaza Strip … intended for use in terrorist operations by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad [armed group]”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Acommercial jetliner and an army helicopter collidednear the nation’s capital on 29 January, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on 31 January, killing the six people onboard and another person on the ground.The Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was on a regularly scheduled afternoon flight between the community of Unalakleet and Nome, a trip of about 150 miles (240km) when authorities lost contact less than an hour after takeoff, David Olson, the director of operations for Bering Air, said at the time.All 10 people aboard Alaska plane that crashed died, says US Coast GuardRead moreA review of the plane’s contents following the crash indicated that its estimated gross weight at departure was about 9,865lb (4,475kg) – about 1,058lb over the maximum takeoff gross weight for a flight where icing conditions were in the forecast, the report says.Messages seeking comment on Wednesday from the NTSB and from Bering Air were not immediately returned.The Cessna Caravan went missing about 30 miles south-east of Nome. After an extensive search, the wreckage was found the following day on a drifting ice floe. The pilot and all nine passengers had been killed.Radar data provided by the US civil air patrol indicated the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed, but it was unclear why that happened, the US Coast Guard has said. The agency was unaware of any distress signals from the plane.The plane was flying in an area where moderate icing was possible between 2,000ft (610 meters) and 8,000ft and where the weather could be hazardous to light aircraft, the NTSB chair, Jennifer Homendy, said at a news conference in Nome last month. She said the plane, which was last spotted on radar at 3,400ft, had an anti-icing system on its wings and tail, and that the equipment would be examined as part of the investigation.NTSB preliminary reports do not usually reveal the cause of a crash since the investigation is still ongoing. A final report, which does usually contain the cause, will be released later.Explore more on these topicsAlaskaPlane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

But seven hours is almost unique in history.”Kristian Midtgard, a dog handler who – with his dog, Whiskey – found the man, told TV2: “It was very surprising that he was still alive.”“All the statistics and experience say that it’s not possible when you stay buried for so long,” he added.The mayor of Lyngen, Erik Larsen, quoted by the public broadcaster NRK, called it “a miracle”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was transferred first to New Jersey and then to Louisiana, where he is currently detained.The Trump administration sought his deportation but two days after his arrest, the New York federal judge, Jesse Furman, ordered thatKhalil not be deported while his legal challengecontinues.‘I am a political prisoner’: Mahmoud Khalil says he’s being targeted for political beliefsRead moreFederal prosecutors then asked the New York court handling the case to transfer Khalil’s challenge to his arrest and detention toLouisiana.Khalil’s lawyers haveadvocated for his return to New York. They have requested that he be released on bail, which would allow him to reunite with his wife, an American citizen who is due to give birth next month.In his order on Wednesday morning, Furman explained that, given the fact that Khalil was in detention inNew Jerseyat the time his lawyers submitted their petition, meant that the New York court “lacks jurisdiction over most, if not all, of Khalil’s claims”.Furman further stated that since the district of New Jersey was “the one and only district in which Khalil could have filed his Petition when he did”, the legal statutes governing the transfer of civil cases from one federal district court to another “dictate that the case be sent there”, rather than Louisiana.Furman added that his order from 10 March – barring the government from deporting Khalil while the legal challenge continues – shall also remain in effect, “unless and until the transferee court orders otherwise”.Khalil’s lawyers have submitted requests for his immediate release, but as of Wednesday morning, Furman has not ruled on those bids, focusing instead on the jurisdiction question.Khalil has not been accused of a crime and his legal team has argued that theTrump administrationis unlawfully retaliating against him for his activism and constitutionally protected speech.Theyassertthat his detention violates his constitutional rights, including the rights to free speech and due process, and that the arrest and detainment exceeds the government’s legal authority.The Trump administration has accused the former student of leading and engaging in “activities aligned to Hamas” and is seeking to deport him using a rarelyinvokedlegal provision from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.This provision gives theUS secretary of state the power to remove individuals from the US if their presence isdeemed to “have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”.Khalil released his first public statement since the arrest on Tuesday.In the statement, Khalilspoke out against the conditions facing immigrantsin US detention and said he was being targeted by theTrump administrationfor his political beliefs.Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsNew YorkLaw (US)New JerseynewsShareReuse this content"

The current overwintering team is not due to be relieved until December, after the southern hemisphere winter ice storms pass.Dangers of life in close quarters on the three-module base, more than 2,600 miles south of Cape Town, were revealed last weekend with the publication of an email sent by a researcheraccusing a male colleagueof physical assault and making a death threat.The person who made the allegations said they feared for their own and their colleagues’ safety, demanding “immediate action”, according to the South AfricanSunday Timesnewspaper, which published the email but removed the names.“Regrettably, [his] behaviour has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing. Specifically, he physically assaulted [name withheld], which is a grave violation of personal safety and workplace norms,” it said.“Furthermore, he threatened to kill [name withheld], creating an environment of fear and intimidation. I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.”The letter said “numerous concerns” had been raised about the alleged attacker.George said the allegation related to “a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do – a weather-dependent task that required a schedule change”. The overwintering team normally includes scientists, engineers and a medical doctor.In a further statement, South Africa’s department of forestry, fisheries and the environment said it was also investigating a sexual harassment claim.It added that none of the alleged incidents “required any of the nine overwintering team members to be brought back to Cape Town” but it had “immediately activated the response plan to engage the individuals involved through trained professionals in order to mediate and restore relationships at the base”.The alleged perpetrator had “willingly participated in further psychological evaluation” and shown remorse, the department said, including by writing a formal apology to the victim.South Africa first established a scientific station inAntarcticain 1960.

He has said he had consensual sex with the woman and is appealing against the verdict, with a hearing scheduled for Friday in the high court in Dublin.McGregor, a former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) champion, used his platform at the White House to hit out at the Irish government over immigration, saying the country was “potentially losing its Irishness” and claiming that some rural towns had been “overrun in one swoop”.Dressed in a green suit on Ireland’s national day, McGregor was invited to speak in the official White House briefing room alongside the president’s press secretary before going on to meet Trump and Elon Musk in the Oval Office along with his partner and children.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Elon Musk pose for a photograph with Conor McGregor and his family on Monday.Photograph: X/@whitehouseMcGregor, 36, has been supported by figures including the self-styled misogynist influencerAndrew Tate and anti-immigration campaigners in Ireland whose reach has been turbocharged by Musk’s retweets.But his claim to speak for the people of Ireland on the issue of immigration has been widely derided and condemned. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said McGregor’s claims were simply “wrong”. The finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, said his “heart fell” when he learned of the meeting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Government data shows that in the last three years, just over 45,000 people have applied for asylum in Ireland, which has a population of about 5.3 million.Some believe the fighter may be positioning himself for a presidential run in Ireland later this year.Explore more on these topicsConor McGregorRape and sexual assaultMMAUFCIrelandDonald TrumpViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

She added that Ottawa would ask for leniency for other Canadians facing the same fate.“There are four Canadians that have been executed and therefore we are strongly condemning what happened,” she said.“Canada strongly condemns China’s use of the death penalty, which is irreversible and inconsistent with basic human dignity,” a GAC spokesperson, Charlotte MacLeod, said in a statement to the Guardian. “Canada repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere.”MacLeod said Canada was providing consular assistance to the victims’ families and asked media “respect the family’s privacy during this difficult time”.China’s embassy in Canada said in a statement it is a “rule of law” nation and that anyone convicted of breaking laws “must be held accountable”.“Drug-related crime is a severe crime recognized worldwide as extremely harmful to the society, and will be faced with severe penalties in all countries. China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a ‘zero tolerance’ attitude towards the drug problem,” the embassy said, adding it had “solid and sufficient” evidence in all the cases in which prisoners were executed.“The Chinese judicial authorities have handled the cases in strict accordance with the law, and have fully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned.”China has aconviction rate of more than 99%, a result that has elicited skepticism and criticism from human rights groups over the years.The embassy called on Canada to “respect the rule of law and China’s judicial sovereignty” and to “stop making irresponsible remarks” in order to improve relationship between to the two countries.Relations between the two countries hit a low point between 2018 and 2022, after the prominent Huawei telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou wasarrested in Vancouverat the request of US authorities.Her detention in Canada prompted China to quickly detain and charge two Canadians living in the country, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, eventually charging the pair with espionage.But the upgrading of charges against a Canadian in prison further cemented views in Canada that China wasengaged in “hostage diplomacy”.In 2014, the Canadian citizen Robert Schellenberg was accused of attempting to smuggle 225kg of methamphetamine to Australia. He has maintained his innocence, but in December 2018 he was sentenced to 15 years. That charge was upgraded to execution in 2019, during the fervour of China’s diplomatic spat with Canada. At the time, Canadaissued a travel warningto its citizens going to China.MacLeod confirmed on Wednesday that Schellenberg was still detained and said the federal government “continues to advocate for clemency”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaChinaAmericasCapital punishmentnewsShareReuse this content"

You can step a little bit back.’ I don’t know how it is for kids who are starting out, but … if someone is like, ‘OK, and then he’s going to put his handhere,’  I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.”Chalamet plays a ping pong protege in the movie, loosely inspired by real-life sportsman Marty Reisman, the US men’s singles champion in 1958 and 1960. Paltrow plays the wife of a rival table tennis contender with whom Chalamet’s character starts an affair.“I mean, we have a lot of sex in this movie,” said Paltrow. “There’s a lot –a lot.” Of the considerable age gap between the leads, Paltrow said she sought to make light of it early on during production. “I was like: ‘OK, great. I’m 109 years old. You’re 14.’ ” She also praised Chalamet’s seriousness and commitment to his craft, after his defeat at the Oscars to Adrien Brody earlier this month.Paltrow won an Oscar 26 years ago for Shakespeare in Love; in 2017 she was one of the first high-profile stars to accuse its producer, Harvey Weinstein, of sexual harassment.The use of intimacy coordinators is now standard practice across the industry, with many stars, includingEmma Thompson,Rachel Zeglerand Sydney Sweeney vocal in their support of their introduction.However, others have criticised their presence, with Sean Bean saying they “spoil the spontaneity” of scenes, while Jennifer Aniston said she dismissed the intimacy coordinator hired for The Morning Show to oversee a scene between her and Jon Hamm.“I’m like: ‘Please, this is awkward enough!’ We’re seasoned – we can figure this one out.”While Paltrow and Aniston are veteran stars likely to be the most powerful people on their respective sets, some younger actors have also expressed scepticism about whether intimacy coordinators need to be mandatory.Anora star Mikey Madison, whose best actress win was among one of the five Oscars the film earned earlier this month said she declined director Sean Baker’s offer of an intimacy coordinator for her sex scenes.“Mark Eydelshteyn, who plays Ivan, and I decided it would be best to just keep it small. My character is a sex worker, and I had seen Sean’s films and know his dedication to authenticity. I was ready for it. As an actress, I approached it as a job.”Explore more on these topicsFilmGwyneth PaltrowFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It comes directly from the collection of the film’s Oscar-winning special effects artist, the late Carlo Rambaldi, who also worked onKing Kongand Alien.His daughter Daniela Rambaldi said: “We are truly honoured to collaborate with Sotheby’s and deeply grateful for this opportunity to bring my father’s work to auction.“We hope that the artefacts being offered will bring immense joy to those who will cherish them in the years to come, just as they have brought great emotions to my family and shaped the magic of my childhood.“These iconic pieces hold a special place in our hearts, and it is our sincere wish that they continue to inspire and captivate future generations.”The model, estimated to be worth between $600,000 and $900,000, is being sold as part of the Sotheby’s auction, There are Such Things: 20th Century Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy on Screen.The auction has items such as costumes, props and posters from the early 1930s through until the end of the century.Sketches and design work from ET are also being sold, along with two screen-used sandworm models from David Lynch’s science fiction film Dune.Rambaldi won two Academy Awards for visual effects on ET and Alien and also a Special Achievement gong for his work on King Kong.The appearance of the model is said to have been inspired by a range of different sources, including the eyes of Albert Einstein, Ernest Hemingway, Carl Sandburg and the Rambaldi family’s cat.Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby’s vice-chair, said Rimbaldi’s “meticulous craftsmanship behind icons such as ET, the sandworms of David Lynch’s Dune and King Kong, remains a testament to the magic of practical effects”.“This model embodies the artistry of an era before CGI took hold, a nostalgic and iconic piece of Hollywood history as captivating as the stories themselves,” she added.The Sotheby’s auction opens for bidding on 21 March and closes on 3 April.Explore more on these topicsET: The Extra-TerrestrialKing KongFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Singh, born in 1937, matured as an artist at a time of huge social upheaval in India. Amid states of national emergency, rising international tensions and nuclear tests, the art that came out of India after 1975 – brilliantly documented in theBarbican’s Imaginary Institution of Indiaexhibition last year – became a way of documenting, resisting and surviving.But Singh’s work isn’t hugely literal, nor particularly angry. Instead, her intense, colourful figurative paintings feel like a glimpse of interior life, of emotion and trauma in times of struggle. They are hugely complex, infinitely layered and filled with historical allusions, military symbolism and daily life. The paintings are stacked vertically with imagery – not laid out on a single plane like a traditional western landscape painting, but with multiple ideas piled up and across the canvas. You’re almost never looking at just one thing, one scene, but multiple images knitted together. It’s part-comic book, part-Chagall dreamscape, part-folk art.View image in fullscreenKali-esque … Devi Pistol Wali, 1990.Photograph: Courtesy of Museum of Art & Photography, Bengaluru, India. © Arpita SinghIn one early painting, a woman tends to her garden as a mother nurses her child. People drive by in cars, a kid peers around a curtain and a figure sleeps while jets fly overhead. Perspectives don’t make sense and picture planes clash, but it all coalesces into a gorgeous world of blue, a portrait of female care and tenderness in the hectic hustle of urbanity.That battle between inner life and sociopolitical reality plays out across all the best works here. A couple takes tea in front of a saluting soldier, a multi-armed Kali-esque woman fights off a bureaucrat with a gun while balancing on a sleeping man. Everywhere you look there are the same images, repeated over and over like memories looping back: flowers, cars, soldiers, bureaucrats in black, looming men and countless women.The women matter here because they nurture, care and provide in a world that otherwise seems hellbent on chaos and violence. This comes out most clearly in watercolours from the 1990s: psychedelic visions of motherhood and femininity that are gorgeously tender and vulnerable. And even though the bigger paintings until about 2002 are the stars of the show, the works on paper are great, clearer and more concise than the paintings but still full of Singh’s hallmarks.View image in fullscreenA gorgeous world of blue … This Could be Us, You, Or Anybody Else, 2007.Photograph: © Arpita SinghWorks from the past 20 years take a more collage-like approach, creating big patchy canvases plastered with words, human figures and strips of clashing colours. There are references to war, conflict, displacement, nods to Indian epics – they’re interesting paintings, but most of them are just splotchy, semi-abstract and incoherent, and don’t convey her ideas or aesthetic as well as the earlier pieces. While they’re not great, maybe that makes sense with the theme of the show. Maybe it reflects how your memory frays and splinters, how images increasingly struggle to coalesce in your mind’s eye.There is a lot here that will go over the heads of a non-Indian audience, and a lot that goes largely unexplained. There are just so many references to folk art, Indian court painting and current events that aren’t so current any more. Trying to figure it all out can leave you feeling a little delirious. But Singh wants viewers to take the work at face value, to interpret it for themselves. So what you’re left with is a sort of beautiful chaos of memory, a vision of life where the political, personal, societal and domestic meld into one big past. That’s how we remember, isn’t it? Everything jumbled together and hopefully, in the end, quite beautiful.Arpita Singh: Remembering is atSerpentine North gallery, London, until 27 July.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingSerpentine GalleryIndiaSouth and central AsiareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the perfect warm-up act for Cheltenham-born experimentalistFKA twigs, whose abstract take on pop has always felt inscrutably alien: from 2012’s dark, trip-hoppy debut EP1to her new club-inspired album Eusexua, her first to hit the UK Top 10. If the latter’s title proved slippery – it’s a term she coined for the elevated state of clarity she likened to “the moment before an orgasm” – this three-act show is even trickier to pin down, and irresistibly so.A title card on a screen introduces Act I: The Practice. Twigs slowly emerges from behind the box in a dress, singing a medley that threads backwards through her catalogue: from Thousand Eyes on 2019’s Magdalene to Weak Spot from EP1. Then she snaps to the present, namely the club vibe of Eusexua. Her dancers strip to their underwear and dance to the airy techno of Room of Fools. It’s a striking showcase of FKA twigs’s versatility, held together by her acrobatic live vocal and closing in the drum’n’bass outro of Striptease.In Act II: State of Being, the box is uncovered to reveal an open frame and the show becomes more free-form and spectacle-heavy. Suspending herself from chains in the box, she sings Eusexua’s title-track upside down. Girl Feels Good features a whip-cracking dancer. Darting around her catalogue, she throws in an unreleased song called Perfectly – a bright, punchy, club-ready track in the vein of Eusexua – and dances to a remix of Madonna’s Vogue. Act III: The Pinnacle feels more sedate, but no less surprise-filled: FKA twigs dances with a sword, sings to a huge silver dragon operated by puppeteers and closes with a pole dance in the box to 24hr Dog.There’s a nagging sense that this three-part structure doesn’t really go anywhere concrete: the resulting jumble falls slightly short of the high concepts it gestures at, though it works as sheer pop spectacle. It even hints, thrillingly, at a future wherein FKA twigs, like Charli xcx, might become a bona fide pop star well into her career’s third act.FKA twigs is playing atMagazine Londonon 21 and 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsFKA twigsExperimental musicDance musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

It sticks with the same 6.1in OLED screen as its predecessors, which looks good but lacks an always-on mode. It’s also still stuck at a relatively slow 60Hz refresh rate, which can make scrolling and motion more jarring than on models with faster screens.The latest A18 chip is rapid and enables Apple’s Intelligence features (AI tools). The battery lasts about two days of general use, or at least a day of heavy use, and the phone charges with USB-C. It also supports MagSafe and Qi/Qi2 wireless charging and accessories. It starts with a decent 128GB of storage, although larger models are available if you don’t want to store your photos and videos in the cloud.The iPhone 16 is light and fairly compact for a modern smartphone, and its IP68 rating means it’s water-resistant to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes – more than safe enough for any accidental dunks. It gains the useful Action button from 2023’siPhone 15 Pro, which replaces the mute switch and can be used to mute the phone or for various other functions, such as turning on the torch or launching apps. The new Camera Control button is great for quickly opening the camera, even if zooming, changing settings and shooting photos with the button is fiddly in the camera app.The dual camera on the back is good, comprising a main 48MP camera and an improved 12MP ultrawide camera, which now has a macro photography mode for fun closeup shots. It also has Apple’s photographic styles features for those who want to customise how the camera captures photos (rich contrast, vibrant, warm) and get creative with tone and colour palette. The main camera can do a 2x in-sensor zoom, which works well in bright light, but the lack of a real telephoto camera holds the 16 back. The 12MP selfie camera is the same as other iPhones.The iPhone runs the recently released iOS 18.3, which includessupport for RCS messaging with Androidand adds more of Apple’s new AI features. They include a selection of AI writing tools that are built into the keyboard, which allow you to proof, rewrite and summarise text, create tables and lists, transcribe audio from calls and recordings, among other small features.An AI object remover in photos can help improve your shots, while theImage Playgroundtool can generate images for you from descriptions or photos, including cartoon versions of real people. The Genmoji tool in the keyboard can create custom emoji stickers too.Siri has a new design and can now pass queries to ChatGPT for more advanced answers.

It’s the step-up option to the basic iPhone 16: the same good bits, but a slightly larger (6.3in) screen, despite being squeezed into a similarly sized titanium and glass body. The display is crisp, bright and slick, with a faster 120Hz refresh rate to keep scrolling and animations smooth. The screen also supports the handy always-on feature, showing the time and notifications when not in use.The 16 Pro also has a slightly more powerful A18 Pro chip and starts with 128GB of storage, with greater space available – up to 1TB – for those who need it. The battery lasts a good 40 hours of general use, meaning it will go through the heaviest of days, and most will need to charge it only every other day.It has the same two extra Action and Camera Control buttons as the regular model, but the camera on the back is better. The 48MP main camera and 48MP ultrawide camera are great and the extra 12MP 5x telephoto camera meaningfully closes the distances to objects. Combined, they shoot great photos across various lighting conditions and scenarios.£949 at John LewisFrom £999 at AppleWhy should you buy it?This is Apple’s best phone, with its most powerful camera, top performance and a high-quality big-enough screen in a device that’s still easy to fit in a pocket.Buy if:you want the Pro screen, titanium body and best camera without a massive displayDon’t buy if:you want the longest battery life or biggest display on an iPhoneRead ourfulliPhone 16 Pro review: Apple levels up its smaller ‘pro’ phoneScreen:6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A18 ProStorage:128, 256, 512GB or 1TBCamera:48MP main + 48MP UW + 12MP 5x; 12MP front-facingDimensions:149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm (HWD)Weight:199gBest iPhone for screen:iPhone 16 Pro MaxView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16 Pro Max, left, has a big batteryanda big screen, which often makes it feel like a small tablet rather than a phone.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe biggest, most expensive iPhone in Apple’s 16 series lineup is the iPhone 16 Pro Max. It takes everything great from the smaller iPhone 16 Pro and adds a bright, crisp and smooth 6.9in display. Watching movies on it feels more like using a small tablet than a phone.The 16 Pro Max also has a big battery, lasting about 55 hours of general use between charges, so it needs charging every third day. That means it will manage even the heaviest all-day use, and is ideal if you want to game for hours.However, Apple’s superphone is so big that it is hard to handle, needing two hands to wield. It’s also quite heavy and bulky, making it a bit of a lump to carry in a pocket or small bag.From £1,129 at John LewisFrom £1,199 at AppleWhy should you buy it?The 16 Pro Max is Apple’s superphone with a massive, beautiful screen and excellent battery life, as well as everything good about its smaller 16 Pro sibling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It is thin, light and pretty compact for a modern phone, and it’s water-resistant like the rest of Apple’s iPhones.Inside is the latest A18 chip with at least 128GB of storage. That enables the same Apple Intelligence features as the rest of the iPhone 16 line, which will not run on the iPhone 15 and older models, though none of them are killer features as yet.It had a solid battery life of up to two days in my tests, which is slightly longer than the regular iPhone 16, and USB-C charging. But the 16e misses out on a few things including the new Camera Control button, MagSafe on the back for accessories, the new fasterwifi 7 standard and a handful of other specs that are common on the regular iPhone 16 models. A bigger deal-breaker might be the single camera on the back, which is good but lacks any ultrawide or telephoto options.Despite costing about 25% less than the regular iPhone 16, it’s not that cheap, so better options can be found refurbished for similar or less money.From £599 at Apple£599 at John LewisWhy should you buy it?The 16e offers the modern iPhone experience with the latest chips and AI but with a few things missing to hit a lower price, such as a dual camera and MagSafe.Buy if:you want the cheapest new iPhone from Apple with the latest AI featuresDon’t buy if:you are at all into photography or have MagSafe accessoriesRead our fulliPhone 16e review: Apple’s cheapest new phoneScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)Processor:Apple A18Storage:128, 256 or 512GBCamera:48MP rear; 12MP front-facingDimensions:146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8mm (HWD)Weight:167gOther iPhones still on sale at AppleView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 15 will have software support for about five to six years.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe iPhone 15, released in 2023, has the same screen and aluminium body as the current iPhone 16 but lacks the action and camera control buttons.

To speed things up, check you have enough free storage and clear out any unused apps or content, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music. Aim for at least 2GB of free space.If your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’siPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receiveoccasional security updatesfrom Apple.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished phonesis better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.There are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished andsold directly by Applethat come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.Quick GuideA buyer’s guide to refurbished phonesShowSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chainsCeXandGameand online stores such asmusicMagpieandEnvirofone. Marketplaces likeAmazonandeBayand refurb specialistBack Marketalso have a wide range. And some phone operators, includingO2,giffgaff,EEandVodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A– virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B– in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C– in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D– also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health– batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port– check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons– do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner– is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks– check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts– not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen– check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against adatabase of stolen devicesthrough a service such asCheckMENDor similar.Warranty– what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Do not buyAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.An iPhone 13 mini unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.How I testedQuick GuideHow I testedShowWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why should you trust me?I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 17 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

I want to stand by the idea that my natural face is formal enough. I really want to cry, laugh and hug without worrying about smudging my face. But I worry about being “underdressed” at my own wedding. I’m sure even our celebrant will look more glam than me.Is going bare-faced to my own wedding too radical for people to understand? Should I encourage other people to go natural in my dress code?– Bare-Faced BrideAccording to a recentarticlein Allure, “wedding day makeup should be ‘you, but enhanced’”.Ahem. This is also the promise ofThe Substance.I don’t think it’s unfair to compare our cultural obsession with bridal glam to the 2024 body horror blockbuster, in which the main character uses a black market cosmetic injectable to create a “more beautiful, more perfect” version of herself. I’d argue that wedding day beauty has indeed devolved into its own brand of body horror. On the big day, the average bride spendsabout $300to transform her ordinary flesh into something worthy of photographic immortalization – very Dorian Gray! – although wedding makeup can reach the“extortionate”price of $1,500.Prep might begin as much as a year in advance. “I’ve worked with countless brides wanting perfect skin on their wedding day, and they’re always surprised to learn how early we need to get to work,” writes New York-based aestheticianSofie Pavitt. For those with large pores, for instance, she recommends occasionally inflicting thousands of one-millimeter wounds on the skin to force regeneration (microneedling) and/or penetrating its moisture barrier with fractional laser beams (Clear + Brilliant) over a period of 12 months. This will ensure that “makeup sits beautifully and lasts all day”, she says.Popular day-oftipsencourage the affianced to defy the laws of physics by letting their “skin shine through [their] makeup” and turning their “own natural beauty up to ‘medium’”.But it’s possible for a bride to spare no financial or temporal investment and just feel “8/10 happy … pretty good” about her nuptial glam. Take Emily Weiss, founder of the ultimate “you but better” beauty brand,Glossier, who detailed the extensive pre-wedding routine for her “limbs, skin, wanted hair, unwanted hair, nails, muscles, digestive tract, lashes and brows” on her beauty blog,Into The Gloss. Or she may look so wonderful getting married that she “never feel[s] pretty again”, as influencer Thea Vaporis joked inan Instagram postjuxtaposing her normal, makeup-free face with the fully made-up face from her wedding photos.With outcomes like these, why bother? Why put so much effort into making your face different from the face that was proposed to, the one that will remain married? Why is matrimonial metamorphosis so normalized, expected – even, in your case, encouraged?It might have something to do with the patriarchal history of marriage as property exchange. From about 1300 to 1800 AD, women were treated as assets and traded to secure wealth. (To wit: The Knot claims“Old Money Makeup”is the number one wedding beauty trend of 2025.) Today, most women can choose who and why they marry, but marriage is still seen as “a major marker of success”, Elise Hu, the author of Flawless: Lessons in Looks and Culture from the K-Beauty Capital, told me earlier this month. “That pursuit and performance of success extends to the body and the face.”In the TikTok era, these performative aspects of a wedding get dialed up to 11.“Social media is the fuel to the fire when it comes to the increasing demand surrounding wedding beauty products, services and advice,”Business of Fashion reports, noting that the arrival of image-focused apps in the 2010s is associated with doubled budgets and increased pressure from peers to put together a picture-perfect wedding.Makeup artist Saskia Wright told Business of Fashion that more brides are requesting pictures of themselves peering into a compact, admiring their own wedding makeup. The final image doesn’t portray theperson, but their mirror image, captured with a camera lens – which is then seen through the screen of a smartphone. It’s a doppelganger to the power of three, which strikes me as an apt metaphor for your situation. If you do decide to wear makeup to your wedding, would you be doing it for yourself – or the version of yourself surveilled by society, sublimated into the symbolic bride, and preserved in a virtual scrapbook?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t look a certain wayI agree with you: itisradical to get married without makeup in 2025. It’s radical to choose embodied freedom – your ability to “cry, laugh and hug” without regard for running mascara – over performance as a bride. It might be hard for your community to understand, but 200 years ago, so was marrying for love! People did it anyway. I think you should do this, too. You want to. Your partner loves you as-is. Go for it.If it makes you feel more comfortable, tell your celebrant, family, friends and wedding party that you’ll be makeup-free ahead of time to help them gauge their own glam level. Letthemadjust toyourpreferences, not the other way around.Sure, there’s a possibility that you’ll regret looking “underdressed” at your own wedding.

Desperate to be accepted by the in-crowd, but sick with anxiety if I was invited to one of their parties, I had no idea who I was. I had spots, wonky teeth and my hair was lank. I was kind of gangly and excruciatingly shy. I didn’t fit the mould, and I had no idea you could carve out your own space in the world.Bombarded with TV shows such as Beverly Hills 90210 and Baywatch, while poring over teen magazines, I compared myself with the glossy, wholesome models that I saw – and felt that I was failing.View image in fullscreenUnapologetic spirit … Courtney Love performing with Hole in 1992.Photograph: Lindsay Brice/Getty ImagesEverything changed when I first heardCourtney Love. I was kneeling on the floor next to my cheap 90s stacker system, aged 14. My boyfriend had lent me his copied tape of Hole’s debut album, Pretty on the Inside, and nothing prepared me for what I felt when I first heard Love scream. Pressing play, the lyrics “When I was a teenage whore” roared from my tinny little speakers. It sounded rebellious and raw – and likenothingyou’d encounter in the 90210 district.I’d never heard a woman sing like that – and knowing that Love played guitar and wrote her own music and lyrics made it even more real. I played Garbadge Man over and over – the lines about “letting the darkness up inside” felt strangely comforting. I didn’t fully understand it – but I knew I wanted more.This was not female perfection; this was messy, undone and unfinished. Love’s tights were ripped and her hair was unkempt, with dark roots given space to breathe. She made me realise that our flaws should be celebrated, not shamed and hidden.Hearing that album opened the door to more incredible female musicians – Babes in Toyland, the Breeders, Bikini Kill; women who were unafraid to turn themselves inside out and bare their chaotic souls. I fell acutely and chronically in love with all of them.View image in fullscreen‘Loud, imperfect women keep the world turning’ … Lucy Nichol today.Photograph: Courtesy of Lucy NicholOf course, I was still me – I wasn’t Love, Kat Bjelland,Kim DealorKathleen Hanna, the frontwomen in these bands. I was never going to stand on stage and scream like that, and my teenage poetry was beyond cringe. But as I started becoming bolder, I found my own means of self-expression. I stopped hiding under baggy jeans and loose T-shirts because I was scared to be noticed. Instead, I made my fashion choices stand out more than my teeth and my spots ever did, swapping drab and boring clothes for charity-shop nightdresses, white fishnet tights and Mary Janes similar to those worn by my punk rock heroes. I smothered my lips in black cherry lipstick and lightened my hair with Sun In. It made me feel invincible.I realised that Love didn’t sing because she had it all sussed; her lyrics were often about injustice, trauma and torture, not to mention misogyny and sexual violence. She sang about how women are expected to be, and about how we really are. She was proud to be a work in progress, and it made me realise that I didn’t have to have it all figured out in order to say what I felt. My confidence grew year on year as I began to form my own opinions and speak up for myself. When I was younger, I was deemed “difficult” for speaking out against the toxic culture at my workplace – but I refused to apologise, eventually walking away from a well-paid job in order to carve out a career as a freelancer. It wasn’t easy but I no longer felt like I was compromising myself.View image in fullscreen‘Everything changed’ … Lucy Nichol circa 1992.Photograph: Courtesy of Lucy NicholI’m not perfect at being imperfect, either. I still panic about how I look and how I think Ishouldlook. I saw a play recently –Mary and the Hyenas, about the 18th-century writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft, and there was a song about being a “fully formed fucked-up woman”, which struck a chord. I still listen to Hole, and all the bands I first fell in love with in the early 90s. They serve as an ongoing reminder that I needn’t apologise for being angry. I know that, sometimes, I will get it wrong.Even now, 30 years later, Love remains the antithesis of beige. I don’t agree with everything she has said, or sung about, or posted on social media, but her unapologetic spirit can never be called bland. I’m all for loud, imperfect women. They keep the world turning, the music blasting – and they help shy girls, as I once was, to find their voice.When Sally Killed Harry by Lucy Roth, the pseudonym for Lucy Nichol, is published on 27 March (Avon Books, £9.99).

But is change on the way? Plus: the history of Black US postal workersNesrine MalikWed 19 Mar 2025 08.45 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 08.47 EDTShareHello and welcome to The Long Wave. This week I look into the emerging health hazards associated with styling Black hair, and how for generations Black women have been let down by legislation, social pressure and the forever shifting demands of the beauty industry.The hidden cost of hair manipulationHair products marketed to Black women span a wide range, everything from wash to styling day involves a product that promises to make one’s hair smooth, shiny, and above allmanageable. Whether hair is worn straightened, natural, or even tucked away in braids, there is an oil, cream or gel to improve the style. Your straightened hair can be glossier; the curls in your natural hair can be more defined and last longer. And goodness, yes, your hair is braided but your edges are unruly and need to be laid. On social media, I even saw a powder that can be sprinkled on straightened hair to give it more volume. So it seems hair products now run the gamut of solid and liquid states.But evidence is mounting that the Black hair care and styling industry is wildly unregulated and poses risks to Black women’s health. Last month,analysis foundthat 80% of about 4,000 beauty products marketed at Black women “contain at least one moderately hazardous ingredient – and most contain multiple”, which is quite disturbing. Among those products were chemical products in hair-straightening formulas linked to health risks such as cancer and damage to the respiratory system, and toxic compounds added to hair conditioners. Such chemicals are linked to health risks that include cancer and damage to the respiratory system.The list of hazardous products isstaggering(pdf), as much for its length as for its range. Among the list are several hair products that I either was familiar with or have used myself, and others that are targeted at children.My eternal search for the ‘miracle’ productView image in fullscreenResearch found that 80% of about 4,000 beauty products marketed at Black women contained at least one ‘moderately hazardous ingredient’.Photograph: Kehinde Akinbo/AlamyMy first exposure to the promise of a product was when I was in my early teens, when John Frieda hair care launched what was to become an iconic line specifically for curly hair called Frizz Ease (the elders will remember). I recall loading every product in the line on my head and then, crestfallen, comparing my very Frizz Uneased hair to the bouncy smooth curls on its advertising. But immediately, the takeaway was that it was simply not the right product for me. And so began a lifetime hunt for that magic combination of serums, mousses and conditioners that will finally give me “good hair”.By the time I came of age to manage my own hair, older generations were already in the grip of hair straightening. The better off could afford chemical relaxers; the rest had to make do with iron tongs heated on the stove. I would have to go back to my grandmothers’ cohort, born in the early 20th century, to find female relatives who never manipulated their hair or used chemicals, simply wearing it in cornrows. The timespan over which Black women have been using such products is now closing in on a century. The health implications of such extended use are only just becoming apparent, with large studies being commissioned primarily during the last decade. But it still feels like the tip of something much bigger, and seemingly gentle and harmless products are now being cast in a new, perilous light.Too relaxed about the risksView image in fullscreenAdvertisements from the 90s for hair relaxers – a product recently linked with an elevated risk in uterine cancer.Photograph: Luster’s PCJOf all Black hair styling products, chemical relaxers pose the greatest health risk. The treatments alter the structure of the hair to straighten it. The effect cannot be reversed, only grown out, and so roots have to be continually retouched to maintain the style. Alandmark studyin 2022 found that women who have used hair relaxers regularly (defined as “more than four times a year”) are at an elevated risk of uterine cancer. More than100 lawsuitshave been filed in the United States, with further claims of increased risk of fibroids.The result is a drop in relaxer use, and a cultural pivoting, most clear on social media, where users chart their journeys “growing out” their relaxers and accepting their natural hair. But elsewhere, relaxer use is actually rising sharply, particularly in Africa. Across the world, the market isexpected to growby almost 20%. There is no global regulatory body, and so even as health risks are exposed there is limited legal scope to enforce changes to product formulas and bans on hazardous products on an international scale. Even within individual countries regulation is a challenge, as the long path to legislation can be interrupted by changing governments. A US Food and Drug Administration move to ban formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, from hair-straightening products hasbecome stuckunder the new US administration, with the legislation caught in the spokes of political transition. There are no signs that it will be implemented soon, if at all, in the current term.Even braids aren’t risk-freeskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The adoption of hair braiding comes with its own virtuous assumption that it was not harmful to the hair as the process involved no chemicals or heat. In fact, braiding has come to be described as “protective style”. But earlier this month, a studyfound carcinogenic ingredientsin 10 synthetic hair products that are weaved into many braiding styles, hair extensions and wigs. Lead was found in nine of the 10 samples analysed.This is a particularly grim revelation. Because I would wager that even the most highly informed consumer would not have assumed that simply running a few bundles of synthetic hair alongside your own could put you at risk of cancer. It is also a sad one. Low maintenance but highly diverse in terms of styling, braids have in many ways freed people from that odyssey of the perfect curl or frizz-free blow-dry. But even that, it appears, is not a safe harbour any more.Strong cultural pressure, poor regulationSure, there is a wild west element to the Black hair industry, where poor regulation ensures that research into hazards does not interrupt the profits that can be made in amultibillion-dollar global market. But there is another dimension – that of the cultural, social and racial pressure placed on Black women to conform to a certain aesthetic.Straight (or more accurately, straightened) long hair still dominates in western popular culture depictions of “beautiful” Black women. The result is an entire genre of poker-straight wigs and weaves adopted throughout the world, as western beauty standards infiltrate Black-majority countries. There are also bewildering mixed messages that make users feel as if all types of hair are possible and accessible. There is genuinely a case for a health warning on such ads to tell consumers, particularly younger and more impressionable girls, that models’ hair is often enhanced, extended, or a wig.Then there is textural discrimination within Black communities, where even in natural form there is a preference for hair that is what I call “layable” – that is, finessed away from sight into flat styles rather than bigger, more coiled afros. Even braid styles cleave to longer, fuller designs, such as boho braids, that in the very styles mimic hair and movement that is rarely found in natural form.Consumers fall at the intersection of complex commercial and social impulses. The marketing is relentless, as is the peer pressure. But as I was reading that study into the thousands of Black beauty products, one quote by a co-author of the study really stayed with me: “Although we have seen some improvements,” Kristin Edwards said, “it’s still really, really important for consumers to be intentional users.”Easier said than done. It involves pausing, reading ingredient lists, and even researching before you buys a product. But intentionality also involves digging deeper into what notions of “good hair” you have come to believe in.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsBeautyThe Long WaveWomen's hairnewslettersShareReuse this content"

This family of crunchy, flaky pastries in various shapes and fillings are “immensely popular” throughout the country, says award-winning authorÖzlem Warren: “Even the fussiest child,” she assures readers of her book Özlem’s Turkish Table, “will … ask for seconds.”So foundational do börek seem to be to Turkish life that a conservative female politician made headlines a few years ago for a tweetclaimingthat, if a woman didn’t know how to make them, “her family is doomed to disintegration”. In reality, as others were quick to point out, though börek aren’t difficult to prepare (and, with practice, perfect), many Turkish women, as well as men, choose to buy them instead, without obvious domestic repercussions. As journalistBelgin Akaltan puts it: “You can make börek for your own pleasure, for your own pastime. Just for fun. For your kids, for your husband, for your friends, for your guests, for your lesbian partner, but do not put it in the middle of your life as an objective, unless you are a professional cook.” They are indeed fun to make – but, I must concede, even more fun to eat.The pastryView image in fullscreenArto der Haroutunian shapes his börek into ‘samosa-like triangles’. Thumbnails by Felicity.Arto der Haroutunian,the late Aleppo-born British Armenian artist and author of several books on the region’s cuisine, says in his ATurkish Cookbookthat börek can be made with “filo, flaky and shortcrust, but some … have their own dough”. To this end, he provides a recipe for a kind of puff pastry made with ghee and a large block of butter laminated into it. It’s delicious, as is the puff pastry thatAyşenur Altan, the Istanbul-born and based creator behind the TurkishFoodTravel website, uses in her“two-ingredienteasy Turkish börek”, but despite being rich and airy, both are quite different to the crunchy, crackly börek with which I’m more familiar.English-language recipes for börek often call for filo, which is easily found in supermarkets. However, without wading too far into international waters, filo is a Greek pastry and, strictly speaking, börek is made withyufka, a similar product that tends to be rolled out slightly thicker than filo; indeed, Ghillie Basan describes it asan “unleavened Anatolian bread”in her book Classic Turkish Cookery. If you happen to have a Turkish food specialist nearby, you should be able to find yufka in the fridge there. It’s also available online, so I’d recommend trying to get hold of some if you can, not least because, mentioning no names, much of the filo that’s widely available in the UK has all the charm of baked cardboard.That said, like filo, yufka has to be treated with care. Bring it to room temperature in its packaging before use, to reduce the risk of it cracking when unfolded. Then slather it with some sort of fat to render it supple enough to roll. Warren suggests a mixture of olive oil, milk and water, Basan sunflower oil, eggs and milk. Istanbul-born Kurdish chef and writerMelek Erdaluses melted butter, andTurkish-Australian chef Somer Sivrioglumilk, egg, yoghurt and sunflower oil in his book Anatolia, co-authored with David Dale. All work pretty well, though I like the flavour of yoghurt and olive oil with the egg best, because it seems to make things a little softer and richer.View image in fullscreenÖzlem Warren’s börek will have ‘even the fussiest child asking for seconds’.If you’d like to experiment with homemade yufka, Altan hasa useful tutorial. It is easier than it sounds, if you have the patience and a large enough work surface for rolling it out. I should add that many modern Turkish cooks seem to buy it for their homemade börek, but then, unlike us, they have it fresh on their doorsteps.The fillingBörek can be filled with just about anything you fancy, be that meat, cheese, potatoes or vegetables. Der Haroutunian, for example, gives a recipe for a milk, yoghurt and cheese-filled version from the city of Adapazar, and Sivrioglu makes one with cured, spiced beefpastirma, tomatoes and green chillies. One of the most common combinations seems to be greens – often spinach – andwhite cheese: Warren explains that “Turkish white cheese, orbeyaz peynir, is traditional … [but] living abroad, it’s hard to get, so I use a combination of feta cheese and grated mozzarella, which works well.”If you have access to a shop that caters to this part of the world, or indeed the Balkans, you’ll be able to find white cheese, a huge and varied international category of which feta is just the best-known example (see also “Greek” AKA strained yoghurt – Greece is almost as good at marketing as cooking). Feel free to add grated mozzarella, too – or, even better, Erdal’s grated halloumi; der Haroutunian includes an intensely cheesy variation using grated hard cheese and dried oregano. He suggests cheddar, though I’d recommend a very mild variety or, better still, something that’s lower fat to ensure it melts rather than splits).You could just leave it at that; Altan’s easy take is just white cheese and (optional!) parsley, but, much as I love cheese, I love it even more when it’s paired with greens, and specifically spinach. If using the greens raw, as Warren suggests, baby leaves are your best bet. But because Ireallylike spinach, I favour the more robust mature sort –something that most supermarkets seem to have decided to cancel, but which can be found at greengrocers and markets. You can also use frozen, in which case, defrost and squeeze out thoroughly before use. The mature variety enables me to pack as much into the pastry as possible, keeping it crisp. Erdal swaps the spinach for courgette, grated and squeezed dry, but whatever you go for, I’d advise removing as much liquid as possible before introducing it to the pastry.View image in fullscreenAyşenur Altan’s version is an ‘easy take’ on the classic, featuring just white cheese and (optional) parsley.Sivrioglu’s recipe also involves onion, spring onion, chilli flakes, dried mint and a punchy amount of black pepper – spicy and undeniably tasty, but my testers and I prefer the fresher, if milder aromatics of Erdal’s spring onions and soft herbs (dill, parsley and mint). I also love her addition of chopped walnuts, which echo the crunch of the pastry and nicely complement the bitterness of the spinach.Der Haroutunian and Warren include egg in their fillings, but, thanks to the eggy pastry basting liquid, I think I’ve got that base covered already. As she explains inVittles, Erdal’s recipe is partly inspired by a baklava-making session with one Aunty Nuray, whoseçarşaf baklavais apparently “famous on the street and would blow any other out of the park”. She pours over a “börek liquor”, rather than a syrup, of eggs, milk and olive oil, which is an excellent idea for any excess liquid, because it gives the börek a satisfyingly squidgy base.The assemblyBörek comes in many forms, from Warren’s traybaketepsi börek, which can be cut into handy portable squares, to der Haroutunian’s samosa-like triangles and even deep-fried cigars. Which one you go for depends largely on how you’re planning to consume the end result – the last two are good for nibbles and snacks, the traybakes and spirals suggest a heartier meal – but I find I have two favourite shapes.View image in fullscreenMelek Erdal’s crinkles the pastry horizontally, rather than stacking it vertically, to create a ‘brilliant’ concertina effect.The first is thekol– which Sivrioglu explains means arm, “presumably … because each roll of pastry is bent to look like an arm coming round to hug you”. It looks impressive, and I like the way that the filling is distributed throughout, rather than sandwiched between two layers of pastry. I will warn you, however, that a neat coil is easier to achieve with puff pastry than with yufka or filo – which, if not absolutely fresh, has a tendency to crack in non-expert hands (I speak from experience). But, messy or not, the results still look good to me.The second is Erdal’s concertina, in which the pastry is crinkled horizontally, rather than being stacked vertically, just like Aunty Nuray’s baklava, which means it has “a larger surface area exposed directly to heat, resulting in a crunchier and lighter börek”. I cannot tell you how delicious it is – much as I’d like to steal her brilliant idea, I urge you to tryher recipefor yourself.The finishView image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect börek.Brushing the börek with beaten egg, as Warren recommends, and scattering over some sesame or nigella seeds gives the pastry a lovely colour – though you might prefer to finish it with Erdal’s grated halloumi.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Amazon’s firstKindlewith a colour screen had been a very long time coming and then suffered a rough landing last year, plagued with yellowing screen issues and shipping delays. But with those problems fixed, is a splash of colour the revolution the Kindle needs?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Amazon isn’t the first to use a colour e-ink screen in an e-reader, but it thinks its upgrades meaningfully improve on the tech used by others such as Boox and Kobo over the past four years by offering greater contrast and speed.Costing £270 (€300/$280) the Kindle Colorsoft towers above the £125 black and white Paperwhite on which it is based, and is more expensive than top colour e-ink rivals. Having phased out theluxury Oasis, the Colorsoft is Amazon’s top 7in model, sitting below the big 10.2inScribetablet.View image in fullscreenRegular text books look great just like a monochrome Kindle but with little colour added here and there.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianDespite the new screen the Colorsoft doesn’t break with the basic Kindle formula. It looks and feels just like the “signature edition” of the Paperwhite with a smooth black plastic back and a matt touchscreen on the front. The power button next to the USB-C port on the bottom edge is the only physical button, meaning all controls, including page turns are touchscreen-only.Black and white books look ever so slightly greyer than the Paperwhite. But otherwise the page turns are fast and text is crisp and easy to read. The front light has 24 levels of brightness with automatic control and it can change the tone of white based on the time of the day. It works very well.The colour screen makes browsing your library or the Kindle store much easier, as book covers are in colour so they are more recognisable at a glance. In-book diagrams, maps or pictures are now in colour and a lot more intelligible. And you can highlight passages in various colours to mark them out for later. The whole screen flashes on page turns when colour images cover more than about one-third of the screen, similar to some of the original black and white e-readers, which you quickly get used to.View image in fullscreenA comic page looks good on the 7in screen, but some text can be a smidgen too small to comfortably read without zooming in.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe matt screen is not as bold or vibrant as a phone or tablet, looking more like newspaper print than a glossy magazine or photo, but with the brightness turned up a bit and the vivid colour mode turned on, the Colorsoft does a decent job of presenting the art of graphic novels.Reading the text in speech bubbles can be tricky because the 7in screen is just too small when displaying a full comic page. The Kindle has apanel view modethat displays a few panels at a time but it is a bit clumsy. I prefer pinching to zoom and pan on the Colorsoft’s touchscreen, which is fast and smooth enough to quickly read sections while still getting an appreciation of the whole page.One of the big advantages of the Kindle is Amazon’s vast ebook store, which is equally large for comics and graphic novels. Amazon boughtgraphic novel specialist Comixology in 2014and has since integrated its library into the Kindle store, including existing purchases.View image in fullscreenZoomed in you can see the fine details in the artwork and easily read the text.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Kindle can be loaded up with ePub or pdf files, allowing you to buy books elsewhere, though only documents sent viaAmazon’s Send to Kindle serviceshowed up in colour on the Colorsoft.One thing that needs improving is library management on the Colorsoft, particularly if you have a lot of comics or books. The Kindle has filters for books and comic strips, but it didn’t recognise any of the graphic novels I own as comics, leaving them all bundled in a mess with regular books and hard to browse. The filters do work on the Kindle app on a tablet, however.SpecificationsScreen:7in colour e-paper (B&W 300ppi; Colour 150ppi)Dimensions:127.6 x 176.7 x 7.8mmWeight:219gWater resistance:IPX8 (2m up to 60 minutes)Connectivity:Wifi 5, BluetoothStorage:32GBBattery life:28 hours of readingView image in fullscreenA full charge of the Colorsoft with a 9W USB-C power adaptor (not included) takes about 2.5 hours. It also supports wireless charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery life is a bit more variable than other Kindles because of the colour screen, but it lasted longer in my testing than Amazon’s estimates. I saw about 45 hours of reading of regular black and white books with about 40% brightness, which reduces to about 32 hours when reading colour graphic novels with the brightness set to about 70%. Standby battery life was very good too, losing less than 1% per day with the power save option enabled.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe smooth plastic back feels nice in the hand, but isn’t any different to much cheaper Kindles.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Colorsoft will receive software and security updates forat least four yearsafter it is last available new from Amazon. The company does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. Access torepair optionsvaries by country. It contains 28% recycled materials including cobalt, magnesium and plastic.Amazon breaks down the Kindle’s environmental impact inits reportand offerstrade-in and recycling schemes.PriceThe Kindle Colorsoft costs£269.99(€299.99/$279.99).For comparison, the Kindle costs£79.99, the Kindle Paperwhite costs£124.99, the Kindle Scribe costs£379.99, the Kobo Libra Colour costs£199.99, the Boox Go Color 7 costs€279.99and theiPadcosts£329.VerdictDespite its troubled start, the Colorsoft proves that colour e-ink can be great. It feels like it will eventually be the norm for e-readers, replacing black and white for books, not just comics and graphic novels.Seeing your covers and in-book pictures in colour immediately lifts the experience without creating a big downside compared with the best monochrome models. Comics also look pretty good and are easier to read outdoors on the Kindle than a tablet. But the 7in screen just isn’t big enough to do justice to graphic novels; for that you would need a colour version of the 10.2in Scribe or an iPad with its much bolder and more saturated display.At the same time the Colorsoft doesn’t feel like a luxury Kindle in the way other high-priced models such as the Oasis managed. Despite its meaty price tag, it feels utilitarian just like a Paperwhite.That leaves the Colorsoft in a hinterland. The colour screen is great, but struggles to justify the extra cost at this size of screen suited most for regular textbooks. Buy it on a deal and you won’t be disappointed. And if you have one already that has a yellow tint at the bottom of the screen, contact Amazon’s support for a replacement.Pros:colour and black and white, in-book images and covers look great, much better for comics, speedy pinch-and-zoom, water resistant, light, good battery life, auto front light, USB-C.Cons:screen flashes on page turns for colour far more than black and white, no page-turn buttons, expensive, 7in screen too small for comics, colours not as vibrant as tablet, locked to Amazon’s ecosystem.View image in fullscreenThe colour screen lifts the Kindle experience without being as distracting as a phone or tablet.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsAmazonKindleE-readersGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

His heart thumped so hard, his chest began to hurt. His hands got colder and colder; he was unable to speak. This had become an agonizing nightly routine for the 24-year-old from India since 8 March, when immigration officials handcuffed the Columbia graduateMahmoud Khaliland took him into detention in Louisiana.“What scares me the most is that I would be fast asleep at home and I would hear a bang on my door and I’d be taken away in the middle of the night by Ice and nobody will ever know what happened to me,” said the student, who attended multiple protests to support Palestine around New York City. “It feels as if people are getting targeted for just speaking up for their political views last year.”Khalil was an organizerat Columbia’sGaza Solidarity Encampment, part of a diverse community that ate, danced, prayed and protested together, demanding the university divest from corporations linked to Israel as violence in Gaza escalated.The federal immigration officers who arrested Khalil gained entry into the Columbia-owned building where he lived and told him his green card, which grants him permanent residence in the US, had been revoked. The Department of Homeland Securityaccusedhim of leading “activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization” and is attempting to deport him, but has not alleged he committed any crimes. His lawyers are challenging his detention and potential deportation, and said agents did not provide an arrest warrant. Khalil’s arrest came afterDonald Trumpvowed todeport student visa holderswho participated in pro-Palestinian protests, a move legal experts have called a flagrantviolation of free speech.Now, Columbia students who are not US citizens, some who have vocally supported Palestinian rights, told the Guardian they feel they must be careful who they speak to and censor what they say. They fear being questioned by Ice agents, having their visas revoked or being arrested and detained. Some feel like they are being watched while walking around Morningside Heights and on campus, while others are reluctant to visit family or friends overseas in case they are not permitted back in the country.View image in fullscreenThien Miru under the Alma Mater statue at Columbia University on 15 March 2025.Photograph: Jazzmin Jiwa“When I leave my apartment, when I go out, I’m just so much more aware and cautious of who’s around me,” said Seher Ahmed, a psychology master’s student from Pakistan. “I went for a run this morning, and I’ve never felt this way before, but I felt like everyone was, like, looking at me.”Another student who arrived at Columbia in August last year to study journalism had been inspired by student reporters’ coverage of campus protests. She photographed a vigil where journalism school students recited names of the more than 100 Palestinian and Lebanese journalists killed in Gaza. For a reporting class, the 21-year-old wrote about an anti-Trump rally on election night that called for an end to the Israel-Gaza war. She posted her work and discussed related issues on Instagram and X.But just days away from applying for a year-long work visa that would follow her expected graduation this May, she stopped posting her opinions and made her accounts private. She is reconsidering attending a friend’s wedding overseas in case she is not allowed back in the country. “I feel like I’m being paranoid, but I’m really scared,” she said.Ahmed, who attended women’s rights marches in Pakistan from the age of 15 with her mother, began an art piece after Khalil’s arrest: a meditation on the Urdu translation of the word freedom, with blue ink pen swept across white canvas. “I come from a Muslim country, so did he. I believe in the same things he does, freedom and basic human rights and just standing up for a place that needs our voice right now,” said Ahmed. Her paralyzing fear is rooted in the idea that the US government will misconstrue those values as “pro-Hamas” and revoke her student visa.“We’re not terrorists, or, like, supporting terrorists. We’re trying to prevent a genocide from happening,” said Ahmed.Imam, a graduate student, went to the encampment – once with his professor – to join protests, listen to speakers including journalist Motaz Azaiza and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attend Friday prayers. The 30-year-old has been attending classes over Zoom or skipping them altogether: he feels he “could be next” on Ice’s list, without having any knowledge of what he has done wrong. Two months away from graduation, he is conflicted about attending more protests, which have continued on and off campus in support of Khalil and Palestine. “I want to do something, I feel so hopeless,” he said. “But also everything I do is going to cost me a bigger risk.”When I leave my apartment, when I go out, I’m just so much more aware and cautious of who’s around meSeher Ahmed, a psychology master’s student from PakistanOn 11 March, three days after Ice arrested Khalil,Ranjani Srinivasan, a Columbia PhD student from India who participated in campus protests, “self-deported” after her student visa had been revoked, DHS said. On 13 March, DHS presented warrants andsearched two students’ dorm roomson campus. In Newark, immigration agents arrested Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, after saying her student visa had expired.That federal agents can target a student or recent graduate without charge is a chilling reminder of the oppressive environments that some international students left behind. For a 22-year-old master’s student from Russia who lives in university housing, Khalil’s arrest brought back memories of police knocking on doors to draft male citizens at the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. She said the spirit of the university had changed; now it feels like “the police state is coming after you”.“Your home should be your safe space. But ever since the arrest, anytime I hear footsteps at night in the Columbia housing – the walls are super thin so you hear everything – I’m always like, ‘Who is that? Who is that?’” she said.This week, Yale Law School professorswarnedinternational students about an impending Trump travel ban, saying they should avoid leaving the US or return immediately to the US if abroad. Brown issued a similar warning to its international students.“People look at the global north thinking they have things so much better. There are better laws to protect your rights,” said Thien Miru, a post-graduate student from Indonesia. Now there is overwhelming concern that if a green card holder can be detained, a student visa holder has little protection.TheTrump administrationis intent on bringing Columbia to heel: last week it sent aletterto the university demanding measures such as a mask ban, winding down the Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies department and empowering campus law enforcement in exchange for any of the $400m federal funding it had clawed back after “inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students”, according to the administration.View image in fullscreenMahmoud Khalil on the Columbia University campus in New York on 29 April 2024.Photograph: Ted Shaffrey/APIn several emails to students and faculty, Columbia’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, emphasized the need to “stand together”. “Our university is defined by the principles of academic freedom, open inquiry, and respect for all,” she wrote. One email linked to a public safety webpage outlining protocols for potential Ice campus visits. But some students interpreted this to mean they were responsible for dealing with immigration officials alone. Columbia did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.While studying for her two-year degree in social work, Miru, 35, learned about advocating for those who need help. She said the university needs to “go the extra mile” by mediating with those in power to protect its students’ rights.“I’ve heard a lot of people at Columbia say that this is our community, so what are you going to do if your community is experiencing something like this?” said Miru. “I am expecting something more than just sending us super-long emails. Prove to us that we are part of your community.”On 14 March, Khalil’s lawyersreleased a videoof him being taken away from his wife,Noor Abdalla, a US citizen who is eight months pregnant, by plainclothes immigration officers. “As a woman I feel it’s so hard for her to think about raising your child without support from your partner,” said Miru, a mother of two girls. “If they deport her husband, family separation is not a good idea, so I’ve been thinking a lot about this little family. I’m speechless.”Miru made the difficult decision to leave her daughters with her parents in Indonesia to get her degree, after her father gave her books about the US and talked for years about the high quality of education while she was growing up. “I also got accepted to some universities in Australia, but since Columbia also accepted me, I thought let’s aim for the highest, let’s aim for the stars,” said Miru. Her hope was to bring her daughters to the US so they could also study there. Now, she’s questioning whether she should give up on her aspirations and move back home.Some names have been withheld for sources’ safety.Jazzmin Jiwa is an international journalist and documentary maker currently based in New York City.

The only trees are more than one thousand kilometres away,” he said. “I realize at that moment: I don’t know what to do.”But the combat veteran was traveling with the Canadian Rangers, a group of reservists largely drawn from Indigenous communities who serve as scouts and guides for Canada’s military in the north.During that trip in 2023, they explained to Davison how to find shelter and food in a landscape that, to the unacquainted eye, looks both homogenous and hostile.View image in fullscreenThe hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk, along the Arctic coastline.View image in fullscreenCanadian ranger Emmanuel Adam (top right, in orange hood) watches the live feed from an underwater rover, which the military is testing under harsh Arctic conditions.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/Guardian“When they talk, I listen,” he said. “And when they say stop, I stop.”In recent years, Canada has realized the deep vulnerabilities of a land mass spanning nearly 4m sq km (1.5m sq miles) that makes up nearly half the country. With renewed threats to its territorial claims coming both from foes and allies, the country’s government has pledged to devote far more resources to holding the north.But those efforts are meaningless without the help of the region’s inhabitants – long seen as pawns in a greater geopolitical game, and yet whose knowledge of the lands and waters is irreplaceable.On Tuesday,Mark Carneymade his first major domestic visit as prime minister to the far-north city of Iqaluit in a bid to “reaffirm” Canada’s Arctic security and sovereignty, adding the region was a “strategic priority” for his government.“Canada is, and will forever be, an Arctic nation,” he said, flanked by Canada’s top soldier, the country’s defence minister and the Nunavut premier.Carney, the first prime minister born in one of Canada’s northern territories, announced the purchase of an Australian early warning radar system and millions of dollars’ investment to improve housing and upgrade power plants in northern communities.Canadian military flies the flag in frozen north as struggle for the Arctic heats upRead moreCarney’s visit follows the completion of Operation Nanook,an Arctic military exerciseinvolving nearly 650 personnel. The operation, conducted alongside allies from the US, the UK, Belgium, Sweden and Finland, reflects an aim to “project force” in the Arctic, but also to sustain that force amid frozen conditions.At every military camp scattered throughout the north, members of the Canadian Rangers are easy to spot: they sport a bright red hooded sweatshirt peeking out from underneath a parka and camouflage pants.Their jobs include predator control, guiding to remote sites and finding paths through treacherous ice and snow. Between duties, they shelter in tents, snacking on salted fish harvested earlier in the summer. If temperatures enter a sustained deep freeze, they pull out the beluga oil, dipping pieces of caribou meat for a combination that warms one up so much “that will make your ears burn”, says ranger Emmanuel Adam.Whitney Lackenbauer, a professor at Trent University and an honorary lt col in the Canadian Rangers, said the 5,000-strong force, whose members come from 200 northern communities and speak 26 languages and dialects is unlike any other unit around the world.View image in fullscreenCanadian ranger Ryan Lennie prepares to take newly arrived soldiers out onto the land.

It has a respect for Indigenous ways of knowing, being and seeing, rather than trying to convert people into a different model of service, like conventional soldiers,” he said. “Because the Rangers have an intimate tie to the lands, they are able to navigate effectively without having to rely on GPS and anything that needs batteries. To have people who use the direction of the snow drifts, the prevailing wind conditions and the night sky to navigate – these are things I’ve experienced and they’re both invaluable.”The Rangers’ status within the armed forces stands in contrast with the region’s dark history.In the 1950s, the federal police rounded up transient Inuit communities under the false promise of new hunting grounds and prosperous lands, forcibly moving them to newly established settlements, so that Canada could claim the territory amid threats from the Soviet Union and the United States.The Inuit, intimately familiar with their old hunting areas after a lifetime of learning to read the nuances of the land, were thrown by their new locations. The environments, once capable of supporting small roving groups, could not supply larger permanent settlements with enough fresh game.“As Inuit, we have endured a great deal in the name of Canadian sovereignty,” Nunavut premier PJ Akeeagok said during Carney’s visit to Iqaluit. “Canada’s national identity as an Arctic nation was built on the backs of our communities.”In past decades, many of those who served as Canadian Rangers were sent to residential schools,where they endured widespread abuse and attempts to crush their culture.“I know the after-effects of what that did to our communities and the three or four generations that come after it. We’re still dealing with it,” said Jackie Jacobson, a prominent Canadian Ranger and former politician. Jacobsen spent three years at a residential school in Inuvik.Yet Jacobson has committed decades of his life to the Rangers, mentoring countless youngsters to become key sentinels for Canada’s military.View image in fullscreenChildren play on a snowbank in Inuvik. The Canadian Ranger program takes youth out onto the land, teaching them survival skills and cultural heritage.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/Guardian“When the green army comes up there, we’re going to be the ones that guide them. We know our land, we know areas with overflow, pressure ridges and thin ice. The local knowledge of a ranger is priceless,” he said.As Canada grapples with its past and the search for justice , a broader criticism of the current relationship betweenIndigenous peoplesand the federal government often rests on symbolic platitudes. Land acknowledgments, a fixture of cultural events, have at times been rendered meaningless by a tangled attempt to reconcile broken treaties and unceded territory with sustained occupation.But in the north, arrogance and ignorance are deadly, says Capt Alex Boom of the Canadian army, and the only way to survive is with a trusting relationship between both parties.“The Rangers you’ll meet don’t go to the armories and play soldier once a week. They live it constantly,” Boom tells a crop of 150 newly arrived reservists before they head out onto the land. Most have never been to the Arctic. “They hunt, they fish, they survive. They pull bodies out of water. They recover downed aircraft. This is their land.,”Boom says.Boom cautions the troops that the Rangers’ job is to keep them alive and safe – not to be called on for menial tasks. “These are sage men and women born of, and shaped by, the north. They thrive up here,” he said. “They’re quiet but they’re watching all the time. They hear everything. They’re seeing you constantly. They’re very happy to share their knowledge, once you gain their respect.”For Rangers, too, Operation Nanook gives some a chance to experience parts of the country that are foreign to them: the Arctic encompasses a vast and diverse geography. During the exercise, Angela Okalik, who flew to Inuvik from the hamlet of Whale Cove, had to grapple with a new and unfamiliar obstacle on the landscape: trees.“I love it here, learning from others. And snowmobiling through forests is weird, but really fun,” she said.Working with Jim Davison, who now serves as liaison between the Rangers and the rigid structure of the military, Okalik and two others from Whale Cove have been given a task closer to their comfort zone: standing guard while military scientists test cold-weather gear on a frozen lake well above the tree line, and helping build a runway for one of the world’s largest transport plane.“This,” she says, surveying the vast white landscape. “This, I know.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndigenous peoplesMark CarneyAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She liked to speak to plants and whispered to smoke, puzzling the elders. No one had taught her that – it came naturally.When she reached adulthood, her grandmother told her that of all her grandchildren, Adana had inherited a place in the lineage of healers and shamans of the Kambeba group, also known as Omágua, “the people of the water”, which has communities in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon.“She saw strong signs in me. These signs have always led me to believe I didn’t choose medicine, I was chosen by it,” says Adana.View image in fullscreenAdana as a child. At a young age she says she ‘liked to speak to plants and smoke’.Photograph: Courtesy of Adana KambebaHer father was not impressed. Being a doctor was incompatible with their reality in an impoverished rural settlement, with houses on stilts by a stream on the outskirts of Manaus, the capital ofBrazil’s Amazonas state.“He told me medicine was for those who have money, not humble people like us,” she recalls. “But I had some kind of decisive faith when I was a girl, a certainty of myself. When people told me something wouldn’t work out, I did it anyway.”Her determination led her to pursue an exceptional life mission: to become both a medical doctor and a shaman, integrating these very separate systems of knowledge and mediating disputes that often arise in Indigenous healthcare.Danielle Soprano Pereira, as she was baptised in Portuguese, is part of a generation of Indigenous people who have gradually had more access to universities thanks to affirmative action policies in Brazil.In 2012, a place at university took her 4,000km (2,500 miles) from home and made her a resident in a city of 2.3 million – Belo Horizonte. At the prestigiousFederal University of Minas Gerais(UFMG), she was no longer seen as gifted but as “different” – the first Indigenous person from the Amazon to gain a coveted place at the medical school, mainly the preserve of Brazil’s elite.View image in fullscreenAdana says other medical students were bothered by her presence. ‘I learned first-hand that prejudice can be covert. It can come with a smile.’Photograph: Marizilda Cruppe/The Guardian“I learned first-hand that prejudice can be covert. It can come with a smile,” says Adana.Students would ask how she got into university. Or would react with surprise when she excelled in an oral exam. A handful of colleagues welcomed her. “But most people felt bothered by my presence. It was very uncomfortable, at times cruel,” she says.The family listened to me because I am Indigenous. The doctors listened to me because I am a doctor. What matters is we saved a life.Adana Omágua KambebaAdana also suffered from clashing notions of time and productivity. The standard duration of the medical course was six years, but she decided to respect her personal rhythm. “The medical course leaves no time for sleep, leisure or to live one’s own humanity. This goes against what we learn with nature, which is to respect our limits,” she says.In 2017, she almost had a breakdown. At home, alone, she questioned aloud how she would become a doctor and a shaman. She heard a voice and spoke to it. She said she would only keep going if certain situations arose.The next day in the hospital, Adana says all the conditions she had set happened, one after the other. She cried in the hallway. “Something inside me said, ‘This is your mission. Never doubt it.’”View image in fullscreenAdana told a conference that ‘nature is seen as if it were here to serve us. It is not.’Photograph: Paulo Roberto Vicente/Courtesy of Adana KambebaCovid-19 interrupted Adana’s studies and she joined emergency workers in Belo Horizonte and Manaus, amid acritical shortage of staff and supplies.She finally graduated in March 2022. Prof Humberto José Alves, the first black director ofUFMG’s Faculty of Medicine, handed her the diploma in a room hung with portraits of the faculty’s former directors, all white men.“It was a historic moment. Those directors would never have imagined a black man in their seat, nor an Indigenous woman graduating there,” she says.View image in fullscreenAdana, centre, with Prof Humberto José Alves on her right, on receiving her graduation diploma at the Federal University of Minas Gerais.Photograph: HandoutUntil recently, Adana worked as a doctor at a maternity hospital and a dengue emergency centre in Belo Horizonte. She has left both roles. In April, she will embark on a journey along the Amazon River, visiting more than 30Kambeba communities.She intends to provide medical care to those in need and run workshops on healthcare issues such as suicide prevention and child sexual abuse.At the same time, Adana will undergo shamanic trials to become apajé, a spiritual leader and healer in Indigenous cultures. She will perform rituals and prayers in front of the Kambeba people and shamans using ayahuasca, a plant-based infusion with hallucinogenic properties traditionally used to connect to the spiritual world and explore the depths of one’s soul.“Experiencing revelations under the influence of ayahuasca is profoundly powerful, and there I will prove if I am worthy or not,” says Adana.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On stage, wearing a long blue skirt, blue bead ornaments and waist-length feather earrings, Adana made a presentation comparing traditional Indigenous medicines with “official scientific medicine”.View image in fullscreenAdana starred in the film Xingu, which was released in 2012.Photograph: HandoutAdana denounced the colonialism inherent in a recent wave of scientific and pharmaceutical interest in traditional psychedelics such as ayahuasca. She also demanded Indigenous groups be heard over the exploitation of their ancestral knowledge.“Indigenous people are not invited to the conversation, and nature is seen as if it were here to serve us. It is not,” she told the audience.Adana is also a musician (she plays the violin) and actor who starred in the Brazilian filmXingu. So she felt comfortable finishing her presentation by singing ana cappellaode to Mother Nature while shaking rattles made of seeds. The crowd burst into applause.In 1999, Brazil created within its public healthcare system a specific subsystem for Indigenous people, devising an intercultural approach to respect their beliefs and employ Indigenous people as healthcare workers.According to the doctor and anthropologist Luiza Garnelo, however, these ideals are not easily translated into everyday practice, as she has found during her research with Amazonian communities around the Rio Negro.“Most Indigenous professionals in the subsystem are community healthcare agents and nurse technicians, lower in the pyramid when compared to doctors. And being Indigenous doesn’t necessarily give them the right to create new ways of providing care,” says Garnelo, a researcher with theOswaldo Cruz Foundation.For a doctor striving to become apajé, Garnelo says it is difficult to reconcile the principles of scientific biomedicine – strictly based on symptoms, examinations, diagnostics and medications – with Indigenous medicinal practices, in which body, mind, soul and context are seen in confluence.This is often an issue when Indigenous people seek treatment, as healthcare providers may show disregard for Indigenous beliefs. In turn, Indigenous people at times avoid hospitals or reject medical intervention, preferring to trust their shamans and healers.View image in fullscreenAdana is consulting two shamans on her path towards becoming a spiritual leader.Photograph: Marizilda Cruppe/The GuardianAdana recalls a case around the Rio Negro where a Tukano Indigenous man was bitten by a snake and doctors said his leg would have to be amputated. His family abandoned the hospital and treated the wound with sap from a vine. His leg was saved.Recently, she mediated a standoff in the intensive care unit of the Sofia Feldman hospital in Belo Horizonte. An Indigenous child had presumed sepsis and needed urgent medical intervention but his father, a shaman, opposed the doctors’ recommendation. Adana stepped in and promised to say an Indigenous prayer in the intensive care unit. The family allowed the treatment.“The family listened to me because I am Indigenous preparing to bepajé. The doctors listened to me because I am a doctor,” she says. The father later said that Adana’s prayer had saved the child. “The doctors said it was the antibiotic,” she laughs. “What matters is that we managed to save a life.”Adana continues to consult the two shamans mentoring her on the pathway towards becoming a spiritual leader. If she succeeds in becoming apajé, she plans to invite both her worlds to the festivities – celebrating with doctors and shamans.Explore more on these topicsSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanBrazilIndigenous peoplesMedicineAmericasGlobal healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not even a decision, really. There is only one choice for me: vaccinate my kids.”Parents including Shallenberger are in the odd position of defending their decision to vaccinate – even though there is no evidence of a link between vaccines and autism. The myth, based on a 1998 study that waslater retracteddue to ethical concerns andfalsified data, has been regaining traction since Covid-19 sparked debates over vaccine safety.Robert F Kennedy Jr, who was recently appointed as the US health and human services secretary, has also publiclysuggestedthat autism may be linked to vaccination.Lynne Peskoe-Yang, a 34-year-old Massachusetts-based journalist with autism, says the myth’s persistence illustrates something disturbing about how the world sees autistic people – that because they are different, they must be contaminated somehow.“It fits really well into other kinds of beliefs about health that really boil down to morals more than science,” Peskoe-Yang said.Autism spectrum disorder is definedby persistent social difficulties as well as repetitive behaviors and interests, sometimes shaped by heightened sensitivity to stimuli like noises, textures and touch, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.It’s not even a decision, really. There is only one choice for me: vaccinate my kidsMatthew Shallenberger, father to an autistic sonThe “spectrum” refers to the variety of ways people fit this definition. Many autistic people make it to adulthood without a diagnosis – despite the challenges that come even with mild cases, they are able to live independently. Others require lifetime support. While autism as a disability is defined by impairments, it is also associated with strengths, includingdedication, focus and creativity in the workplace.Even in more challenging cases, parents of autistic children find it repugnant that other parents are risking their own children’s serious illness or death, ostensibly to avoid the condition.Kate Abarca, a retired occupational therapist in South Carolina, says that learning to understand her son’s autism was immensely rewarding. Caring for him made her a better therapist, and advocating for him helped her overcome her shyness. Now 35, her son Benjamin Beals is beloved in his community. He lives in a semi-independent facility and is known for his karaoke performances.Measles outbreak spreads as 250 cases reported across multiple statesRead moreAbarca realized early that her son’s difficulties stemmed from her own inability to understand his needs. When he was an infant, she says he screamed constantly and would kick and bite her when she was trying to care for him.“ I came to recognize his actions as self-defense against me providing caregiving that he perceived as an assault,” she said.Jonathan Knapp, 71, a podcaster in Indiana known by the stage name Johnny Profane, agrees that some of the difficulties associated with autism are more manageable if you understand their cause.“Any child will start screaming in a supermarket given the right stimuli,” he said. Knapp, along with others contacted for this story, suspects that anti-vaxxers see autism as a combination of exaggerated stereotypes stemming from misunderstood behaviors.Knapp was diagnosed with autism at 63. While the diagnosis is still stigmatized, Knapp says that understanding why he felt different his whole life has been a blessing.People need to vaccinate. This is life or death. People are dying. Babies are dying!Emir Lopez of MassachusettsEmir Lopez, a 32-year-old working in IT in Massachusetts, also sees his autism diagnosis as a gift. Lopez said when he was diagnosed as a child, his parents hid it. He connected the dots himself studying psychology in college. When his mother confirmed he had autism, Lopez realized there actually was “nothing wrong” with him. He was “normal” – just autistic.Hearing parents fret over vaccines causing autism “just makes me so angry”, says Lopez, adding: “Autistic people, we’re very logical, so that blows my mind even more.” Lopez remembers a particularly upsetting instance when his father’s former girlfriend told him he might not have autism had he not been vaccinated.Eventually, Lopez became so fed up with the stigma he decided to disclose his autism on social media with the joke “vaccines are just computer updates for me”.RFK Jr sparks alarm after backing vitamins to treat measles amid outbreakRead moreA 37-year-old autistic sound engineer said he finds misinformation so disturbing he loses sleep over it, adding that anti-vaxxers are not “entitled” to “their own set of facts”. He echoed Lopez’s sentiment that this cognitive dissonance can be especially distressing for autistic people: “It saps your energy away. You lose your appetite and your body temperature changes. It’s a drastically physical thing.”.Knapp, too, said he’s lost days replaying social media conversations with anti-vaxxers over and over in his head.While Lopez is troubled by misunderstandings over autism, he says he’s most concerned over declining vaccination rates.“People need to vaccinate.

One minute, I was in an immigration office talking to an officer about my work visa, which had been approved months before and allowed me, a Canadian, to work in the US. The next, I was told to put my hands against the wall, and patted down like a criminal before beingsent to an Ice detention centerwithout the chance to talk to a lawyer.I grew up in Whitehorse, Yukon, a small town in the northernmost part ofCanada. I always knew I wanted to do something bigger with my life. I left home early and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where I built a career spanning multiple industries – acting in film and television, owning bars and restaurants, flipping condos and managing Airbnbs.In my 30s, I found my true passion working in the health and wellness industry. I was given the opportunity to help launch an American brand of health tonics called Holy! Water – a job that would involve moving to the US.I was granted my trade Nafta work visa, which allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the US in specific professional occupations, on my second attempt. It goes without saying, then, that I have no criminal record. I also love the US and consider myself to be a kind, hard-working person.I started working in California and travelled back and forth between Canada and the US multiple times without any complications – until one day, upon returning to the US, a border officer questioned me about my initial visa denial and subsequent visa approval. He asked why I had gone to the San Diego border the second time to apply. I explained that that was where my lawyer’s offices were, and that he had wanted to accompany me to ensure there were no issues.After a long interrogation, the officer told me it seemed “shady” and that my visa hadn’t been properly processed. He claimed I also couldn’t work for a company in the US that made use of hemp – one of the beverage ingredients. He revoked my visa, and told me I could still work for the company from Canada, but if I wanted to return to the US, I would need to reapply.I was devastated; I had just started building a life in California. I stayed in Canada for the next few months, and was eventually offered a similar position with a different health and wellness brand.I restarted the visa process and returned to the same immigration office at the San Diego border, since they had processed my visa before and I was familiar with it. Hours passed, with many confused opinions about my case. The officer I spoke to was kind but told me that, due to my previous issues, I needed to apply for my visa through the consulate. I told her I hadn’t been aware I needed to apply that way, but had no problem doing it.Then she said something strange: “You didn’t do anything wrong. You are not in trouble, you are not a criminal.”I remember thinking:Why would she say that? Of course I’m not a criminal!She then told me they had to send me back to Canada. That didn’t concern me; I assumed I would simply book a flight home. But as I sat searching for flights, a man approached me.“Come with me,” he said.There was no explanation, no warning. He led me to a room, took my belongings from my hands and ordered me to put my hands against the wall. A woman immediately began patting me down. The commands came rapid-fire, one after another, too fast to process.They took my shoes and pulled out my shoelaces.“What are you doing? What is happening?” I asked.“You are being detained.”“I don’t understand. What does that mean? For how long?”“I don’t know.”That would be the response to nearly every question I would ask over the next two weeks: “I don’t know.”They brought me downstairs for a series of interviews and medical questions, searched my bags and told me I had to get rid of half my belongings because I couldn’t take everything with me.“Take everything with me where?” I asked.A woman asked me for the name of someone they could contact on my behalf. In moments like this, you realize you don’t actually know anyone’s phone number anymore. By some miracle, I had recently memorized my best friend Britt’s number because I had been putting my grocery points on her account.I gave them her phone number.They handed me a mat and a folded-up sheet of aluminum foil.“What is this?”“Your blanket.”“I don’t understand.”I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.View image in fullscreenA border patrol agent watches as girls from Central America sleep under thermal blankets at a detention facility in McAllen, Texas, on 8 September 2014.Photograph: John Moore/Getty ImagesFor two days, we remained in that cell, only leaving briefly for food. The lights never turned off, we never knew what time it was and no one answered our questions. No one in the cell spoke English, so I either tried to sleep or meditate to keep from having a breakdown. I didn’t trust the food, so I fasted, assuming I wouldn’t be there long.On the third day, I was finally allowed to make a phone call. I called Britt and told her that I didn’t understand what was happening, that no one would tell me when I was going home, and that she was my only contact.They gave me a stack of paperwork to sign and told me I was being given a five-year ban unless I applied for re-entry through the consulate. The officer also said it didn’t matter whether I signed the papers or not; it was happening regardless.I was so delirious that I just signed. I told them I would pay for my flight home and asked when I could leave.No answer.Then they moved me to another cell – this time with no mat or blanket. I sat on the freezing cement floor for hours. That’s when I realized they were processing me into real jail: the Otay Mesa Detention Center.View image in fullscreenThe Otay Mesa Detention Center in Otay Mesa, California, on 9 May 2020.Photograph: Sandy Huffaker/AFP/Getty ImagesI was told to shower, given a jail uniform, fingerprinted and interviewed. I begged for information.“How long will I be here?”“I don’t know your case,” the man said. “Could be days. Could be weeks. But I’m telling you right now – you need to mentally prepare yourself for months.”Months.I felt like I was going to throw up.I was taken to the nurse’s office for a medical check. She asked what had happened to me. She had never seen a Canadian there before. When I told her my story, she grabbed my hand and said: “Do you believe in God?”I told her I had only recently found God, but that I now believed in God more than anything.“I believe God brought you here for a reason,” she said. “I know it feels like your life is in a million pieces, but you will be OK. Through this, I think you are going to find a way to help others.”At the time, I didn’t know what that meant. She asked if she could pray for me. I held her hands and wept.I felt like I had been sent an angel.I was then placed in a real jail unit: two levels of cells surrounding a common area, just like in the movies. I was put in a tiny cell alone with a bunk bed and a toilet.The best part: there were blankets. After three days without one, I wrapped myself in mine and finally felt some comfort.For the first day, I didn’t leave my cell. I continued fasting, terrified that the food might make me sick. The only available water came from the tap attached to the toilet in our cells or a sink in the common area, neither of which felt safe to drink.Eventually, I forced myself to step out, meet the guards and learn the rules. One of them told me: “No fighting.”“I’m a lover, not a fighter,” I joked. He laughed.I asked if there had ever been a fight here.“In this unit? No,” he said. “No one in this unit has a criminal record.”That’s when I started meeting the other women.That’s when I started hearing their stories.View image in fullscreenWomen sit on their beds in a privately run 1,000-bed detention center on 28 February 2006 in Otay Mesa, California.Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty ImagesAnd that’s when I made a decision: I would never allow myself to feel sorry for my situation again. No matter how hard this was, I had to be grateful. Because every woman I met was in an even more difficult position than mine.There were around 140 of us in our unit. Many women had lived and worked in the US legally for years but had overstayed their visas – often after reapplying and being denied. They had all been detained without warning.If someone is a criminal, I agree they should be taken off the streets. But not one of these women had a criminal record. These women acknowledged that they shouldn’t have overstayed and took responsibility for their actions. But their frustration wasn’t about being held accountable; it was about the endless, bureaucratic limbo they had been trapped in.The real issue was how long it took to get out of the system, with no clear answers, no timeline and no way to move forward. Once deported, many have no choice but to abandon everything they own because the cost of shipping their belongings back is too high.I met a woman who had been on a road trip with her husband. She said they had 10-year work visas. While driving near the San Diego border, they mistakenly got into a lane leading to Mexico. They stopped and told the agent they didn’t have their passports on them, expecting to be redirected. Instead, they were detained. They are both pastors.I met a family of three who had been living in the US for 11 years with work authorizations. They paid taxes and were waiting for their green cards. Every year, the mother had to undergo a background check, but this time, she was told to bring her whole family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody and told their status would now be processed from within the detention center.Another woman from Canada had been living in the US with her husband who was detained after a traffic stop. She admitted she had overstayed her visa and accepted that she would be deported. But she had been stuck in the system for almost six weeks because she hadn’t had her passport. Who runs casual errands with their passport?One woman had a 10-year visa. When it expired, she moved back to her home country, Venezuela. She admitted she had overstayed by one month before leaving. Later, she returned for a vacation and entered the US without issue. But when she took a domestic flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she was picked up by Ice and detained. She couldn’t be deported because Venezuela wasn’t accepting deportees. She didn’t know when she was getting out.There was a girl from India who had overstayed her student visa for three days before heading back home. She then came back to the US on a new, valid visa to finish her master’s degree and was handed over to Ice due to the three days she had overstayed on her previous visa.There were women who had been picked up off the street, from outside their workplaces, from their homes. All of these women told me that they had been detained for time spans ranging from a few weeks to 10 months. One woman’s daughter was outside the detention center protesting for her release.That night, the pastor invited me to a service she was holding. A girl who spoke English translated for me as the women took turns sharing their prayers – prayers for their sick parents, for the children they hadn’t seen in weeks, for the loved ones they had been torn away from.Then, unexpectedly, they asked if they could pray for me. I was new here, and they wanted to welcome me. They formed a circle around me, took my hands and prayed. I had never felt so much love, energy and compassion from a group of strangers in my life. Everyone was crying.At 3am the next day, I was woken up in my cell.“Pack your bag. You’re leaving.”I jolted upright. “I get to go home?”The officer shrugged. “I don’t know where you’re going.”Of course. No one ever knew anything.I grabbed my things and went downstairs, where 10 other women stood in silence, tears streaming down their faces. But these weren’t happy tears. That was the moment I learned the term “transferred”.For many of these women, detention centers had become a twisted version of home. They had formed bonds, established routines and found slivers of comfort in the friendships they had built. Now, without warning, they were being torn apart and sent somewhere new. Watching them say goodbye, clinging to each other, was gut-wrenching.I had no idea what was waiting for me next. In hindsight, that was probably for the best.Our next stop was Arizona, the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24 hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next five hours, packed together – women in the front, men in the back. We were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet, forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle.When we arrived at our next destination, we were forced to go through the entire intake process all over again, with medical exams, fingerprinting – and pregnancy tests; they lined us up in a filthy cell, squatting over a communal toilet, holding Dixie cups of urine while the nurse dropped pregnancy tests in each of our cups. It was disgusting.We sat in freezing-cold jail cells for hours, waiting for everyone to be processed. Across the room, one of the women suddenly spotted her husband. They had both been detained and were now seeing each other for the first time in weeks.The look on her face – pure love, relief and longing – was something I’ll never forget.We were beyond exhausted. I felt like I was hallucinating.The guard tossed us each a blanket: “Find a bed.”There were no pillows. The room was ice cold, and one blanket wasn’t enough. Around me, women lay curled into themselves, heads covered, looking like a room full of corpses. This place made the last jail feel like the Four Seasons.I kept telling myself:Do not let this break you.Thirty of us shared one room. We were given one Styrofoam cup for water and one plastic spoon that we had to reuse for every meal. I eventually had to start trying to eat and, sure enough, I got sick. None of the uniforms fit, and everyone had men’s shoes on. The towels they gave us to shower were hand towels. They wouldn’t give us more blankets. The fluorescent lights shined on us 24/7.Everything felt like it was meant to break you. Nothing was explained to us. I wasn’t given a phone call. We were locked in a room, no daylight, with no idea when we would get out.I tried to stay calm as every fiber of my being raged towards panic mode. I didn’t know how I would tell Britt where I was. Then, as if sent from God, one of the women showed me a tablet attached to the wall where I could send emails. I only remembered my CEO’s email from memory. I typed out a message, praying he would see it.He responded.Through him, I was able to connect with Britt. She told me that they were working around the clock trying to get me out. But no one had any answers; the system made it next to impossible. I told her about the conditions in this new place, and that was when we decided to go to the media.She started working with a reporter and asked whether I would be able to call her so she could loop him in. The international phone account that Britt had previously tried to set up for me wasn’t working, so one of the other women offered to let me use her phone account to make the call.We were all in this together.With nothing to do in my cell but talk, I made new friends – women who had risked everything for the chance at a better life for themselves and their families.Through them, I learned the harsh reality of seeking asylum. Showing me their physical scars, they explained how they had paid smugglers anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 to reach the US border, enduring brutal jungles and horrendous conditions.One woman had been offered asylum in Mexico within two weeks but had been encouraged to keep going to the US. Now, she was stuck, living in a nightmare, separated from her young children for months. She sobbed, telling me how she felt like the worst mother in the world.Many of these women were highly educated and spoke multiple languages. Yet, they had been advised to pretend they didn’t speak English because it would supposedly increase their chances of asylum.Some believed they were being used as examples, as warnings to others not to try to come.Women were starting to panic in this new facility, and knowing I was most likely the first person to get out, they wrote letters and messages for me to send to their families.Some of the letters given to Jasmine Mooney from the women she met during her time in Ice detention facilities.Photograph: Jasmine MooneyIt felt like we had all been kidnapped, thrown into some sort of sick psychological experiment meant to strip us of every ounce of strength and dignity.We were from different countries, spoke different languages and practiced different religions. Yet, in this place, none of that mattered. Everyone took care of each other. Everyone shared food. Everyone held each other when someone broke down. Everyone fought to keep each other’s hope alive.I got a message from Britt. My story had started to blow up in the media.Almost immediately after, I was told I was being released.My Ice agent, who had never spoken to me, told my lawyer I could have left sooner if I had signed a withdrawal form, and that they hadn’t known I would pay for my own flight home.From the moment I arrived, I begged every officer I saw to let me pay for my own ticket home. Not a single one of them ever spoke to me about my case.To put things into perspective: I had a Canadian passport, lawyers, resources, media attention, friends, family and even politicians advocating for me. Yet, I was still detained for nearly two weeks.Imagine what this system is like for every other person in there.A small group of us were transferred back to San Diego at 2am – one last road trip, once again shackled in chains. I was then taken to the airport, where two officers were waiting for me. The media was there, so the officers snuck me in through a side door, trying to avoid anyone seeing me in restraints. I was beyond grateful that, at the very least, I didn’t have to walk through the airport in chains.To my surprise, the officers escorting me were incredibly kind, and even funny. It was the first time I had laughed in weeks.I asked if I could put my shoelaces back on.“Yes,” one of them said with a grin. “But you better not run.”“Yeah,” the other added. “Or we’ll have to tackle you in the airport. That’ll really make the headlines.”I laughed, then told them I had spent a lot of time observing the guards during my detention and I couldn’t believe how often I saw humans treating other humans with such disregard. “But don’t worry,” I joked. “You two get five stars.”When I finally landed in Canada, my mom and two best friends were waiting for me. So was the media. I spoke to them briefly, numb and delusional from exhaustion.It was surreal listening to my friends recount everything they had done to get me out: working with lawyers, reaching out to the media, making endless calls to detention centers, desperately trying to get through to Ice or anyone who could help. They said the entire system felt rigged, designed to make it nearly impossible for anyone to get out.The reality became clear: Ice detention isn’t just a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s a business. These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receivegovernment fundingbased on the number of people they detain, which is why theylobbyfor stricter immigration policies. It’s alucrative business: CoreCivic made over$560mfrom Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than$763mfrom Ice contracts.The more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly. What I had experienced was finally starting to make sense.‘I escaped one gulag only to end up in another’: Russian asylum seekers face Ice detention in the USRead moreThis is not just my story. It is the story of thousands and thousands of people still trapped in a system that profits from their suffering. I am writing in the hope that someone out there – someone with the power to change any of this – can help do something.The strength I witnessed in those women, the love they gave despite their suffering, is what gives me faith. Faith that no matter how flawed the system, how cruel the circumstances, humanity will always shine through.Even in the darkest places, within the most broken systems, humanity persists. Sometimes, it reveals itself in the smallest, most unexpected acts of kindness: a shared meal, a whispered prayer, a hand reaching out in the dark. We are defined by the love we extend, the courage we summon and the truths we are willing to tell.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationCanadaUS domestic policyUS foreign policyUS politicsAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was also found guilty of criminal damage and sentenced to a further six-week custodial sentence for spraying paint on a wall of Exeter University in 2023. He sent this letter from prison before he was released in January.I remember the day I was sentenced like it was yesterday. I was filled with anxiety the entire time. It’s a strange situation to be in, not knowing whether or not you’d have your liberty at the end of the day, or for how long it might be taken away. My mind was racing and I had no idea how to operate.At the moment the judge read out my sentence, I felt so many things at once. Sadness, strength and some relief, if I’m honest. Simply because the uncertainty was gone. I stood up and blew kisses to my family and partner who were sitting in the gallery. I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK.But I didn’t look at the judge. I wanted those precious moments to be shared with the people I love. As I walked down to the court cells, my eyes filled with tears. I didn’t know when I’d see any of them next and I didn’t know what the next few months would bring.The whole experience has shaped me and made me who I am todayMy first few days in jail felt like weeks. It was the end of summer and it was something like 30 degrees at HMP Chelmsford. The heating was on constantly and the tiny windows offered no relief. The Olympics were on, so I and my co-defendant, who I was sharing with, spent our time watching and re-enacting the events in our hot, sweaty cell. I’ll always be grateful for his company during that time. It was the first time in prison for both of us so we were able to work through it together.It took several weeks to sort out communication with my family. Several times my application forms would get lost or forgotten about by staff.I was hungry a lot of the time, too: vegan options weren’t on the menu, so often I’d have digestive biscuits for dinner and eat my cereal with water rather than milk. I didn’t kick up too much of a fuss. I was new on the wing and I knew that prison wasn’t going to be particularly nice.I was sustained by the belief that a better future is possible. I fought for it, and now, as a result, I’ve been sent to prison. But I wasn’t going to let the experience break me.The action itself was over two years ago now. I remember many friends, family and even strangers were supportive, but some weren’t. One family friend told me that they would run me over if they were stuck in the traffic I caused. I understand their anger, and I just hope that one day they will understand why I chose to take this action – simply, I didn’t think there was any other option left.The days here run on a rigid routine which changes only slightly between weekdays and weekends. In the week, we wake up at 7.30am. I listen to the radio while I eat my prison-issue breakfast and drink my coffee. We’re unlocked at 8.05am and I leave the wing after a pat-down from the guards. Thankfully, I’m in full-time work, so I spend much of the day fixing bicycles in the workshop for a charity. There is a two-hour break at lunchtime when we’re locked up again. After work in the afternoon, we’ll grab our dinners before going to the gym, which we can attend a few times per week. We aren’t allowed out into the yard during the week, so I only spend five to 10 minutes each day outside walking to and from work.On the weekends, it’s a lot slower and loneliness often creeps in. I’ll have biscuits with my coffee for a treat. I play card games, write letters or watch TV in my cell. We all dread the weekend: Saturdays and Sundays feel longer than the working week.If I was alone it would be so much worse, but the people I’ve met in here have given me so much strength and support. They’re friends that I’ll keep in contact with once I’m released.I’m convinced that civil resistance works, and it’s absolutely justified when you’re fighting for the survival of the human race. I’d voted, signed petitions, written to my MP, attended marches … I tried all the conventional ways to make my voice heard like everyone else, but it didn’t change a thing. So I feel content with the choices I’ve taken. Ultimately, the action that I took did work: it played a part in getting the demands of no new oil and gas drilling into the Labour manifesto. And now it’s policy.It angers me that politicians have known about global warming and climate change for decades. They’ve known that fossil fuels are causing it, and they’ve known that it’s going to kill, displace and starve millions of people. But they ignored it.Whatever stability people had is ripped away when you step insideOur politicians are perfectly willing to lead when the country goes to war, but not when it comes to stopping emissions, which will save lives. In light of all of this, it was clear to me that civil resistance was the only option left. I didn’t do it for fun, for attention or for the sake of it. I did it because I knew that it could work. We’re taught about Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and the suffragettes in school: they’re celebrated as heroes now. But nobody pays much attention to the fact that they were absolutely vilified by the government, the judiciary and the journalists at the time.In the end I’ve done what I can, and a judge chose to send me to prison for it. I don’t blame him, and I don’t spend my time wishing things had gone differently. The whole experience has shaped me and made me who I am today.You learn about society by seeing how people are treated in its prisons, and it’s an absolute mess in ours. This whole experience has deepened my understanding of our system and strengthened my conviction that change is desperately needed. Not reform – we need revolutionary change. The prison system is insanely broken – people here are not treated like human beings.The entire apparatus is executed with maximum emphasis on punishment and a superficial mention of rehabilitation. Many people resort to smashing the contents of their cells or self-harming as a way to access the help that is available. It is absolutely no wonder that re-offending rates are so high when those leaving prison are in a worse way than when they came in.And whatever stability people had in their lives before prison, whether it’s housing or employment, is ripped away when you step inside and there is minimal help to put things back together. Once you’ve received a prison sentence, it’s harder to get a mortgage, car insurance, or a job. How is any of this fair? This country has a huge problem and the evidence is hidden away behind razor wire and brick walls where nobody can see it.11:57Can the UK fix its broken prison system? – videoI’m going to be released with extraordinarily broad licence conditions, with the purpose of stopping my involvement in “political activism”. Really, these conditions will mean that the probation service can pick and choose which elements of the political process I can be involved in. I’ve been told that I won’t be able to attend meetings of the Labour party, for example, or post anything to do with protesting on my social media, despite the fact that freedom of assembly and expression is protected by the European convention on human rights. Lack of cooperation results in imprisonment for the remainder of the sentence. In my case, that would be 19 months.Before I got involved in civil resistance, I was so depressed. I buried my head in the sand because I felt so powerless in the face of it all. I was terrified about what the rest of my life would be like.Looking at the positives, though, I’m going to come out of prison with a fresh appreciation for the things around me. I can’t wait to savour the things that gave me happiness. I took so much for granted before. Whether it’s walking in nature, listening to music, or spending time with my family and partner, I’m going to savour every minute. Even things like being able to use a toilet or shower in privacy and go to sleep knowing you won’t be woken up by a night guard. There’s a lot to settle back into, but I feel lucky that the day of my release is coming – something that many people in here don’t have.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationLetters from prisonEnvironmental activismProtestUK criminal justicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Patrick Butler reportsOn Tuesday the welfare secretary,Liz Kendall, set out her plans to save £5bn from the government’s welfare bill. The current situation is unsustainable, the government says. With the numbers of people claiming disability benefits soaring, it was time for a fairer system, she said.For many disabled people, who have felt the effects of successive governments’ attempts to reform the welfare system, it was a stressful moment. The disability campaigner, musician and actorMik ScarlettellsHelen Piddabout the reality of navigating the benefits system, and why he worries about the increasing nastiness of the conversation around benefits and disability.Patrick Butler, the Guardian’s social policy editor,has been looking at Labour’s new proposals.

A family gathering was planned in Maracay. On Sunday those plans were shattered when El Salvador’s authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, published a cinematographic propaganda video on social media showing scores of Venezuelan prisonersbeing frog-marched off planes and into custodyin his country’s “terrorism confinement centre”.“It’s him,” a shell-shocked Sebastián told their mother after spotting his sibling among those shackled men.“I never in my life thought I would see my brother like that – handcuffed, his head shaved, in a prison for murderers, where they put rapists and kidnappers. It is very painful because he is innocent,” he said of his brother, who travelled to the US in late 2023 chasing a better future.Trump waging ‘sickening’ psychological war, deported Venezuelan’s lawyer saysRead moreLindsay Toczylowski, a California-based immigration lawyer, was another person who found herself scouring Bukele’s sensationalist video for any sign of her client, another Venezuelan migrant she feared had also been unjustly dispatched toEl Salvadorafter seeking shelter from political persecution in the US.“I felt sick … absolute shock,” Toczylowski said of the moment she saw those pictures in which detainees are shown being forced to their knees to have their heads shaved by masked security forces with batons and guns.“It really is such an escalation … and to see it paraded and celebrated by the White House and by Bukele was just an absolutely shocking escalation of human rights abuses against migrants,” said the lawyer who works for the Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef) group.García and Toczylowski’s client – an LGBTQ+ asylum seeker she declined to name out of fears for his safety – appear not to be the only Venezuelans deported to El Salvador despite having no criminal history in their home country or the US. More than 260 people were deported to the Central American country last weekend, 137 of them under 227-year-old wartime powers invoked by the US president called the Alien Enemies Act.In recent days, a succession of Venezuelan families have gone public to demand the release of their loved-ones: young working men whose main “crimes” appear to have been their nationality and having tattoos that US immigration authorities deemed a sign of affiliation to theVenezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Experts in South American organized crime reject the idea that tattoos are a meaningful indicator of gang membership in Venezuela.García’s tattoos include one – inspired by a verse from the Book of Isaiah and inked onto his skin during a stint living in Peru – that reads: “God gives His toughest battles to his strongest warriors”.His brother, Sebastián, has the same tattoo.In a video plea posted on social media, Mercedes Yamarte, the mother of another migrant sent to El Salvador, Mervin Yamarte, described her 29-year-old son as “a good, hardworking boy” who had never been involved in crime. But Yamarte, who entered the US in 2023 and had lived in Dallas, also has tattoos – one with the name of his daughter, another paying tribute to his mum – which were seemingly interpreted as an indication of gang membership by US authorities.“Everyone close to him knows he has a big heart and NOTHING TO DO WITH TREN DE ARAGUA,” his brother, Francis Varela, wrote on social media. “My brother went in search of the American dream,” Varela added. “A dream that has now become a nightmare for us all.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An Instagram photo shows him posing outside a train station in the Mexican state of Jalisco as he heads to the southern border. The post is accompanied by a song by the Mexican singer Peso Pluma called Nueva Vida” (New Life) which captured his aspirations.Two months later, another image shows him cutting hair at a Marvel-themed salon in Longview, Texas named after the Incredible Hulk. “May it be everything we dreamed of,” García wrote of his fresh start beside an emoji of the Stars and Stripes flag. Last weekend that dream came to an abrupt and unexpected end in Bukele’s mega prison near San Salvador.Immigration advocates have voiced outrage at the plight of men such as García and the lack of due process in their cases.“It’s enraging because they clearly don’t have any affiliation with Tren de Aragua at all,” said Adam Isacson, a migration expert from the Washington Office on Latin America thinktank.Tren de Aragua: are Trump’s claims about a violent street gang overblown?Read moreIsacson said that in the past such migrants tended to face detention in a “miserable [detention] centre here in the United States” or were “shipped back” home. “It did not mean that you were sent to some medieval jail of an authoritarian leader in another country. So we’re in brand new ground here,” Isacson warned, adding that while it was possible some of those deported to El Salvador were hardened criminals, many appeared to be innocent.Sebastián García Casique insisted that was the case of his older brother who their mother had raised to be an “honest and good” person. He urged Trump to review his brother’s case and free him.“I believe this is an injustice,” said García, 21. “Maybe one or two [of the prisoners] have criminal records, and if they did something, punish them for it … But the innocent should be sent to Venezuela … What is he doing in El Salvador if he committed no crime there? … Why don’t they say what crimes they are accused of?”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaTrump administrationUS politicsAmericasEl SalvadorUS immigrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

She added that Ottawa would ask for leniency for other Canadians facing the same fate.“There are four Canadians that have been executed and therefore we are strongly condemning what happened,” she said.“Canada strongly condemns China’s use of the death penalty, which is irreversible and inconsistent with basic human dignity,” a GAC spokesperson, Charlotte MacLeod, said in a statement to the Guardian. “Canada repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere.”MacLeod said Canada was providing consular assistance to the victims’ families and asked media “respect the family’s privacy during this difficult time”.China’s embassy in Canada said in a statement it is a “rule of law” nation and that anyone convicted of breaking laws “must be held accountable”.“Drug-related crime is a severe crime recognized worldwide as extremely harmful to the society, and will be faced with severe penalties in all countries. China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a ‘zero tolerance’ attitude towards the drug problem,” the embassy said, adding it had “solid and sufficient” evidence in all the cases in which prisoners were executed.“The Chinese judicial authorities have handled the cases in strict accordance with the law, and have fully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned.”China has aconviction rate of more than 99%, a result that has elicited skepticism and criticism from human rights groups over the years.The embassy called on Canada to “respect the rule of law and China’s judicial sovereignty” and to “stop making irresponsible remarks” in order to improve relationship between to the two countries.Relations between the two countries hit a low point between 2018 and 2022, after the prominent Huawei telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou wasarrested in Vancouverat the request of US authorities.Her detention in Canada prompted China to quickly detain and charge two Canadians living in the country, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, eventually charging the pair with espionage.But the upgrading of charges against a Canadian in prison further cemented views in Canada that China wasengaged in “hostage diplomacy”.In 2014, the Canadian citizen Robert Schellenberg was accused of attempting to smuggle 225kg of methamphetamine to Australia. He has maintained his innocence, but in December 2018 he was sentenced to 15 years. That charge was upgraded to execution in 2019, during the fervour of China’s diplomatic spat with Canada. At the time, Canadaissued a travel warningto its citizens going to China.MacLeod confirmed on Wednesday that Schellenberg was still detained and said the federal government “continues to advocate for clemency”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaChinaAmericasCapital punishmentnewsShareReuse this content"

No laws were ever passed to address the controversy.The Citizen Lab, in areport published on Wednesday, found a possible technical link between Paragon,which sells spyware known as Graphite to government clients, and entities based in Ontario, Canada, including one that used the address of the Ontario provincial police (OPP).In a statement sent to the Guardian after this article was published, the OPP did not deny using spyware, but said: “InCanada, the interception of private communications requires judicial authorization in accordance with the Criminal Code, and is only used to advance serious criminal investigations. Such authorizations are subject to stringent criteria relating to designated offences defined in the Criminal Code.“The OPP uses investigative tools and techniques in full compliance with the laws of Canada, including the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Releasing information about specific investigative techniques and technology could jeopardize active investigations and threaten public and officer safety.”Paragon, which is now a US-owned company, does not disclose the names of its clients and did not comment on this story.Like other spyware makers, the company has emphasized that it is meant to be used to fight serious crime and terrorism. But the company’s spyware, which can hack into any phone, wasrecently found to have been used against an Italian journalist and several activists who support immigrants. The Italian government has acknowledged it was a Paragon client and that the companysuspended its contract with Italyfollowing revelations that the hacking software had been used against members of civil society.‘Asleep at the wheel’: Canada police’s spyware admission raises alarmRead moreIn a previous statement, a spokesperson said Paragon requires all of its users to “adhere to terms and conditions that preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders”. A spokesperson added: “While we are not able to discuss individual customers, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our terms of service.”Canada’s use of spyware was a source of controversy in 2022, when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police admitted – in what was called a “remarkable” disclosure – that the national police force had used spyware to infiltrate mobile devices and collect data. It said at the time that it had only used the technology in serious cases, when other surveillance technology had failed.The Citizen Lab’s new report provides more detail about the use of spyware by Canadian authorities. Researchers said they found evidence of a “growing ecosystem” of spyware capability among Ontario-based police services. Researchers said public court records obtained by the Citizen Lab show that the OPP used a surveillance tool that was being used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the course of a 2019 investigation to infect a mobile phone for remote interception of private communications.Additionally, a 2023 judgment from the superior court of justice in Toronto described a joint investigation by Toronto police and York regional police services where investigators “considered” the use of a spyware surveillance tool, which in Canada is referred to as an “on-device investigative tool” (ODIT).A 2023 search warrant application obtained by the Citizen Lab, which was prepared by the Toronto police service, also revealed that TPS had obtained an ODIT from an unknown source, and that the police had been seeking authorization to use the software to intercept cellular communications through encrypted instant-messaging applications.“What these findings show is that there is a widening gap in public awareness regarding the extent to which spyware technology is being used in Canada,” said Kate Robertson, a senior researcher at the lab. “These findings raise important questions for the government and privacy regulators about what technologies are being used, and underscores again the need for law reform to address the security and human rights risks concerned.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasIsraelSurveillancenewsShareReuse this content"

That argument is continuing in court, with the administration saying all flights took off before Boasberg’s order, while that is disputed and the judge has demanded a detailed itinerary. On Wednesday he threatened consequences if his order was violated, while giving the administration more time to present evidence.Leavitt said: “The judge in this case is essentially trying to say that the president doesn’t have the executive authority to deport foreign terrorists from our American soil. That is an egregious abuse of the bench. This judge cannot, does not have that authority.”She added: “And it’s very, very clear that this is an activist judge who is trying to usurp the president’s authority under the Alien Enemies Act. The president has this power, and that’s why this deportation campaign has continued, and this judge, Judge Boasberg is a Democrat activist.”Republican president George W Bush appointed Boasberg to the district of Columbia’s superior court, then Democratic president Barack Obama elevated him to the federal court.Boasberg is considered a centrist Democrat and was a roommate of US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, while both were studying at Yale University, the New York Timesreported, as an aside.Meanwhile, Trump has repeated his declaration thathe would not defy a court ruling, even as controversy swirls about whether his administration has already ignored several of them following a spate of negative judgments that threaten to block his governing agenda.Conservative former federal judge says Trump has ‘declared war’ on US rule of lawRead moreAsked byFox Newson Tuesday night if he would ever defy a court ruling, Trump said he would not–but launched an attack on Boasberg, though without naming him.“I never did defy and I wouldn’t in the future, no. You can’t do that,” he said. “However, we have very bad judges, and these are judges that shouldn’t be allowed. I think at a certain point you have to start looking at what do you do when you have a rogue judge.“The judge that we’re talking about is you look at his other rulings … He’s a lunatic.”Trump renewed his assault in a later post on his Truth Social platform: “If a President doesn’t have the right to throw murderers, and other criminals, out of our country because a radical left lunatic judge wants to assume the role of president, then our country is in very big trouble, and destined to fail!”The comments followeda rare rebukefrom John Roberts, the conservative-leaning chief justice of theUS supreme court, who criticised demands by Trump and his supporters, including his wealthiest backer,Elon Musk, that Boasberg be impeached.Fears over the administration’s readiness to defy the courts – widely seen as the only obstacle to Trump’s rampant agenda in the absence of meaningful resistance from a Republican-ruled Congress – seemed likely to intensify after high-profile negative rulings on Tuesday.In one, a US district court judge, Theodore Chuang,ruledthat Musk and his “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit had violated the constitution in “multiple ways” in attempting to dismantle USAid.A separate rulingbarred the Pentagon from enforcing Trump’s order banning transgender people from serving in the military, saying it was “soaked in animus”.Another order on Wednesday by Judge Jesse Furman rebuffed the administration’s effort to dismiss an attempt byMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, to fight a deportation order and said the case must beheard in New Jersey, rather than Louisiana, where he is now detained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now let him enforce it.’”The statement attributed to Jackson, president from 1829 to 1837, is widely believed to be apocryphal.Vance reiterated the sentiment in a social media post in February of this year following anearlier injunctionagainst Doge.“If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal,” hewrote. “If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s also illegal. Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”Legal commentators have warnedthat a president openly ignoring court orders could portend a slide into dictatorship.Michael Luttig, a former federal judge, told NBC that Trump had already “declared war on the rule of law”.“In the past few weeks, the president himself has led a full frontal assault on the constitutional rule of law, the federal judiciary, the American justice system and the nation’s legal profession,” Luttigsaid. “America is in a constitutional crisis.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationLaw (US)Donald TrumpUS politicsEl SalvadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The judges, who spent several hours questioning Katzenbach on Monday and Wednesday, at one stage expressed scepticism at the plaintiff’s claim that there was a direct and serious risk to the house.“You have to convince us that in the next 30 years there is a concrete threat to your client’s property,” lead judge Rolf Meyer told the plaintiff’s lawyers. “Personally, I don’t yet see it.”Lliuya, the farmer and mountain guide at the centre of the case, took RWE to court to try to make the company contribute to local flood defences in line with its share of planet-heating pollution. The proportion was calculated by areport from Carbon Majorsat 0.47% of global emissions when the case began, and has since shrunk to 0.38%.Speaking to the Guardian after the hearing, Lliuya, who issupported by nonprofit Germanwatch, said the danger of a flood caused by an avalanche was real.“Living with this risk makes you scared,” he said. “It’s not just the physical danger, it’s also the psychological effects.”The case could open the door for claimants across the world hit by carbon-aggravated weather extremes. Similar cases have been filed in Belgium, where a cattle farmer is targeting French oil giant Total, and in Switzerland, where four Indonesians from the island of Pari are targeting cement maker Holcim.Moritz Becker, the Freshfields lawyer representing RWE, said in closing remarks that the company was not disputing climate change or RWE’s responsibility for climate action, but argued that going through civil courts would either lead to individual cases of symbolism or a dog-eat-dog world of lawsuits. “In neither case does this help combat the climate crisis.”Judge Meyer had rejected the argument in opening remarks on Monday, referring to statements made to the media by RWE that the case would leave every motorist liable for their emissions.“We are talking about huge amounts of CO2,” he said. “Not about individuals driving cars.”Explore more on these topicsRWE npowerFarmingFloodingPeruCoalGermanyFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

In a caption accompanying the video posted to social media, he wrote: “This is a blow to the will of the people.”View image in fullscreenEkrem İmamoğlu speaks to supporters in Istanbul in January.Photograph: Erdem Şahin/EPA“Hundreds of police officers have arrived at my door.

The Istanbul prosecutor accused them of collaborating with a leftwing political coalition in the run-up to local elections after losses for Erdoğan’s party last year, thereby allegedly aiding the PKK. The jailed leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, announced late last month that the group would disarm and dissolve.View image in fullscreenPeople take part in a protest against the detention of Ekrem İmamoğlu in Ankara.Photograph: Necati Savaş/EPALong seen as the only candidate capable of presenting a serious challenge to Erdoğan’s 22 years in power, İmamoğlu had been taking part in primaries for the Republican People’s party (CHP) to choose the opposition’s candidate for the next presidential election. He was widely tipped to be declared as the opposition’s candidate in a vote expected this weekend.The next presidential vote is scheduled for 2028, although observers anticipate early elections.İmamoğlu had previously faced a political ban after an Istanbul court convicted him of insulting election officials in 2022, charges that he appealed.The night before hundreds of police arrived at his residence to arrest him, Istanbul University declared that it had annulled his diploma – effectively barring him from running for the presidency, as a university degree is a pre-requisite. İmamoğlu denounced the decision as “legally baseless”.Turkish police were out in force across Istanbul on Wednesday amid a four-day ban on public protests and meetings following İmamoğlu’s arrest, with main thoroughfares closed and some metro stations shuttered. A boulevard around the police station where İmamoğlu was taken into custody was locked down.View image in fullscreenStudents gathered to protest outside Istanbul University on Wednesday.Photograph: Emrah Gürel/APDespite the restrictions, thousands of students gathered to protest on the campus of Istanbul University before some clashed with riot police. Crowds of students then marched towards the mayoral headquarters, while a major union called on its members to take to the streets near the police station where the mayor was detained.Internet access across Turkey was limited, while the internet freedom organisation Netblocks notedrestricted access to social media platformsincluding X, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok after the mayor’s detention.The head of the CHP, Özgür Özel, denounced İmamoğlu’s arrest as “a coup”. “There is currently a force in place to prevent the nation from determining the next president,” he said in a post on X. “We are faced with a coup attempt against our next president.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

İmamoğlu won his seat again after a re-run of the vote, and secured a second term with a wide margin in local elections that marked a high point of opposition support last year.Turkish authorities have arrested hundreds in a series of dawn raids in recent months, detaining politicians with the pro-Kurdish People’s Equality Democracy (DEM) party as well as journalists and academics. Authorities alsounseated pro-Kurdish mayorsfrom their posts in south-eastern cities, whittling away at the opposition’s victory last year, often replacing them with trustees loyal to the government.Özel travelled to Istanbul and addressed a crowd that had gathered in front of Istanbul city hall, thanking the students and youth “who ignored the police barricades” and walked to city hall to protest.In reference to Erdoğan’s earliest foray into politics as the mayor of Istanbul in the late 1990s, Özel added: “He who wins Istanbul wins Turkey.

The White House said Trump had promised to help with a Ukrainian request to source more air defence batteries for Kyiv.The last encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy ended in an angry exchange of words between the two presidents and the US vice-president, JD Vance. It marked a low point in US-Ukrainian relations and spooked other allies that Washington may be about to abandon Kyiv.‘As real as it can get’: EU to loan €150bn for European defence from invasionRead moreSince then, Zelenskyy has been eager to get relations with Trump back on track. His readout of Wednesday’s call thanked Trump multiple times, and he said he had signed on to the ceasefire plan.“We instructed our teams to resolve technical issues related to implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram after the call.Previously, Ukrainian and US negotiating teams had agreed on a full ceasefire, but Putin turned that down suggesting instead pausing mutual strikes on energy infrastructure and a ceasefire in the Black Sea.Trump, posting on Truth Social, described his talk with Zelenskyy as a “very good telephone call” that lasted around an hour. “Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia andUkrainein terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track,” he wrote, in language that was noticeably less hyperbolic than some of his pronouncements on the conflict.In a Zoom call with journalists late on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he had “felt no pressure” from Trump, adding: “It was a fruitful conversation, perhaps the most fruitful we have had, the mood was positive.“We have received signals from the United States that we are talking about the ceasefire on energy facilities, so not to attack energy infrastructure, and we are also talking about the civilian infrastructure facilities.”Zelenskyy said his team would draw up a list of the kind of facilities they felt could be included and would present them to the Americans at upcoming negotiations.The Ukrainian leader also said that he and Trump had discussed the US proposal to take ownership of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south Ukraine.“We talked only about one power plant, which is under Russian occupation,” he said.In a sign that European leaders are closely watching the discussions between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy, the Ukraine president answered a phone call while speaking with reporters on Wednesday evening and promised to call back. Returning to the briefing, he said: “That was President Macron, we have a conversation on average once a day, he’s helping a lot. I will call him back.”Ukrainian officials say that they believe their relations with the Trump administration are now on sounder footing.“It was a fairly emotional conversation in the Oval Office, and it showed that contradictions had built up,” said Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak, in an interview in Kyiv earlier on Wednesday. He claimed, however, that the two administrations quickly “found a synchronised position”, as demonstrated by the agreement in Saudi Arabia.Nonetheless, much of the rhetoric from many in the White House continues to alarm Kyiv’s European allies. On Wednesday, Trump’s negotiating envoy Steve Witkoff described the call between Trump and Putin as “two great leaders coming together for the betterment of mankind”.Podolyak said he was “relaxed” about the Trump administration’s strategy of “soft communication” with Russia. “They believe that this softer rhetoric, many personal connections, will enable them to find a level of trust. Although when I put the words ‘trust’ and ‘Russia’ together, it looks fantastical to me,” he said.A deal onUS access to Ukraine’s mineral wealthis still awaiting signatures. Trump’s suggestion that the US could take over Ukrainian power plants “would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure”, according to a White House statement.There was some confusion over what exactly had been said on the call between Trump and Putin, as Moscow and Washington gave very different readouts in the aftermath.Trump, in an initial post on Truth Social, said the partial ceasefire would apply to “energy and infrastructure”, giving the impression that it would extend to all civilian infrastructure. Zelenskyy, after his call with Trump, spoke about “ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure”.However, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday that the ceasefire would only apply to the energy sector, and a White House statement on Wednesday also referred only to energy, leaving the details of the ceasefire unclear.Additionally, the Kremlin said in a statement that a requirement for serious peace talks would be “the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyiv”.Trump, speaking on Fox News, denied this had ever come up: “No, we didn’t talk about aid, actually, we didn’t talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things but aid was never discussed,” he said.However, Peskov directly contradicted Trump, when speaking to reporters in Moscow: “The need to halt arms supplies to Kyiv was discussed during Putin and Trump’s conversation,” he said. Ceasing military aid would be “high on the agenda in negotiations between Russia and the US, but the topic will not be discussed publicly”, Peskov added.Ukrainian officials dismissed the demand as unrealistic.“It’s a very strange demand, of course,” said Podolyak. “He wants Ukraine to give up its army, to give up security guarantees, to give up its right to be in alliances, and to give up on various territories. This is what he’s been fighting for for three years, and he couldn’t do it militarily … And now that’s what he wants from the negotiations process,” he added.There remains no indication that Putin has abandoned any of his most hardline objectives in the war in Ukraine. Kommersant, a well-connected Russian newspaper, reported on Wednesday that Putin told a meeting of senior business leaders on Tuesday that he intends to continue the fighting until he gets full control of, as well as international recognition over, the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Based on Apple’s 2024 revenue of $391bn (£301bn), the maximum fine would be nearly $80bn.Google’s parent to buy cybersecurity group Wiz in its biggest ever dealRead moreThe commission said it had taken a “preliminary view” that Google’s search engine prioritises results pointing to Alphabet’s own services over those of rivals, breaching the requirement to treat third-party services in a “transparent, fair and non-discriminatory” way.It also said that Google Play, the company’s app store, prevents developers from steering consumers towards other channels where better offers might be available.The commission told Apple it must make its operating systems available to devices made by competitors, such as smartphones and wireless headphones, or else face the prospect of investigations and fines.The order is designed to promote competition by making it possible for makers of rival technology to connect with Apple’s devices, such as iPads and iPhones.The EU issued a second order against Apple, laying out a detailed timeline and methodology for how Apple should respond to requests from app developers to open up its systems.A spokesperson for Apple said: “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules.”The company added: “It’s bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.”Google’s senior director for competition, Oliver Bethell, wrote in a blogpost: “The commission’s findings require us to make even more changes to how we show certain types of search results, which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US vice-president, JD Vance, meanwhile, has railed against excessive AI regulation in a rebuke aimed at the EU’s sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act.The US has also pushed back against Britain’s plans for a digital services tax, amid regular attacks by Elon Musk, the owner of X, on the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. Vance has also attacked the UK’s Online Safety Act, claiming last month that free speech in the UK was “in retreat”. However, the UK government is adamant that the act will not be a bargaining chip in any negotiations between the Trump administration and Britain over tariffs.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorAppleGoogleiPadiPhoneEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The rest could be spent in non-EU countries with a security agreement.The details came as the European Commission saidRussiawould remain “a fundamental threat to Europe’s security for the foreseeable future”.The EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters that the EU was preparing for the worst: “We don’t have a cold war, but we have a hot war on European soil, and the threat is existential. It’s as real as it can get.”Last month Danish intelligence services warned that if Moscow perceived Nato as weak,Russia could be ready to wage a large-scale war in Europewithin five years. Denmark’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen urged fellow EU leaders to set a 2030 target on rearmament at a recent emergency summit in Brussels.Addressing the Royal DanishMilitaryAcademy in Copenhagen on Tuesday, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said “readiness 2030” meant “to have rearmed and developed the capabilities to have credible deterrence” and “an industrial base that is a strategic advantage”.The UK is described as an “essential European ally” in the paper, which also proposes deepening cooperation with Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. The EU has defence pacts with six countries, including Japan, Korea and Norway.Kallas, who met the UK foreign secretary David Lammy on Tuesday, said the commission was working on having a defence and security partnership with the UK and she hoped for results at an EU-UK summit in May.View image in fullscreenEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, left, and EU defence commissioner Andrius Kubilius from the European Commission in Brussels.Photograph: Yves Herman/ReutersThe “Buy European” approach is a victory for France, but is likely to face pushback from member states, such as the Netherlands and Poland, in discussions on finalising the €150bn loan proposals. Many countries say they want a bigger European defence industry, but oppose restrictions on military spending.“The British defence industry is so much intertwined with ours [in the EU],” a senior EU diplomat said. “We have an integrated value chain in the west for our military stuff. And it wouldn’t make sense to cut it.”They added that China, Iran and Russia were deepening defence industry cooperation. “So those who say that we should cut out the non-Europeans are shooting themselves geopolitically and economically in the foot.”EU leaders, who will discuss the plans at a summit on Thursday, also differ in the tone they take on the US.Italy’s former prime minister, Mario Draghi, who isadvising the commission on competitiveness, told Italian lawmakers this week thatEuropean security had been put in doubtby Donald Trump’s change in foreign policy towards Russia.A senior German government official in Berlin told reporters: “We don’t want to give the impression we are seeking to decouple ourselves from the US.”EU countries, such as France and Spain, are likely to be disappointed that the commission has not come up with new money to fund defence ambitions.Officials think the EU can raise €800bn in new defence spending – €150bn from EU-backed loans raised on capital markets and €650bn fiscal flexibilities that allow EU member states to go into debt for defence without breaking the EU’s fiscal rules.EU diplomats say the headline €800bn will never be realised. Some of the largest and wealthiest member states, with top credit ratings, such as Germany and the Netherlands, have no intention of taking out EU-backed loans. Other member states, especially in southern Europe, are seen as reluctant to deepen their national debts for defence.The commission could act asa central purchasing body, it suggests in the paper, opening the door to the EU executive buying drones, missiles and other equipment, if member states wished. The proposal recalls the role EU bodies have already played in buying ammunition for Ukraine and vaccines during the Covid pandemic.Defence spending in Europe has jumped since Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainein February 2022, hitting 1.9% of GDP in 2024 for 27 member states, which includes 23 Nato allies. But Donald Trump’s rapprochement towards Russia and hostility to the EU has forced a change of thinking.The EU’s 450 million citizens “should not have to depend on 340 million Americans to defend ourselves against 140 million Russians, who cannot defeat 38 million Ukrainians”, EU defence commissioner Andrius Kubilius said.“We really can do better. It’s time for us to take responsibility for the defence of Europe.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionDefence policyRussiaUkraineEuropeMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

But seven hours is almost unique in history.”Kristian Midtgard, a dog handler who – with his dog, Whiskey – found the man, told TV2: “It was very surprising that he was still alive.”“All the statistics and experience say that it’s not possible when you stay buried for so long,” he added.The mayor of Lyngen, Erik Larsen, quoted by the public broadcaster NRK, called it “a miracle”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Darren Cormack, the chief executive of the demining charity Mines Advisory Group, said the Briton was among five people injured in the explosion.The Israel Defense Forces denied hitting a UN building, saying “there was no IDF operational activity” in the area of the UN compound and “the IDF didn’t strike” it.Israeli strikes latest bloody chapter in war of extraordinary civilian casualtiesRead moreA series of Israeli evacuation orders telling about 150,000 people in the north and east of Gaza to leave their homes to avoid being trapped in a combat zone suggested ground assaults in coming days, but seizure of the Netzarim corridor is the first major move to retake territory in Gaza since Tuesday’s airstrikes, which shattered a two-month-long pause in the hostilities withHamas.A private security company that had been securing checkpoints in the Netzarim corridor withdrew overnight and Israeli troops in armoured vehicles and tanks and on foot moved in at dawn on Wednesday, according to western aid officials.The Israeli forces are believed to have reoccupied four fortified bases there and closed off all access. Travelling from north to south Gaza is now impossible, the officials said.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has said the new offensive will continueuntil “total victory” is achievedover Hamas and the 59 remaining hostages held by the militant group are freed.As part of the ceasefire deal agreed in January, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor.Netzarim corridor mapSeparately, Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, threatened ordinary people in Gaza.Katz issued a “last warning” to Palestinians in Gaza on Wednesday, saying in a video statement that they should follow the recent advice of the US president, Donald Trump, to return Israeli hostages and remove Hamas from power.“Return the hostages and remove Hamas, and other options will open up for you – including the possibility of leaving for other places in the world, for those who want to,” Katz said.Hundreds of thousands returned to what remained of their homes and Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone around the edges of Gaza during the ceasefire, which began in mid-January.When the agreed first phase of the ceasefire ended 17 days ago, Israel reimposed a blockade on Gaza, cutting off all supplies.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned on Wednesday that medics were struggling to manage a sharp increase in casualties over the last 36 hours after the resumption of ground operations by Israel in the Gaza Strip.“Due to the recent suspension of humanitarian aid into Gaza, stocks of medical supplies have dropped significantly and on top of this, hospital staff are struggling to manage the sharp increase of casualties,” said the ICRC in a statement.The Guardian view on Israel breaking the ceasefire: destroying hope along with lives | EditorialRead moreIsrael and Hamas accuse each other of breaching the truce, which had broadly held since January and offered respite for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza.About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died in the shock Hamas incursion into Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict. About 250 hostages were also taken. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 49,000, also mostly civilians.Netanyahu and other Israel officials said the decision to renew attacks in Gaza came after Hamas rejected proposals for a 30- to 60-day extension of the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire.Hamas says it wants to conclude the phases of the ceasefire deal as signed.Israel has refused to enter into discussions about the second phase, which is intended to lead to a permanent end to hostilities, the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza, and the return of all the hostages in Gaza, of whom more than half are thought to be dead.“Hamas has not closed the door on negotiations, but we insist there is no need for new agreements,” Taher al-Nunu, a Hamas official, said on Wednesday.Nunu called on the international community to “take urgent action” to end the war, while accusing Israel of “violating the ceasefire agreement it signed”.Analysts said Israel had launched new strikes to “break an impasse”.Prof Danny Orbach, an expert in military history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said: “There was a very good reason Israel did not want to go to phase two [of the ceasefire agreement]. It would have meant Hamas staying in Gaza, staying in power and Israel having to lift its siege too … There was a complete disconnect between the interests of the two sides.”Critics in Israelhave accused Netanyahu of resuming the offensive toreinforce his coalition governmentbefore a crucial budget vote in parliament, to rally support for the war in the face of popular backing for a ceasefire, and to head off widespread public anger over his attempt to fire the head of the internal security service, the Shin Bet.Underlining the deep divisions in Israel, tens of thousands in Israel protested on Tuesday night and Wednesday against the renewed offensive and Netanyahu’s government.

And I want to promise you – and them – this is only the beginning,” the Israeli prime minister said in a video statement.Israel and Hamas accuse each other of breaching the truce, which had broadly held since January and offered respite for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza.About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died in the shock Hamas incursion into Israel in October 2023 that triggered the war.

The first phase came into effect in January but expired earlier this month. They consulted with the Trump administration before the strikes went ahead.Hamas, which still holds 59 of about 250 hostages seized in the October 2023 attack, says it wants to conclude the three-phase ceasefire deal as signed. More than half of the hostages are thought to be dead.Israeli has refused to enter into discussions about the deal’s second phase, which is intended to lead to a permanent end to hostilities, the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza and the return of all the hostages. It has also reimposed a strict blockade on the territory, and cut off remaining electricity supplies.Under the ceasefire deal drafted under the former US president Joe Biden’s administration, the second phase should have begun in early March.“Hamas has not closed the door on negotiations, but we insist there is no need for new agreements,” Taher al-Nunu, a Hamas official, said on Wednesday.Nunu called on the international community to “take urgent action” to end the war, while accusing Israel of “violating the ceasefire agreement it signed”.Critics have accused Netanyahu of resuming the offensive to reinforce his coalition government before a crucial budget vote in parliament, to rally support for the war in the face of popular backing for a ceasefire and to head off widespread public anger over his attempt to fire the head of the internal security service, the Shin Bet.Underlining the deep divisions in Israel, tens of thousands have protested against the renewed offensive. Parliamentarians have called for a review after police forcefully dispersed activists demonstrating on Tuesday against the resumption of the war.The prime minister’s office said early on Wednesday that the Israeli government had “unanimously approved” his proposal to reappoint the far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir as national security minister.Ben-Gvir left the government in protest at the ceasefire deal agreed in January, but said he would return if the war was resumed.Israeli strikes latest bloody chapter in war of extraordinary civilian casualtiesRead moreA second far-right minister who has returned is Amichai Eliyahu, who was briefly suspended in November 2023 for suggesting that the use of nuclear weapons on Gaza was an option during the war.Analysts said Israel had launched strikes to “break an impasse”.Prof Danny Orbach, an expert in military history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said: “There was a very good reason Israel did not want to go to phase two [of the ceasefire agreement].

Parties in war are expected to adhere to theprinciple of distinctionbetween militaries and civilians, and theprinciple of proportionality. Attacks against military objectives which cause excessive civilian casualties relative to the advantage gained are, in theory, a war crime.Hamas showed no respect for distinction or proportionality in the 7 October attack in which about 1,200 were killed. Six months after,Israel’s social security agency said814 civilians had been killed, 39 of them children, in brutal attacks on the Nova music festival,where an estimated 365 people were killed, and at Nahal Oz and other kibbutzim near the Gaza Strip.1:44Mourners gather at site of Nova music festival to mark 7 October attacks – videoIsrael’s military response has been ferocious, leading to the deaths inGazaof more than 49,000 people – civilians and military personnel – about 59% of whom were women, children or elderly, according to Palestinian health authorities. These figures are so high they raise questions of their own.“Even without looking at specific incidents, it becomes hard to see how harm may have been mitigated towards civilians and how the principles of distinction and proportionality were applied,” said Anna Gallina, a specialist international humanitarian lawyer with Global Rights Compliance.In some incidents, the number of civilian casualties is extraordinary. At least 126 Palestinians arerecordedto have been killed inthe bombing of the densely populated Jabalia refugee campon 31 October 2023. The target, in an attack that took place with no warning, was Hamas’s northern commander, Ibrahim Biari, and an underground base, Israel’s military said. Craters 40ft deep were left behind.View image in fullscreenOne Israeli strike on the Jabalia refugee camp killed at least 126 people.Photograph: ReutersThere is also ample evidence to suggest the Israeli military relaxed its own rules of engagement. Reports in Israeli publication+972 magazineandthe Guardian, citing sources within the IDF, said it was deemed permissible to kill up to 15 to 20 civilians when attacking a person identified as a junior Hamas operative and 100 for a commander.On 25 October 2023, the IDF struck a block above whatit said was a “Hamas terror tunnel”multiple times. The attack destroyed the al-Taj residential building, and 101 people (44 children, 37 women, 26 men) werecounted by Airwarsas killed.When Israeldramatically increased its air campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanonlast September after nearly a year of tit-for-tat cross-border strikes, 492 civilians and military were reported by Beirut as killed in a single day. A few days later 73 were killed when a six-storey apartment block was destroyed by Israeli missiles in the village of Ain el-Delb.Six victims were identifiedas having links to Hezbollah.Craig Jones, the author of a study of military lawyers, said that while Nato militaries, in the US under the former president Joe Biden, and particularly in Europe, have become increasingly cautious about the risks of civilian casualties, “Israel has gone 180 degrees in the opposite direction” during the Gaza war.Britain, by contrast, is particularly cautious. The UK military says it operates a policy of no civilian casualties. Though the RAF’s claim that its bombing raids have only caused one civilian death during the war against Islamic State has beenrepeatedly challenged, former insiders say the commitment to avoid civilian harm was genuine.“If it was thought there would be any civilian casualties then the strike would be aborted even if the aircraft was already in the air,” said a former UK government lawyer. “The Israelis have always been absolutely wildly different to us and this is discussed openly.”Israel’s argument is that it is fighting a different kind of war. Hamas, Israel has repeatedly argued, deliberately erased civilian-military distinctions throughout the conflict.It accuses the Palestinian group of locating command centres in tunnel networksbelow buildings such as hospitals in Gaza’s dense urban environment, while its besieged 2.3 million citizens had nowhere to escape.A former IDF military lawyer, who asked not to be named, asked how the British would act if the UK was invaded. “This was a war we thought we could lose – and when you are under direct attack, it was very important to get rid of the main commanders of Hamas.” Because the threat was considered existential, it justified an alternative approach, the former lawyer added.Key western allies – the UK and US – have not concluded that Israel has violated the doctrine of proportionality. A letter from David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, to the foreign affairs committee from January said it had “not been possible to make an assessment of Israel’s compliance with the principle of proportionality” because of “the opaque and contested information environment in Gaza”.View image in fullscreenRecent US strikes in Yemen have killed dozens.Photograph: Naif Rahma/ReutersLast May,a leaked US state department reviewrequested by Biden on whether countries receiving US arms were using them “in accordance with international humanitarian law” concluded that a determination was not possible because “Israel has not shared complete information” about its decision-making processes.“What we have seen is that there’s been no accountability for this gross widening of the whole concept of proportionality,” said Dearbhla Minogue, a human rights lawyer with Global Legal Action Network. “You could imagine it loosening other militaries’ standards in future conflicts.”Donald Trump’s administration, which says it was consulted before Israel’s overnight assault, has made clear it is strongly pro-Israel. At the same time, the US is rewriting its own rules. Earlier this month, Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, moved tocut positions of those who work to mitigate and assess risks to civilians– and began an overhaul of US military lawyers aimed atloosening the rules of engagement.On Saturday,the US military bombed the Houthis in Yemen, killing 53 and wounding 98 according to the Houthi health ministry, including women and children. By contrast,five were reported killed and six injuredin joint US-UK air raids on the Houthis in mid-January 2024. Early indications are that the US doctrine is already changing in practice.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

In a voicemail to the family she said: “We don’t even know what the charges are against us. We will hear the charges for the first time then.”The couple have been running projects in schools in Afghanistan for 18 years and decided to stay in the country afterthe Taliban seized power in 2021. One of the projects involved educational training for mothers and children in Bamiyan, one of the largest cities in central Afghanistan.There is a ban on women working and on female education beyond primary school, but their work had apparently been approved by the Bamiyan local authority.The couple’s daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the Guardian she feared her parents would not get a fair trial because their interpreter, Juya, who was arrested alongside them, is also due in court on Thursday and will not be allowed to translate during the proceedings.She said: “Mum is obviously extremely concerned that without a competent interpreter, their case cannot be accurately or fairly represented and [they] will not be able to properly follow or engage in the proceedings, in serious breach of their rights.”Juya has also been caring for her father who requires regular heart medication. At the weekend, Entwistle said herfather’s life was in danger after his health deteriorated.On Wednesday, she said: “We remain extremely concerned for Dad in particular. Without access to the medication he needs, his continued detention poses a serious risk to his life.”She said her parents were being held separately and had been denied access to each other for the last 10 days.The couple were arrested on 1 February with Juya and a American-Chinese friend, Faye Hall, who had rented a plane to travel with them.At the time an employee for Rebuild, the couple’s training company, was informed that their flight “did not coordinate with the local government”.Entwistle said: “Again, we ask the Taliban to release Dad, Mum, Faye and the interpreter as a gesture of goodwill during this season of Ramadan.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The firing was described by both Bedoya and present Colorado representatives as “illegal”.Elon Musk, Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, the tech billionaires behind X, Amazon and Meta, respectively,were all presentat Trump’s inauguration in January. Musk is playing a key role in his administration, while both Bezos and Musk have held talks with the president.“Each of those men and each of their companies is currently the subject of an FTC court order, or is currently the subject of FTC litigation,” Bedoya said.The fired commissioner expressed his concern that theTrump administrationwould not block future mergers that threaten consumer protections.“I’m worried that the only thing that’s going to matter is which billionaire has the president’s ear on this deal, and what strings can he pull about it,” Bedoya said. “I am profoundly worried that the only thing that’s going to matter with respect to these mergers is not the law, but money.”He emphasized the importance of state legislation, and ended his remarks with a call for all workers and consumers, regardless of political affiliation, to pay attention to the growing power and influence of billionaires in the US government.“I want to stress an uncomfortable fact, which is the issue of the corrupting influence of money in politics. I don’t think it is limited to one party,” he said. “This issue of the corrupting influence of billionaires in law enforcement is an issue that affects all of us, regardless of party, regardless of where we live.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJeff BezosAmazonMetaXElon MuskMark ZuckerbergnewsShareReuse this content"

It awarded Energy Transfer at least $660m, according to calculations from Greenpeace.The environmental group, which had expressed concerns before the trial about getting a fair hearing in oil and gas country, said that a loss and an enormous financial award could bankrupt their US operation. Energy Transfer sued three Greenpeace entities, claiming that they are a single organization rather than independent members of the Greenpeace network.Greenpeace will appeal the decision, the organization said.The case has been closely watched by the wider non-profit community and first amendment experts amidconcernsover how it could affect activism.“What we saw over these three weeks was Energy Transfer’s blatant disregard for the voices of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. And while they also tried to distort the truth about Greenpeace’s role in the protests, we instead reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to non-violence in every action we take,” said Deepa Padmanabha, Greenpeace’s senior legal adviser.“We should all be concerned about the future of the first amendment, and lawsuits like these aimed at destroying our rights to peaceful protest and free speech. Greenpeace will continue to do its part to fight for the protection of these fundamental rights for everyone,” Padmanabha said.Greenpeace International was one of the three entities sued by Energy Transfer. Its general counsel, Kristin Casper, said the organization’s fight would continue: “Energy Transfer hasn’t heard the last of us in this fight. We’re just getting started with our anti-Slapp [strategic lawsuits against public participation] lawsuit against Energy Transfer’s attacks on free speech and peaceful protest. We will see Energy Transfer in court this July in the Netherlands. We will not back down, we will not be silenced.”Energy Transfer thanked the judge and jury in a statement, saying: “While we are pleased that Greenpeace has been held accountable for their actions against us, this win is really for the people of Mandan and throughout North Dakota who had to live through the daily harassment and disruptions caused by the protesters who were funded and trained by Greenpeace. It is also a win for all law-abiding Americans who understand the difference between the right to free speech and breaking the law. That the disrupters have been held responsible is a win for all of us.”Trey Cox, Energy Transfer’s counsel for the case, said the jury’s verdict was “resounding” and showed Greenpeace’s actions had been unlawful. “It is also a day of celebration for the constitution, the state of North Dakota and Energy Transfer,” he said.During jury selection, potential jurors appeared to largely dislike the protests, and manyhad ties to the fossil fuel industry. In the end, more than half the jurors selected to hear the case had ties to the fossil fuel industry, and most had negative views of anti-pipeline protests or groups that oppose the use of fossil fuels.“Today’s verdict is not a reflection of wrongdoing on Greenpeace’s part, but rather the result of a long list of courtroom tactics and propaganda tricks that Energy Transfer used to deny Greenpeace its right to a fair trial,” said Kirk Herbertson, a New York attorney and the US director for advocacy and campaigns for EarthRights International. “We hope that the North Dakota supreme court will question why this case ever made it to trial in the first place.”Concerns over finding an unbiased jury plagued the case even before it began, given the rightward political leanings of Mandan, North Dakota, and the distaste for the protests among local residents. Mysterious rightwing mailers, made to look like a newspaper called “Central ND News”, that contained articles slanted against the pipeline protest or in favor of Energy Transfer were also sent to residents in recent months, which Greenpeace alleged could taint the jury pool.Greenpeace sought to move the trial to another venue in North Dakota multiple times, but was shot down by the county court and the North Dakota supreme court. The judge, James Gion, who was brought in to preside over the case after all Morton county judges recused themselves, denied requests for livestreaming, which the state supreme court also denied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These cases, even when the entities suing lose, cause significant legal costs for defendants and can have a chilling effect.Most jurors in US pipeline case against Greenpeace have fossil fuel industry tiesRead moreThe five-week trial saw Energy Transfer attempt to tie a host of misdeeds or disruptions caused by the protests to Greenpeace, which has maintained that its involvement was small and at the request of the Standing Rock Tribe.Standing Rockreleased a statementafter the trial began affirming it had led the protests and claiming the tribe had had ongoing issues with getting safety information from Energy Transfer. The pipeline company was “frivolously alleging defamation and seeking money damages, designed to shut down all voice supporting Standing Rock. The case is an attempt to silence our Tribe about the truth of what happened at Standing Rock, and the threat posed by DAPL to our land, our water and our people. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will not be silenced,” the tribal chairperson, Janet Alkire, wrote.In the final days of the case, Kelcy Warren, Energy Transfer’s billionaire founder and a major donor toDonald Trump, said in a video deposition that his company had offered financial incentives – including money, a luxury ranch and a new school – to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to stop the protests, which the tribe declined,according toa group of monitors attending the trial because of concerns over its fairness. Warren said he believed the tribe refused the offer because it was offered more by Earthjustice, which has served as a legal representative of the tribe.The trial-monitoring committee released a statement after the verdict saying that the trial had been “deeply flawed” and denied Greenpeace the ability to present a full defense. The committee monitored every part of the trial and concluded the jury had been biased in favor of Energy Transfer and the judge lacked full legal knowledge of the complex issues at hand.Marty Garbus, a longtime first amendment lawyer who is part of the monitoring group, said: “In my six decades of legal practice, I have never witnessed a trial as unfair as the one against Greenpeace that just ended in the courts of North Dakota … Greenpeace has a very strong case on appeal. I believe there is a good chance it ultimately will win both in court and in the court of public opinion.”The trial came after Energy Transfer first filed a Rico lawsuit in federal court in 2017. The federal racketeering case was dismissed on 14 February 2019, but seven days later Energy Transfer refiled a virtually identical suit in North Dakota state court.Explore more on these topicsGreenpeaceDemocracy and justiceNorth DakotaFossil fuelsEnvironmental activismOil (Business)Oil and gas companiesOil (Environment)newsShareReuse this content"

The 10 campuses have a total of nearly 300,000 students enrolled, more than 25,000 faculty members and 173,000 staff members.Some of the proposed policy changes and executive orders issued byDonald Trumpsince he returned to office in January “threaten funding for lifesaving research, patient care and education support”, Drake wrote.Trump administration pauses $175m in funds to UPenn over trans athlete policyRead moreIn addition, the 2025-26 California state budget calls for a substantial cut to the university’s budget, Drake said.“These actions affect colleges and universities across the country,” Drake said. “As one of the most innovative, research-focused public institutions in the nation, these proposed changes would have a particularly profound impact on the University of California.”The university isalready fighting alongsideDemocratic state attorneys general, who have sued over the Trump administration’sproposed sweeping cuts to medical researchfunded through the National Institutes of Health.The University of California hiring freezes are likely to havebig ripple effects, the Los Angeles Times reported, noting that there are thousands of current openings across the University of California’s many campuses, including “more than 1,000 heath-related positions in nursing, medical research and clinical, and nonclinical roles” in Los Angeles alone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johns Hopkins University announced last week that it would cut more than 2,000 jobs after the Trump administration terminated $800m in grants at the institution.The funding cuts come as universities also anticipate a return of a travel ban that will affect international students and staff, and a new high-profile threat: thesudden deportationsofstudentsandstaff members.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS universitiesTrump administrationUS politicsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Male prisoners repeatedly propositioned them for sex and male officers subjected them to strip searches without female officers present, they said.“The fact that they have already been transferred and, allegedly, have been abused at their new facilities can only strengthen their claims of irreparable harm,” Lamberth wrote. A Bureau of Prisons spokesperson declined to comment.The preliminary injunction is the latest in a series of rulings thwarting the agency’s efforts to comply with the executive order, whichcalls forhousing transgender women in men’s prisons, and for halting gender-affirming medical care.Lamberth, who was appointed by the Republican president Ronald Reagan, previously blocked the bureau from transferring a dozen other transgender women prisoners to men’s prisons.In a ruling last month, he ordered that their “housing status and medical care” remain as they had been prior toinauguration day, when Trump signed the executive order. Separately, in January, a federal judge in Boston halted the transfer of anothertransgenderwoman to a men’s prison.At the time, Rachel and Ellen Doe were not plaintiffs in any lawsuit challenging Trump’s executive order and were not covered by Lamberth’s initial rulings.In a court filing last month, aTrump administrationofficial said that as of 20 February, there were 22 trans women housed in federal women’s facilities. That’s about 1% of the nearly 2,200 transgender prisoners the agency said it had in its custody.With Lamberth’s order on Wednesday, at least 15 people are now covered by orders blocking or reversing the moves.Trump administration pauses $175m in funds to UPenn over trans athlete policyRead moreLamberth has yet to rule in a lawsuit filed last week by three other prisoners – a trans woman housed in a men’s prison and two trans men housed in women’s prisons. They are challenging the executive order’s ban on gender-affirming hormone therapy and other care.Meanwhile, Maine’s education office is being ordered to ban transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports or face federal prosecution, an escalation in Trump’s threats to pull federal money from states and schools over transgender athletes.The US education department on Wednesday said an investigation had concluded that Maine’s education office violated the Title IX anti-discrimination law by allowing trans girls to compete on girls’ sports teams and use girls’ facilities. It’s giving Maine 10 days to comply with a list of demands or face justice department prosecution.The federal investigation into Maine’s department of education was opened on 21 February, just hours after Trump and the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, clashed over the issue at a meeting of governors at the White House. During the heated exchange, Mills told Trump: “We’ll see you in court.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsUS prisonsDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials also revised down their projections for GDP growth in 2026 and 2027, to 1.8%.Uncertainty is “remarkably high”, the Fed chair,Jerome Powell, cautioned, as the Trump administration attempts to engineer radical economic change. “I don’t know anyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast.”Some of the increase in the Fed’s inflation expectations was “clearly” due to tariffs, Powell said.Fed officials maintained the benchmark interest from 4.25% to 4.5% following their latest two-day policy meeting. A closely watched “dot plot”, which shows policymakers’ predictions for the trajectory of rates, indicated that they might cut them twice over the course of this year.The Bank of England is also expected on Thursday to announce that it will keep UK rates on hold at 4.5%.Trump, who returned to the White House in January after promising to rapidly bring down prices for millions of Americans, has roiled businesses and investors in the US and across the world with the erratic rollout of an aggressive tariff strategy.Many economists warn the Trump administration’s plans to impose or increase US tariffs on goods from overseas risk raising prices further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Based on Apple’s 2024 revenue of $391bn (£301bn), the maximum fine would be nearly $80bn.Google’s parent to buy cybersecurity group Wiz in its biggest ever dealRead moreThe commission said it had taken a “preliminary view” that Google’s search engine prioritises results pointing to Alphabet’s own services over those of rivals, breaching the requirement to treat third-party services in a “transparent, fair and non-discriminatory” way.It also said that Google Play, the company’s app store, prevents developers from steering consumers towards other channels where better offers might be available.The commission told Apple it must make its operating systems available to devices made by competitors, such as smartphones and wireless headphones, or else face the prospect of investigations and fines.The order is designed to promote competition by making it possible for makers of rival technology to connect with Apple’s devices, such as iPads and iPhones.The EU issued a second order against Apple, laying out a detailed timeline and methodology for how Apple should respond to requests from app developers to open up its systems.A spokesperson for Apple said: “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules.”The company added: “It’s bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.”Google’s senior director for competition, Oliver Bethell, wrote in a blogpost: “The commission’s findings require us to make even more changes to how we show certain types of search results, which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US vice-president, JD Vance, meanwhile, has railed against excessive AI regulation in a rebuke aimed at the EU’s sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act.The US has also pushed back against Britain’s plans for a digital services tax, amid regular attacks by Elon Musk, the owner of X, on the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. Vance has also attacked the UK’s Online Safety Act, claiming last month that free speech in the UK was “in retreat”. However, the UK government is adamant that the act will not be a bargaining chip in any negotiations between the Trump administration and Britain over tariffs.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorAppleGoogleiPadiPhoneEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Multiple pages were removed from the ADA’s archive website, including onepagethat explained how retail businesses are required to have accessible features andanotheron customer service practices for hotel and lodging guests with disabilities.In awebpagetitled “Covid-19 and the Americans with Disabilities Act”, the justice department removed five out of seven questions that were listed on the page as recently as recently as early March.The removed guidances include questions about whether the justice department issues exemptions for mask requirements and resources to help explain an employee with a disability’s rights to an employer during the Covid-19 pandemic.In apress release, the justice department called the guidance “unnecessary and outdated”.“Avoiding confusion and reducing the time spent understanding compliance may allow businesses to deliver price relief to consumers,” the press release said.The justice department said it will highlight tax incentives that will help businesses cover the costs of making accessibility improvements for customers and employees.The department referred to a 20 Januaryexecutive orderas the reason why it was removing the ADA guidelines.In the executive order,Donald Trumppointedvaguely at government regulation as the reason behind inflation. The White House said the Biden administration “made necessary goods and services scarce through a crushing regulatory burden and radical policies designed to weaken American production”.“Unprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden administration is estimated to have imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American household,” the White House claimed in the executive order.At the time, the order did not specify what regulations theTrump administrationwould remove but directed agencies to evaluate business regulations.“Putting money back into the pockets of business owners helps everyone by allowing those businesses to pass on cost savings to consumers and bolster the economy,” said the acting US assistant attorney general Mac Warner in a statement.This isn’t the first time Republicans have tried to curb the ADA for the sake of making it easier on businesses. In 2017, Republicans in Congress introduced abillthat would have made it harder for Americans with disabilities to bring lawsuits against businesses and employers.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

So why is Trump cutting funding?Read moreAnother court order last month shut out borrowers of student loans from participating in four income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which tie income to student loan payments, designed to keep payments affordable and avoid defaults on loans.“By effectively freezing the nation’s student loan system, the new administration seems intent on making life harder for working people, including for millions of borrowers who have taken on student debt so they can go to college,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT. “The former president tried to fix the system for 45 million Americans, but the new president is breaking it again.”More than 12 million student loan borrowers rely on income driven repayment plans andmore than 1 million borrowerswere waiting on their applications to be processed at the time when the stop work order was issued.The lawsuit says the Department of Education has not indicated when, or if ever, the suspended programs will be revived.AFT “brings this lawsuit to compel the Department to abide by Congress’s command and provide borrowers with the ability to re-pay their loans through the affordable, income-driven repayment plans to which they are entitled,” says thecomplaint.The education department hasciteda court ruling over an income driven repayment plan introduced under Joe Biden, the Saving on a Valuable Education (Save) plan, in their decision to stop all IDR applications and processing.In aletterearlier this month to the agency, 25 US senators noted that while the ruling focused on a single IDR plan, “the Department inexplicably and confusingly chose to also suspend access to every other IDR plan”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS educationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The following summer he rebranded the platform as X.Since taking over, Musk has loosened the site’s moderation policies, which prompted many advertisers to pause or leave. Musk subsequently said advertisers were trying to “blackmail” him with boycotts and hit out in a profanity-laced outburst in a session at the New York Times DealBook Summit in November 2023.X subsequentlysued a global advertising alliance and several big companies, including Unilever, Mars and CVS Health, accusing them of unlawfully conspiring to shun the social network and intentionally causing it to lose revenue.“We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war,” Musk tweeted after the launch of the legal action.The new $44bn valuation represents a remarkable turnaround for the platform and its investors, which include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, 8VC, Goanna Capital and Fidelity Investments. The secondary deal will set a price for the primary fund raise of $2bn.Institutions that provided loans to help fund Musk’s X takeover also received a boost after Musk gave a 25% stake in his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI, to them early last year.Since then, xAI has obtained a valuation of $45bn, providing new security to lenders, which has also boosted the updated valuation of X.Revenues at the social media platform have fallen since Musk’s takeover but it posted adjusted profits of $1.2bn last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, that was down more than a third from €589m the year before.Frank-Steffen Walliser, Bentley’s chief executive since July, said it had been a “positive year despite the headwinds”, but added that the threat of tariffs from Donald Trump was hanging over the manufacturer. The US president last month said thattariffs of up to 25% on carswill force manufacturers to shift production to America.That is unlikely in the case of luxury brands like Bentley, whose cachet depends in part on continuous production at its factory in Crewe, Cheshire. That means that price increases can be easier to impose on customers without hurting sales.“We are assessing different scenarios on how to handle it, but it would eventually be passed on to consumers,” Walliser told reporters.Volkswagen’s premium Audi brand said on Tuesday it was considering “the extent to which we will have to pass on at least some of the tariffs to our customers in the form of price increases”, and seeking a “sweet spot” between price increases and adjusting production, Reuters reported.“The market challenges definitely remain,” Bentley’s Walliser said. “We have a very volatile political situation.”Bentley made revenues of €2.6bn in 2024, but declined to share the number of cars sold. It delivered 13,560 cars in 2023.Executives claimed the company is shifting focus to “value over volume”, targeting higher revenues from every car sold. About 70% of all buyers pay for lucrative bespoke content, including one buyer in 2024 who requested 3D-printed rose gold details inside a car.However, Walliser did say the main reason for falling profits in 2024 was weakness in demand for cars in China.A slowdown in consumptionin the world’s second-largest economy has weighed on sales of luxury goods.Bentley finance boss Jan-Henrik Lafrentz said he hoped Chinese demand “will hopefully level out this year”.An improvement in the Chinese market could help Bentley and other carmakers to invest in the shift to electric vehicles. Bentley has delayed a planned electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) to 2026, with the first deliveries only in 2027 amid anadjustment across the car industry to lower-than-expected demandfor electric cars.Bentley in November said it willdelay the end of sale of petrol cars to 2035, five years later than initially planned. Walliser said previous plans for electric cars were potentially “a little bit too bullish”.However, Lafrentz said Bentley expected its electric cars to be as profitable as its petrol and new hybrid models. “That’s a clear target,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

CouldSebastian Coereally pull it out of the fire again? At the Moscow and Los Angeles Olympics he bounced back from defeat in the 800m to take 1500m gold. Then, against the odds in Singapore in 2005, he brought the 2012 Games to London ahead of Paris and Madrid.And now, in the final hours before Thursday’s vote for the nextInternational Olympic Committeepresident, he was busy pressing flesh and securing promises in the hope of a fourth Olympic win.Coe feels ‘momentum’ but IOC presidential race remains on knife-edgeRead moreHis supporters believe he can find a narrow path to victory. He has form, after all. In 2005 London won after a maximum four rounds of incredibly tense voting, beating Paris by 54 votes to 50. Yet amid the rumours, smears, and intrigue here in Greece, others pointed to a different campaign as a cautionary tale:England’s bid for the 2018 World Cup.The night before that vote, one British journalist said of the Russian bid “they’ve thrown in the towel!” when he heard that Vladimir Putin wasn’t turning up. The next day proved a sharp and painful rejoinder. As things stand, most IOC watchers make Juan Antonio Samaranch the favourite. But no one is counting out Kirsty Coventry, who is bidding to become the first woman to lead the IOC. Or indeed Lord Coe. But the fact it is a secret ballot only adds more uncertainty and intrigue.On the surface, everything appears cordial. The vote is being staged at the same five-star hotel where Christopher Nolan, Matt Damon and Anne Hathaway are staying while filming a version of Homer’s Odyssey. The resort has 131 infinity pools, six waterslides and a golf course designed by Bernhard Langer.Behind the scenes, however, two candidates have been subject to an internet smear campaign with scurrilous and baseless rumours about their characters, while there is increasing disquiet that the outgoing president Thomas Bach is pushing Coventry, even though it would seem to breach the political neutrality the Olympic movement holds dear. No wonder comparisons are frequently made with a papal conclave.Finding signal amid the noise is tricky given most voters are resolutely tight-lipped. At one point, the man from the BBC asked Princess Anne for her thoughts as she walked through the hotel. “No,” came the curt reply. Britain’s other IOC representative Hugh Robertson, who was walking with the Princess Royal, smiled at the exchange. “Nice try,” he said. Shortly afterwards Prince Albert of Monaco walked through, smiling but keeping his cards close to his chest too.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe and the culture secretary Tessa Jowell at London 2012’s Olympic bid launch.Photograph: Kieran Doherty/ReutersIt means that not even Samaranch can be sure he will be smiling when the vote takes place at 2pm. As he sagely put it: “Everybody has the right to keep his vote confidential, and it’s very easy in this world – and when it is so close – to confuse a smile for a vote, a friendship for a vote, a nice word for a vote. So all candidates have to be very careful in making that translation.”What makes the election even harder to predict is that the IOC is one of the world’s most exclusive private members’ clubs, with just 109 individuals and its own set of dynamics. To win, Coe will have to build a coalition from a combination of former athletes, politicians, royals, billionaires, and even an Oscar-winning actress, Michelle Yeoh – while Bach tries everything in his power to stop him winning.Coe’s task is made even harder by the fact he clearly upset some members – including Bach – with World Athletics’ decision to ban Russia from the Rio Games, while awarding£50,000 in prize moneyto every Olympic track and field gold medallist in Paris was far from universally welcomed either, especially as he didn’t tell other sports in advance.However no one in the field has a better CV than Coe. Not only is he a double Olympic champion, who ran the London 2012 Games and then became the president of World Athletics, he is a political heavyweight used to meeting senior leaders. In a discordant and uncertain world, where sport is increasingly weaponised and no one can be sure what the presidents Trump, Putin and Xi will do next, that is undoubtedly an asset.Samaranch, however, has an even greater advantage given he is the son of the former IOC president Juan Samaranch who ran the organisation for 21 years. Samaranch Jr might reject the idea that he is a nepo baby, but undoubtedly he has access to networks and loyalties, including with China, that other candidates do not have.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe (left) among the England delegation in Zurich in 2010 when Fifa announced Russia would host the 2018 World Cup.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PACoventry, who won two swimming gold medals for Zimbabwe before becoming her country’s sports minister, cannot be ruled out – even if there is some disquiet over her role in a government that Amnesty International says has imposed “wide-scale repression of dissent, including arbitrary detention and prosecution” and where “plainclothes state agents abducted political activists, tortured them, and killed one man”.So how might the vote go? Coventry’s hope is that Bach’s patronage allows her to win by a first- or second-round knockout by securing a majority of votes. While that isn’t completely out of the question, most onlookers believe it is unlikely and the vote will continue into the latter rounds.The Japanese candidate Morinari Watanabe, president of the International Federation of Gymnastics, is expected to go first, followed by the Swedish‑British businessman Johan Eliasch. The French head of the UCI, David Lappartient, is forecast to be next.Then it gets messy. Coe’s team, however, still believe that if they make the final two they can win. But soon they, and the other six candidates vying for the most powerful job in global sport, will face a moment of truth.How the seven candidates compareSebastian Coe, Great BritainThe double Olympic 1,500m champion, former head of London 2012, and current president of World Athletics is widely regarded as having the most complete CV in the field. The 68-year-old is running as the change candidate after the authoritarian reign of Thomas Bach and has promised IOC members more involvement in debates and decisions. Other planks of Coe’s manifesto include protecting women’s sports and pushing more for smaller sports. Has a chance. But he also knows that Bach is doing everything in his power to stop him.Kirsty Coventry, ZimbabweThe 41-year-old is bidding to become the first woman and African to lead the IOC in its 131-year history and, crucially, has Bach’s backing. Whether that will be enough is unclear, but it gives her a shot even though her manifesto was widely regarded as uninspiring and her policies are essentially continuity Bach. However she has grown on the campaign trail and will have the support of many of the athletes among the IOC membership.Johan Eliasch, Great BritainNo one expects the Swedish-born, British citizen president of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation to win. However the billionaire and former chief executive of Head has made his voice heard by insisting that sport has to do more to respond to climate change. His proposals include rotating the Winter Games among a group of permanent venues and ensuring that “only those who were born female can compete in women’s sport.”Prince Faisal al Hussein, JordanPrince Faisal, the younger brother of Jordan’s King Abdullah II, has enjoyed a well-run campaign in which he has stressed that sport can be a tool for peace between east and west, and called for better safeguarding. “I grew up in a family that knows all about service,” said Faisal, who previously served in the military. He is also a big fan of the computer game World of Warships. His candidacy is likely to be sunk by the fourth round of voting.David Lappartient, FranceThe 51-year-old has been president of the International Cycling Union since 2017. After overseeing a deal with Saudi Arabia for staging an Esport Olympics, with Bach’s blessing, his star was seen in the ascendancy. However the IOC president has instead chosen to throw his support behind Coventry in this election and as a result the Frenchman will struggle to get out of the early rounds.Juan Antonio Samaranch, SpainThe 65-year-old joined the IOC at the same 2001 meeting in Moscow where his father stood down after 21 years as president. He is well connected and has links with Russia, where his father was an ambassador, and China, where there is a Samaranch museum. A former banker, Samaranch is well-regarded and charming. His manifesto talks about protecting women athletes and giving members more of a voice – but, his critics argue, why didn’t he raise these issues before?Morinari Watanabe, JapanThe well-liked head of international gymnastics has no chance in the race. However he did come up with the most-talked about proposal of the seven candidates: staging the Olympics in five continents at the same time on a rolling 24-hour sports channel. Watanabe argues that such a proposal will add more sports and allow more and smaller cities to be Olympic hosts while meeting sustainability targets.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeSebastian CoeSport politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hebroke Major League Baseball’s color barrierin 1947 when he suited up for the Brooklyn Dodgers; he went on to be elected to his sport’s Hall of Fame. Robinson also served in the US Army during the second world war. However, on Tuesday nightESPN’S Jeff Passan noteda page detailing Robinson’s army career had been taken down and “dei” added to the URL.On Wednesday,the page had been restored. Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot said that “everyone at the Defense Department loves Jackie Robinson”. He added that the defense department regularly checks for material than may have been removed in error.Pentagon restores webpage for Black Medal of Honor winner but defends DEI purgeRead moreThe initial removal was in step with similar decisions in recent weeks as the Pentagon works on the removal of any webpage it considers to be representative of DEI programs. The Trump administrationhas made its distaste for DEI clearand has rolled back many DEI programs across the federal government. One Trump executive order sought to end all “mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities in the federal government” related to “illegal DEI and ‘diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility’ (DEIA) programs”.Other pages to have been removedinclude one focusing on Ira Hayes, a Native American who was one of the marines pictured raising the American flag at Iwo Jima during the second world war. Articles about the Native American code talkers alsoappeared to have been removedfrom military websites.Defense department spokesperson Sean Parnell has defended the removals. “I think the president and the secretary have been very clear on this – that anybody that says in the Department of Defense that diversity is our strength is, is frankly, incorrect,” Parnell said.Robinson had a striking military career. After a successful battle to train as an officer, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1943 and assigned to a tank regiment. However, in 1944 the driver of an army bus ordered Robinson to sit at the back, a directive Robinson refused. Robinson was court martialed and acquitted, then served as an athletics coach before being honorably discharged in November 1944.The removal of Robinson’s page seems to be at odds with comments by Trump himself, who last month said Robinson’s statue would be added to a garden of national heroes. Trump said at the time that Robinson was one of a number of “Black legends, champions, warriors and patriots who helped drive our country forward to greatness.”Explore more on these topicsBaseballMLBUS militaryTrump administrationUS sportsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

For another, he could be at Duke for a while yet: a scary injury is no longer a spur for talented college players to turn professional and make money while they still can. That all changed in July 2021, when the NCAAallowed college athletes to profitfrom their name, image and likeness (NIL), and make money while they’re still students. By letting go of one of its foundational tenets (the notion that “amateurs” should not be paid), the NCAA now has its member schools scrambling to build sponsorship war chests to lure top talent. The athletes, for so long the biggest losers in the NCAA’s billion-dollar amateur system, are finally making gains, meaning they are less inclined to turn professional as soon as possible.Perhaps no college basketball player has benefited from the system more than the 18-year-old Flagg, who scored endorsement deals with New Balance and Gatoradebeforeputting on a Duke uniform. Altogether, his $4.8m NIL valuation trails only University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning’s $6.5m portfolio.It’s why so many people are all relaying the same message to Flagg, who projects as the top pick in this year’s NBA draft: pro ball can definitely wait. “I mean, if I’m the NCAA or the ACC, I’m figuring out an NIL deal to keep that dude in school, because he is everything that’s right about our game,” Illinois coach Brad Underwood said after a blowout loss to Flagg’s team in February.Quentin Richardson, a 13-year NBA veteran turned ESPN analyst, considered the Duke star’s dismal prospects if he does go pro this year. “If I’m Cooper Flagg, I’m not sure I want to go to the Washington Wizards,” he said. “That’s what’s waiting on him, and that’s purgatory.” As much as top college prospects accept the very likely possibility of being drafted by a bad NBA team, the new NIL system gives them the power to stay in school if an exceptionally terrible team looks likely to get the No 1 pick – and the lottery-leading Wizards, who have only made the playoffs once in the last six years, would certainly qualify.And Flagg has admitted he has considered the idea of staying in school for another year. “I still feel like a kid, this is the only way I’ve ever known college,” Flagg said. “I really wouldn’t know how kids felt before.”Whoever winds up this year’s No 1 pick is projected to make $12m as a rookie. That’s around $7m more than Flagg would make if he stays at Duke but, as ridiculous as it may sound, that’s not a huge amount for someone who is likely to make hundreds of millions of dollars in the NBA if he fulfills his vast potential. Rutgers swingman Ace Bailey – who scored a Nike brand deal as a high school senior – is another talented prospect who does not appear to be in a rush to turn pro. And an extra year in college will allow them to get stronger and develop their skills before being thrown into a league with some of the best athletes in the world.Not that staying in school guarantees success. Kyle Filipowski, who preceded Flagg at Duke, successfully leveraged his popularity with Blue Devils fans into NIL deals with Dunkin’ Donuts and T-Mobile. The six-figure deals may not have been life-changing for Filipowski, but they did give him that extra bit of breathing room to consider the finality of leaving school afterhisfreshman year. Though Filipowski projected as a first-round selection, he returned to Duke for his sophomore season before the Utah Jazz drafted him in the second round. He has spent a good chunk of this season going back and forth between G-League assignments. His move from college standout to borderline NBA player just goes to show how tough the transition to pros can be, even for college standouts. Zion Williamson was evenmorehyped than Flagg during his own time at Duke, but has often struggled with injury and form since he was drafted No 1 overall in 2019.The game has also changed for those are unlikely to ever become stars. Players farther down the college bench at top schools reportedly make a minimum five figures from local deals, school merchandise, camps and clinics, and social media partnerships. For the first time in college basketball history, players who either don’t have major money-making opportunities waiting for them in pro basketball as future pros or don’t figure to keep playing after college can finally explore their athletic earning potential while it’s peaking. But the NIL revolution wouldn’t have been possible without college basketball players leading the way.The paradigm shift started with Ed O’Bannon, a former March Madness hero at UCLA, leveling a class-action antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA for using his likeness as well as those of other former players for a video game in 2008. In his lawsuit, O’Bannon argued that the student-athletes should be eligible for compensation in exchange for commercial use of their image. At the time it seemed as if the lawsuit would linger in the system for years without a clear resolution. But when a judge ruled for O’Bannon et al in 2014, it was only a matter of time before the amateur era of college sports was brought to a resounding end.But that doesn’t mean the litigation is over. Far from it. In January, the attorneys general of Tennessee and Virginia filed a federal lawsuit in response to a potential NIL recruiting violation involving University of Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava – a top recruit at the center of a multi-million dollar NIL market. This month, the states announced a proposed settlement that would allow recruits to negotiate their own NIL dealsbeforethey enroll in school. (Under the current setup, a high school athlete either drafts a qualified third party to negotiate on their behalf, as Flagg did with the powerful Hollywood agency CAA, or the schools dictate termsaftersecuring the player’s commitment.) If the settlement is approved, the NCAA will stop penalizing schools that use NIL as a recruiting inducement. Next month could see the settlement of another major case, House vs NCAA, that would pave the way for schools to begin directly paying players rather than through endorsements.The defeats in the court of law ultimately serve college basketball over the long term. With more incentives to stay in school than ever, players get to build their brands in relative comfort while the NCAA leverages the name recognition for TV ratings and ticket sales. It means even the NCAA isn’t starting from scratch again if Flagg doesn’t play again this year. And it means Flagg has time to enjoy everything the college experience has to offer. “Go have fun,” Underwood suggested. “Chase a girl. I get the whole [NBA draft] thing. That’s slotted, he’s going to make what he is.”Of course, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Flagg stuck with the plan to turn pro after this season. It’s just a relief that he and his peers finally have the freedom to explore their options.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballNCAA TournamentCollege sportsBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

French sports media address the theme on a regular basis and with good reason: the country’s football managers are no longer wanted abroad. The days when Arsène Wenger and Gérard Houllier opened the door for Jean Tigana, Rémi Garde, Claude Puel and others to coach in England are long gone. In the 2000s and 2010s, French managers could also find work in La Liga and Serie A, as Philippe Montanier did at Real Sociedad and Rudi Garcia at Roma and Napoli – leaving aside Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps, who could not be really considered expatriates at Real Madrid and Juventus.This is no longer the case and takes particular significance now that Deschamps, whose France side face Croatia in aNations Leaguequarter-final on Thursday and Sunday, has entered the final straight of his 14-year association withLes Bleusand confirmed he will leave his position at the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup. Who could succeed him?PSG remain unbeaten in Ligue 1 but the chasing pack are improvingRead moreOf the 78 managerial positions available in the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and the Bundesliga, one is occupied by a Frenchman: Patrick Vieira, the former head coach of New York City and Crystal Palace, who took over from Alberto Gilardino at Genoa last November, and appears to have saved Italy’s oldest club from relegation.Further down the English pyramid, Régis Le Bris is doing well at Sunderland and last month Valérien Ismaël made Blackburn his fourth English club after Barnsley, West Brom and Watford. That is all, unless Columbus Crew’s Wilfried Nancy and managers who have accepted lucrative assignments in the Middle East – Laurent Blanc at Al-Ittihad, Christophe Galtier at Al-Duhail, Sabri Lamouchi at Al-Riyadh – are taken into account. Given France’s reputation for the quality of its coaching of young talent and its status as a football power, it is a pitiful return.Deschamps volunteered an explanation for this. According to him, French managers suffer from a “language handicap”. He said: “We’re not good enough in this respect. A foreign manager working in France might not speak French; we’ll accept it. But go to Italy, England or Spain, if you don’t speak the country’s language, you won’t even be considered.”View image in fullscreenGenoa’s Patrick Vieira is the only French manager in Serie A, the Premier League, La Liga or the Bundesliga.Photograph: EPAAs anyone who had to sit through a Jacques Santini press conference when he briefly was in charge of Spurs will attest, Deschamps has a point, and the fact that Vieira and Ismaël are trilingual and Le Bris should not be ashamed of his English, reinforces it. Once the fashion for hiring compatriots of Wenger and Aimé Jacquet receded, there was not much to fall back on for French managers who, when they went abroad, tended to land jobs in French-speaking countries, especially in Africa, where Robert Nouzaret, Claude Le Roy, Alain Giresse and Patrice Neveu coached 13 national teams between themselves from the 1980s onwards.This is also becoming a thing of the past. There used to be at least a dozen French managers in charge of national teams at any given time. There are seven since Garcia’s surprise appointment by Belgium in January. Willy Sagnol and Hervé Renard (once of Cambridge and Zambia) are still in charge of Georgia and Saudi Arabia respectively. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, South Sudan and Haiti also have French coaches. There, too, French influence is waning.Quick GuideFrance's coaching shortageShowOf the 78 managerial positionsavailable in the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and the Bundesliga, only one is occupied by a Frenchman (Patrick Vieira at Genoa):21Spain17Italy13Germany5Portugal3Denmark, Austria2England, Netherlands, Croatia, Argentina1France, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, Romania, ChileAmong the top 10 countries in the Uefa rankings, France is above only England in the table of homegrown coaches active in their top division:1) England2 (of 20)2) Italy15 (of 20)3) Spain15 (of 20)4) Germany10 (of 18)5) France8 (of 18)6) Netherlands14 (of 18)7) Portugal14 (of 18)8) Belgium9 (of 16)9) Czech Rep13 (of 16)10) Turkey13 (of 19)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The situation is even more concerning in the domestic game. There are not that many Italians working abroad in leading jobs, pace Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid, Enzo Maresca at Chelsea and Roberto De Zerbi at Marseille; but nobody thinks less of the quality of Italian managers for that and Coverciano’sUniversità del calciohas lost none of its cachet.Italian coaches have a ready market on their doorstep: all the clubs in Serie A’s top eight have domestic managers. By contrast, in 2024-25, for the first time, less than half of Ligue 1’s managers – eight of 18 (44.4%) – are French, when 80% of Serie A’s coaches are Italian. None of the head coaches of Ligue 1’s top three – Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille and Monaco – is French.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2012-13, when Ancelotti took PSG to their first championship title of the Qatari era, he was the only foreigner in charge of a Ligue 1 club. Two years ago, that number was 14. Among the top 10 countries in the Uefa rankings, France is above only England in the table of homegrown coaches active in their top division. The Netherlands and Portugal, whose best managers are invariably snapped up by wealthier foreign leagues, are joint-top, with 77%.This is proof it is possible to nurture coaching talent at home and export it without fear of drying up the well – and even suggests it could be a winning recipe for a thriving managerial culture. The same goes for Spain, where 75% of elite clubs are led by Spaniards and has coaches working at the very top of Ligue 1, Serie A, the Bundesliga and the Premier League. France has not and the few managers it still has are not getting any younger.Eric Roy and Bruno Génésio, who did wonders in this season’s Champions League with Brest and Lille respectively, are 57 and 58. The average age of Ligue 1 managers is 55 years and nine months. Deschamps is 56. Zidane, 52, will be a shoo-in to replace him should he wish to step in, which is not guaranteed. Other than that? Thierry Henry, 47, failed with Monaco and did not convince at Montréal, buttook France to an Olympic final. That is it.Julien Stéphan, 44, the son of Deschamps’s assistant Guy Stéphan, was once considered one of France’s brightest managerial hopes after shining in the first of his two stints at Rennes, but he is looking for a job after being sacked last November. The only club that has considered hiring him since is Iran’s Persepolis.It may be the “language handicap”. It may be, as the former Montpellier manager René Girard suggested, “an absence of networks and decent agents”. Whatever the reason, the glory days are well and truly over.Explore more on these topicsFranceNations LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He missed the entire 2024 season after surgery to repair his torn right meniscus. In McCarthy’s place, Sam Darnold led the Vikings to a 14-3 record in the regular season but the team chose to let him walk in free agency, and he signed with the Seattle Seahawks.The 49ers have been a model of success. So why are they putting on a fire sale?Read moreThe Vikings have their sights on the Super Bowl and clearly decided the 22-year-old McCarthy was a better all-around option than the 41-year-old Rodgers. McCarthy still is on his rookie deal and will earn a base salary of $960,000. Rodgers would have commanded millions, leaving the Vikings fewer options to strengthen their roster.Minnesota have reportedly rejected trade discussions with other teams about McCarthy.Now the attention is on Rodgers to tell the Steelers and the Giants of his plans. One Steelers player, veteran Cameron Heyward, said he’s tired of waiting on Rodgers, a four-timeNFLMost Valuable Player.“Either you want to be a Pittsburgh Steeler or you don’t,” he said Tuesday on his Not Just Football podcast. “It’s that simple. That’s the pitch. If you want me to recruit, that’s the recruiting pitch. Pittsburgh Steelers. If you want to be part of it, so be it. If you don’t, no skin off my back.”Rodgers is coming off a disappointing season in which he led the New York Jets to a 5-12 record as the team’s playoff drought continued. He completed 368 passes for 3,897 yards with 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

The organization that governs most of lower-division soccer in the United States made a splash by announcing its attention to starta new league at the same tier as MLS, and followed that up this week with another bombshell. The league’s board, comprising owners in the two professional men’s circuits (the second-division USL Championship and the third-division USL League One) voted to enact promotion and relegation within the USL ecosystem. If it comes to fruition, it will be the first time promotion and relegation will exist in the modern history of US soccer.USL president Paul McDonough spoke to the Guardian shortly before the league officially announced the vote on Wednesday morning. Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.The USL only just announced a big change a few weeks ago. How did this big of a vote come about just after that?After the division one announcement, we met with the board in Atlanta, and the conversation came back around to promotion and relegation, and there was a strong desire to intensify the conversations. We got to a stage where we had a board call on Monday, and the decision was to go ahead and push forward with voting with both leagues yesterday.What was the language of the vote itself?The vote was to approve the concept of promotion/relegation and the implementation of it, knowing that there’s still a lot of work to do before we implement it. I think you’ve got to take this in steps, and the first step is getting that affirmative vote from the boards. And we got that yesterday. Both votes were complete about four o’clock yesterday afternoon.How does a question as foundational as this go from a conversation to a vote?Each of our teams have two board members – a governor and an alternate governor that participate in board meetings. And we have different committees. We’ve got a sporting committee, a commercial committee, and so on. So a lot of these conversations happen in smaller groups, and then are brought to the board.How USL can rival MLS: quirks, streaming and, yes, promotion and relegationRead moreSo just to be clear, was the vote to officially enact it by “date X,” or was it to continue researching and making progress towards doing it?We’ve adopted promotion/relegation. But we know full well that there’s different things we have to talk about, right? How do we enact it across the three tiers? We’ve got to get division one going. What are the mechanics of the promotion, relegation, up and down? How do we protect teams that get promoted if the expenses are different? So there’s just some of those things that we’re going to run to and do some work on and present that to the board. But yeah, they’ve adopted to move forward with it.Is there a chance that any of these issues become some sort of impassable road block? To pick one at random, let’s say that there turns out to be a major problem in how teams that change divisions are able to adapt to whatever their new level is, and there’s some disagreement about how to address that problem among the teams. Would that cause pro/rel to be shelved?No, I just think we have to do the work to safeguard against some of those things. You don’t just say “all right, we’re going to do it.” There’s a lot of work that goes into it, because it hasn’t been done over here.How did the board land on 2028 as a start date, as has been reported, and is there a chance that that could be adjusted?We have talked about adjusting it to starting in 2027 if division one is going to start in 2028. But that’s something that the board will vote on. You know, some people like that idea, and some people feel as though we shouldn’t enact it until division one starts, so we have the three tiers up and running. So that’s one of those things that we have to do some work and show the pros and the cons of each we bring it back to the board and have a discussion.Who was responsible for drafting the question itself, and how specifically is it worded?There was a resolution that we put together, which is what they were voting on. It’s like “division one has to start,” you know? And we acknowledge that there’s a lot of work to do. We commit to do the work with the owners and answer a lot of the questions like: How many teams up, how many teams down? What does the competition structure look like? It’s just not something where you say “OK, we’re gonna do promotional relegation,” but then you have an unbalanced schedule, and it doesn’t work. So there’s a lot of conversations that have to happen in the coming months.How will this affect the conversations you’re having with potential new ownership groups who are interested in joining the new division one league?Based on my conversations, it helps. I’ve talked to some different investors, and they like the idea of promotion and relegation, because they know that fans want it, it aligns with the global game, and it’s something that could be really intriguing, and it’s different.On that point – it’s true that pro/rel would bring USL in line with most systems around the world, but does it really make the league stronger on its own merits? Yes, England has promotion and relegation, but so does Luxembourg. It’s not necessarily true that having promotion and relegation alone makes you a good league.I think the difference for us is fans: If they’re going to spend money and come to games, they want to see matches that matter, right? And when we looked at our competition calendar, we found that there were just a lot of what we would call dead rubber matches – you play and if you win or you lose, it just doesn’t matter. We consulted with [sports consultancy firm] Twentyfirst Group on this, but the idea is that getting more matches of consequence throughout your calendar gets fans more engaged. The last thing fans want to do is watch a game where the outcome doesn’t really have any bearing or effect on anything. That’s why playoffs are more important, right? There’s more jeopardy. Normally, when you see a team that’s out of the playoffs, they sell off players, or they trade players, and they just start to regroup for next year. Well, now you can’t do that, because even though you’re out of the top eight, you have to fight to stay out of the bottom. And I think that just gets more appealing for fans.It does also very much depend on how many teams you end up relegating, right? Because even in the Premier League, you have this pretty big middle class that is still playing a lot of those dead rubber games you’re talking about.Yeah, but they play for money. Every spot gets you money. We’re not there yet. But that keeps it interesting, that if you’re in spot No 13 in the Premier League, getting up to 11 is significant financially, right? You want to try to find that type of balance.You said that the board and the team owners will be working through all this, but what are your first thoughts on how USL would address a situation where, say, a club gets promoted and doesn’t meet the US Soccer standards for the higher tier, or has an ownership that’s maybe not interested in the team after getting relegated?We have governance where, when this passes as a super majority, even if the team’s against it, they’ve got to go along with it. So that’s what we’ll lean into. And I think everyone will be OK with that. And as far as the pro league standards, we have to have conversations with US Soccer, Concacaf, Fifa, about that. Are we just going to get waivers? You know, we’re not sure, but those are conversations we have to have.Will you or the clubs be releasing any sort of an idea of which team voted for what, or how the votes broke down?No. I’ll tell you we had 42 teams between the leagues, and about 90% wanted the adoption of promotion and relegation. The owners did a good job. We did the work. And it was pretty resounding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But once you call the vote, you’ve got to do it. And in conversations with a couple that didn’t want it, that was their thing: We really want it, but we just like a little more time, because this happened really fast.How modern football’s exploitation model brewed fan resentment | Jonathan WilsonRead moreWould you say that the announcement of the division one league accelerated those discussions, or made it more palatable to some owners?Yeah. I think it helped, yes.Did you or the board speak with players or the player’s union about this?No. We reached out to the union last night to inform them, they’ll be telling their players today. But it’s not one of those things that … you just have to take this in steps. So getting the owners on board and getting the affirmative vote was the first step. Talking to all the different stakeholders is the next step.Was the welfare of players a factor in conversation? This move would certainly affect the leagues and what it’s like to play in them.Yeah, I think so. I think if you’re looking for a place where players can develop, having more games that matter is better for player development. As the league is more relevant and it grows, then that’s better for players. Listen, we’re not anywhere without our owners or our players, right? So, you know, we need them all to have a successful ecosystem.You’ve said, both to me and to a few other places, that the beauty of USL and what separates it fromMLSis that every team can have their own model and sort of go about their business in their own individual way. I think the lack of pro/rel certainly enables teams to be flexible like that to an even greater degree, because they’re not facing relegation if things go really badly. Soon, they could be. Is the freedom to operate still a tenet of USL that you can still sell to people, particularly new division one investors, when teams are feeling the pressure in that way?Yes, and I think 90% of owners feel that way too. I think they can still be individual. And I think by the owners voting in the way that they did shows that they believe that too.Promotion and relegation has been discussed ad nauseam throughout American soccer for years. Is there any part of this topic that you think isn’t being discussed enough?I think the hard part is, everyone compares it to England, and I think that we’re a very young country as far as the sport goes, and we need to build it. You can’t compare where we are to something that’s been around for 100-plus years.I think enacting pro/rel feels very automatic to some. Like, just flip the switch and there it is.Yeah, I don’t think it’s that automatic, right? I think everything you do when you’re building something, you have to build it in steps, and you want to be cautious, and you want to really, really take the time to think about how you implement and build it. And that’s what we’re going to try to do.Explore more on these topicsUSL ChampionshipMLSUS sportsUSAinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He has said he had consensual sex with the woman and is appealing against the verdict, with a hearing scheduled for Friday in the high court in Dublin.McGregor, a former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) champion, used his platform at the White House to hit out at the Irish government over immigration, saying the country was “potentially losing its Irishness” and claiming that some rural towns had been “overrun in one swoop”.Dressed in a green suit on Ireland’s national day, McGregor was invited to speak in the official White House briefing room alongside the president’s press secretary before going on to meet Trump and Elon Musk in the Oval Office along with his partner and children.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Elon Musk pose for a photograph with Conor McGregor and his family on Monday.Photograph: X/@whitehouseMcGregor, 36, has been supported by figures including the self-styled misogynist influencerAndrew Tate and anti-immigration campaigners in Ireland whose reach has been turbocharged by Musk’s retweets.But his claim to speak for the people of Ireland on the issue of immigration has been widely derided and condemned. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said McGregor’s claims were simply “wrong”. The finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, said his “heart fell” when he learned of the meeting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Government data shows that in the last three years, just over 45,000 people have applied for asylum in Ireland, which has a population of about 5.3 million.Some believe the fighter may be positioning himself for a presidential run in Ireland later this year.Explore more on these topicsConor McGregorRape and sexual assaultMMAUFCIrelandDonald TrumpViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

The 25-year-old Algerian boxer,who won goldamid controversy and huge media attention at the Paris Olympics last year, has signalled her intention to repeat the feat in 2028 and hit back after Trumpwrongly claimed she was transgenderin August.In an interviewwith ITV News to be broadcast on Wednesday evening, Khelif said: “I will give you a straightforward answer: the US President issued a decision related to transgender policies in America. I am not transgender. This does not concern me and it does not intimidate me.”Olympic boxing gender row a result of Russian fake news, says IOC chiefRead moreThat came after Khelif interrupted a question about her dream of repeating her triumph, saying: “Second gold medal, of course. In America, Los Angeles.” Khelif’s victory in Paris, along with that ofTaiwan’s Lin Yu Ting, sparked a gender eligibility debate. High-profile figures such as Trump, Elon Musk and JK Rowling weighed in.Khelif, who launched a “cyber-harassment” suit in August thatnamed Musk and Rowling, revealed she was “deeply affected mentally” by the “major media campaign” surrounding her and said her mother was attending hospital almost daily as her family shared the brunt of the attacks.The furore followed an International Olympic Committee (IOC) decision to dismiss the blood tests that had prompted the now discredited International Boxing Association (IBA) todisqualify Khelif and Lin from the world championshipsin 2023.Khelif said: “As we say in Algeria, those who have nothing to hide should have no fear. The truth became clear at the Paris Olympics – the injustice was exposed and, later, the truth was acknowledged by the [IOC] in Paris.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, it’s about making sure we analyse the game right. We watch the game again and analyse the game with the players. I take responsibility for the performance and the result. I’m very hard on myself. My job tomorrow is to make sure we have a positive mindset going into the next two games. We’ve only lost one game in the season, it’s a big one, an important one, but it happens.”What strategy do you use in the second of four chess matches against the same opponent? Ultimately, with Miedema on the pitch, it doesn’t really matter.“I was confident tonight that if she got chances, she’d score,” said Nick Cushing, who was brought back in ahead of this run of four games between the sides following the ­sacking of Gareth Taylor.Cushing enjoyed celebrating with the fans on his first time back at the stadium since 2019. “She’s frustrated because she thinks she should have had a hat-trick.”City had caused Chelsea plenty of problems in their League Cup final defeat against Bompastor’s side at Pride Park, edging possession stats and accruing 36 touches in the opposition’s box to Chelsea’s 15; in Manchester those figures were reversed, Chelsea dominating possession and amassing 24 touches to City’s 14 but it meant little.If the odds were stacked in the unbeaten Chelsea’s favour before kick‑off, they were weighted ­further their way when the team news arrived. Cushing’s side were without the influential striker Khadija Shaw and Aoba Fujino, the scorer of City’s equaliser in their 2-1 defeat against Bompastor’s side in the cup final on Saturday. Meanwhile, the former Arsenal forward Miedema was named on the bench. That was “a bit of a gamble”, said Cushing.For Chelsea, players returned, with Keira Walsh and Aggie Beever-Jones named in the starting XI.City did well to contain Chelsea with their injury-hit squad – Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood long‑term absences. But this was a cagey encounter, Beever-Jones arguably the most dynamic player on the pitch in the first half, making a statement on the right and forming a c­ohesive partnership with the right‑back Lucy Bronze.There will naturally be a drop in intensity from a final over 90 ­minutes to a two-legged tie, but Chelsea’s ­failure to capitalise on a depleted City will be a concern. Bompastor had promised the London team would “attack the game” but they struggled in the final third. Mayra Ramírez, who scored the opener against City on ­Saturday and in the WSL in November, threatened but was profligate in the opening 45 minutes.View image in fullscreenVivianne Miedema (second left) celebrates with her teammates after doubling Manchester City’s lead late on.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAWith neither coach happy, there were changes at the break, Miedema returned to the pitch in place of the City youngster Lily Murphy and Wieke Kaptein replaced the USA plauyer Catarina Macario for the visiting team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe second half was more frene­tic, the opportunity to take a lead to Stamford Bridge next week the carrot. Kerolin, making her Champions League debut, sent in a cross that was narrowly missed by the head of Miedema in the first clear-cut chance after the break and suddenly the momentum was with the home team, the crowd roaring to life.Moments later the ball was in the back of the net. Chelsea cleared a corner only as far as Mary Fowler who pinged the ball back into the box, Laia Aleixandri powered it off the crossbar and Miedema was on hand to turn in. Three minutes later Miedema was testing Hannah Hampton again, her shot kept out by the goalkeeper.Quick GuideBarcelona outclass Wolfsburg with Pajor to foreShowBarcelona took a big step towards a third straight Women's Champions League title by beating Wolfsburg 4-1 away in the first leg of their quarter-final.In the first meeting of the two teams since Barcelona beat Wolfsburg 3-2 in the 2023 Champions League final, Barça  showed how the gap between the two teams has only grown. They dominated throughout and largely shut Wolfsburg's forwards out of the game as Ewa Pajor caused her old team plenty of problems.Barcelona took the lead when Pajor, who joined Barcelona from Wolfsburg last year, pressured defender Caitlin Dijkstra into conceding an own goal as she tried to stop Pajor connecting with Aitana Bonmatí's cross in the 26th minute.Two goals in the space of three minutes early in the second half took the game further away from Wolfsburg as Irene Paredes scored to finish off a short corner routine before Salma Paralluelo made it 3-0 soon after with a deflected shot.Wolfsburg had some hope of a comeback when Janina Minge scored a header from a corner, but Barcelona's 18-year-old substitute Sydney Schertenleib responded with a curled shot that went in off the crossbar.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The palpable tension in the crowd lifted with the goal from the Dutch forward, and the pace came out of the game a little as City stifled Chelsea’s attack over and over. As the clock ticked towards a first defeat under Bompastor, City still looked the more threatening side, every attack dangerous as Chelsea poured forward in search of the leveller.With 10 minutes remaining and Chelsea ­throwing everything at City’s back line, ­Rytting Kaneryd clipped an effort off the crossbar and Ayaka Yamashita smothered the follow-up effort from Hamano in their most potent attack.Miedema pounced again in the 89th minute to extend the lead and put Chelsea under real pressure going into Sunday’s WSL tie against City and the UWCL second leg next week, collecting Kerolin’s ball and rifling it into the bottom corner.Chelsea looked a little shell shocked. How will Bompastor’s side cope following defeat? Their record to this point remains hugely ­impressive, but we will find out amid the most gruelling run of games. Can they turn around the tie? “It will be difficult, but nothing is impossible,” said Bompastor.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueManchester City WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Subway’s commitment is understood to be about supporting the growth of women’s football.In addition, it is understood that there are numerous options being looked at by the WPLL, which will consult clubs, the FA, fans and players on all alternatives under consideration.Chelsea secured their third League Cup title with a 2-1 victory against Manchester City on Saturday.The competition was launched in 2011 alongside the introduction of the WSL, with top‑tier clubs competing in the Women’s Premier League Cup before its launch. In 14 seasons only Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City have won the competition, with the Gunners picking up a record seven titles.The League Cup format has been questioned in recent years. The group stage format, which was introduced in 2016, is widely viewed as complicated, with teams split into regional groups and additional points available should a game end in a draw and go to penalties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was about sticking together and being together as one, and speaking to people. Just talking and being on that same page, that makes a massive difference when you’re playing.“I know that first-hand. Being at the clubs I’ve been at, having the leaders I’ve had in dressing rooms and on the pitch, having that person speaking to you constantly certainly helps me. It helps you get through sticky moments.”Rogers said Tuchel had been “very clear and transparent” in a team meeting on Monday night. “The main thing I took from that was about the love and commitment he wants from us within, how he wants us to be a family, how he wants us to be close and connected,” the Aston Villa forward said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Republic of Ireland midfielder is back with the under-21s, the side he led toa first European title triumphin 2023, before the finals in Slovakia in June.Thomas Tuchel: perfectionist, workaholic, disciplinarian … winnerRead moreCarsley is focused on winning a second successive title but he did not rule out a permanent return to the senior role. “It’s something that I enjoyed doing but ultimately, like I’ve said in the past, you’ve definitely got to earn the right to be in that position and I can only do my best,” he said. “I feel happy and trusted doing what I’m doing so we will see what happens in the future.”Asked whether the experience with the senior side had changed his approach, Carsley said: “No, not really. I tried to be myself, tried to do my best and enjoyed it. I didn’t enjoy it at times, but I enjoyed the majority. It was a great experience and I felt privileged and entrusted to be in that position.”He said he needed to deal better with the media: “I’m aware of that. If I’m going to do better in the future then I need to make sure I’m pushing myself. But I enjoyed it – the three camps were excellent.“To get the last win at Wembley [against Ireland] was a great feeling. It was a bit surreal then following that because I was coming off such a high and then going back to the day job.”Only four players who were part of England’s triumphant squad two years ago remain eligible for the under-21s, with Carsley drawing on a number of the under-19s side who became European champions in 2022, including the Ipswich forward Liam Delap and Bournemouth’s Alex Scott.Carsley’s assistant, Ashley Cole, was inducted into the National Football Museum’s hall of fame on Wednesday and he believes a squad that includes Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri, Harvey Elliott of Liverpool and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are capable of emulating their predecessors.“We’ve told this group they have left a legacy for you and we want to continue that and hopefully do well in the Euros and leave a legacy for the next generation,” Cole said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chelsea are treating the injury with caution and want to ensure they have not missed any hidden damage.Phil Jones: ‘My bread and butter is on the grass. It’s what I really enjoy’Read moreThere is optimism that the second scan is precautionary and will not show that Palmer, who will be key to the Chelsea’s push for Champions League qualification, has done anything serious. The club hope Palmer is not in the same position as Nicolas Jackson, who was ruled out until after the international break when he tweaked a hamstring in February. It had seemed the striker’s complaint was minor only for scans to show otherwise.Hamstring injuries have been an issue for Enzo Maresca’s side this season, particularly in attack. The England winger Noni Madueke and the Spanish striker Marc Guiu have been out since last month. The midfielder Roméo Lavia and the defender Wesley Fofana have just returned from hamstring problems but the teenage attacker Omari Kellyman is out for the season.Maresca has argued his side’s issues in attack are down to injuries. Palmer, Jackson and Madueke have delivered a large proportion of Chelsea’s goals this season and were all unavailable against Arsenal.The positive for Maresca is that Chelsea do not play again until they host Tottenham in the league on 3 April, giving them time to work Palmer back to fitness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The banner read: “Keep woke foreign ideologies out. Defend Europe.”The club praised the passion of their fans in a statement, but said: “It is, however, deeply saddening and frankly embarrassing that the club is now set to face significant sanctions for the actions of a very small minority.“Rangers is a modern, progressive football club, and we are fiercely proud of our diverse playing squads, workforce and support. For the club to be charged with such a matter in 2025 is shameful, and the disdain for those responsible will be shared by the overwhelming majority of our supporters.”Rangers said they were working to identify those responsible and would ensure those people faced consequences. “For the avoidance of doubt, if you do not believe in 2025 that absolutely everyone is welcome to follow Rangers whether at Ibrox or away, then Rangers is not the club for you, and you should disassociate yourself with the club immediately,” the statement said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This [win] puts some petrol in the tank but I need to be realistic and see how my wrist feels tomorrow because it is a grind out here.”The 2022 Wimbledon finalist, who once reached 13 in the ATP Tour rankings, currently sits at 892.

I have listened a lot and I’ve heard about what members are concerned about and what they would like to change.“I believe my manifesto strikes the right balance of building on the last 12 years and change with purpose and care. It’s an election and I’m enjoying the energy.”In recent days Coe has been given the backing ofUsain Bolt, Mo Farahand Jessica Ennis-Hill and on Wednesday evening Manchester United also came out in support, citing his work in helping to drive the Old Trafford regeneration taskforce.“Everyone at Manchester United is backing your campaign to become the next president of the International Olympic Committee,” the United chief executive, Omar Berrada, wrote. “You have demonstrated your impeccable credentials as an unrivalled leader in global sport, and we were fortunate enough to benefit from those priceless skills as you drove forward, and shaped, our ambitious vision for a new stadium and the regeneration of Trafford Park. There is no doubt that if you are elected you will be a most innovative and effective leader of the Olympic Family.”The 41-year-old Coventry sounded optimistic when asked whether it was time for the first women president of the IOC. “Well, I’m biased, so I’m going to say yes,” she said.She refused to be drawn on suggestions that the IOC president, Thomas Bach, had been lobbying for her behind the scenes, much to the consternation of some of the other candidates. Samaranch, whose father ran the IOC from 1982 to 2001, seemed confident as well. “I can promise you that I will be working until the very last second,” he said.“The journey has been an incredible experience for myself, a personal effort that I will always cherish.

I think that’s maybe been missing in the past couple of months. I’m really proud of that. It’s just nice to win in two sets and less than two and a half hours.”Andreeva continues to defy odds of the modern teenage tennis prodigyRead moreAlongside Raducanu’s win came the revelation that she has already parted ways with Vladimir Platenik two weeks into their coaching trial.Raducanu has had to find a new coach since Nick Cavaday departed her team after the Australian Open because of health issues. She had been on a trial run with Platenik since he arrived at Indian Wells in time to watch her first‑round defeat against Moyuka Uchijima.The pair had been working together since her Indian Wells defeat, meaning his absence from her player box on Wednesday came as a surprise. She was instead supported by the LTA coach Colin Beecher and Jane O’Donoghue, a former player and family friend who has helped Raducanu out from time to time over the past three and a half years, alongside her fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura. After the match, a member of Raducanu’s team confirmed they had opted to part ways.Although their agreement was only a trial, Platenik had indicated in an interview in his home country with the Slovak newspaper Dennik N that they had planned to trial their partnership until the French Open. Instead, Raducanu will continue her search for a coach.On the court, Raducanu had a kind opening-round draw against a former top-five junior player who is still attempting to make the transition to the professional circuit and who remains quite far from competing regularly at the highest level. Ishii trains at the IMG Academy and received a wildcard in Miami; IMG owns the tournament.Ishii showed early glimpses of her potential, particularly her weighty forehand, lasering flashy winners as she retrieved a break and levelled Raducanu at 2-2. That purple patch did not last very long and her uncompromising aggressive approach led to a stream of unforced errors.To her credit Raducanu laid down a professional, steady performance that made clear the gulf in quality between the two players. All wins are valuable, particularly for a player in poor form. In recent weeks the world No 60 has endured one of the toughest periods of her career in terms of results, losing five of her previous six matches. There have been obvious mitigating circumstances behind her form, particularly herwell-publicised encounters with a stalkerwho followed her from tournament to tournament in Asia throughout February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After an inauspicious start, the association co-founded by Novak Djokovic has spent time building its professional structures, finances and player support while trying to gain influence in the sport. The PTPA functions ostensibly as a players’ union but it is not legally recognised as such, since players are classed as independent contractors rather than employees.As the PTPA’s numerous attempts to gain a seat at tennis’s decision-making table have been rebuffed, often vigorously, by the leading governing bodies – the Association of Tennis Professionals, the Women’s Tennis Association, the International Tennis Federation and the four grand slam tournaments – it became increasingly likely that their acrimonious relations would lead to litigation. The PTPA’s decision to initiate on Tuesday a lawsuit against the ATP, WTA and ITF, while naming the grand slam events as co-conspirators, marks a dramatic intensification of its campaign for players’ rights. It also comes as no great surprise.Players accuse tennis governing bodies of running ‘cartel’ in lawsuitRead moreIn the lawsuit’s 163 pages, the PTPA presents ample valid criticism of the tours. Its points range from the lack of financial transparency from the ATP and WTA alongside the low percentage of revenues received by players, to the exhausting 11‑month season, the frequency of matches that drag on to 3am or later, plus the increasingly unpopular decision to increase ATP Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 events to 12 days.There is also significant weight attached to what the PTPA brands as anti-competitive practices. It argues that the tour structures artificially limit players’ earning potential. In some cases that is fair; the lawsuit cites events at Indian Wells in 2012 when Larry Ellison, the billionaire owner of the tournament, was stopped by the ATP and WTA from significantly increasing prize money. Prize moneyfund limits and annual rises are standardised across tournament categories.Many of its criticisms have focused reasonably on ATP and WTA structures, which present players and tournaments as having an equal vote in the development of the sport. The PTPA, for example, argues that the chair of the ATP board (the ATP chief executive, Andrea Gaudenzi), who usually has the deciding vote, has a financial interest in siding with the tournaments over players. The lawsuit also alleges what amounts to union‑busting behaviour by the ATP in particular which, it is claimed, has aggressively sought to discourage players from officially associating with the PTPA, and even penalised them for doing so.Quick GuideAlcaraz against lawsuitShowCarlos Alcaraz on Wednesday said he does not support the lawsuit filed in the US against groups that run tennis.“There are some things that I agree [with]. There are some other things that I [don’t] agree with,” Alcaraz said about the case by the Professional Tennis Players’ Association, co-founded by Novak Djokovic. “But the main thing here is that I am not supporting that. So that’s it.”Speaking at the Miami Open, the world No 3 added: “It was surprising for me, because nobody told me about it. I just saw it on social media.”Associated PressWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Some of the PTPA’s arguments are less impressive. The lawsuit spends a significant amount of time lamenting the rankings system. There are valid issues surrounding restrictions on players; the problematic WTA scheduling rules were highlighted by a farcical situation last month when Madison Keys was unable to compete in the Austin Open because she entered the top 10 after herAustralian Open triumph. WTA 250 events have limits on the number of top‑10 players they can host.The PTPA also criticises the players’ lack of freedom to compete outside the tour in lucrative unsanctioned exhibitions and the exclusion of those events from receiving ranking points. Aside from the fact that exhibitions benefit only the richest, most famous players, rewarding unregulated, low‑effort, hit-and-giggle invitation events with ranking points would devalue the entire sport. Some of its issues seem to be with the basic organisational structures of a professional sporting league or tour.View image in fullscreenMadison Keys was unable to compete at the Austin Open because of regulations on WTA 250 events hosting a specified number of top 10 players.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPAThroughout the lawsuit, the PTPA argues that the free market should determine player earnings, even stating players should be allowed to accept or display betting sponsorships. While there is a double standard in allowing tournaments to receive them but not athletes, perhaps the scourge of betting advertisements,particularly in tennis, should berestricted for all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its efforts are funded partially by the hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman.The ball is now in the court of the ATP, WTA and ITF, and they must decide whether they will choose to tackle the PTPA in a potentially expensive legal battle. Maybe this suit will bring those governing bodies to the negotiating table after four and a half years of attempting to shut out the PTPA. While tennis may be as fractured as ever, there is certainly never a dull day on tour.Explore more on these topicsTennisSport politicsUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

She left Google in September 2021.Adams said the settlement came after Cantu’s lawyers agreed this month to exclude Black employees from the proposed class action, which Google had sought.Net settlement proceeds total $20.4m, after deducting $7m for legal fees, penalties tied to Cantu’s claim under California’s Private Attorneys General Act, and other costs.Adams scheduled a hearing in September to consider final settlement approval. Cantu’s lawyers did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsGoogleAlphabetnewsShareReuse this content"

The following summer he rebranded the platform as X.Since taking over, Musk has loosened the site’s moderation policies, which prompted many advertisers to pause or leave. Musk subsequently said advertisers were trying to “blackmail” him with boycotts and hit out in a profanity-laced outburst in a session at the New York Times DealBook Summit in November 2023.X subsequentlysued a global advertising alliance and several big companies, including Unilever, Mars and CVS Health, accusing them of unlawfully conspiring to shun the social network and intentionally causing it to lose revenue.“We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war,” Musk tweeted after the launch of the legal action.The new $44bn valuation represents a remarkable turnaround for the platform and its investors, which include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, 8VC, Goanna Capital and Fidelity Investments. The secondary deal will set a price for the primary fund raise of $2bn.Institutions that provided loans to help fund Musk’s X takeover also received a boost after Musk gave a 25% stake in his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI, to them early last year.Since then, xAI has obtained a valuation of $45bn, providing new security to lenders, which has also boosted the updated valuation of X.Revenues at the social media platform have fallen since Musk’s takeover but it posted adjusted profits of $1.2bn last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Amazon’s firstKindlewith a colour screen had been a very long time coming and then suffered a rough landing last year, plagued with yellowing screen issues and shipping delays. But with those problems fixed, is a splash of colour the revolution the Kindle needs?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Amazon isn’t the first to use a colour e-ink screen in an e-reader, but it thinks its upgrades meaningfully improve on the tech used by others such as Boox and Kobo over the past four years by offering greater contrast and speed.Costing £270 (€300/$280) the Kindle Colorsoft towers above the £125 black and white Paperwhite on which it is based, and is more expensive than top colour e-ink rivals. Having phased out theluxury Oasis, the Colorsoft is Amazon’s top 7in model, sitting below the big 10.2inScribetablet.View image in fullscreenRegular text books look great just like a monochrome Kindle but with little colour added here and there.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianDespite the new screen the Colorsoft doesn’t break with the basic Kindle formula. It looks and feels just like the “signature edition” of the Paperwhite with a smooth black plastic back and a matt touchscreen on the front. The power button next to the USB-C port on the bottom edge is the only physical button, meaning all controls, including page turns are touchscreen-only.Black and white books look ever so slightly greyer than the Paperwhite. But otherwise the page turns are fast and text is crisp and easy to read. The front light has 24 levels of brightness with automatic control and it can change the tone of white based on the time of the day. It works very well.The colour screen makes browsing your library or the Kindle store much easier, as book covers are in colour so they are more recognisable at a glance. In-book diagrams, maps or pictures are now in colour and a lot more intelligible. And you can highlight passages in various colours to mark them out for later. The whole screen flashes on page turns when colour images cover more than about one-third of the screen, similar to some of the original black and white e-readers, which you quickly get used to.View image in fullscreenA comic page looks good on the 7in screen, but some text can be a smidgen too small to comfortably read without zooming in.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe matt screen is not as bold or vibrant as a phone or tablet, looking more like newspaper print than a glossy magazine or photo, but with the brightness turned up a bit and the vivid colour mode turned on, the Colorsoft does a decent job of presenting the art of graphic novels.Reading the text in speech bubbles can be tricky because the 7in screen is just too small when displaying a full comic page. The Kindle has apanel view modethat displays a few panels at a time but it is a bit clumsy. I prefer pinching to zoom and pan on the Colorsoft’s touchscreen, which is fast and smooth enough to quickly read sections while still getting an appreciation of the whole page.One of the big advantages of the Kindle is Amazon’s vast ebook store, which is equally large for comics and graphic novels. Amazon boughtgraphic novel specialist Comixology in 2014and has since integrated its library into the Kindle store, including existing purchases.View image in fullscreenZoomed in you can see the fine details in the artwork and easily read the text.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Kindle can be loaded up with ePub or pdf files, allowing you to buy books elsewhere, though only documents sent viaAmazon’s Send to Kindle serviceshowed up in colour on the Colorsoft.One thing that needs improving is library management on the Colorsoft, particularly if you have a lot of comics or books. The Kindle has filters for books and comic strips, but it didn’t recognise any of the graphic novels I own as comics, leaving them all bundled in a mess with regular books and hard to browse. The filters do work on the Kindle app on a tablet, however.SpecificationsScreen:7in colour e-paper (B&W 300ppi; Colour 150ppi)Dimensions:127.6 x 176.7 x 7.8mmWeight:219gWater resistance:IPX8 (2m up to 60 minutes)Connectivity:Wifi 5, BluetoothStorage:32GBBattery life:28 hours of readingView image in fullscreenA full charge of the Colorsoft with a 9W USB-C power adaptor (not included) takes about 2.5 hours. It also supports wireless charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery life is a bit more variable than other Kindles because of the colour screen, but it lasted longer in my testing than Amazon’s estimates. I saw about 45 hours of reading of regular black and white books with about 40% brightness, which reduces to about 32 hours when reading colour graphic novels with the brightness set to about 70%. Standby battery life was very good too, losing less than 1% per day with the power save option enabled.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe smooth plastic back feels nice in the hand, but isn’t any different to much cheaper Kindles.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Colorsoft will receive software and security updates forat least four yearsafter it is last available new from Amazon. The company does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. Access torepair optionsvaries by country. It contains 28% recycled materials including cobalt, magnesium and plastic.Amazon breaks down the Kindle’s environmental impact inits reportand offerstrade-in and recycling schemes.PriceThe Kindle Colorsoft costs£269.99(€299.99/$279.99).For comparison, the Kindle costs£79.99, the Kindle Paperwhite costs£124.99, the Kindle Scribe costs£379.99, the Kobo Libra Colour costs£199.99, the Boox Go Color 7 costs€279.99and theiPadcosts£329.VerdictDespite its troubled start, the Colorsoft proves that colour e-ink can be great. It feels like it will eventually be the norm for e-readers, replacing black and white for books, not just comics and graphic novels.Seeing your covers and in-book pictures in colour immediately lifts the experience without creating a big downside compared with the best monochrome models. Comics also look pretty good and are easier to read outdoors on the Kindle than a tablet. But the 7in screen just isn’t big enough to do justice to graphic novels; for that you would need a colour version of the 10.2in Scribe or an iPad with its much bolder and more saturated display.At the same time the Colorsoft doesn’t feel like a luxury Kindle in the way other high-priced models such as the Oasis managed. Despite its meaty price tag, it feels utilitarian just like a Paperwhite.That leaves the Colorsoft in a hinterland. The colour screen is great, but struggles to justify the extra cost at this size of screen suited most for regular textbooks. Buy it on a deal and you won’t be disappointed. And if you have one already that has a yellow tint at the bottom of the screen, contact Amazon’s support for a replacement.Pros:colour and black and white, in-book images and covers look great, much better for comics, speedy pinch-and-zoom, water resistant, light, good battery life, auto front light, USB-C.Cons:screen flashes on page turns for colour far more than black and white, no page-turn buttons, expensive, 7in screen too small for comics, colours not as vibrant as tablet, locked to Amazon’s ecosystem.View image in fullscreenThe colour screen lifts the Kindle experience without being as distracting as a phone or tablet.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsAmazonKindleE-readersGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It sticks with the same 6.1in OLED screen as its predecessors, which looks good but lacks an always-on mode. It’s also still stuck at a relatively slow 60Hz refresh rate, which can make scrolling and motion more jarring than on models with faster screens.The latest A18 chip is rapid and enables Apple’s Intelligence features (AI tools). The battery lasts about two days of general use, or at least a day of heavy use, and the phone charges with USB-C. It also supports MagSafe and Qi/Qi2 wireless charging and accessories. It starts with a decent 128GB of storage, although larger models are available if you don’t want to store your photos and videos in the cloud.The iPhone 16 is light and fairly compact for a modern smartphone, and its IP68 rating means it’s water-resistant to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes – more than safe enough for any accidental dunks. It gains the useful Action button from 2023’siPhone 15 Pro, which replaces the mute switch and can be used to mute the phone or for various other functions, such as turning on the torch or launching apps. The new Camera Control button is great for quickly opening the camera, even if zooming, changing settings and shooting photos with the button is fiddly in the camera app.The dual camera on the back is good, comprising a main 48MP camera and an improved 12MP ultrawide camera, which now has a macro photography mode for fun closeup shots. It also has Apple’s photographic styles features for those who want to customise how the camera captures photos (rich contrast, vibrant, warm) and get creative with tone and colour palette. The main camera can do a 2x in-sensor zoom, which works well in bright light, but the lack of a real telephoto camera holds the 16 back. The 12MP selfie camera is the same as other iPhones.The iPhone runs the recently released iOS 18.3, which includessupport for RCS messaging with Androidand adds more of Apple’s new AI features.

The display is crisp, bright and slick, with a faster 120Hz refresh rate to keep scrolling and animations smooth. The screen also supports the handy always-on feature, showing the time and notifications when not in use.The 16 Pro also has a slightly more powerful A18 Pro chip and starts with 128GB of storage, with greater space available – up to 1TB – for those who need it. The battery lasts a good 40 hours of general use, meaning it will go through the heaviest of days, and most will need to charge it only every other day.It has the same two extra Action and Camera Control buttons as the regular model, but the camera on the back is better. The 48MP main camera and 48MP ultrawide camera are great and the extra 12MP 5x telephoto camera meaningfully closes the distances to objects. Combined, they shoot great photos across various lighting conditions and scenarios.£949 at John LewisFrom £999 at AppleWhy should you buy it?This is Apple’s best phone, with its most powerful camera, top performance and a high-quality big-enough screen in a device that’s still easy to fit in a pocket.Buy if:you want the Pro screen, titanium body and best camera without a massive displayDon’t buy if:you want the longest battery life or biggest display on an iPhoneRead ourfulliPhone 16 Pro review: Apple levels up its smaller ‘pro’ phoneScreen:6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A18 ProStorage:128, 256, 512GB or 1TBCamera:48MP main + 48MP UW + 12MP 5x; 12MP front-facingDimensions:149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm (HWD)Weight:199gBest iPhone for screen:iPhone 16 Pro MaxView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16 Pro Max, left, has a big batteryanda big screen, which often makes it feel like a small tablet rather than a phone.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe biggest, most expensive iPhone in Apple’s 16 series lineup is the iPhone 16 Pro Max.

It is thin, light and pretty compact for a modern phone, and it’s water-resistant like the rest of Apple’s iPhones.Inside is the latest A18 chip with at least 128GB of storage. That enables the same Apple Intelligence features as the rest of the iPhone 16 line, which will not run on the iPhone 15 and older models, though none of them are killer features as yet.It had a solid battery life of up to two days in my tests, which is slightly longer than the regular iPhone 16, and USB-C charging. But the 16e misses out on a few things including the new Camera Control button, MagSafe on the back for accessories, the new fasterwifi 7 standard and a handful of other specs that are common on the regular iPhone 16 models. A bigger deal-breaker might be the single camera on the back, which is good but lacks any ultrawide or telephoto options.Despite costing about 25% less than the regular iPhone 16, it’s not that cheap, so better options can be found refurbished for similar or less money.From £599 at Apple£599 at John LewisWhy should you buy it?The 16e offers the modern iPhone experience with the latest chips and AI but with a few things missing to hit a lower price, such as a dual camera and MagSafe.Buy if:you want the cheapest new iPhone from Apple with the latest AI featuresDon’t buy if:you are at all into photography or have MagSafe accessoriesRead our fulliPhone 16e review: Apple’s cheapest new phoneScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)Processor:Apple A18Storage:128, 256 or 512GBCamera:48MP rear; 12MP front-facingDimensions:146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8mm (HWD)Weight:167gOther iPhones still on sale at AppleView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 15 will have software support for about five to six years.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe iPhone 15, released in 2023, has the same screen and aluminium body as the current iPhone 16 but lacks the action and camera control buttons.

The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’siPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receiveoccasional security updatesfrom Apple.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished phonesis better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.There are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished andsold directly by Applethat come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.Quick GuideA buyer’s guide to refurbished phonesShowSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chainsCeXandGameand online stores such asmusicMagpieandEnvirofone. Marketplaces likeAmazonandeBayand refurb specialistBack Marketalso have a wide range. And some phone operators, includingO2,giffgaff,EEandVodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A– virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B– in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C– in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D– also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health– batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port– check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons– do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner– is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks– check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts– not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen– check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against adatabase of stolen devicesthrough a service such asCheckMENDor similar.Warranty– what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Do not buyAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.An iPhone 13 mini unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.How I testedQuick GuideHow I testedShowWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why should you trust me?I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 17 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

The attack occurred at a time when he was in communication with The Hague, he said. At least one attack took place around June 2024, researchers said.In a statement to the Guardian, Yambio said he alerted the ICC to the attack after it had been confirmed and urged members of the court to have their phones checked for spyware. The ICC’s office of the prosecutor said it would not comment on matters related to “ongoing investigations”.The revelation raises questions about whether a government agency with access to military-grade spyware may have been seeking to interfere with ICC proceedings by keeping tabs on individuals who have access to and advocate on behalf of victims of torture. It will probably put pressure onGiorgia Meloni, who has faced questions about the use of spyware in her government since revelations emerged in January that a handful of Italian activists and journalists had received warnings from WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Meta, that their phones had been targeted by spyware.Meloni’s government has been heavily criticised after authorities in Italyreleased a Libyan citizenwanted by the ICC for war crimes who had been arrested in Rome. Osama Najim, who is known as Almasri, is the director of a detention centre in Mitiga in Tripoli, which has been condemned by human rights organisations for its arbitrary detention, torture and abuse of political dissidents, migrants and refugees.The Citizen Lab report has confirmed that several activists and associates of Yambio, includingtwo personal friends of Pope Francis, were targeted by hacking software that is supposed to be used against targets in terrorism investigations and other serious crime.Italian priest close to pope told he was target of surveillance tool used by a governmentRead moreResearchers have not yet been able to determine the exact kind of spyware used against Yambio, but are continuing their investigation. They were able to confirm that the hacking software used against other activists was made byParagonSolutions, an Israeli surveillance technology company that is now owned by a US financial investor. The researchers included Luca Casarini and Giuseppe Caccia, the two founders of an NGO that tries to protect migrants and refugees who are crossing the Mediterranean.The researchers said: “We forensically analysed multiple Android phones belonging to Paragon targets in Italy [an acknowledged Paragon user] who were notified byWhatsApp. We found clear indications that spyware had been loaded into WhatsApp, as well as other apps on their devices.”The Italian government has acknowledged it was a client of Paragon but has denied it was behind a spate of surveillance attacks against a journalist and several activists. Paragon has since suspended its contract withItalybecause, according to a a person close to the matter, of a failure to abide by Paragon’s rules that forbid spyware to be used against journalists or other members of civil society.WhatsApp firstrevealed in January that 90 of its users, including civil society members and journalists, had been the target of government clients of Paragon. When it is successfully deployed, Paragon’s spyware, which is called Graphite, can hack into any phone and access a user’s messages and listen to mobile phone conversations, including those held over encrypted apps such as WhatsApp or Signal.Yambio was first notified byAppleof a possible attack in November and his mobile phone was subsequently examined by experts at Cyber Hub-AM and the Citizen Lab.Forensic details of the researchers’ investigation was then shared for further analysis with Apple, which said in a statement that attacks like the one used against Yambio were “extremely sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop … and are used to target specific individuals because of who they are or what they do”. Apple confirmed it had developed and deployed “a fix” to the security flaw that had been exploited to attack Yambio, and that the fix was released in its iOS 18 to protect iPhone users.The Citizen Lab researchers said its investigation found a number of other countries appeared to be clients of Paragon, including: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Cyprus, Singapore and Israel. No other details about the alleged relationship of those countries with Paragon were revealed in the report.John Scott-Railton, a senior Citzen Lab researcher, said the emergence of fresh information about Paragon clients ought to raise questions about who was running the deployment of spyware, what was being done with information gathered, and whether the use of the spyware was aligned with domestic laws.John Fleming, the executive chair of Paragon US, said in a statement: “Paragon has been contacted by Citizen Lab and provided with a very limited amount of information, some of which appears to be inaccurate. Given the limited nature of the information provided, we are unable to offer a comment at this time.”The company, which has previously agreed a contract with US immigration authorities, said it required all users to adhere to terms and conditions that “preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders”.Fleming said: “While we are not able to discuss individual customers, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our terms of service.”Hannah Neumann, an MEP who investigated the abuse of spyware inside the EU, said in a statement that spyware abuse continued inEurope, and followed a similar pattern.She said: “We have seen this pattern before – denial, deflection, and ultimately, no justice for the victims. It is Groundhog Day for spyware abuse, and unless we fix the loopholes in regulation and strengthen victim protection, these violations will continue unchecked. We need strong European rules and accountability measures to stop this cycle once and for all.”Explore more on these topicsItalySurveillanceInternational criminal courtHackingParagonLibyaGiorgia MeloninewsShareReuse this content"

If that’s your level of engagement with AI, then this competent, fluent documentary offers a very approachable entry into the subject. It’s not, however, a wide-lens overview of the subject but a character-driven study of one specific, key-player company in the industry:DeepMind, whose intercapped name betrays its origins in the 2010 tech-boom era.As it happens, DeepMind is now officially calledGoogleDeepMind and is part of a suite of divisions developing robotics and solving problems using AI – sorry, AGI because it’s not just Artificial Intelligence we’re talking about here, but Artificial General Intelligence (it gets explained). The fact that Google and its tech overlords are involved, however amiable they seem when seen in their office casual dress (former CEO Eric Schmidt at least), means this has more than a little flavour of corporate video, investor-fluffing, and self-congratulatory smugness about it. But DeepMind’s British founder and CEO Demis Hassabis manages to come across as a pretty nice guy with a genuinely interesting backstory. The son of a Greek father and a Singaporean mother raised in London, he was a child chess prodigy who became a video game designer; instead, he opted to go into a purer form of research on how thinking itself works, and that became his business.All this leads up to a satisfyingly climactic achievement for Hassabis that viewers who read science news may know fromrecent headlines. And what he and his collaborator John Jumper achieved with their AI model AlphaFold, a program that predicts the structure of proteins based on chemical sequence, is truly remarkable. Director Greg Kohs uses animation and all the tools in the video editing toolbox to explain the science in crystal clear layperson’s terms, which in itself is no mean feat. But it’s hard not to feel there’s a few dimensions to the AGI story that are being left in the desktop recycling bin.The Thinking Game is in UK cinemas from 21 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleDeepMindAlphabetComputingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a crisis demanding real-world solutionsWed 19 Mar 2025 14.41 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 14.44 EDTShareBoys used to be raised by their parents. Now, as they grow up, an increasing number are coming under theinfluenceof toxic online figures who push a hollow, misogynistic version of masculinity. This isn’t helping their character or their relationships. But it does work for a digital world where worth is measured in money, status and appearance. Girls have long seen their mental healthsufferfrom social media comparisons and phone addiction. But that doesn’t make it any less troubling now that boys are being similarly affected.In hisRichard Dimbleby lecturefor the BBC, Sir Gareth Southgate made a cogent case that young men are being failed by modern society – not just by absent role models, but by a culture that doesn’t acknowledge failure and vulnerability while exposing them to damaging digital influences. Without real-life guidance, they can withdraw, becoming reluctant to talk or unable to express their emotions. Boys can fall into an unhealthy world of gaming, gambling and pornography.This void, the former England football manager warned, is also being filled by “callous, manipulative and toxic influencers whose sole drive is for their own gain”. They trickyoung meninto believing that success is measured by money or emotionless dominance. That seems hard to refute – and is affecting society for the worse. Polls suggest men and women belonging to gen Z are morepolarisedthan any other generation on questions about feminism, gender roles and women’s rights – with a clear increase in sexist attitudes. There must be a concerted effort to reverse such trends.That boys are now more likely to own asmartphonethan to live with their dad is striking. Politicians, enamoured with hi-tech progress, must reckon with the impact: it’s now easier to connect to a global network than to build a local community, easier to consume endless content than to find real-world mentors.Encouraging boys to be resilient, empathetic and capable of real relationships requires investment in families, schools and youth clubs that foster connection. They need space to be themselves – and the confidence to reject the empty validation of a social media feed. Resilience isn’t innate; it’s built through experience, effort and good example.Ifliterature– as evidenced by the young adult novels on the Carnegie medal shortlist – is beginning to explore the struggles of young boys, mainstream entertainment is exploring a darker narrative. The Netflix dramaAdolescence, about a teenage boy accused of murder, has had the country – from theprime ministerdown – glued to their screens. While the show has rightfully garnered rave reviews, boys should not be seen as dangerous or inherently suspect – they are children who need care and support just as much as girls do.Apple’s iPhonearrivedin 2007. Mobile social media apps followed, offering access and unimaginable connections to a new generation. But they didn’t just change masculinity – they monetised it. Instead of mentors, boys get marketers; instead of guidance, they get grifters; instead of role models, they get algorithms. Sir Gareth stressed the need to create a world where young people feel valued beyond just success. Because when society worships wealth and power, it is the young who suffer most from knowing they have neither.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It isn’t the 21-year-old detainee I met who stepped foot in this country at age nine, only to be deported without so much as a hearing.Justice escapes the contours of this nation’s immigration facilities.‘I am a political prisoner’: Mahmoud Khalil says he’s being targeted for political beliefsRead moreOn March 8, I was taken by DHS [the Department of Homeland Security] agents who refused to provide a warrant, and accosted my wife and me as we returned from dinner. By now, the footage of that night has been made public. Before I knew what was happening, agents handcuffed and forced me into an unmarked car. At that moment, my only concern was for Noor’s safety. I had no idea if she would be taken too, since the agents had threatened to arrest her for not leaving my side. DHS would not tell me anything for hours – I did not know the cause of my arrest or if I was facing immediate deportation. At 26 Federal Plaza, I slept on the cold floor. In the early morning hours, agents transported me to another facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. There, I slept on the ground and was refused a blanket despite my request.My arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza, which resumed in full force Monday night. With January’s ceasefire now broken, parents in Gaza are once again cradling too-small shrouds, and families are forced to weigh starvation and displacement against bombs. It is our moral imperative to persist in the struggle for their complete freedom.Judge orders Mahmoud Khalil case to be moved from Louisiana to New JerseyRead moreI was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria to a family which has been displaced from their land since the 1948 Nakba. I spent my youth in proximity to yet distant from my homeland. But being Palestinian is an experience that transcends borders. I see in my circumstances similarities to Israel’s use of administrative detention – imprisonment without trial or charge – to strip Palestinians of their rights. I think of our friend Omar Khatib, who was incarcerated without charge or trial by Israel as he returned home from travel. I think of Gaza hospital director and pediatrician Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, who was taken captive by the Israeli military on December 27 and remains in an Israeli torture camp today. For Palestinians, imprisonment without due process is commonplace.I have always believed that my duty is not only to liberate myself from the oppressor, but also to liberate my oppressors from their hatred and fear. My unjust detention is indicative of the anti-Palestinian racism that both the Biden and Trump administrations have demonstrated over the past 16 months as the US has continued to supply Israel with weapons to kill Palestinians and prevented international intervention. For decades, anti-Palestinian racism has driven efforts to expand US laws and practices that are used to violently repress Palestinians, Arab Americans, and other communities. That is precisely why I am being targeted.While I await legal decisions that hold the futures of my wife and child in the balance, those who enabled my targeting remain comfortably at Columbia University. Presidents [Minouche]Shafik, [Katrina] Armstrong, and Dean [Keren] Yarhi-Milo laid the groundwork for the US government to target me by arbitrarily disciplining pro-Palestinian students and allowing viral doxing campaigns – based on racism and disinformation – to go unchecked.‘I could be next’: international students at Columbia University feel ‘targeted’ after Mahmoud Khalil’s arrestRead moreColumbia targeted me for my activism, creating a new authoritarian disciplinary office to bypass due process and silence students criticizing Israel. Columbia surrendered to federal pressure by disclosing student records to Congress and yielding to the Trump administration’s latest threats. My arrest, the expulsion or suspension of at least 22 Columbia students – some stripped of their BA degrees just weeks before graduation – and the expulsion of SWC [Student Workers of Columbia] President Grant Miner on the eve of contract negotiations, are clear examples.If anything, my detention is a testament to the strength of the student movement in shifting public opinion toward Palestinian liberation. Students have long been at the forefront of change – leading the charge against the Vietnam war, standing on the frontlines of the civil rights movement, and driving the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. Today, too, even if the public has yet to fully grasp it, it is students who steer us toward truth and justice.The Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent. Visa holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs. In the weeks ahead, students, advocates, and elected officials must unite to defend the right to protest for Palestine. At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all.Knowing fully that this moment transcends my individual circumstances, I hope nonetheless to be free to witness the birth of my first-born child.This statement was originally publishedhereExplore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilOpinionTrump administrationUS immigrationIsrael-Gaza warUS campus protestsUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Nearly six decades later, as the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic party (SPD)prepareto join forces across the right-left divide for the fifth time, following February’s snap election, the circumstances are superficially similar. The scale of the challenges, however – and the sense of jeopardy – are of a different order.As geopolitical events have undermined its trade‑led business model, the German economy has beenundergoingthe most prolonged period of stagnation since the second world war. Not unrelatedly, the extreme-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party – elements of which are judgeda threatto the democratic constitutional order by security services – has risen in the polls to become the second-biggest party in the EU’s most powerful member state. At the same time, a Putin-sympathetic Donald Trump is dismantling the transatlantic security guarantees on which Germany has relied in the postwar era.In response to this menacing conjuncture, German politics is reinventing itself at a vertiginous pace. On Tuesday, at the behest of the chancellor-elect, Friedrich Merz, the outgoing Bundestagvotedto change the country’s Basic Law to allow historic levels of public investment in defence, national infrastructure and the climate transition. The so-calleddebt brake– a constitutional restriction on borrowing that had come to symbolise Germany’s fiscal conservatism – is being unceremoniously sidelined.Mr Merzis a former investment banker and avowed economic liberal. His welcome conversion to the case for a proactive state, and a new leadership role for Germany in bolstering European security, has been one of the more eye-popping moments in recent political history. The scale of investment licensed by the Bundestag vote will need to be rubber-stamped by parliament’s upper house on Friday. But shares in defence companies and manufacturing giants such as Volkswagen are alreadyup, alleviating fears of deindustrialisation that were undermining national morale and fuelling the rise of the AfD.For both Mr Merz’s CDU and the SPD, this paradigm shift represents a bold and necessary leap into uncharted territory. In recent years, coalitions across the political divide have delivered stability but also, at times, an enervating impression of stasis. As Angela Merkel’s unhappy sidekicks in the 2010s, the SPDlosta sense of distinct identity and purpose, while blue-collar votersdriftedto the xenophobic far right in large numbers. Berlin’s insistentadvocacyof a fiscal orthodoxy unfit for the times contributed to a Europe-wide crisis of the political centre, manifested in the rise of rightwing populism across the continent.Liberated by this week’s groundbreaking vote, Mr Merz’s “grand coalition” is set to break that mould. Countries such as Britain and France, where prolonged economic underperformance has also been accompanied by the rise of the populist right, should be taking note. As politics in western liberal democracies has polarised, mainstream politicians have sometimes talked about the need for a “radical centre”. Much of the time that has amounted to a slogan without substance. But as the two traditional behemoths of German politics wake up to the need for urgent change, Mr Merz’s administration may prove to be the real deal.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Khalil, who helped lead the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia university last year, was targeted for his politics. His unlawful arrest by the US immigration enforcement agency comes amidst relentless smears lobbed at protesters of Israel’s war on Gaza. This McCarthyite abduction of a Palestinian Green Card holder is a trial balloon, a test of what society might tolerate and a threat of more to come. And the added horror-show twist to this assault on free speech is that it is being done in the name of Jewish people under the pretence of tackling antisemitism.Such egregious claims are easily refuted. Most American Jews didn’t vote for Trump and don’t back his crackdowns. As Amy Spitalnick of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, one ofmultiple Jewish groups opposing Khalili’s detention, said: “The Trump administration is exploiting real concerns about antisemitism to undercut democracy.” Meanwhile, it is grotesque to pretend that Team Trump, home to antisemitic conspiracy theories,Nazi salutesandHolocaust denialism, is fighting antisemitism, rather than actively reproducing it.But while Khalil’s arrest fits into longstanding attempts to silence pro-Palestine protesters, it is also part of a wider global authoritarianism. US students protesting Israel’s decimation of Gaza have faced relentless bi-partisan furore over antisemitism claimed to be rife within such movements. And pro-Israel groups have lobbied hard to provoke these accusations. But to locate Trump’s crackdown purely within this political arena is to misunderstand the full force of far-right ideology in all its mechanisms.That pro-Israel Jewish groups, or the Israel government are cheering this assault on free speech does not substantively change the dynamics of power at play here. This is not about the impact of pro-Israel Jewish university funders, or aggressively anti-Palestinian alumni groups, or even the prominent Anti-Defamation League. We can – and should – criticise their actions and theirabject moral failurein lining up with Trump. But we can do so without inflating their influence to suggest that authoritarianism in supposed defence of Jewish people is actually being led by Jewish people. For that would be to fall into a divisive trap set by Trump and the global far-right.A key element here is that the far-right has found in its pretend fight against antisemitism the perfect political strategy, a way to divide progressives while at the same time clobbering them. The far-right is using this wedge not just to shut down voices critical of Israel’s serial violence against Palestinians and a war on Gaza described by experts as genocidal, but also to attack so-called wokeism, critical race theory, Black Lives Matter, diversity, equity and inclusion programmes, ‘liberal elites’at universities– in short, all the political enemies in its constructed culture wars.This has long been clear across Europe, where far-right figures from Hungary’s Victor Orban to France’s Marine Le Pen have rehabilitated their political fortunes in part by performatively proclaiming tocare about Jews. This has been achieved by best-friending Israel, bear-hugging its prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a shield against accusations of antisemitism. Wrapped in the Israeli flag, far-right parties with fascist roots and current displays of antisemitism cast themselves as defenders of Jews against an antisemitism claimed to be coming from Muslims and migrants.It’s a terrifically self-serving formulation, since hating Muslims and migrants is the main ideological obsession and rallying cry for the resurgent far-right. We see the same brush strokes in the Heritage Foundation’s Project Esther, a blueprint for Trump’s repressive crackdowns starting with pro-Palestine protesters,penned by Christian Evangelistsand in a claimed defence of Jewish communities.Rolling out this McCarthyist crusade carries an additional and dangerous undercurrent. By stating that authoritarian measures are deployed to fight antisemitism, Trump is scapegoating Jewish people. Creepily, the White House announced its detention of Khalil on X using the Hebrew for goodbye in the all-caps message: “Shalom, Mahmoud.” This narrative, with those in power deflecting blame onto Jewish people, is itself characteristic of antisemitism. And if repressive measures are supposedly about protecting Jews, it inevitably risks generating resentment of Jewish people. All of which is more reason for progressives to not lose sight of who is both instigator and executor of this current crackdown.Jelena Subotić, a professor of political science at Georgia State university who has written aboutfar-right pro-Israel antisemitism, told me that Khali’s detention is “incredibly pernicious because it is pitching Jewish students, or faculty, or anyone identified as Jewish, as the cover for totalitarianism. It is splitting groups along identity lines and dividing people who should be allies.”In the midst of a multi-spectrum assault on democracy, this tests the cohesion of progressive movements. It calls for a firm stand in solidarity with Palestinians while resisting attacks on all minorities, even while one racialised community is set up as the ‘good’ minority in need of protection from the others. As Subotić puts it: “Nobody wants to be the model minority for a fascist regime.”Progressives must now grapple with the way both antisemitism itself and the fight against various political movements labelled as “antisemitism” is being used by the far-right, thereby countering anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and anti-migrant hatred, while also combatting antisemitism. It’s a lot. But every part of it is essential to building an inclusive progressive tent. And keeping everyone together, inside the tent, a mosaic of forces pushing in one direction, is the only rational way to combat fascism.Rachel Shabi is the author of Not the Enemy – Israel’s Jews from Arab Lands and Off-White: The Truth About AntisemitismExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

The sender was the United States government. Like a ransom note, the government letter insists that Columbia comply with a list ofTrump administrationdemands in order to even have a chance at recovering the $400m in federal funding for scientific research that thegovernment canceledon 7 March.Oddly, one of the specific targets identified in the letter was Columbia’s department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies (Mesaas), a small humanities department devoted to studying the languages, cultures and history of those regions. The government demanded the Mesaas department be put into “receivership” – basically, be taken over by the university – as a precondition to further negotiations.I’m a recent Stem grad. Here’s why the right is winning us overRead moreThe battle against the authoritarianism taking hold in Washington now appears to turn in part on the fate of Mesaas.Why Mesaas?The Trump campaign to destroy the independence of American higher education began when an obscure federal agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Human Services and Education, coordinated the extraordinary move to rescind $400m in federal funding for scientific research at Columbia, since Columbia “has fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment”.After threatening some 60 other universities with the same fate, on 13 March the government sent their ransom note to Columbia alone. Their conditions were to be met within seven days, and not in return for the release of the funds, but merely as “preconditions”. Further demands would then be presented for “formal negotiation” – which would not be an actual negotiation, because the GSA would continue to hold back the university’s money, like a mobster.The preconditions concern mainly the policing of student protest on campus. Their imposition likely violates both federal law and the US constitution, asColumbia law faculty have made clear. But in a startling and equally unlawful move the government took another hostage in its letter: Mesaas. For a period of five years, Columbia must place the department in academic receivership. The university was given the same seven-day ultimatum by which to specify “a full plan, with date-certain deliverables” for enforcing the receivership.This is an unparalleled attempt to seize control over people and ideas in a US university. Universities do find it necessary sometimes to place an academic department in receivership, typically when the department’s self-governance breaks down. Normally the administration will appoint as chair a member of another department, for one academic year. Mesaas’s current self-governance is outstanding, and there have been no problems in all the years that that I chaired the department.For the United States government itself to intervene directly in faculty governance – specifying the extraordinary five-year period, and with “deliverables” on whose performance the future funding of the entire university might depend – is without precedent in the history of US higher education.Why has the government chosen to single out this department?The answer is clear: because its faculty have not voiced steadfast support for the state of Israel in their scholarship. The US government stands almost alone in the world in its unwavering ideological and financial support for the violence of the state of Israel against the people of Palestine. Most recently it has provided the consent, the justification and the arms for Israel’s destruction of Gaza. (Just this week, thedestruction was relaunched, to condemnation from around the world but not from Washington, which alone gave its support.)In contrast, academic research by prominent scholars in the field of Middle Eastern studies, including those in Mesaas, has reflected deeply on the complexity of the situation and has long since questioned the versions of history and racial ideas fueling Israel’s actions. Mesaas professors ask hard but entirely legitimate questions aboutIsrael– and our government wants to ban that.The Mesaas department played no role in organizingstudent protestsfor Gaza. But Washington has decided that in addition to dictating how a university should govern political protest, it should control how the university governs academic research – intensifying a broad attack onresearch on the Middle Eastacross US universities.With its demands to essentially seize control of Mesaas, the federal government is undermining two fundamental principles of the American university: the right of academic departments to self-government and the freedom of members of the faculty to express their views, without fear, both as authorities in their fields of inquiry and as private individuals.Trump is setting the US on a path to educational authoritarianismRead moreColumbia is required to decide by Thursday 20 March how to respond to this ransom note, with the government threatening to cut off two of the university’s fingers: academic freedom and faculty governance. If the Columbia administration capitulates, it will mark the beginning of its own destruction and that of the American university as such – precisely what the American Enterprise Institute, which supplied the template for the note,has called for.The courts have so far paused more than 40 of the administration’s initiatives, though it remains unclear if the mob boss will obey. So long as we do have a functional judicial system, however, Columbia’s answer to Trump can only be: see you in court.Sheldon Pollock FBA is the Arvind Raghunathan professor emeritus of South Asian studies at Columbia University and former chair of the Mesaas department.

Let me show you America’s unbeautiful suburban sprawlAlexander HurstI drove 2,000 miles with a French friend across my home country – and saw the endless nowhere land that is the crucible of TrumpismWed 19 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 09.40 EDTShareIn 1941 Dorothy Thompson, an American journalist who reported from Germany in the lead-up to the second world war, wrote an essay for Harper’s about the personality types most likely to be attracted to Nazism, headlined “Who Goes Nazi?” “Those who haven’t anything in them to tell them what they like and what they don’t – whether it is breeding, or happiness, or wisdom, or a code, however old-fashioned or however modern, go Nazi,” Thompson wrote.Talia Lavin, a US writer, recently gave Thompson’s idea an update on Substack with an essay of her own: “Who Goes Maga?”The essay has since been taken down (I’m not sure why), but in it Lavin reimagined Thompson’s original dinner party setting, with various archetypes in attendance, offering in one or two paragraphs a brief but empathetic explanation for why each person has or has not “gone Maga”.Eventually arriving at Mr I, an academic and a frequent traveller to France with family money,Lavin wrote: “Nonetheless, he will never go Maga and would spend his days in exile even if he got cut off from the family purse … because … he is a true devotee of beauty.” He finds in Maga “a hatred of things that are beautiful and strange, as all the things he loves are. Power holds no attraction for him, only beauty.”Of course, power often tries to use aesthetics, and its own definition of beauty, to further its own purposes. Fascists and authoritarians are deeply aware of the ability of art to propagate ideas or oppose them. From architecture to rallies, Hitler and Mussolini favoured a type of massiveness, an imposing nature and uniformity to evoke a sense of the imperial eternal. Soviet aesthetics – though meant to be futurist rather than focused on a glorified past – also fell back on the idea of massiveness and uniformity to subjugate the individual and elevate the state. And, of course, all three authoritarian regimes repressed art, artists and aesthetics that were dissident.Trumpism, too, has an aesthetic. Allow me to pretentiously, subjectively, declare itnot beautiful. The aesthetic of Trumpism is sprawl – which had already infected the United States long before the Maga movement metastasised.Last September I drove nearly 2,000 miles in the US with a French friend, Guillaume, zigzagging our way from DC to New Orleans and tracing, in part, the footsteps of Alexis de Tocqueville. (“It might be our last opportunity to observe democracy in America,” I had said to him.) Through his non-American eyes, I saw even more poignantly the ways the physical manifestation of Hannah Arendt’s “atomisation” are scarred into the suburban and rural US landscape itself.Like fish in water, I wonder if Americans are even aware of how they swim in it. The hours-long stretches of chain stores in single-storey, flat-topped buildings. The cluster of gas stations, with functionally and aesthetically similar convenience stores selling rows and rows of sugary food and drinks. The big box chain stores, some of them matryoshka dolls that house other chains within – rectangular islands of stuff surrounded by parking lots leading to other little islands of fast food, also surrounded by parking lots, filled with rows and rows of the most enormous pickup trucks imaginable.And then, just as it starts to dwindle, another on-ramp/off-ramp, and the whole shebang starts all over again, until you’ve cycled through all of the possible chain permutations and you begin to repeat. Wherever there is grass, it will be impeccably mowed.No matter where you are in America’s 3.8m sq miles, with its 340 million inhabitants, the sprawl will have followed the same driving logic as the chains it hosts – an utterly nondescript, completely indistinguishable look, feel and experience. Somehow, there is always still traffic on these six-lane roads, a trailing line of enormous vehicles that require parking lots that spill out like muffin tops, and with double-wide parking spaces. Everything about sprawl slumps outwards, like warmed jelly that can no longer hold its shape. There is no height except for the height of the signs advertising the chains; those rise several storeys into the sky, enough to be visible from the highway.View image in fullscreenHeavy traffic on a US freeway.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesSomewhere along the line, the American Dream became to live alone, surrounded by all of this, rather than living in connection with other people.In somewhat cryptic lines, the poet Keats put forward a nexus that goes beyond the subjective nature of what we, individually, find aesthetically pleasing. “Beauty is truth, truth beauty. That is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,” he wrote. He was hardly the only one to interrogate the two at the same time. Plato and Plotinus sought to link beauty to an equally ineffable truth that lingered somewhere beyond our material reality; Kant, too,placed beauty beyond taste, as a disinterested thing that radiated outward. In theology, Saint Augustine and Hans Urs Von Balthasar draw the two back to the same divine origin, as critical components to any human attempt to understand the transcendent.And if that’s all too mystical for you, the British theoretical physicistTom McLeish argues: “As indications of the road forward rather than destinations achieved, beautiful experiments and theoretical ideas can, and even must, be celebrated, their aesthetic appeal unashamedly enjoyed.”I would add a third vector to the one between beauty and truth: art, which in his 1934 book, Art As Experience, John Dewey sees as something that is inherent in the everyday experience of life rather than something necessarily pushed into museums. As long as that living is authentic. “Experience in the degree in which it is experience is heightened vitality,” writes Dewey.Perhaps there is something authentic to suburban sprawl when experienced as spectator and anthropologist. But as everyday life, sprawl is deadening, ugly, fake. Devoid of art, beauty and truth alike. The United States has long bought into the idea that freedom is endless expansion. But slouching across land simply because it is there uplifts neither the land nor the people on it. In this instance in particular, abundance did a disservice to the US by drawing it into an absence of experience. What surprise that a moribund ideology would take root in physical spaces that radiate the peculiar desolation oftoo much?Given the number of artists, photographers, cinematographers and architects who have been willing to serve nefarious political movements, it would be simplistic for me to claim that artists are somehow immune to them. But art is an attempt to capture – and convey – something true about the world, and the human emotional experience of it. When the rational world has committed itself to a path that leads to destruction, perhaps those dedicated to beauty can, with what Keats called a “negative capability” to perceive truth, bring us back to both.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe correspondentExplore more on these topicsUrbanisationOpinionUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

By stocking up on the key item most preppers forgetEmma BrockesWith France about to advise its citizens on how to survive an ‘imminent threat’, it’s time to wise up to what the real essentials areWed 19 Mar 2025 12.13 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 14.05 EDTShareIt’s a fairly strong indication that your US presidency is not going well when, within three months of you taking office, one of your closest allies feels the need to issue its entire population with a manual on how to survive an “imminent threat”. According toFrench media reports, that is what the French government is planning in the form of a 20-page booklet to go out to its citizens this summer. And while it’s intended for use against natural disaster or medical threat, we all know what we’re really talking about here. The French government would like to remind its people that, in the event of a nuclear attack, they must remember to close the doors and windows.My dad recalls Buckinghamshire county council issuing a similar pamphlet in the 1980s, for when Russia dropped an atomic bomb on Aylesbury. My family didn’t need the advice, as it happened; in the event of the collapse of civil society, my mother’s Tupperware and plastic-bag reserves that filled an entire floor-to-ceiling cupboard would’ve pushed us to the top of any barter-based value system. Plus, for at least a week, we could have lived like kings on decades-old gravy and bolognese sauce loosened from the permafrost of the chest freezer in the garage like the body of a caveman after an ice age.To my mother’s disappointment, this opportunity to be vindicated in the face of my dad’s occasional efforts to have a clearout never came to pass. My own history as a prepper, meanwhile, shows definite signs of generational decline. In New York, I lived through the incredible two-and-a-half-hour blackout of 2019, in which the lights of Broadway went out and people kept themselves together by singing old-timey songs and wondering if it was OK to order in pizza. (The answer to that was, slightly shockingly, yes.) Back then, I had an outdated emergency bag in the closet stocked with baby formula and tiny bottles of water and I made a promise to myself that night: that in the event of another disaster, I would not be reliant on a torch in the shape of a ladybird, or use my last 2% of phone battery to look at Twitter.That promise needs refreshing. We live in a new world, now, one in which defence spending takes priority over foreign aid, Russia is once again a threat toEuropeand the US can’t be relied upon to save us. In the French government booklet there will, reportedly, be emergency numbers, radio channels and encouragement, should the need arise, to get involved in civil defence-type efforts including volunteer firefighting.This assumes that some semblance of order survives. My nearest London tube station is one of the city’s deepest, but I’ve seen enough apocalypse shows to know that hiding underground is not the answer; you have either to head north, to a national park where you can outrun the cannibals and hunt game, or barricade yourself in your apartment for three months until the initial anarchy has burned itself out and you can go on a scavenging run to the shops.And, of course, you must be prepared. After the blackout, I bought a torch so powerful it could double as Mace if you could get an aggressor to look straight into it, and I’m definitely thinking about finding the cable to charge it. I’m also starting to stock up, although it strikes me that the French have left out one important piece of advice from their booklet. A lot of people in New York have generational trauma from relatives who did, indeed, flee Europe decades ago, and the ones I know would point out that missing from the French guidelines is alcohol.This isn’t a joke. The shrewd prepper understands that if things collapse and money becomes useless, the value of alcohol – for anaesthetic, sterilisation, sedation – rises to the very top of the new currency system. You can pack your tiny bottles of water and buy your tins, but my advice to you, if prepping, is to stop off at the off-licence and grab three bottles of premium whisky and a bottle of Tanqueray – which you are absolutely not allowed to touch until the bombs start falling.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionFranceNuclear weaponsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Nothing happens “just because”.With that said, let’s explain a few other things about the budget.The figures will be wrongThe history of budget estimates is a story of optimism not coming true and pessimism being happily wrong.If the graph does not display, click hereThat doesn’t mean we should ignore all the numbers – or even think the Treasury department is incompetent. Forecasting is hard at the best of times. And these are not the best of times.The numbers will be wrong – and as a result we really should not care too much about them. Unless you think the Liberal party was smart to produce a stack of“Back in Black”merchandise? The deficit is bigger, or smaller, than expected?We’ll see.Most Australians look with horror at the Trump administration’s whirlwind of destruction, but what about the lads? | Peter LewisRead moreHow will the government respond to the uncertainty?Just because the numbers will be wrong doesn’t mean the government can shrug its shoulders. In December, no one could have predicted south-east Queensland would be hit by a cyclone. But we can predict that there will be more such events, more floods, more impacts of climate change. So, what is the government going to do about that?Slightly less difficult to predict is what Donald Trump will do. If you want a sense of how tricky things are, the global economic uncertainty index is now as high as it was right at the start of the pandemic.If the graph does not display, click hereSure calling the tariffs“senseless”is fine, but what are you going to do about it? This is not just about tariffs on steel and aluminium, or even ones that may come on beef and pharmaceuticals. The reality is that what was once is no more. The world trade system, and our ability to trust our biggest defence ally, is all gone to hell. How will the government respond? Are they going to carry on with Aukus as though nothing has happened?Thus far both the ALP and LNP are hoping to get through the election without having to come up with any plans. We should not let them get away with it.Budget surpluses are often about taxThere will be a lot of talk about the budget deficit and how long till we get back to a surplus. Firstly, don’t worry. Just remember a budget surplus is just the government choosing to take more tax from all of us than it pays back. Is that good? Not really.Governments don’t run profits or losses. You don’t get a dividend payout when they run a surplus – indeed, often you get less.A big determinant of a deficit of surplus is tax. Last year the government collected the amount of tax that Howard and Costello used to get when they had surplus. This year the government will not raise that much tax and thus we are in deficit:If the graph does not display, click hereBut budget surpluses are not only about taxYes, tax is important but don’t fall into the trap of thinking the budget is just determined by world forces and oil or iron ore prices.In 2023-24 the government delivered a budget surplus of $15.8bn. It did not do this because it gained more revenue than expected; it delivered a surplus because even though at the time those on jobseeker were living well below poverty, the government chose not to do anything about it.It delivered a surplus because even though at the time nearly 22% of retirees were living in poverty, the government chose not to do anything about it.It delivered a surplus because it chose not to spend $16bn more on education or healthcare or social assistance or infrastructure or on assistance towards net zero.That is the reason a surplus was delivered – not tax.The impact of Trump 2.0 on Australia is evidence of how American we suddenly aren’t | Van BadhamRead moreThis year it looks as though the government is about to deliver a deficit of around $27bn. That is not because of poor company tax or events – but because the government has chosen not to raise more revenue.This year the government will spend around $4.8bn giving a fuel tax credit to the mining industry (which is not exactly struggling). The government will forgo $18.6bn in revenue due to giving the richest 10% a 50% discount on capital gains tax, and $20.3bn by giving tax breaks to the richest 10% so they can put money into superannuation.Had the government not chosen to do these things, the budget would have been in surplus.If the graph does not display, click hereBudgets are always about choicesTwo weeks ago the government’s ownEconomic Inclusion Advisory Committeereleased its 2025 report calling for jobseeker to be increased to 90% of the age pension.They called for this because jobseeker is currently well below the poverty line:If the graph does not display, click hereThe current base rate of the age pension is $1,047.10; if you include the supplements, it is $1,144.40.To raise jobseeker to 90% of the base rate would cost $3.5bn and to raise it to 90% of the total including supplements would cost $5.2bn.Again, think of what the government is choosing to spend its money on or give tax breaks to:If the graph does not display, click hereWill the government raise jobseeker? Probably not. But do not let them tell you they had no choice.All budgets are about choices – who they tax, who they give tax breaks to, what and who they spend money on, what and who they don’t. Nothing is unable to be changed. It is just about whether or not they care enough to change it.Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian budget 2025GrogonomicsLabor partyAustralian economyAustralian politicsAustralian election 2025TaxBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

Is it worth it?Wed 19 Mar 2025 08.03 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 13.29 EDTShareEight months on from being elected on thepromise of “change”, we’re beginning to see what Labour’s version of that looks like: sweeping cuts to the benefits system that have outraged charities, claimants and backbenchers alike.Plans to freeze the personal independence payment (Pip)have been droppedafter a backlash from Labour MPs. But eligibility for the benefit will be severely tightened. It is thought the move will deny support to about 1 million disabled people, including those who need help with washing, dressing themselves and ­eating.The long-hated work capability assessment will be scrapped, with all extra health support to come via Pip. The basic rate of universal credit (UC) will be raised for those able to seek work, while the highest level of UC – for the most disabled or ill people who have been found not fit to work – will go down for new claimants. New claimants with “the most severe, lifelong health conditions”, who will never be able to work, will see their incomes protected through an additional premium as well as an end to reassessments – but young people under the age of 22 could miss out on the health top up payment entirely.Added up, the package amounts to £5bn worth of cuts – the largest since George Osborneslashed benefits supporta decade ago.With the benefits bill rising and a record number of people off work owing to long-term illness, the government is banking on all this sounding reasonable. Surely everyone who can work should? But expose the plans to the most basic facts and they’re rotten with contradictions and cruelty.Even with the U-turn, the bulk of the cuts will fall on the Pip budget, despite the benefit having nothing to do with employment. Indeed, removing Pip – which is often used to pay for taxis, mobility aids and care staff – is more likely to push disabled people out of employment. Pip is also a “gateway benefit”, and ministers are yet to address whether those losing it could see their families lose vital carer’s allowance too.Meanwhile, the plan to reduce UC for thewhole “unfit to work category”will hit many severely ill and disabled people who will not be protected by the new premium. Ministers say this will “incentivise” people to stay in the work-search group, as if the reason a teacher confined to bed with ME quit her job is that she’s just not incentivised enough.This is austerity dressed up as reform, where the government cuts the money disabled people need to live on in order to balance the books, while claiming it’s all being done to help them.We have been here before. Over the past 15 years, successive coalition and Conservative governmentsrepeatedly targeted disability benefitsandother supportdisabled people rely on. I have documented the toll in these pages: thedistress, thedestitutionand thedeaths.Many of the same people reading headlines today about how their income will be stripped have already had theirMotabilty cartaken away,lost their adapted hometo the bedroom tax or beenpushed into debtto pay rising social care fees. If the lines you hear ministers parrot on their media rounds to justify these latest cuts sound familiar – that there is no money, that the genuinely disabled will be helped, that there is a duty to work – it is because you have been hearing them off and on for more than a decade. The difference this time round is it is a Labour government saying them.2:05Liz Kendall unveils Labour's 'action to fix the broken benefits system' – videoWe know from the last time we were here that low benefit rates do not get disabled people into work – they just get themto the local food bank. We know divisive rhetoric from politiciansincreases hate crimesagainst disabled people, just as we know austerity doesn’t save the economy money –it actually loses it. Making disabled people poorer or forcing them into work has, funnily enough, never made them better.Pat McFadden, the minister who oversees the royal family’s multibillion-pound estate,remarked on Tuesdaythat “you can’t tax and borrow your way out of the need to reform the state”. But you can tax the super-rich and use the cash to invest in disability support – Labour has simply chosen not to. It is a choice that is bordering on zealotry at this point, a“moral” missioncontrary to theadvice of economists.No Labour MP expected to vote the cuts through in the coming months can pretend they do not know where all this ends: the rules for Pip alone could see up to 1.2 million people lose between £4,200 and £6,300 a year,according to the Resolution Foundation, the majority of whom are already in some of the poorest households in the country. As one reader wrote to me last week: “I [pay a carer] to get help washing my hair and I couldn’t afford this without Pip. I’m so scared of losing support and any dignity and enjoyment in my small life.”Turning on the lights is a luxury in my family. These benefit changes will push us even closer to the edge | BrianRead moreBenefit cuts with a red rosette are in many ways no different from those stained blue. Joints still throb when the heating has to be switched off in winter. Stomachs still pang with hunger when there is only a biscuit for tea. And yet cuts signed off by aLabourchancellor are in a sense particularly brutal. They come with a tinge, not just of fear, but despair and betrayal. There is a feeling that, if this is life under the “good guys”, there really is no hope that anything will get better. Politicians, it turns out, really are all the same. That is the sort of loss that can’t be measured by a Treasury spreadsheet. It is also something that – once lost – is deeply hard to get back.The consequences of this will be a conversation for another day – think growing disfranchisement or ever-declining mental health – but for now, as the announcement of the cuts settles, let us return to what we know. People in this country who are already suffering will be going to bed with more worry tonight. Families who are struggling to pay the bills now will be pushed further below the breadline. Others who have long beenexcluded from everyday lifewill be more isolated and segregated.That it is a Labour government making “the moral case” for taking disabled people’s benefits is as perverse as it is shameful. Change, it turns out, is not coming for everyone.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist. Her latest book,Who Wants Normal?

It’s part of a visible new determination on the part of the governing party to trip up Farage and stymie his rising polling numbers. It may work. But it’s far from clear that it will.TheLabourparty clearly believes Reform has a vulnerability. Its socially conservative views – most notably on immigration and Brexit – appeal to a broad cross-party coalition of pro-free market, economically rightwing Tories and poorer, pro-redistribution former Labour voters. However, when it comes to economic policy, the interests of the two groups diverge quite sharply. If the electoral battleground in 2029 is the detail of economic policy, that will matter.The data bears this out to some extent. Reform is a victim of its own success. About80% of its 2024 votersvoted Tory in 2019. Yet those were Boris Johnson’s Tories, a collection of disenchanted voters who were as likely to have migrated to the Tories from Labour as from theBrexit party. The very diversity of this coalition means its members have different views on economic policy. Data from the British Election Study shows that while many 2024 Reform voters share the same authoritarian-leaning social values, their economic views areless cohesive: 42% of them oppose redistributive policies, while 33% favour them.In terms of actual party policy, Reform has to date leaned towards the small-state crowd rather than former Labour voters, whose economic preferences might be more interventionist. Behind the cover of its “contract” with the British people lay proposed tax cuts (estimated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) toamount to £90bn), a cut in the rate of corporation tax of 10%, cuts to government departments, tax relief for users of private healthcare, reforms to the benefits system and the scrapping of employment protections.Not, of course, that these mattered much at the last election.Just 2% of Reform voterssaid they voted for the party because of its tax policy versus 34% who said they did because of the party’s policies on immigration. The question is whether this situation is sustainable.There is of course always the possibility that Reform might adapt. One of the clearest contrasts between them and populist rightwing parties in continental Europe is that many of the latter have adopted relatively leftwing positions on the economy. Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom (PVV) successfully linkedmigration to housebuildingand social housing shortages and economic insecurity. TheAfD has been vocalin support for the minimum wage and pension protections for poorer households.Marine Le Penhas become much more interventionist in recent years, speaking in favour of social assistance for the poorest people.And there is a precedent for Farage to co-opt Labour policies if it helps his party in the polls. In the run-up to the 2015 general election,Ukip drifted leftwardsas it began to pick up votes from disaffected former Labour voters. The party’s manifesto opposed the privatisation of Royal Mail and favoured limiting zero-hours contracts, abolishing bedroom tax and establishing progressive taxation. One might assume from this that Farage is capable of a degree of ideological flexibility.And then there is the question as to whether Reform’s policies matter. In harvesting what was in effect a “none of the above” vote, the party benefited from the anti-incumbency wave that was a feature of so many elections in 2024. Many of those who cast their ballot for Reform are united not just by their socially conservative views but also by their apathy towards Westminster politics and scepticism of politicians’ abilities to make their lives better.In Reform UK’s power struggle, Farage takes on unusual role of moderate voiceRead moreNine months after the general election, these voters are already doubtful of the Labour government’s capabilities – 2024 Reform voters are by farthe most likelyof any party to say they think Labour is out of ideas and has no competent politicians.And so the government and “red wall” MPs can bang on all they like about the way Farage and co voted on theemployment rights bill. But if the government fails to deliver on its commitments to improve living standards and public services, and cut net migration, why would disaffected voters (who Reform is so good at attracting) listen to them?The more Reform can encourage people to tick the “none of the above” box, the less it matters what its actual policies are.Sophie Stowers is a researcher at UK in a Changing Europe.

How convenientRhiannon Lucy CosslettInstead of dismissing huge swaths of the population, how about a nuanced conversation about neurodivergence and mental health?Wed 19 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 04.24 EDTShareIs “overdiagnosis” the new culture-war buzzword of choice? I had been wondering this for a while, and then Wes Streeting claimed on Sunday that there is an “overdiagnosis” of some mental health conditions. Now I am certain it is.I first noticed the term being used in relation to anxiety and depression, then attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and most recently autism. Two books on overdiagnosis, Suzanne O’Sullivan’sThe Age of Diagnosisand Searching for Normal by Sami Timimi, have garnered attention across the media, adding fuel to a new fire that we might characterise as “Bloody everyone has a label these days, don’t they?”.This is not to say that these authors and medical professionals don’t have valid points, or that the medicalisation of societal issues isn’t of concern. We all know how “therapy speak” has leached into public discourse, how teens are now throwing around terms such as “trauma response” and “stimming” – lifted from earnest TikToks – with a confidence that must seem startling to some of their elders, who grew up with the idea that you only went to a shrink or a counsellor if there was something “wrong” with you, or you were about to get divorced.There is a generational aspect here, though really the divide is determined by our openness to examining our mental health. In some households, a faultline can develop between those who have had a diagnosis and therapy (often younger), and those who won’t countenance it (often older). Just look at Prince Harry, whose determination, after extensive therapy, totalk about the traumaof his mother’s death was considered ghastly and exhibitionist by those used to the stiff-upper-lip attitude of previous generations of royals. Post-traumatic stress disorder – a diagnosis I have had in the past – is another one of those conditions people like to claim isn’t real.We have all noticed that the autism spectrum has widened massively in the past three decades, partly owing to the removal of theAsperger’s diagnosis. When my brother was formally diagnosed at four years old, in 1997, you usually had to be what they then called “severe”. Nowadays, there are children who are verbal and able to be in mainstream school who have diagnoses. This surge deserves examination, too. However, I am not one of the people saying this must mean that those people aren’t autistic, or that they don’t face enormous challenges. Heterogenous and multifactoral disorders tend to be that way.It isn’t the existence of books on overdiagnosis that perturbs me. I have a lot of respect for the opinions of doctors, especially those who ask vital questions about how we treat patients with chronic illness, mental distress and neurodivergence. What is alarming is how the concept of overdiagnosis is being deployed by culture warriors as a battering ram to beat ill and disabled people with, to cast doubt on their diagnoses, to mock them and, inthe case of politicians, to justify further punitive cuts to their support systems.Take this paragraph from aSunday Times reviewof Timimi’s book: “Instead of operating on the Socratic principles of doctors talking with patients to find the emotional and historical source of their unhappiness, too many have pivoted to treating mental health like physical health. They diagnose their patients with a ‘disorder’, slap them with a pathologising label (ADHD, autism etc) and medicate them.”Where to start? The fact that autism andADHDaren’t mental illnesses? Autism and ADHD are neurodevelopmental disorders (they can both co-occur with mental-health issues). But what I find most troubling is the suggestion that doctors are slapping diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders on to patients willy nilly.Presumably we must now mistrust the neurologists, the developmental paediatricians, the psychiatrists, the geneticists and the speech and occupational therapists involved in a diagnosis? The parents who have noticed that their child is struggling to meet their milestones, the school special educational needs coordinators, and the GPs and health visitors who refer?I believe Labour cares about those in need, but it must show that. It can’t go on like this  | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe wait for anNHS autism assessment– and the meagre support that may result from it – is more than four years in some trusts. No one is simply “slapping” an autism diagnosis on anybody, at least not in the NHS. I do worry about the private market for diagnosis, though it is worth noting that in order for these diagnoses to be of any use, many boroughs require that they be reviewed by a panel of NHS experts.Amid all this ill-informed noise about overdiagnosis, there has been little discussion about what it is about Britain that makes so many people struggle to function within it, no real admission of the fact that this country has become quite a depressing place to live, or what has been done to an education system within which anxious and neurodivergent children are simply the canaries in the coalmine.This culture war places the onus on the individual to function within a brutal society that makes little effort to include or support them. It demonises patients as a starting point, and has real-world effects on people’s lives. It means people having to repeatedly justify their diagnoses or those of their children, even to others in their families. It means people having tofight harder for supportfor themselves or their children. It means being confronted with people parroting lines like: “ADHD? What he needs is a good smack.” It means a general atmosphere of ignorance and contempt.Sick people, disabled people and the parents who advocate for their children, as well as the professionals who support them, deserve far better than this unkindness. The measure of our society lies in how we treat our vulnerable. As it stands, it is downright nasty.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And yet inaction and censorship reignWed 19 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 04.25 EDTShareIsrael’s genocide was only on pause: for Palestinians woken on Monday night by a vicious wave of airstrikes, the resumption was no less shocking. More than400 people– many of them children – were slaughtered in a matter of hours, in an assault that reportedly received the “green light”from Donald Trump. This mayhem was swiftly followed by evacuation orders – that is, forced displacement – raising the possibility of renewed ground operations. Israel’s excuse? A confected claim that Hamas hasn’t observed the terms of January’s so-called ceasefire agreement – the terms of which Israel itself has broken over and over again.In the wake of the attacks,CNN reportedthat Israel’s onslaught threw “doubt on the fragile ceasefire”. Orwellian doesn’t even begin to describe such framing. As it is, there was no “ceasefire”: not if your definition is firing ceasing. Asingle Israelihas been reported to have died in Gaza during the “ceasefire”: a contractor killed by the Israeli army, who mistook him for a Palestinian. A reported150 Palestinianshave been killed in Gaza during this “ceasefire”, and dozens others butchered in the West Bank.Here is an example of how Israeli violence is endlessly indulged and Palestinian life is stripped of any meaning. If just one Israeli soldier had been killed by a Hamas militant, I predict many politicians and media outlets would have immediately pronounced the ceasefire over. This same narrative is why we are led to believe that peace prevailedbefore 7 October, even when 238 Palestinians – 44 of them children– had been killed in the previous nine months.Future generations may well ask: “How was a crime that obscene facilitated for so long?” After all, thanks to mobile phones and the internet, no crime in history has been so well documented by its victims as it happened. As they have done for 529 days, Gaza’s survivors post the evidence of their own extermination on social media, hoping – in vain – that enough consciences will be pricked to end the genocidal mayhem. A dead baby in a rainbow jumpsuit; a grieving father playing with the pigtail of his daughter for the last time; entire families covered in shrouds, their bloodlines wiped from the civil registry.No crime has been so evidenced by experts as it happened. Last week, anew UN reportdetailed Israel’s sexual and reproductive violence: like the killing of pregnant women, the rape of male detainees with objects ranging from vegetables to broomsticks, thedestruction of an IVF clinicwith its 4,000 embryos. Waging war on Palestinians’ ability to reproduce were termed “genocidal acts”.There are limitless examples of other such acts. Report after report has detailed Israel’s destruction of civilian infrastructure – homes, hospitals, schools, universities, mosques, churches; itsobliteration of 83%of all plant life,more than 80%of agricultural land,95% of cattle; and its ruin of more than80% of waterand sanitation infrastructure. Israel has deliberately and systematically rendered Gaza uninhabitable. This is why – from Amnesty International toscholars such as Omer Bartov, the world-renowned Israeli-American professor of Holocaust and genocide studies – there is a consensus among the relevant specialists that Israel is committing genocide.And no crime has been so confessed to by its perpetrators as it happened. Israel announced a total blockade on all humanitarian aid entering Gaza 17 days ago, an incontrovertible violation of international law. Last week, Israel’s environmentminister declaredthe “only solution for the Gaza Strip is to empty it of Gazans”, one of countless statements of criminal and genocidal intent made by Israeli leaders and officials in the past 17 months. Israel has made no attempt to disguise its belief that the civilian population has collective guilt – “human beasts” who deserve only “damage” and “hell”, asone Israeli generalsaid at the start – or its intent toraze Gazato the ground. Israeli soldiers havejoyously postedtheir crimes online, whooping, cheering, singing as they detonated civilians’ homes and abused detainees.How can an obscenity so documented, evidenced and confessed to – an obscenity facilitated by western weapons and diplomatic support – persist for so long? No one in western politics or media circles can plausibly say, “I did not know what was really happening.”In a rational world, cheerleaders of this abomination would be regarded as monsters with no place in public life. You cannot, after all, justify the Rwandan genocide and expect anything other than to become a pariah. But it is those who opposed Israel’s depravity who have beendeplatformed,shut down,censored,sacked,arrestedand – in the case of the Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil – detained and potentiallydeported.For Palestinians, this was never a ceasefire | Dalia HartuqaRead moreBy turning the world on its head, the most brazen and systematic attack on free speech in the west since McCarthyism has achieved its primary goal: widespread silence over a crime of historic proportions among those with power and influence. There are politicians who have unequivocally called this crime what it is, but they are marginalisedand disciplined. There are mainstream journalists whospeak the truth, but they are few. There are celebrities who use their platform to tell the truth – such as Gary Lineker,Paloma Faith,Khalid AbdalaandJuliet Stevenson– but they are isolated.The silent are scared about their careers and incomes, and not irrationally so. But Gaza’s survivors are scared about starvation, disease, being burned alive and suffocated under rubble. Silence in the face of injustice is always a sin; when your government is facilitating genocide, it is a moral crime. In every atrocity in history, the silent are always principal players.If allthose who know a terrible evil is being committed spoke out, what would now happen? Ministers would resign from governments. Newspapers and news bulletins would not only lead with Israel’s atrocities, they would correctly frame them as heinous crimes, underpinned with a drumbeat – that something drastic must be done to stop them. Demands for anarms embargoand sanctions on Israel would become impossible to ignore. Rather than those who opposed genocide being hounded and vilified, it would be those complicit in genocide who would be emptied from public life.Many of the silent undoubtedly feel guilt, and they should. Through their cowardice, they have played a pivotal role in normalising some of the worst barbarism of the 21st century. Ending silence doesn’t involve handwringing and platitudes about how sad you are about civilians dying: it means calling a crime for what it is, and demanding accountability for those who facilitated it. Time is running out for the traumatised, maimed, starving people of Gaza. So is time for those who want to salvage their conscience.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As legal tobacco prices have soared, criminal networks have profited by undercutting legal products, offering smokers a cheaper alternative that circumvents regulation and taxation. This underground economy has expanded dramatically in recent years, fuelling criminal turf wars andundercutting tax revenues.Thesporadic but aggressive increases in tobacco exciseare the primary driver of the illicit trade. Australia’s policy, implemented with the dual aim of reducing smoking rates and boosting government coffers, has created some of theworld’s highest cigarette prices. Despite mounting evidence of unintended consequences,and prior knowledge of these risks, government officials remain inflexible, rejecting even temporary pauses in tax hikes.Proponents of ever-increasing tobacco taxes often dismiss industry opposition through what they call the “scream test” – the notion that the louder tobacco companies protest, the more effective a policy must be. This simplistic reasoning conveniently ignores a troubling reality: while prices have increased due to the excise tax, Big Tobacco’s profit margins have also increased considerably.Before taxes are applied, Australia’s cigarette prices rank among the highest in the world, suggesting that the “big three” cigarette manufacturers have opportunistically used tax increases as cover for their own price gouging.Burning out: how Australia’s bid to cut smoking rates exploded into suburban tobacco warsRead moreWhile public health advocates continue to recite theWorld Health Organisation’s mantrathat taxation represents “the single most effective and cost-effective measure” to reduce smoking in the population, the evidence supporting this claim in Australia is weak in recent years. Despite the policy’s centrality to our tobacco control strategy, no formal evaluation has been published since the major tax increases started in 2010 – an astonishing oversight for such a consequential intervention.Much has changed over the past two decades. Prices are much higher and smoking rates have fallen, becoming increasingly concentrated in disadvantaged groups in the community. The absence of rigorous assessment should raise serious questions about whether assumptions and ideology, rather than evidence, are driving policy decisions.Available data paints a picture at odds with tax advocates’ confident assertions.Smokingrates have declined remarkably – but at similar rates during periods with and without significant tax increases. This suggests minimal impact from the tax hikes themselves.The graphs below display two trends from 2000 to 2022-23: the percentage of adults who smoke daily (according to theNational Drug Strategy household survey from 2000 to 2022-23) and the price breakdown of a common cigarette brand (showing both tax and pre-tax components).Line graph on daily smoking prevalenceBar chart on price per cigaretteThe relationship between cigarette pricing and consumption appears far more complex than the simplistic elasticity models upon which policy has been based. The fact that smoking rates fell during periods of price stability indicates that shifting social attitudes and cultural norms around tobacco use, as well as policies such as smoke-free areas, are playing significant roles in reducing smoking prevalence. This nuance has been largely ignored in policy discussions fixated on tax as a silver bullet.Furthermore, the growth of the black market fundamentally undermines the health aims of the tobacco excise. By creating parallel distribution channels offering cigarettes far below retail prices, high taxes have expanded access to cheaper tobacco products. For price-sensitive smokers, the black market provides an alternative to quitting. This diminishes the intended health benefits of tax rises. It also deprives the government of billions in revenue and enriches criminal enterprises.This is particularly troubling when we consider who bears the heaviest burden of these taxes. Those unable to quit are disproportionately and increasingly concentrated among disadvantaged groups who are least able to absorb these financial imposts. The policy effectively functions as a regressive tax, deepening inequality and penalising the poor. This might be justified to the extent that tax increases are saving lives, but it is not clear that the policy is delivering on its public health promise.Smoking remains a vitally important public health issue. A comprehensive, evidence-based review of Australia’s tobacco pricing strategy is long overdue. We need an honest accounting of both the benefits and costs of pricing policies, acknowledging the complex interplay between pricing, social factors and illicit markets. Without such analysis, we risk continuing a policy approach that imposes significant economic hardship on disadvantaged smokers and may not deliver proportionate public health gains – and inadvertently strengthening organised crime.The time has come to look beyond ideological commitments and engage with the uncomfortable reality we find ourselves in.Edward Jegasothy PhD is a senior lecturer at the Sydney school of public health at the University of Sydney.

As a thrilling exhibition opens in ‘Britain’s California’, we enter a heady world of coffinboards, hotdogging Aussies – and bans dished out to gangs fighting on the beachStuart JeffriesWed 19 Mar 2025 11.47 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 13.36 EDTShare‘Ihad no friends,” says Charlotte Banfield, a gold medal-winning world para surf champion. “And no interests. I was very depressed. It was all going to end very badly indeed for me.” Banfield – who has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and autism, and was being bullied at school – thought of taking her life. But then, aged 13, she was enrolled by her mum in a six-week surfing course run bythe Wave Project, which helps to improve children’s confidence and ease their anxiety through riding breakers. It was a pivotal moment, not least because Banfield was about to be excluded from school.Her first surf class was a disaster, though. “I ran away and locked myself in the car. I had a phobia of water. I couldn’t stand it on my skin.” But something – perhaps the sense that there was “no pressure” – brought her back. “When I went up on my first wave, I felt free for the first time in my life.” This liberation turned her life around. “I went back into education and, though I left school with no GCSEs, I got a masters in marine biology.Surfinggave me confidence.”There aren’t many sports where you could be eaten by a wild animalIt gave her more than that – it gave her gold. Banfield’s medal-winning achievement is celebrated in Surf! 100 Years of Waveriding inCornwall, an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall (NMMC) in Falmouth, her home town. “It was an honour when I won a gold and beyond an honour to get mentioned in this museum,” says the 26-year-old as we chat in its cafe. “I used to come here on school trips. I remember hiding from teachers in the boats on display.”Although surfing dates back thousands of years, and is particularly associated with Polynesians who settled in Hawaii about 400AD, the pursuit has become as much part of Cornwall’s heritage as pasties, piracy and painting. There is a Cornish word that helps explain why: “mordros”, meaning the ever-present sound of the sea. You don’t get that in Wolverhampton. Then there’s the light. “In Cornwall,” writes geographer Dr Sam Bleakley, “we are bathed in reflected light from the Atlantic.”View image in fullscreenHang 100 … the record-breaking surfboard at Fistral beach in 1999.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/Bleakley, a European longboard champion and senior lecturer in cultural tourism at Falmouth University, curated the show at the NMMC. He says surfing is different in Cornwall, thanks to the soft sandy beaches that dot its 422 miles (680km) of surfable coastline from Bude to Falmouth. “You can ride in the shallows in a way that is different from the surf breaks of Polynesia,” he says. What’s more, this county is wide open to the Atlantic swell all year round. One of the great pleasures, says Cornish-born former pro Robyn Davies, is rising up on a wave that has travelled 4,000 miles across the ocean before smashing into Porthleven, Porthmeor, Penzance or Perranporth.The history the show tells is of a Cornish surf culture rising on a tide swollen by foreign influences. What Bleakley calls the “tin-mining diaspora” witnessed surfing in Tahiti, Hawaii, west and south Africa – not least off Muizenberg near Cape Town, where Agatha Christie reportedly surfed in 1922. Boards and the surf bug came back with these travellers and, by 1937, the railways were advertising glorious, sun-drenched surfing holidays in the West Country.During the second world war, US troops stationed at RAF St Mawgan near Newquay reportedly enchanted locals with their daredevil techniques. But it was four Australian lifeguards – Bob Head, Ian Tiley, John Campbell and Warren Mitchell – who revolutionised surfing in Cornwall when they arrived 63 years ago, astounding Newquay locals with their “hotdog surfing” on fibreglass longboards. To the sound of the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean playing from pirate radio stations, surfing became part of the swinging 60s.View image in fullscreenUnique light … professional longboarder Izzy Henshall at Cornwall’s Sennen Cove.Photograph: Luke GartsideSurfboard artisans sprang up, their slick creations now celebrated in the show. Among them is Chris “CJ” Jones who sculpted boards from wood, carbon fibre, paint and even recycled plastics. “They were and remain works of art,” says Stuart Slade, NMM’s director as he shows me around.By the late 1960s, Newquay was being branded as Surf City – and Cornwall as Britain’s California. That said, surfing was once banned after feuding gangs of bodyboarders and longboarders (surfing’s equivalent of mods and rockers) brawled on the beaches of Newquay. Ostensibly the most chillaxed of pastimes, surfing became regarded by some as a violent threat to public order.This is one of the many tensions explored in the show. Surfing is both a tourist money spinner and counter-cultural lifestyle. It has also involved the Californication of Cornwall, pitting swinging surfers against strait-laced stuffed shirts. Ever since surfing became an Olympic sport in 2020, another tension has become clear. Is waveriding, like skateboarding or BMX-ing, fundamentally a sport whose essentially rebellious nature can only get lost in the competition for medals or world records?Whatever the answer, Cornwall has become a breeding ground for world champions and industries that recognise surfing’s therapeutic benefits and wish to make it a sport for all. On that last point, I am struck by the displays of surf couture in the show, from wet suits so tight they’re almost fetish wear, to a loose-fitting, body-covering surfing hijab designed by local firm Finisterre.View image in fullscreen‘Times seems to extend’ … Cornwall’s Robyn Davies rides waves in the Indian Ocean.Photograph: Courtesy O’Neill © T. GibaudBleakley’s nicest conceit is to tell the story of the past 100 years through 100 surfboards. One is a coffinboard, so named because in the 1920s the first bodyboards were made by carpenters who specialised in coffins. There’s a photo of one being held by a female surfer at Fistral beach in 1926, sticking it to West Country patriarchs who deemed surfing unsuitable for women.By contrast, there’s a wall of gleaming lacquered boards, one designed by Damien Hirst, whose former partner, California-born Maia Norman, is a keen surfer. Hirst’s designs were auctioned in 2003 for the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage. Nearby, we encounter a surfboard found in a Newquay garden and dusted off for the show. Once the world’s longest board, it’s 37ft long and looks like the kind of thing Team GB would use if the six-person bobsleigh ever switched to the sea.For all the show’s surf positivity, Banfield’s rise suffered setbacks, not least in 2021 when a seizure hit during a surf competition in California. “It was so humiliating,” she says. “I was underwater for a minute and couldn’t move. My body felt so heavy. I had to be helped by another surfer.”View image in fullscreenSticking it to West Country patriarchs… female surfers in Watergate Bay in 1950.Photograph: courtesy of Alex Williams collection.Worse was to come. “I was banned from competition until I got my epilepsy under control. That made me incredibly depressed. I went to a very dark place. I tried to take my own life. It was very clear to me that the ocean had kept me sane. When I go in the water, my mind becomes completely calm.”Happily, with some coaching and medication adjustments, Banfield was able to start competing again. Last year, she won another gold at the world championships. “I still have bad days,” she says. “When I do, I get my surfboard, get my wetsuit, get in the car and go.”Davies, many times national surfing champion, echoes this sentiment. “Surfing’s almost a spiritual experience. It’s humbling – because you find out very quickly that you can’t master nature. But the very present danger is also an adrenaline rush. The epitome of this is when you get barrelled.” Eh? She cups her fingers to show me: barrelling means riding inside a hollowed-out breaking wave. “Time seems to extend. You feel like you’ve been in there for ages when it’s scarcely been seconds. It’s pure stoke. Epic.”I hit bottom and pushed off with my feet – only to hit rock. I thought I was going to drownIt also sounds quite dangerous. “It is – but then surfing is dangerous and exhilarating at the same time. There aren’t many sports where you could be eaten by a wild animal. I’ve seen sharks, which is scary. And, in Mexico, I’ve been very close to whales breaching.” This is when they propel their bodies out of the water and land back on the surface with explosive force. Davies lists more dangers: “Seals have nibbled my toes.” That doesn’t sound too scary, I say. “They were really big seals,” she replies.Then there was the time she wiped out at Pipeline in Hawaii, a reef break notorious for rip currents and underwater caves. “I hit bottom and pushed off with my feet – only to hit rock. I thought I was going to drown, until I saw a gap and managed to swim to the surface.”A car crash ended Davies’s competitive career, but she still longboards and insists that it’s never too late to learn. “I taught an 80-year-old woman whose dream it was to stand on a board. She did it! I’m not saying it’s easy, though. When you swim out to where the waves are, through foaming white water, it’s hard – but it’s worth it. I’ve never felt a connection with nature like it. I’ve never felt so good as when I’m surfing.”Surf!is at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, Falmouth, 28 March to January 2027.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

You’re not supposed to say that, but even though I was working class and we were in the thick of it, I didn’t experience any violence directly. I experienced the warmth of working-class communities on both sides, Catholic and Protestant, and the power of community in the fight for things like justice, fairness and equality. I learned about those principles mostly through women.Belfast was a very patriarchal place, but women always seemed to be the ones making the most sense. If you look at UN statistics for when women are at negotiating tables, the chances of reaching peace agreements are much higher. Then, if they stay at the table, the peace agreement lasts longer. In different parts of the world that I’ve been commissioned to shoot, like Sudan or Beirut, I’ve met many different women but they all have the same ability to cut through the shit, yet they’re not given any power.This was taken in 2023 when I was back in Belfast working on a show of 21 portraits for Ulster museum calledPrincipled and Revolutionary: Northern Irish Peace Women. It was to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. I wanted to capture the often untold stories of the women who were influential to peace-building in Northern Ireland, to pay tribute to their work.If I have an idea for a female protagonist, I go out into the world and hope our paths crossWhile I was there, in my head I was carrying this image with a mural that I kept suppressing, because it’s a tourist image in a way. My process is that if I have an idea for a particular female protagonist, I will go into the world and hope our paths will cross. I was in a vintage shop and this girl walked in looking exactly as she looks in the picture. She seemed so strong, so forceful to be going through Belfast dressed like this, and probably putting up with a lot of shit from the street because of it.I thought: “You’re amazing.” Projecting this hyper-feminised character, she was a real “Fuck you” to the male violence and oppression. I gave her my card, told her how much she’d get paid, what the picture would be about, and to go home and look me up and think about it. But she said yes right away. The next day, we walked around Belfast and talked about her life, and she was everything that I was projecting on to her. She wasn’t afraid of authority, like me when I was young. I think that might be quite a Belfast, Northern-Irish thing.A touch of class: an authentic glimpse of Britain – in picturesRead moreEventually, I decided I needed a mural, because the image I wanted to create was about male aggression and control. We went to an area called Sandy Row, which used to be a very Protestant area. The mural was on the wrong side of the street, because I knew I had to point the camera in the direction of those dark skies, with the sunlight and then the seagulls coming from the port that, for me, is Belfast. I knew this was a lucky picture. When you’re making a picture, you’re hoping the gods of photography are with you. There’s a transcendence that happens. I chose the frame that seemed most strident – and then, in Photoshop, I lifted the mural from one side of the street and put it on to the other.I’m not a documentary photographer. I am interested in cinema and how you elicit emotion. I’ve always constructed images, to extend the narrative of the picture and remind the viewer that photography is a constructed medium. These pictures are exhibited large on a gallery wall. You can stand and look at all the details, and think about how you have derived meaning from these clues – and see how photography manipulates us.After the End of History: British Working Class Photography 1989 – 2024 is atStills Gallery, Edinburghfrom 21 March until 28 JuneView image in fullscreenPhotograph: @maureenpaleyHannah Starkey’s CVBorn:Belfast, 1971Trained:Edinburgh Napier University Edinburgh, Royal College of Art London.Influences:“Women and photography.”High point:“There have been many.

Tubs songs might jangle deceptively with intricate riffs and Teenage Fanclub-style harmonies, but the words are loaded with self-laceration. Manipulative, irritating, sycophantic, unreliable: these are just some of the ways Williams portrays himself on record.The 32-year-old seems none of those things when I meet him at a Wetherspoon’s in the band’s native south-east London where, over a succession of pints, he cheerfully explains how the Tubs has always been a vehicle to “do a hatchet job” on himself. “Sometimes I actually end up painting myself as a lot more unlikable than I am,” he admits. “But I’ve always liked lyrics that can be brutal.”View image in fullscreenCotton Crown by the TubsWilliams’s life was in the doldrums when the band recorded their 2023 debut Dead Meat. His previous group, noise-rock outfitJoanna Gruesome, had split in 2017 and new projects – including an attempt to publish a novel – had all fizzled out. Williams says he had “zero expectations” that anyone outside his circle would care about the Tubs, whom he formed with fellow Joanna Gruesome members Max Warren and George Nicholls, and who are these days completed by drummer Taylor Stewart, along with occasional guest vocals from Lan McArdle, also formerly of Joanna Gruesome.“We just turned up and bashed that first album out,” says Williams. “We didn’t actually put much effort into it.”Whether that’s true or not (and with its unusual hooks and harmonies, Dead Meat certainly didn’t sound bashed out), Williams is adamant that they’ve tried a lot harder on its follow-up. Cotton Crown is full of songs about Williams’s relationship woes, told with bleak humour. (“Took a bit of what I think was speed,” is certainly one way of beginning a love song.) But what really sets it apart from its predecessor is the inclusion of final track Strange, which deals with the death of Charlotte Greig, Williams’s mother, by suicide in 2014.The Tubs: Cotton Crown review – a blistering, joy-to-heartbreak masterpieceRead moreWilliams says he had been trying unsatisfactorily to write about his mother for years until he stumbled on a way in: writing not about her death directly so much as the social awkwardness and bizarre situations that he faced in the immediate aftermath. “Sometimes when everyone’s high / They ask me what it’s like / If I’m all right,” he sings. “I say it makes me more interesting / Then they laugh / And then it’s all fine.” Most jolting of all is the way he recalls finding out the method she used to kill herself by reading an article in WalesOnline.Williams has a keen, almost novelistic eye for the minutiae of day-to-day interactions – sending up both himself and the well-meaning folk who tried to console him. “At the wake someone took my hand / Said that I should write a song about this,” sings Williams at the song’s end. “Well, whoever the hell you were / I’m sorry, I guess this is it.”“I don’t think you can really touch on what it’s actually like [to lose your mother],” he says. “It’s too big. But in a perverse sort of way, writing about it from this angle has given it some kind of emotional heft.”Williams’s mother was a writer and musician, too. Her beautiful debut album, 1998’s Night Visiting Songs, was a mix of original tracks and reimagined folk standards thatwas the focus of a Guardian profile in 2023. Williams grew up in a home full of various touring folk musicians, and his love of the genre clearly influenced his vocal style, which is often compared to that of a young Richard Thompson.The sleeve for Cotton Crown also features his mother – she’s photographed in a graveyard, breastfeeding Williams as a baby. The picture was originally used in a vinyl release of hers which Williams has carried around with him from home to home. “It felt appropriate to use it because the fact I was having a breakdown was very linked to her. She’s kind of in the background of all the songs on the record, not just Strange,” he says. It is, he admits, yet another peculiar aspect of her death that her image is now acting as a kind of promotional tool for his album. “Now that the vinyls have started arriving at my house, it does feel a bit much. Sometimes I think: should I have done that?”Another thing Williams has refused to shy away from in his songwriting is the reality of living with poor mental health. His struggles with obsessive compulsive disorder were laid bare on earlier songs such as Round the Bend. Cotton Crown continues the excavations: on Narcissist, he sings about wanting to hook up with a potential sociopath in order to distract himself from more existential thoughts.He hopes his lyrics act as an antidote to the romanticisation of mental illness. “Everyone has sympathy for [people with] mental illness in a kind of abstract way,” says Williams. “But that doesn’t really work in an intimate relationship or friendship. Sometimes people who are mentally ill are really fucking annoying. Anxious people are annoying! Especially if you have something like OCD and you’re constantly asking for reassurance about some catastrophic fear that you’ve become obsessed with.”Williams paints an equally unforgiving picture of being a musician in the modern world – one in which nobody makes any money any more, and any glamour associated with indie rock has long since vanished: “When you’re dating, telling someone you’re in a jangle-pop band is basically a red flag these days,” he says, laughing. It has to be said, few would be tempted to sign up for the rock’n’roll lifestyle after listening to Dead Meat’s title track, in which Williams explores the previously untapped subject of simultaneously running out of beans and the steroid cream you use to treat a stubborn groin rash.View image in fullscreen‘I like writing lyrics that can be brutal’ … The Tubs at their rehearsal spacePhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianWhat the Tubs document so well is that period in life in between young adulthood and middle-age, when the party lifestyle starts to seem less carefree, and adult issues are more prone to intrusion. In this sense it shares a similarity with Charli xcx’s Brat, albeit a much scruffier Brat that grew up listening to early REM and Hüsker Dü.Williams laughs off the comparison but says that he has noticed that the songs do strike a particular chord with men in their 30s. “Guys over the last decade have maybe felt this pressure to be living more virtuously,” he says. “And some of them have said that our music makes them feel like they don’t have to be this super-virtuous, perfect person – but they also don’t have to be a misogynistic arsehole either. There’s, like, a third way.”That way is a throwback to pre-social media times, before everybody felt monitored and the music business became slickly professionalised. “I think other bands practise a lot more than we do,” says Williams. “We might run through the set once and be like, ‘Can we go to the pub now?’”As for playing live – at present Williams says they can only handle that by getting extremely drunk beforehand. “It’s maybe a bit unsustainable. The drinking in the band can be quite exhausting. We always feel like every show is a big deal, and we probably overcompensate for that.”Not all chaos is good chaos. On the eve of their sold out gig at Moth Club in London last December, their bassist Max was hit by a car and hospitalised, meaning it had to be cancelled. “We immediately started treating it like a joke, posting pictures from his hospital bed,” says Williams. “Then he went to ICU with blood clots on his lungs. It was quite dicey. I was thinking – if he dies, will we have to take those Instagram posts down?” Fortunately Max pulled through, although he’s still in a wheelchair.The same month also saw the departure of Nicholls, whose spidery, Johnny Marr-like guitar lines elevated the songs (for all Williams’s claims of minimal rehearsing, the band can undoubtedly play). Nicholls is off to focus on his career lecturing at Goldsmiths, University of London, but Williams is adamant that the Tubs are only just getting started. In fact they’ve already written album number three, which apparently has a northern soul-infused sound. Creativity comes easily to Williams – he writes songs and stories constantly. And despite the struggles and the squalor of being a musician in 2025, he concedes that it’s a pretty good life overall.“It’s not like I need to buy clothes or whatever it is that people buy,” he says. “All I need to get by is food and pints.”And so with that in mind, we get another round in.The Tubs tour the UK and Irelanduntil 5 April.

So why is the groundbreaking 80s design collective so little known?Charlie PorterWed 19 Mar 2025 07.14 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 07.16 EDTShareHow do we tell histories, particularly queer histories, when they are ignored by the establishment? In 1986, a loose design collective of around eight people named the House of Beauty and Culture started a shop in Dalston, east London. At the time, Dalston was a desolate area, nothing like the fashionable neighbourhood it is today. The House of Beauty and Culture was so unconventional, it barely ever opened.Its output included shoes, furniture, garments, jewellery and art. Much of the work was made from salvaged materials, for both aesthetic and financial reasons: the collective were all broke. The floor of the shop was scattered with loose change, as a joke on their collective lack of money. Their romantic, fragile work was made against the backdrop of Margaret Thatcher’s Britain, in the shadow of the Aids crisis.View image in fullscreenThe House of Beauty and Culture founder and shoe designer John Moore.Photograph: Cindy Palmano/© Cindy Palmano courtesy of Kasia MaciejowskaIt only lasted a few years, but the impact of the shop was so great that, according to legend, the artist and fashion designer Martin Margiela first turned to deconstruction after his visit. In 2015, a Louis Vuitton menswear show was inspired by the collective: its then designer, Kim Jones, was an avid collector of their work. And yet, today, no pieces by its protagonists are held in the permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, nor theDesignMuseum. In our institutions, it’s like HOBAC never existed.To me, HOBAC has always seemed from a parallel universe, with creative freedom totally at odds with the crippling environment of today’s London. For the past five years, I’ve been writing a novel,Nova Scotia House, attempting to reconnect with queer philosophies and alternate ways of living from the 70s and 80s. The primary focus is HIV/Aids, and the underexplored repercussions of that pandemic. But also central to the narrative are stories of queer creative acts, like HOBAC, that have been underacknowledged. It’s not just their work, it’s how they worked: communally, collaboratively, outside heteronormative value systems.Its members includedJohn Moore, the shoemaker who founded the collective;Judy Blame, a jeweller and stylist who went on to art direct the debut albums by Neneh Cherry and Massive Attack;Richard Torry, who worked in knitwear, and the designerChristopher Nemeth, known for making garments from old postal sacks. Within fashion circles, these names are known and respected. It is the furniture makersFrick & Frackwho to me seem entirely excluded from cultural discourse.View image in fullscreenAlan MacDonald of Frick & Frack, for Vanity, 1986.Photograph: © Cindy Palmano courtesy of Kasia MaciejowskaThe duo, Alan MacDonald and Fritz Solomon, often made pieces that looked as if they should fall over. Chairs of salvaged wood seem to not have enough support to hold them up; lamps of bent pipe have the lightbulb so far from the base it is as if they will topple. Found objects became visual jokes, like a table made from a stolen parking restriction sign, or a chair seat made from the cover of an old parking meter that reads “NO: WAITING, LOADING, UNLOADING”.Their friendDave Babywould often add provocative carvings to the furniture. According to Kasia Maciejowska’s 2016 book on HOBAC,Boy George ordered a set of two tables and four chairs from Frick & Frack, with penises carved into the armrests by Dave Baby. The work wasn’t cheap: they charged George £4,000, the equivalent of about £11,700 today. The value was in the craft, rather than the materials used: Frick & Frack’s make was exquisite, even if the look was raw.View image in fullscreenDave Baby and Judy Blame, for Vanity, 1986.Photograph: © Cindy Palmano courtesy of Kasia MaciejowskaMany of their friends still live with their pieces, nearly four decades on. This was how I wanted to depict the work in my novel: radical furniture, made within a community, that was part of everyday life, indeed that made living better, but was unrepresented in institutions. Those living with the furniture are now entering late midlife and late life: what happens to the legacy when they are gone?Frick & Frack’s work is often confused with that ofAndy Marshall, AKA Andy the Furniture Maker, a gay man who was also making furniture with salvaged materials. Recently, a 1986 documentary about Andy has become cult viewing online, raising his profile. But, just like Frick & Frack, no work by Andy the Furniture Maker can be found in the V&A nor the Design Museum.Andy was close friends with the artistDerek Jarman, as were members of HOBAC. Today, Jarman is widely known for his films, books, and his Dungeness home Prospect Cottage, with its shingle garden. Still to be more widely acknowledged is his art – there has yet to be a Jarman retrospective at Tate Britain – and his experiments in living as a young man. In the 1970s, Jarman and his friends made homes in a series of abandoned warehouses on the South Bank of the Thames.We can particularly see Jarman’s philosophy of living in his first film,Studio Bankside, 1971, and the last,Glitterbug, a compilation of Super 8 footage released posthumously. He makes art, he reads, he thinks, they party, they play. It is Jarman’s design of living that matters, like a hammock strung across a room: pleasure is essential. Of course, the easy response is that no one can live that way any more, that the cost of living is too great. But a re-creation of the past is not the point, it is about learning from the past. Such learning can only happen when our queer legacies are brought to light.Nova Scotia House by Charlie Porter review – radical visions of gay 90s LondonRead moreCrucially, this is not about deification. It can feel as if Jarman has been elevated to sainthood, spoken about as though he were an overlord of UK queer culture. Actually, he was separate from much of counterculture. In the catalogue forthe Tate’s current Leigh Bowery show, Torry writes that while Bowery “appreciated Derek being open about his sexuality, he hated Derek’s aesthetic, which he found too earnest.”HOBAC and Jarman are influences on my novel, but so too are illegal raves and lawless gay bars, the ecosystems of which to me are the result of creative acts. I was thinking aboutGideon Berger, the DJ and co-founder ofthe NYC Downlow, Glastonbury’s queer club that’s been running during the festival since 2007, often described as the best party in the world.Berger grew up in south London in the 80s and early 90s, obsessed with pirate radio. He went to illegal raves and squat parties, eventually setting up his own queer sound system. When nightlife is historicised, it is usually clubs that are listed or promoted, rather than the ephemeral or the outlier. In my novel, I wanted to show illegal rave culture as embedded in queer experience.It’s also the creative nourishment that comes from the seemingly squalid. A gay bar is more than just booze and a backroom. It is the philosophies with which they are established and run, just as vital as the something-from-nothing ethics of HOBAC. A prime example isthe Joiners Arms, an east London after-hours gay bar opened with intentional permissiveness.View image in fullscreenThe Joiners Arms in 2007.Photograph: Jonathan Player/Shutterstock“The Joiners is a theoretical impossibility,” its late landlord David Pollard told writer Paul Flynn for a 2008 i-D feature. “That’s one of its joys. It shouldn’t exist, legally even. But if enough people want to have fun they can sustain somewhere like it.”The Joiners closed in 2015. What matters is the seriousness with which it took pleasure. It changed my life. From 2008-2012, I co-ran a weekly party on Thursday nights at the Joiners called Macho City. At the time, I was a jobbing journalist at the tipping point of mainstream print media’s decline. Before, I’d spent most nights at the Joiners hogging the jukebox to play Sylvester records. We started the party to keep late disco and Hi-NRG in the contemporary conversation. Each week, it was wild. It opened my eyes to what else I could do. The party in the Joiners led to me being able to write books.Try to write these histories as nonfiction, and so much would be blank. So much was not recorded at the time, inevitable in communities that face discrimination, or was misrepresented in homophobic media. So many died in the Aids crisis, their stories now gone.Institutions such as the V&A and the Design Museum can, and should, act to ensure queer histories are represented, before they are lost. In the meantime, to get to the heart of these stories, close to what feels to me like truth, all I could do was write fiction.Nova Scotia House by Charlie Porter is published by Particular (£18.99).

Ubisoft’s historical fiction is perennially almost-great. A lot of players would say it reached its peak in the late 2000s, with the trio of renaissance Italy games beginning with Assassin’s Creed 2, and their charismatic hero, Ezio Auditore. Since then, the series has become bloated, offering hundreds of hours of repetitive open-world exploration and assassination in ancient Greece, Egypt and even Viking Britain. Odyssey (the Greek one) was the last I played seriously; I found the setting exquisite, the gameplay somewhat irritating and the scale completely overwhelming.The Assassin’s Creed games are extraordinary works of historical fiction, fastidiously recreating lost periods of history and letting you walk around in them. They’re the closest thing to time travel. I play them for the virtual tourism, and find myself vaguely disappointed that 80% of what you do in these painstakingly realised worlds boils down to parkouring around killing people.Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released this week after a couple of last-minute delays, and I was surprised to find that it makes running around and killing people more fun and interesting than it has been in many years. This is partly down to the setting: 16th-century Japan, the era of warlord Oda Nobunaga, of samurai and shinobi and endless complex, fascinating conflicts. Japan was changing fast, having reluctantly opened up contact with the rest of the world. Shadows’ two protagonists are at the centre of all this change and tumult: Yasuke, a slave turned samurai under Nobunaga, and Naoe, a peasant shinobi building her own resistance movement as her home is torn apart.Two protagonists, two playstyles: Naoe is fast and quiet, and makes playing stealthily a viable and enjoyable way to experience the game for the first time in ages. Yasuke is strong and skilled, and can cut through enemies when a situation suddenly explodes into conflict. This adds variety and choice to the gameplay. Both characters are genuinely interesting, and I care about their stories. Yasuke appeared right at the beginning of the game and then was absent for about 12 hours; when he showed up again, I was beginning to get bored by Naoe’s quest for revenge, and having someone new with whom to explore this extraordinary setting kept me interested.And truly: what a setting. I’ve been playing Shadows on a PS5 Pro and it is the most beautiful video game I have ever seen. You know how you just get used to how gorgeous modern games look after a few hours, and forget to admire the scenery? That hasn’t happened to me yet after 15 hours with Shadows. The light, the architecture, the natural beauty of Japan’s mountains, the way you can see the roofs of shrines poking out from the treetops, the delicate beauty of Kyoto’s winding streets … It helps that the seasons change every few hours, letting you quite literally see your surroundings in a new light. I cannot begin to imagine the hours of human effort that have gone into creating this environment. The detail is exceptional.View image in fullscreenNaoe in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.Photograph: UbisoftOne example of this is in the multilingual script. You can play the whole thing with English voice-acting, or you can play in period-appropriate Japanese and Portuguese with subtitles, which the games calls “immersive mode”. With the provisos that I am by no means an expert in Japanese history and that my own Japanese is extremely rusty, playing like this was astonishingly good. Every conversation feels like a series of delicate and dangerous manoeuvres; much is left unsaid, implied by tone and careful choice of words. You can choose Naoe or Yasuke’s responses at times, and saying the wrong thing sometimes results in an infinitesimal change in your interlocutor’s expression – just enough to let you know that you’ve screwed up. It is, for a game about a ninja on an assassination revenge quest, surprisingly subtle.If you watched FX’sexceptional TV adaptation of Shōgun, you’ll probably be thinking that a lot of what I describe sounds familiar. And though Shadows isn’tas tense and brilliant as that show, it approaches its setting and story with equal care and respect. Assassin’s Creed’s approach to historical authenticity has always been playful – remember doing quests for Socrates in Odyssey, and getting Leonardo da Vinci to make gadgets for you in renaissance Italy? – but here there’s a more serious tone. Many of Shadows’ characters have real historical analogues. There’s no silliness in the side quests, no japes or banter in the dialogue. It feels … realistic, for want of a better word. Perhaps naturalistic is more apt. There’s nothing realistic about a samurai-shinobi pair running around killing all of Kansai’s powerful daimyo between them, but the world they inhabit sticks close to the historical reality. It’s believable.There are still some things about Assassin’s Creed that belong in the bin. The Animus is one of the all-time great video game framing devices. All Assassin’s Creed games take place inside a machine that lets you relive the memories of your ancestors, but with all the useful info and overlays of a video game. But that’s all it needs to be: a framing device. We can surely get rid of the modern-day subplots about the Animus and who’s controlling it. Don’t interrupt my fun adventures in historical Japan by making me hunt down glitches and anomalies in the machine. And over the series’ 18-year history, it has acquired altogether too manysystems. It’s fiddly and unfocused – there are too many menus for collecting and upgrading equipment, too many different skill trees for your characters’ abilities.Shadows may be sometimes confusing and overwhelming, but for the first time in a while, I was willing to forgive all that if I got to see more of Japan. If, like me, you’ve skipped the last few Assassin’s Creed games, you might be pleased to find that this is as streamlined and enjoyable as the series has been for a long time.What to playView image in fullscreenIntelligent and funny … Expelled!Photograph: InkleIf you do not have the 30 to 50 hours required for Assassin’s Creed Shadows right now, here’s a much more manageable treat:Expelled!Made by one of my favourite studios, Inkle, it is the story of a working-class scholarship girl trying to avoid getting kicked out of a posh English boarding school in the 1920s.

But I love a good open world and decided to start onAssassin’s Creed Origins. When I got to the menu, I noticed an educational/discovery option: combat-free walkthroughs of the historical places and people that were heavily researched and included in the game. It was amazing. Does Shadows have this mode? And can you recommend any other games that employ these passive, but immersive educational modes?”Assassin’s Creed’s Discovery Tourmode is brilliant – as you said in your email,ValhallaandOdysseyalso gave players the option to walk around in their worlds and learn cool facts about the time period depicted. Ubisoft made a fuss about this feature back when it was first created, offering it to schools as an educational tool, but not a lot of people talk about it. I love this mode – I had a big interest in ancient Egypt when I was a kid, and I would have eaten this up. There’s no Discovery Tour mode in Shadows at launch, but I’ve asked Ubisoft one is forthcoming. I’ll report back when I get a response.In the meantime, here are a couple of other games with similar pacifist modes: inGTA Online, is not educational but you can turn on “passive mode” to simply enjoy and explore Los Santos without getting grief from other players; and in strategy gameHumankindyou can turn off war and just build your civilisation.

Now, grieving late bandmate Rick Froberg, he explains why he’s still punk’s hardest workerWed 19 Mar 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 06.35 EDTShareJohn Reis has lived as if there’s no tomorrow. Over the last 35 years, the hardest-working man in punk rock has recorded more than 25 albums and an avalanche of singles with groups including Rocket from the Crypt, Drive Like Jehu, Hot Snakes, the Night Marchers, Sultans and more; as Swami John Reis, he’s about to put out a blistering new LP, Time to Let You Down. But lately, the 55-year-old has been particularly haunted by the finite nature of existence.It began when the pandemic forced Hot Snakes off the road mid-tour early in 2020. “It came at a time in our lives where, even though it was just a couple of years we couldn’t tour, we could feel how precious those years were. We’re getting older, and we’re already thinking, ‘How much longer will I be able to do this?’” Reis pauses. “And then my friend Rick went into the other realm.”Reis first met Rick Froberg – who died in 2023 aged 55 of an undiagnosed heart condition – in 1986, at a picnic for San Diego punks held by the publisher of an anarchist newsletter. Both helped establish the DIY, all-ages scene at San Diego’s Ché Cafe, as a refuge from the city’s “super-violent” punk clubs. And when Reis’s instrumental trio Pitchfork decided they needed a vocalist, Rick volunteered. “He’d never sung before, and he was a shy dude, too,” Reis remembers. “But he sounded amazing, and wrote such good lyrics, viewing the world through a lens far beyond his years. We went from three guys making noise in a garage, to four guys making a much better noise in a garage.”View image in fullscreenHot Snakes playing Newcastle in 2018, with Rick Froberg and John Reis, right.Photograph: David Wala/ShutterstockReis’s next group with Froberg, Drive Like Jehu, were “more complex, more dissonant”, influenced by Sonic Youth, the MC5’s free-jazz excursions and Neu!’s avant garde experiments. Froberg hollered like a demented preacher over angular, mathematical riffs, while on the epic Luau, on Jehu’s second album Yank Crime, Reis’s guitar howled like a broken siren. He came across this thrilling din after incorrectly reassembling his amplifier post-repair. “The transformer was igniting the tubes and burning through them,” he grins. “Whenever I got close to that thing, it screamed.And it sounded awesome.”It was the early 90s, when major labels signed every gnarly punk group, hoping to find the next Nirvana. Interscope nabbed Jehu, though their noise remained resolutely radio-unfriendly. However, the label also optioned Reis’s other group, the Froberg-less Rocket from the Crypt, who were a much more saleable proposition. Comprised of buddies from the Ché Cafe scene, Rocket had “no motives other than ‘let’s just have fun’,” says Reis. Rocket aped the primal favourites of Reis’s teenhood – the Ramones, the Dictators, the Saints and Didjits – but their punk-rock party truly hit top gear after the group acquired a horn section. The inspiration for this development is, perhaps, surprising. “As a kid, I thought Live and Let Die was the biggest song ever,” Reis says. “So huge sounding. I approached Rocket with the mindset that more is more – the more people onstage, the bigger the sound will be. And I love how the horns sit with the guitars – it all sounds like one massive instrument. It just has this undeniable girth.”Arriving as grunge mouldered, Rocket dressed in matching uniforms and greaser quiffs, took pseudonyms – Reis was “Speedo” – and engaged in life-affirming rock’n’roll showmanship, including onstage fire-breathing and swinging guitars around their bodies like hula-hoops. “Our music was honest and sincere,” Reis says, “but we also had this James Brown sensibility of: this is ashow. Having fun is regarded as less artistically important than stuff that’s darker in tone, and I always thought that was stupid. Rocket was the most fun band, ever. Wherever we were playing, that was the place on planet Earth you had to be that night.”Their magnum opus, 1995’s Scream, Dracula, Scream!, was the result of the “fucking massive budget” Interscope had given the group. “Instead of dividing it up between us, like anyone with a brain would’ve, we spent it on a punk-rock record.” The album featured string sections and glockenspiels, and Reis recorded “orchestral transitions between songs” that were removed pre-release after the label balked and Reis realised they sounded “a bit pompous” (the deleted interstitials were lost inthe Universal Studio fire, he ruefully adds). Rocket scored an unlikely UK Top 20 hit with On a Rope, after appearing on pretty much any TV show that would have them, includingTop of the Pops,TFI FridayandThe White Room. “We said yes to everything in the UK that we’d have said no to in the US, as an experiment,” Reis says. “You want us to appear on breakfast TV? Yes. Use our music to sell shampoo? Yes. We had fun with it, because we knew it would go away. But for that brief moment, it seemed like people knew who we were, and they liked the music. And that felt good.”Rocket toured hard, until parenthood changed their priorities. “To be a decent parent, you can’t be gone for three years straight,” Reis says (his son was born in 2006, and the 18-year-old now attends shows at the Ché Cafe himself). The group went on ice, and now play the occasional reunion show, while Reis invested his time in his Swami Records label, producing other groups, and forming Hot Snakes, his final band with Froberg. “Rick always made songs out of my noise, elevated it into music,” he says. The group cut four albums of rapturously acclaimed, sublime punk-rock over 18 years, and were working on a fifth when Froberg died suddenly. That unfinished Hot Snakes material will someday see the light. “But it’s hard, man,” Reis admits. “Just hearing my friend’s voice … I know grief is a process. I feel very connected and close to Rick – we still have a dialogue in my head and in my dreams. But sometimes it’s just too real and heavy when I hear his voice singing. I just get really sad whenever we work on it.”Reis ploughed his grief into 2024’s Swami John Reis album All of This Awaits You, which “wore everything on its sleeve. I made it with a bunch of friends, and it was dark, but there was a lot of joy to it.” He believes, however, that distribution issues scuppered its release. “I was crushed that record didn’t get its chance,” he adds, “and I wanted to put out another record so I wouldn’t feel the effects of that, and could move on. Time is precious, I don’t want to waste it wallowing in defeat.” Time to Let You Down’s lean, super-melodic punk – rock fuses Rocket’s anthemic brutishness with Hot Snakes’ dissonant attack. There’s catharsis within its grooves, but precious little self-pity: the title track closes with Reis hollering: “Dry your eyes and get out of your grave!”“I was fucking angry,” he says. “But I realised at an early age, I’m not a bluesman. Tragedy doesn’t inspire my best art.”Wallowing still has no place on Reis’s agenda, and his eyes are trained firmly on the future. “I already have the next record pretty much done in my brain, and the record after that as well,” he says. “There’s nothing to savour in defeat, only an opportunity to move on and do something new. I know I’m getting older. I just want to see where rock’n’roll takes me next.”Time to Let You Down is released 21 March on SwamiExplore more on these topicsPunkPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The novel’s author re-encounters her characters on stageOyinkan BraithwaiteWed 19 Mar 2025 04.11 EDTShareOne dead body. Two sisters. Two pairs of yellow gloves. The wiping away of the evidence; one sister efficiently, the other lazily. And in the background, an enigmatic score.So begins the Ballet Black adaptation of my debut novel,My Sister, the Serial Killer. I have dreamed of it coming to life via various visual mediums – film, TV, as a musical, as a play. Not once did I consider it as a ballet production. And not because I don’t love the medium – in a former life I joined a ballet school, which we won’t dwell on here – but because, in creating this story, I focused heavily on dialogue and a ballet is essentially wordless.Still, when I was approached byBallet Black, I was intrigued. Ballet Black is a company founded by Cassa Pancho, with the mission to showcase diversity on stage and promote inclusivity for Black and Asian content. And perhaps, because of that, the perfect company to handle my story, which is set in Nigeria – a majority black environment.Cassa directs the adaptation and her vision for it is clear. The plot is truncated, keeping only the elements required to get the story across in a 50-minute production – the murderous femme fatale, the put-upon sister, the doctor caught between them, the endless male victims and the knife at the heart of it all.View image in fullscreenCheeky and funny … My Sister, the Serial Killer.Photograph: ASHThe first time I watched the performance, I was moved to tears. Ayoola, played to perfection by Helga Paris-Morales, entered the scene, and it was like seeing a friend from decades past. I would have known her anywhere. Certainly, there were differences – this Ayoola is more “psychotic” – but the way she carried herself, the way she twisted her waist, the little shakes of her hips, the long, slow smiles, the playfulness, the teasing; all Ayoola. During her pas de deux with Dr Tade, played by Ebony Thomas, she allows him to feel in control, to pull her closer, and reach for her as she dances on pointe around him.Then there’s Korede, the protagonist in my story and in this ballet, and the more complex of the two sisters. Korede is played by the gifted Isabela Coracy. Isabela takes the character and illustrates her seriousness, her vulnerability and her pain. The agony can be seen in the way she hugs her body, and hunches her normally elongated form. Cassa was particularly insightful in giving Korede’s demons life via the talented dancers that surround her, tug at her, torment her and pull her down into their harrowing depths.And the team’s attention to detail is truly impressive. One example: Ayoola’s poisoning of her lover’s drink perfectly synced to the beat of Toots and the Maytals’ 54-46 Was My Number. And they nod to the source material’s culture in the inclusion of Fela Kuti’s Water No Get Enemy, a wonderful accompaniment to the original score by composer Tom Harrold which managed to be jaunty, mystical and compelling. I also thoroughly appreciated the authentic look of the Nigerian police uniform, courtesy of costume designer Jessica Cabassa.View image in fullscreenAttention to detail … My Sister, the Serial Killer.Photograph: ASHMy Sister, the Serial Killer is part of a double bill withChanel DaSilva’s A Shadow Work, a more abstract piece saturated with strong routines. There is so much of note – the thumping/fluttering of hands to chest, the helicopter spins the dancers perform, the arms swinging in pendulum style, the fixed smiling faces that could not be any creepier, the futuristic score and the silent, musicless communication at the centre of the piece. It is a work that explores the struggle when trying to come to terms with one’s inner demons or alter ego. There is certainly a link that can be made with My Sister, the Serial Killer.It goes without saying that I am highly biased towards this adaptation but I was not alone. Behind me, I heard a woman mutter “psycho bitch” at one of Ayoola’s actions. And I often caught the odd gasp. My husband, who is as familiar with the ins and outs of My Sister, the Serial Killer as I am, laughed several times. The performance was engaging, cheeky, funny, an excellent way to spend the evening with family, friends or even on your own – it won’t matter because you’ll be sucked in by the narrative and the bodies pirouetting effortlessly across the stage.AtBirmingham Repon 27-28 March,then touringExplore more on these topicsStageBallet BlackBalletDanceOyinkan BraithwaiteCrime fictionFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Zegler commented that “there’s confusion because I don’t have a single ounce of Latin in my name”, adding: “When I was in the running for María in West Side Story, they kept calling to ask if I was legit. I remember thinking, Do you want me to bring my abuelita in? I will. I’ll bring her into the studio if you want to meet her.”Zegler was born in New Jersey, andhas said previouslythat her mother, Gina, is the US-born daughter of Colombian immigrants . Her father, Craig, is descended from Polish immigrants to the US. Referring to her Colombian roots, Zegler said: “It’s an interesting experience being part of that diaspora in the current climate we live in. But I love being Colombian.”Snow White, a live-action remake of Disney’s groundbreaking 1937 animated fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, has become something of a lightning rod for controversy, with film academic and journalist Stephen Gallowaytelling the Observer: “It’s hard to imagine a picture in this DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion], or post-DEI, post-woke age could be more controversial and polarising.”Zegler has attracted much of the attention.Like Halle Bailey in The Little Mermaid, Zegler’s ethnic background appeared to trigger accusations of a “woke” reimagining of a classic story.Zegler has also incurred the wrath of commentators with her political statements, posting messages on social media in support of the Palestinian cause and attacking Donald Trump supporters in the wake of the 2024 presidential election. (She apologised for the latter, saying “sorry I contributed to the negative discourse”.) She also said that in the original Disney cartoon, the prince “literally stalks” Snow White.The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) hasgiven Snow White a PG certificate, with its scene descriptions triggering more accusations of“ridiculous” levels of sensitivity. The BBFC’s content advice says that the film contains a scene where “a woman is deliberately poisoned”, “a girl is surrounded by ominous trees” and “a character threatens to shove something up another’s backside during a comic exchange”.Explore more on these topicsSnow WhiteRacenewsShareReuse this content"

It also comes amid seriousDemocraticbacklash against Schumer for failing to provide stiff enough resistance to Trump’s actions.Chuck Schumer postpones book tour stops amid shutdown vote backlashRead moreSchumer told Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater: “Here’s my hope … after this election, when the Republican party expels the turd ofDonald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican party.”That insult may cause a splash at the White House in light of Trump’s abuse of Schumer, who he said last week was“not Jewish any more”, over the senator’s response to anti-Israel college protests.According to Karni and Broadwater, of the New York Times, Schumer delivered his judgment over a glass of wine one night in June 2023. With hindsight, the authors add: “If Schumer had seen any of it coming, he had not wanted to face it.”They are referring to events since Trump’s win over Kamala Harris in November, including the appointment of extremists to key roles and Trump’s assault on the federal government, assisted byElon Musk.“The old Republican party was leaving, and the new MAGA guard was staying,” the authors write.View image in fullscreenMad House: How Donald Trump, MAGA Mean Girls, a Former Used Car Salesman, a Florida Nepo Baby, and a Man With Rats in His Walls Broke Congress.Photograph: Random HouseMad House: How Donald Trump, MAGA Mean Girls, a Former Used Car Salesman, a Florida Nepo Baby, and a Man With Rats in His Walls Broke Congress, will be published next Tuesday.

Last week, Schumer first said Democrats would not helpRepublicansstave off a government shutdown, then reversed and supported the GOP budget. Enough Democrats followed that the measure passed, promising more draconian cuts.Schumertoldthe Times he “knew there would be divisions” but insisted “we are all unified in going after Trump”. But on Monday, amid heavy fire from figuresincluding Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman many want to challenge Schumer for his Senate seat, Schumercancelleda tour for his own book,Antisemitism in America: A Warning.Karni and Broadwater quote another Democratic senator, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has prominently gone after Trump and who many see as a Senate leader in waiting. Murphy was “willing to entertain the Schumer theory of the case” about a Republican party rescuable from Trumpism, the authors write. But “he didn’t buy it himself”.“There are plenty of examples of societies captured by a singularly unique individual demagogue and that get healthy after that person disappears,” Murphy says. “I don’t know. I’m not as optimistic as [Schumer] is. I worry there’s a rot at the core of the country that will continue to be exposed politically.”Now 74, Schumer entered Congress in 1981. A senator since 1999, he became minority leader in 2016 and was majority leader from 2021 until this year.Karni and Broadwater describe a 2013 dinner at the Palm, a “see-and-be-seen steakhouse” in Washington, between Schumer, the South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, and the far-right shock jock Rush Limbaugh.LiveSchumer indicates he will vote against shutdown to 'minimise harm to the American people' – videoThe meeting was brokered by the rightwing media baron Rupert Murdoch, so the senators could sell Limbaugh onimmigration reformthat offered a path to citizenship to millions of undocumented migrants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Schumer posited that the firefighter was made “so fucking mad” by “this technological revolution” and the ensuing loss of “family, community, religion”.“Trump, who’s an evil sorcerer, comes in, he says, ‘I can get that old world back.’”But according to Karni and Broadwater, Schumer did not harbor such realism about Trump’s party.Trump revokes Secret Service detail for Joe Biden’s childrenRead more“Despite all facts to the contrary, it was a core belief of Schumer’s that politics in America would recalibrate after Trump exited the stage. Driving through Brooklyn months before the shattering election cycle, Schumer repeated the sentiment.”Schumer thought 25 Republican senators “were scared of Trump” but “those people, if Trump is gone, will go back”.Karni and Broadwater add: “Schumer was bullish on everything, especially after Biden’s dramatic exit from the race.“He liked telling people that Robert Caro, the famed biographer of President Lyndon B Johnson, had referred to him, Schumer, as the ‘Jewish LBJ’. So, he let himself fantasize about Democrats winning everything, the White House, the Senate, and the dysfunctional House and steamrolling through progressive legislation that would have him live up to the moniker. ‘The one thing I’d really like to do is immigration reform,’ he said. He was still thinking about the 2013 failure … ‘If that bill had passed,’ he said, ‘the country would be a different place.’“But it was never going to be that simple, because nothing ever is.”Explore more on these topicsBooksChuck SchumerUS politicsUS SenateUS CongressDemocratsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

In Daré’s novel, a sequel to her internationally bestselling debut The Girl with the Louding Voice, 14-year-old Adunni is living in Lagos, having escaped the rural village in which she was a victim of abuse and enslavement. The novel exposes “the harsh realities faced by women and girls worldwide, underscored by intersectional environmental issues”, according to judge Tori Tsui. “It’s a tough but essential read.”Meanwhile former Times Literary Supplement journalist Dineen’s debut, about a mother looking after her three small children in a city rocked by global catastrophe, was described by judge Nicola Chester as “a haunting, fierce narrative of love, beauty and the desire to live through an accelerating crisis and a world on fire”.Kaliane Bradley’s novel The Ministry of Time, which hasalso been longlisted for this year’s Women’s prize for fiction, completes the shortlist, and was praised by the Climate fiction prize’s chair of judges Madeleine Bunting as “climate fiction which manages to be both surprising and still make its point powerfully”.Described byGuardian reviewerElla Risbridger as “50% sci-fi thriller and 50% romcom”, The Ministry of Time is a love story about a disaffected civil servant working in a near-future London and Commander Graham Gore, first lieutenant of Sir John Franklin’s ill-fated expedition to the Arctic. Though it contains “vast themes” – the British empire, the refugee crisis and the Cambodian genocide among others – they are “handled deftly and in deference to character and plot”, Risbridger wrote.Journalist Bunting, climate justice activist Tsui and author Chester were joined on the judging panel by birdwatcher and writer David Lindo and the Hay festival’s sustainability director Andy Fryers.The shortlist was whittled down from a longlist of nine that also included Praiseworthy by Alexis Wright, The Mars House by Natasha Pulley, Water Baby by Chioma Okereke and Private Rites by Julia Armfield.The five chosen books “promote and celebrate the power and joy of storytelling, to show us how we might see ourselves anew in the light of the climate crisis, and how we might respond to and rise to its challenges with hope and inventiveness”, said Chester.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

While colonisation, racism and segregation cast a shadow over their countries of origin, the City of Light appeared then a more liberated place where they were free to mix, study, work and create.Now, a new exhibition – the last major event at Paris’s Pompidou Centre before it closes fora five-year renovationin September – explores the “unrecognised and fundamental” contribution these artists made to the French capital and how it influenced them.View image in fullscreenA visitor looks at an artwork by French artist Georges Coran, titled Delire et paix.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPAThis vibrant final show brings together 350 works by 150 artists of African heritage, many of whom have been historically sidelined or forgotten and who the museum says are being given the recognition they deserve for the first time inFrance.The Pompidou, Paris’s primary showcase for modern and contemporary art, describes it as an “unusual project”.ParisNoir(Black Paris) “celebrates artists who persisted in their commitment to create” despite being ignored by most cultural institutions at the time and for whom Paris was an essential part of their journey.Alicia Knock, the exhibition’s lead curator, said: “It is a story that hasn’t been told and should be. The exhibition allows us to see the richness of these artists who came to Paris, many of whom were also philosophers and poets and whose works have not been seen before in France.”View image in fullscreenEverlyn Nicodemus is one of the artists being displayed.Photograph: Jordan Macy/The GuardianParis had attracted African American artists even before the second world war. The celebrated Boston-born artist Loïs Mailou Jones arrived in the city on a fellowship in 1937 and marvelled at the positive response she received when painting was displayed outside on the streets. “The French were so inspiring. The people would stand and watch me and say ‘mademoiselle, you are so very talented. You are so wonderful.’ In other words, the colour of my skin didn’t matter in Paris …” she said of her time in the capital.Mailou Jones, who died in 1998 and whose work features in the exhibition, later returned to the US and set up the Little Paris Studio Group, a salon to provide local artists of colour with training and an outlet to show their work.Other artists featured include Chéri Samba, one of the most renowned contemporary African artists from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, African American Sam Middleton and James Baldwin’s close friend Beauford Delaney, as well as the Cuban Wifredo Lam and the Tanzanian-born, Edinburgh-based artist and writer Everlyn Nicodemus.View image in fullscreenThe exhibition is the last major show for the Paris venue before it closes for a five-year renovation.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPAAfter Delaney died in 1979, Baldwin wrote in a tribute that he was “the first living proof, for me, that a black man could be an artist”.

Knock hopes they will be included in its permanent exhibition when the museum opens again in 2030 after an estimated €262m refit of the 50-year-old building.“It’s a way for the museum to be more global, more inclusive and also about honouring the artists. As a last exhibition before the museum closes for five years it is spectacular but it’s part of a longer-term project,” Knock said.Explore more on these topicsExhibitionsPaintingArtParisFranceEuropeRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Singh, born in 1937, matured as an artist at a time of huge social upheaval in India. Amid states of national emergency, rising international tensions and nuclear tests, the art that came out of India after 1975 – brilliantly documented in theBarbican’s Imaginary Institution of Indiaexhibition last year – became a way of documenting, resisting and surviving.But Singh’s work isn’t hugely literal, nor particularly angry. Instead, her intense, colourful figurative paintings feel like a glimpse of interior life, of emotion and trauma in times of struggle. They are hugely complex, infinitely layered and filled with historical allusions, military symbolism and daily life. The paintings are stacked vertically with imagery – not laid out on a single plane like a traditional western landscape painting, but with multiple ideas piled up and across the canvas. You’re almost never looking at just one thing, one scene, but multiple images knitted together. It’s part-comic book, part-Chagall dreamscape, part-folk art.View image in fullscreenKali-esque … Devi Pistol Wali, 1990.Photograph: Courtesy of Museum of Art & Photography, Bengaluru, India. © Arpita SinghIn one early painting, a woman tends to her garden as a mother nurses her child. People drive by in cars, a kid peers around a curtain and a figure sleeps while jets fly overhead. Perspectives don’t make sense and picture planes clash, but it all coalesces into a gorgeous world of blue, a portrait of female care and tenderness in the hectic hustle of urbanity.That battle between inner life and sociopolitical reality plays out across all the best works here. A couple takes tea in front of a saluting soldier, a multi-armed Kali-esque woman fights off a bureaucrat with a gun while balancing on a sleeping man. Everywhere you look there are the same images, repeated over and over like memories looping back: flowers, cars, soldiers, bureaucrats in black, looming men and countless women.The women matter here because they nurture, care and provide in a world that otherwise seems hellbent on chaos and violence. This comes out most clearly in watercolours from the 1990s: psychedelic visions of motherhood and femininity that are gorgeously tender and vulnerable. And even though the bigger paintings until about 2002 are the stars of the show, the works on paper are great, clearer and more concise than the paintings but still full of Singh’s hallmarks.View image in fullscreenA gorgeous world of blue … This Could be Us, You, Or Anybody Else, 2007.Photograph: © Arpita SinghWorks from the past 20 years take a more collage-like approach, creating big patchy canvases plastered with words, human figures and strips of clashing colours. There are references to war, conflict, displacement, nods to Indian epics – they’re interesting paintings, but most of them are just splotchy, semi-abstract and incoherent, and don’t convey her ideas or aesthetic as well as the earlier pieces. While they’re not great, maybe that makes sense with the theme of the show. Maybe it reflects how your memory frays and splinters, how images increasingly struggle to coalesce in your mind’s eye.There is a lot here that will go over the heads of a non-Indian audience, and a lot that goes largely unexplained. There are just so many references to folk art, Indian court painting and current events that aren’t so current any more. Trying to figure it all out can leave you feeling a little delirious. But Singh wants viewers to take the work at face value, to interpret it for themselves. So what you’re left with is a sort of beautiful chaos of memory, a vision of life where the political, personal, societal and domestic meld into one big past. That’s how we remember, isn’t it? Everything jumbled together and hopefully, in the end, quite beautiful.Arpita Singh: Remembering is atSerpentine North gallery, London, until 27 July.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingSerpentine GalleryIndiaSouth and central AsiareviewsShareReuse this content"

The group’s anniversary season at Wigmore Hall, already peppered with new commissions, culminated in a day of concerts of which the finale contained four more world premieres, plus works from previous round-number anniversaries. Stravinsky’s 1920 Concertino was the outlier in this context, but its punchy, bouncy rhythmic drive made it a good opener.First of the “old” Nash works wasElliott Carter’s 2004 Mosaic, in which seven other instruments are corralled into cohesion by the harp: a virtual concerto, and a winning showcase here for the harpist Hugh Webb.Peter Maxwell Davies’s 2014 String Quintet was the weightiest work on the programme, infused with hints of Orkney music and with striking moments for the pair of cellos, played here by Adrian Brendel and Gemma Rosefield.Julian Anderson’s Van Gogh Blue, a Nash commission from 2015, struggled to hold its intensity as the two clarinettists moved around the hall between movements, but the sounds created by them and the ensemble, conducted by Martyn Brabbins, were increasingly evocative nonetheless, the finale a cacophony of unruly swirls like the artist’s Starry Night.Leading the four premieres,Simon Holt’s Acrobats on a Loose Wire also made spatial use of the hall: the flautist Philippa Davies played from the balcony, sounding acrobatic and bird-like too, while the string trio on stage formed the wire, their music tensing and relaxing. Heard simultaneously, the two aspects felt coincidental rather than cohesive, at least until the final moments.John Casken’s Mantle, a vibrant yet emollient movement for piano and wind quintet full of restlessly dancing motion, seemed perfectly geared to the occasion. So, too, didColin Matthews’ Canon – an introduction and four songs setting Christopher Reid’s whimsical poetry about alphabets and animals. Few sopranos can sell a new song as convincingly as Claire Booth, and though it was a shame the high-lying lines made it hard to hear the words, she was on form here.But the piece I immediately wanted to hear again wasHelen Grime’s Long Have I Lain Beside the Water, a haunting setting of words by Zoe Gilbert in which Grime’s close, charged writing finds the six instruments lending the singer a luminous, otherworldly aura.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicNash EnsembleWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

The US comic needn’t have worried: the room is full and she opens with local material for the London crowd. Why do we add an “s” to “math”? Why are Black people living here – “you knew it was cold”? Nothing in the capital scares her, she says, because we don’t have guns: “Give meyourwallet!”Sloan’s CV spans acting and improvising, too, and that shines through as she masterfully shapes the energy in the room. She avoids The Daily Show’s topical comedy, instead sharing vignettes from her life as a 40-something Atlanta-raised artist who has recently bought a house in LA for herself and her family. We’re treated to impressions of her “insane” mother and brother arguing, a “goofy” ex-colleague, and men trying to propose to her in Spanish. Punchlines are punctuated with sidelong looks, confident pauses left for the crowd to keep laughing after each joke lands.This was billed as a show about Sloan’s experience of freezing her eggs as a single woman in America. That topic’s absent tonight. After a (very enjoyable) warmup fromMichelle de Swarte, we instead get jokes on evolution, supporting her family and the “cop dog” she’s begrudgingly allowed into her home, plus thoughts on dating and why straight men need to rethink their approach. Some material will be familiar to fans, with a memorable bit about “broke dick” delivered more smoothly in 2023’s Netflix showcase Verified Stand-Up.Maybe because of this, the show tonight feels unfinished – a collection of thoughts without a coherent narrative. There are strong sections on the white American obsession with dogs and her scepticism of jazz, and we skim the surface of intriguing strands, like the failed promises of feminism (“White women got bored, now I have to work?”) and why she’s ready for a rich husband. These morsels are nevertheless glued together by Sloan’s charismatic persona, as she conjures huge laughs from exaggerated incredulity and keeps the energy fizzing throughout.AtSoho theatre, London, until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsComedySoho theatreTelevisionTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

We meet the protagonist just as she is being dumped by Joe, her boyfriend of four years, and it quickly becomes clear that Karen is a negative force in her life beyond the office too.Sarah Cameron-West’s monologue was compared to Peep Show and Fleabag at last year’s Edinburgh fringe and you can see why. Like the latter, it is confessional, intimate and sheds insight on female anger, envy and feelings of inadequacy. Cameron-West performs energetically and there is real promise in the writing, but it touches on themes rather than cracking them open to say something beyond the tropes of its more famed forebears.View image in fullscreen‘An angry young Bridget Jones’ … Sarah Cameron-West in Karen.Photograph: Dylan WoodleyIn Evie Ayres-Townshend’s production, we see the protagonist at work and packing up her life with Joe while swigging red wine like an angry young Bridget Jones. One-way conversations are conducted with various unseen characters including her mother, and we learn that she has a “free-spirited” sister who is trekking across Peru while the protagonist is mired in white-collar life. These family elements – which might bring more depth – are skirted across while the romantic heartbreak is too generalised.The drama sometimes includes reflections on its own construction (“Did I just say that out aloud?” she asks) and Oliver McNally’s lighting design is part of the artifice. Inner turmoil is captured in flashes of red, for example, when the monologue goes from conversational to bursts of internal anger. Cameron-West comes off the stage to talk directly to us, as if we are the other characters, and switches cleanly between these inner and outer voices. But none of it is penetrating enough, while the forcibly happy end seems to betray the gritty reality of this woman’s life.Atthe Other Palace, London, until 23 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

If that’s your level of engagement with AI, then this competent, fluent documentary offers a very approachable entry into the subject. It’s not, however, a wide-lens overview of the subject but a character-driven study of one specific, key-player company in the industry:DeepMind, whose intercapped name betrays its origins in the 2010 tech-boom era.As it happens, DeepMind is now officially calledGoogleDeepMind and is part of a suite of divisions developing robotics and solving problems using AI – sorry, AGI because it’s not just Artificial Intelligence we’re talking about here, but Artificial General Intelligence (it gets explained). The fact that Google and its tech overlords are involved, however amiable they seem when seen in their office casual dress (former CEO Eric Schmidt at least), means this has more than a little flavour of corporate video, investor-fluffing, and self-congratulatory smugness about it. But DeepMind’s British founder and CEO Demis Hassabis manages to come across as a pretty nice guy with a genuinely interesting backstory. The son of a Greek father and a Singaporean mother raised in London, he was a child chess prodigy who became a video game designer; instead, he opted to go into a purer form of research on how thinking itself works, and that became his business.All this leads up to a satisfyingly climactic achievement for Hassabis that viewers who read science news may know fromrecent headlines. And what he and his collaborator John Jumper achieved with their AI model AlphaFold, a program that predicts the structure of proteins based on chemical sequence, is truly remarkable. Director Greg Kohs uses animation and all the tools in the video editing toolbox to explain the science in crystal clear layperson’s terms, which in itself is no mean feat. But it’s hard not to feel there’s a few dimensions to the AGI story that are being left in the desktop recycling bin.The Thinking Game is in UK cinemas from 21 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleDeepMindAlphabetComputingreviewsShareReuse this content"

His books often feature people who leave what they know and arrive “in strange places, carrying little bits of jumbled luggage and suppressing secret and garbled ambitions”, to use the words of a character from his 2001 novel By the Sea. Theft, Gurnah’s first book since his Nobel win, is in part a continued inquiry into familiar themes of exile and memory, home, longing and loneliness. It is also a poignant portrait of love, friendship and betrayal, set against Tanzania’s tourism boom during the 1990s.The novel follows Karim, Fauzia and Badar, chronicling their uneasy passage into adulthood. Karim’s story begins on Pemba Island, where his mother, Raya, leaves her joyless marriage while he’s a toddler, first returning with him to her parents in Unguja and later relocating without him to Dar es Salaam, where she remarries. When Karim enrols for university in the city, he stays with her and her husband, Haji Othman. He returns to Zanzibar once he finishes his studies to take up a position in development. There, Karim crosses paths with Fauzia – once a sickly, epileptic child, now a confident young woman training to become a teacher. The two fall helplessly in love.Sometime during Karim’s second year of university, 13-year-old Badar arrives at the Othmans’ house, sent by his adopted parents as a servant (“There was to be no more school for him. There was no money”). Homesick and haunted by his abandonment, Badar gradually learns to adjust to his new life. While Raya, Haji and Karim are all kind to him, Haji’s father appears to resent him. Badar senses that the hostility isn’t exactly directed at him, but rather at his real father, “a restless troublemaker”, as he’s often been told. It isn’t until several years later, when he is accused of theft by the old man, that the reader is finally let in on the truth about Badar’s father and his ties to the Othman family. The revelation is a modest development, only confirming Badar’s suspicion that “there was something degrading about his circumstances”. True intrigue begins when Karim, now married to Fauzia, invites Badar to start anew with them in Zanzibar, arranging a job for him at a boutique hotel: a gesture that leaves Badar profoundly, almost existentially, indebted to him.Gurnah’s sly pairing of volunteer tourism and the colonial enterprise hints at harms glossed over in the name of ‘goodwill’Debt, both as a real monetary burden and a symbolic relational pact, has been a recurring feature of Gurnah’s writing. In his 1987 debut novel, Memory of Departure, impoverished Hassan Omar invites himself into his wealthy uncle’s home in Nairobi, on the basis of an inheritance that is owed to his mother.By the Seafeatured two Zanzibari migrants who reunite in an English seaside town, years after a loan gone awry had led one to lose his family home to the other. Paradise, shortlisted for the Booker prize, told the story of young Yusuf’s quest for freedom after he is pawned to an ivory merchant by his parents. It is set in what is now Tanzania; then, at the turn of the 20th century, a beleaguered place on the verge of German colonisation.Theft is in dialogue with these books, with the motif of debt grounding wider ruminations: on hospitality, autonomy and servitude as well as the nuanced distinction between obligation and generosity. For Gurnah, the record-keeping principle underlying a ledger is also one that animates human exchange more broadly, corrupting even the most innocent of bonds. As the tale progresses, Karim increasingly hectors and dominates Badar, demanding gratitude, deference and eventually even subordination and silence, convinced that without his help, Badar “would have ended up living on the streets as some kind of a criminal”.The final third is the novel’s most compelling section. Karim’s testiness with Badar takes a toll on their friendship, while his relationship with Fauzia is complicated by the arrival of a difficult baby and Karim’s domineering mien. The island, meanwhile, is in the throes of profound change. Foreign exchange rules have been relaxed. More and more hotels dot the coast; houses once belonging to Omani sultans and Indian-owned buildings abandoned amid the post-independence exodus have been transformed into heritage retreats, while old premises, now in the hands of foreign investors, are “gilded fantasies of oriental luxury”. Everywhere, European tourists with no Kiswahili and little regard for the locals “went about their pleasures with frowning intensity”.The same holds for the EU-marshalled aid workers Badar encounters, volunteer tourists who journey “all this way to do their good deeds”, bringing condescension, “such ill humour” and an insensitive spirit of adventure. Gurnah’s sly pairing of volunteer tourism and the colonial enterprise, as when Badar muses on the kind of work one hotel guest, the director of an international relief exchange programme, would be doing if she was around “during the old good times of the empire”, hints at harms glossed over in the name of “goodwill”. The idea of poisoned benevolence is picked up again when Karim becomes involved with a British volunteer, a software engineer bent on a local affair. “Does beauty like hers make its own rules, disregarding responsibilities and duties?” Badar wonders. “Or was it that coming to a place like theirs she felt entitled to please herself because in the end it was she that mattered?” Powerful, affecting and provocative, Theft is a vital addition to Gurnah’s remarkable body of work; a novel steeped in heartbreak and loss but one that ultimately refuses despair.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

James Graham’s reason for dismantling a hit is that his story of Gareth Southgate’s renewal of the England men’s football team was, in effect, written at half-time.The2023 premierehad an implied triumphant coda in which the manager’s methods of psychology and motivation won the 2024 Euros. A 2-1defeat to Spain in the finallast July has made this version of the play more reflective than celebratory, although the fact that the Spanish winner was scored by a substitute after an agonising offside review confirms a strong theme: football as a metaphor for life’s tiny margins between good and bad outcomes.View image in fullscreenPutting the ball into ballet … Dear England.Photograph: Marc BrennerSo in the new version, the protagonist becomesSirGareth Southgateand additional cameos include his successor,Thomas Tuchel. Original squad members such as Gunnar Cauthery’s crisp Gary Lineker now have new teammates. As Southgate, Gwilym Lee matches the role’s originator, Joseph Fiennes, in uncannily capturing the corkscrew frown and jumping eyebrows. As the Yorkshire-born, Australia-trained team psychologist Pippa Grange, Gina McKee in 2023 foregrounded the northern English while Liz White now emphasises the Antipodean.Valuable new players include Gamba Cole’s Raheem Sterling, Tristan Waterson’s Dele Alli and Jude Carmichael’s Marcus Rashford – although the rewrite might have dealt more with the fact that so many of the players Graham focused on only two years ago have since lost form.A weakness remains the simplicity of some minor characters. Graham Taylor and Greg Dyke, respectively a manager and football executive of intelligence and charm, are portrayed as unrecognisable vulgarians. Oddly, Dear England chooses not to dramatise one England manager (Roy Hodgson) and a prime minister of the period (Rishi Sunak).View image in fullscreenDesire for triumph.Photograph: Marc BrennerDue to Spain’s superiority last summer, there is an even greater tension between the play’s willed desire to end in triumph and the reality of England’s tournament performances, although Rupert Goold’s staging (with Elin Schofield credited as revival director) is slicker and swifter than ever and movement directorsEllen Kaneand Hannes Langolf – in sequences re-creating matches, penalty shootouts and changing room dance-offs – extraordinarily put the ball into ballet.Dear England increasingly strikes me as a theatrical sibling of The West Wing. Where Aaron Sorkin’s TV drama consoled liberals during the George W Bush years with the fantasy of a Democrat intellectual giant in the White House, Graham offers Southgate as a progressive, gentle, healing alternative national leader, for the period from 2016 to 2024, while the Tories were in fact in charge. That this corrective resonance may survive into a Labour administration is revealing of the state we’re in.

But this time I hop on a local train at the Brussels Gare du Midi for the 30-minute journey to Mechelen, a surprisingly grand and opulent city that in the 16th century was capital of most of the Low Countries – Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg.Belgium map showing MechelenDespite boasting an eclectic mix of medieval churches and renaissance palaces, eye-catching contemporary art and culture venues, great bars, restaurants and the obligatory Belgian brewery, it remains delightfully uncrowded, unspoilt and firmly off the tourist trail.Railway buffs will know that Mechelen’s original 1835 train station was the terminus of continental Europe’s first railway. Today it is being rebuilt and is part construction site, part futuristic travel hub. But it is only a 15-minute walk through narrow cobbled streets into the heart of the historic town centre, with the Unesco world heritage bell tower of Saint Rumbold’s Cathedral serving as a landmark.View image in fullscreenMuseum Hof van Busleyden.Photograph: AlamyInside the cathedral, the baroque high altar features a painting of Christ on the cross by Anthony van Dyck and a choir byLucas Faydherbe. But most visitors head straight for the stairs up to the belfry, blissfully unaware that there are 538 of them. Their reward is a vertiginous open-air walkway around the top of the tower with spectacular views.The Hof van Busleyden museum is filled with priceless tapestries, baroque sculptures and Flemish old mastersTo get a feel for Mechelen’s sumptuous golden age, the next stop is theHof van Busleydenmuseum, a splendid redbrick palace surrounded by ornamental Renaissance gardens that welcomed princes, emperors and figures such as Erasmus and Sir Thomas More. Recently renovated, the building is dedicated to the history of the city and filled with priceless tapestries, baroque sculptures and Flemish old masters such as Peter Paul Rubens and David Vinckboons.Other historic buildings have also been reinvented for modern times, such asHet Predikheren. This 17th-century monastery has been transformed into a public library that is now the town’s cultural hub, hosting art exhibitions, dance and music performances. Comfy sofas and armchairs line a cloistered terrace, with the casualBarbibserving coffee, craft beers and sandwiches. More upmarket, the intimate Michelin-starred dining room ofTinèlleoffers a €53 three-course lunch by Flemish chef Ken Verschueren, along with à la carte dishes such as North Sea crab, smoked eel and pigeon accompanied by crunchy, seasonal hop shoots.View image in fullscreenA wooden sculpture of the Madonna and child in Saint Rumbold’s Cathedral.Photograph: De Rocker/AlamyMechelen’s other landmark building isGrand Béguinage, a typical medieval Flemish town-within-a-town initially created as a refuge for lay religious women (Béguines), and now a Unesco world heritage site. Today, its labyrinth of narrow alleyways and tiny cottages house a grand church andHet Anker, a family-run brewery and distillery, which was founded by the Béguines in 1471. A tour includes beer and whisky tastings, and its cosy brasserie is popular for local specialities such as beef carbonnade, a hearty stew slow-cooked in their signature Gouden Carolus beer, or Mechelen’s famouskoekouek(cuckoo chicken), served with fresh local asparagus.A slow stroll back through the town centre brings me to my lodgings,Martin’s Patershof, an imposing neo-Gothic church that has again changed with the times, being transformed into an arty hotel. Several rooms have original stained-glass windows and arched vaults, while the breakfast hall is dominated by an imposing altar and religious paintings.View image in fullscreenThe old Vleeshalle market in Mechelen is an emporium of local food.Photograph: Luoxi/AlamySaturday is market day in Grote Markt, the city’s main square, which is lined with ancient mansions, guild houses and its palatial 16th-century town hall. This is the place to pick up local cheeses, smoked sausages, shrimps and oysters, and sip chilled Belgian bubbly. More food is on the menu at the nearby coveredVleeshalle, an immense 19th-century butcher’s market that has been reborn as a vibrant emporium for cosmopolitan food stalls and is a firm favourite with locals for a tasty, reasonably priced lunch.The conviviality of market day is in marked contrast to an afternoon spent atKazerne Dossin, a holocaust museum dedicated to Mechelen’s transit camp for the deportation of Jews, Gypsies and homosexuals to Nazi concentration camps. The building is an austere concrete pentagon with four floors dedicated to the victims of wartime antisemitism in Belgium, as well as temporary exhibitions about contemporary human rights abuses across the globe.Afterwards, I wander along the futuristic towpath of the Dyle River that zigzags through the town centre – a raised ramp that seemingly floats above the water, dipping under ancient bridges and past the old fish market – until I come out atKruidtuin. The former botanical gardens are now a lush public park of streams, lakes and flowerbeds. Spring is definitely in the air, with the first daffodils shooting up, and locals are getting excited about the upcomingParkpopseason of outdoor summer concerts. Even though the music is free, this being little-known Mechelen, there are never huge crowds.Explore more on these topicsBelgium holidaysEurope holidaysCity breaksShort breaksCultural tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This family of crunchy, flaky pastries in various shapes and fillings are “immensely popular” throughout the country, says award-winning authorÖzlem Warren: “Even the fussiest child,” she assures readers of her book Özlem’s Turkish Table, “will … ask for seconds.”So foundational do börek seem to be to Turkish life that a conservative female politician made headlines a few years ago for a tweetclaimingthat, if a woman didn’t know how to make them, “her family is doomed to disintegration”. In reality, as others were quick to point out, though börek aren’t difficult to prepare (and, with practice, perfect), many Turkish women, as well as men, choose to buy them instead, without obvious domestic repercussions. As journalistBelgin Akaltan puts it: “You can make börek for your own pleasure, for your own pastime. Just for fun. For your kids, for your husband, for your friends, for your guests, for your lesbian partner, but do not put it in the middle of your life as an objective, unless you are a professional cook.” They are indeed fun to make – but, I must concede, even more fun to eat.The pastryView image in fullscreenArto der Haroutunian shapes his börek into ‘samosa-like triangles’. Thumbnails by Felicity.Arto der Haroutunian,the late Aleppo-born British Armenian artist and author of several books on the region’s cuisine, says in his ATurkish Cookbookthat börek can be made with “filo, flaky and shortcrust, but some … have their own dough”. To this end, he provides a recipe for a kind of puff pastry made with ghee and a large block of butter laminated into it. It’s delicious, as is the puff pastry thatAyşenur Altan, the Istanbul-born and based creator behind the TurkishFoodTravel website, uses in her“two-ingredienteasy Turkish börek”, but despite being rich and airy, both are quite different to the crunchy, crackly börek with which I’m more familiar.English-language recipes for börek often call for filo, which is easily found in supermarkets. However, without wading too far into international waters, filo is a Greek pastry and, strictly speaking, börek is made withyufka, a similar product that tends to be rolled out slightly thicker than filo; indeed, Ghillie Basan describes it asan “unleavened Anatolian bread”in her book Classic Turkish Cookery. If you happen to have a Turkish food specialist nearby, you should be able to find yufka in the fridge there. It’s also available online, so I’d recommend trying to get hold of some if you can, not least because, mentioning no names, much of the filo that’s widely available in the UK has all the charm of baked cardboard.That said, like filo, yufka has to be treated with care. Bring it to room temperature in its packaging before use, to reduce the risk of it cracking when unfolded. Then slather it with some sort of fat to render it supple enough to roll. Warren suggests a mixture of olive oil, milk and water, Basan sunflower oil, eggs and milk. Istanbul-born Kurdish chef and writerMelek Erdaluses melted butter, andTurkish-Australian chef Somer Sivrioglumilk, egg, yoghurt and sunflower oil in his book Anatolia, co-authored with David Dale. All work pretty well, though I like the flavour of yoghurt and olive oil with the egg best, because it seems to make things a little softer and richer.View image in fullscreenÖzlem Warren’s börek will have ‘even the fussiest child asking for seconds’.If you’d like to experiment with homemade yufka, Altan hasa useful tutorial. It is easier than it sounds, if you have the patience and a large enough work surface for rolling it out. I should add that many modern Turkish cooks seem to buy it for their homemade börek, but then, unlike us, they have it fresh on their doorsteps.The fillingBörek can be filled with just about anything you fancy, be that meat, cheese, potatoes or vegetables. Der Haroutunian, for example, gives a recipe for a milk, yoghurt and cheese-filled version from the city of Adapazar, and Sivrioglu makes one with cured, spiced beefpastirma, tomatoes and green chillies. One of the most common combinations seems to be greens – often spinach – andwhite cheese: Warren explains that “Turkish white cheese, orbeyaz peynir, is traditional … [but] living abroad, it’s hard to get, so I use a combination of feta cheese and grated mozzarella, which works well.”If you have access to a shop that caters to this part of the world, or indeed the Balkans, you’ll be able to find white cheese, a huge and varied international category of which feta is just the best-known example (see also “Greek” AKA strained yoghurt – Greece is almost as good at marketing as cooking). Feel free to add grated mozzarella, too – or, even better, Erdal’s grated halloumi; der Haroutunian includes an intensely cheesy variation using grated hard cheese and dried oregano. He suggests cheddar, though I’d recommend a very mild variety or, better still, something that’s lower fat to ensure it melts rather than splits).You could just leave it at that; Altan’s easy take is just white cheese and (optional!) parsley, but, much as I love cheese, I love it even more when it’s paired with greens, and specifically spinach. If using the greens raw, as Warren suggests, baby leaves are your best bet. But because Ireallylike spinach, I favour the more robust mature sort –something that most supermarkets seem to have decided to cancel, but which can be found at greengrocers and markets. You can also use frozen, in which case, defrost and squeeze out thoroughly before use. The mature variety enables me to pack as much into the pastry as possible, keeping it crisp. Erdal swaps the spinach for courgette, grated and squeezed dry, but whatever you go for, I’d advise removing as much liquid as possible before introducing it to the pastry.View image in fullscreenAyşenur Altan’s version is an ‘easy take’ on the classic, featuring just white cheese and (optional) parsley.Sivrioglu’s recipe also involves onion, spring onion, chilli flakes, dried mint and a punchy amount of black pepper – spicy and undeniably tasty, but my testers and I prefer the fresher, if milder aromatics of Erdal’s spring onions and soft herbs (dill, parsley and mint). I also love her addition of chopped walnuts, which echo the crunch of the pastry and nicely complement the bitterness of the spinach.Der Haroutunian and Warren include egg in their fillings, but, thanks to the eggy pastry basting liquid, I think I’ve got that base covered already. As she explains inVittles, Erdal’s recipe is partly inspired by a baklava-making session with one Aunty Nuray, whoseçarşaf baklavais apparently “famous on the street and would blow any other out of the park”. She pours over a “börek liquor”, rather than a syrup, of eggs, milk and olive oil, which is an excellent idea for any excess liquid, because it gives the börek a satisfyingly squidgy base.The assemblyBörek comes in many forms, from Warren’s traybaketepsi börek, which can be cut into handy portable squares, to der Haroutunian’s samosa-like triangles and even deep-fried cigars. Which one you go for depends largely on how you’re planning to consume the end result – the last two are good for nibbles and snacks, the traybakes and spirals suggest a heartier meal – but I find I have two favourite shapes.View image in fullscreenMelek Erdal’s crinkles the pastry horizontally, rather than stacking it vertically, to create a ‘brilliant’ concertina effect.The first is thekol– which Sivrioglu explains means arm, “presumably … because each roll of pastry is bent to look like an arm coming round to hug you”. It looks impressive, and I like the way that the filling is distributed throughout, rather than sandwiched between two layers of pastry. I will warn you, however, that a neat coil is easier to achieve with puff pastry than with yufka or filo – which, if not absolutely fresh, has a tendency to crack in non-expert hands (I speak from experience). But, messy or not, the results still look good to me.The second is Erdal’s concertina, in which the pastry is crinkled horizontally, rather than being stacked vertically, just like Aunty Nuray’s baklava, which means it has “a larger surface area exposed directly to heat, resulting in a crunchier and lighter börek”. I cannot tell you how delicious it is – much as I’d like to steal her brilliant idea, I urge you to tryher recipefor yourself.The finishView image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect börek.Brushing the börek with beaten egg, as Warren recommends, and scattering over some sesame or nigella seeds gives the pastry a lovely colour – though you might prefer to finish it with Erdal’s grated halloumi.

Wash and trim the spinach, then finely slice it stalks and all.Put a tablespoon of the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, then fry the onions, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until softened.View image in fullscreenAdd the spinach and salt, turn up the heat slightly and fry, stirring, until completely wilted and dried out (if using defrosted spinach, cook just until it’s well mixed in and dry).Stir in the pul biber, then spread out the spinach mix on a large plate or tray.View image in fullscreenOnce cool, roughly chop the fresh herbs and stir them into the spinach with the nuts, if using, and crumbled cheese. (This can all be done well in advance, because, once made, the filling will keep well in the fridge for a few days.)View image in fullscreenWhisk the egg, yoghurt and remaining olive oil in a small bowl.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, and grease a round, 24cm-wide ovenproof pan (or any baking tray wider than that) with a little oil.View image in fullscreenCarefully unfold the pastry and cut it into long rectangle-ish shapes (yufka is often sold in large circles, in which case if need be cut these in half to make half-moons, or, if it’s easier and you have only a small work surface, quarter-moons).Filo may come in smaller rectangles, which can be used whole – just lay one on a clean work surface, and keep the rest covered until use.View image in fullscreenBrush one pastry rectangle at a time with the egg and yoghurt mixture, then spoon a line of the filling down one of the long sides (or, if it’s a half moon, down the flat edge), leaving a small border around the edges.View image in fullscreenRoll up into a long, moderately tight sausage (don’t worry if it cracks slightly), brush with more egg-and-yoghurt mix and coil into the centre of an ovenproof pan – again, if it cracks as you coil it, it’s not the end of the world. Repeat, adding each sausage to the end of the coil, until all the filling is used up.View image in fullscreenScatter with the seeds, if using, then bake for 25 minutes, or until golden.

Cornbread, with its subtle sweetness, golden hue and earthy flavour, is a welcoming canvas for the kinds of toppings that more commonly adorn Italian flatbreads. Similarly, today’s satisfying dessert features the familiar flavours of rice pudding but delivers them in a gloriously snackable, transportable and plate-able form. Thanks to a reformulation influenced byflan patissier(Parisian custard tart), the pudding, which bakes atop a simple pastry crust, ends up firm enough to slice while remaining silky and custardy.Cornbread gets the pizza treatment (pictured top)Cornbread usually gets cast as a side dish, but this makes a meal of the stuff. Here, it’s embellished with a flavourful topping that includes roast mushrooms and potatoes, sweet red onion and tender greens.Cheese, herbs and spices deliver extra intrigue to the cornbread’s texture and flavour. If nettles are available near you, take advantage, but if not, baby leaf spinach or rocket will work well.Prep20 minCook50 min, plus coolingServes4For the topping275g oyster mushrooms, torn into 2cm pieces (shiitake or cremini are fine alternatives)225g waxy potatoes, cut into 3cm slices4 tbsp olive oilFine salt and black pepper1 medium red onion, peeled, halved, and sliced very thin90g parmesan, or sharp cheddar, coarsely grated50gbaby leaf spinach, or rocket or nettles2 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced thinly½ tsp dried thyme,or 1½ tsp fresh thyme leaves⅛ tsp cayenne pepper,or ¼ tsp red pepper flakes2 lemons, cut into wedges, to serveFor the cornbread base420g full-fat yoghurt105g olive oil2 large eggs100g mild honey1 tbsp baking powder½ tspbaking soda (bicarbonate of soda)¾ tsp fine salt280gcornmeal (polenta)120g plain flourHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and line a 33cm x 46cm baking tin with greaseproof paper. Put the mushrooms and potatoes in the tin, toss with two tablespoons of the olive oil and some salt and pepper, then bake for 15-18 minutes, until the vegetables are lightly roasted (the mushrooms will be browned at the edges). Set aside and turn down the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½.Put the onion, cheese, greens, garlic, thyme and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Add the roast mushrooms and potatoes, the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, then toss until well combined.Line the same baking tin you used for the vegetables with a fresh sheet of paper (or, if the used sheet is fairly clean, leave it in place and reuse). In a large bowl (or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment), whisk the yoghurt, olive oil, eggs, honey and 75g water until homogeneous. Add the baking powder, baking soda and salt, and mix well. Finally, add the cornmeal/polenta and flour, and mix just until no lumps or dry spots remain; don’t overmix.Scrape the batter into the lined tin and spread it out evenly to the tin’s walls. (A largeoffset spatulais the best tool for this task, but a flexible spatula or a large spoon will do.) Scatter the topping evenly over the batter, then bake for 25 minutes, until the cornbread is puffed and the edges are deeply browned.Remove and leave to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving with a lemon wedge to squeeze over. Once fully cooled, the cornbread can be wrapped tightly in foil or stored in an airtight container and refrigerated for up to two days. Reheat it in a toaster or oven.Rice pudding squaresView image in fullscreenBrian Levy’s rice pudding squares.Grapefruit zest brings a dash of herbal, citrus brightness to these creamy, vanilla-spiked squares. (The flavour is subtle, but if you’re not a grapefruit fan, feel free to swap in the zest of another citrus fruit, such as orange or lemon.) The stovetop rice preparation can be made up to a day ahead and stored in the fridge; the optional syrup can be made up to a week in advance.Prep10 minCook1 hr 35 min, plus coolingServes12For the crust185gall-purpose (plain)flour1½ tsp sugar(7g)½ tsp fine sea salt130g unsalted butter, very cold and cut into 1cm cubes50g whole milk1 egg yolkFor the rice custard135g short-grain white rice, such as arborio885g whole milk(or 750g if using single cream)160g sugar1 tbsp grapefruit zest, from about ½ a large grapefruitA pinch of salt3 large eggs65g double cream, or 200g single cream1 tbsp vanilla extractFor the tarragon-honey syrup (optional)100g honey1 tsp dried tarragon, or 1 tbsp fresh tarragon leavesLightly butter a 23cm x 33cm metal or glass baking dish that’s at least 3cm deep. Put the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor. Add the butter, then pulse until the mix resembles coarse breadcrumbs. In a spouted cup or jug, whisk the milk and egg yolk with a fork, then add to the dough while the motor is still pulsing, and mix until the liquid is evenly distributed. Pour the mix into the prepared baking dish and chill. (To make this without a food processor, mix the dry ingredients, add the cubed butter and work it into the flour with your fingertips until no pieces of butter larger than a pea remain. Whisk the milk and egg yolk, then gradually add this liquid to the flour/butter mixture, using a flexible spatula to mix just until the moisture is evenly distributed through the dough.)Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ and position a rack in the lower third. In a large, heavy-based pot over a high heat, bring a couple of litres of water to a boil. Add the rice, boil for two minutes, then strain immediately and run under cold water to cool it down.Return the blanched rice to the pot and add the milk, sugar, grapefruit zest and salt. Bring to a gentle boil, whisking occasionally, then turn down the heat to low. Cover and continue to simmer, stirring every few minutes, for 25 minutes, until the rice is tender, then take off the heat.Meanwhile, prepare the crust. Using your fingertips and the heel of your hand, spread the chilled dough evenly over the bottom of the baking dish. (For a more perfectly level and compacted pastry, lay some greaseproof paper over it and roll with a mini roller.) Pierce the dough every few inches with a fork, then bake for about 10 minutes, until lightly golden around the edges and dry to the touch. (The crust might appear frothy, but the foam will subside once you remove it from the oven.) Turn down the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5.In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cream and vanilla. Whisk in a little of the hot liquid from the milk-rice mixture to temper it (so the eggs don’t curdle when they meet the rest of the hot milk), then repeat with a couple of more ladlefuls. Scrape the remaining milk-rice mixture into the tempered egg and whisk thoroughly.Scrape the rice pudding on to the par-baked crust and, with a flexible spatula, evenly distribute it across the surface (it will be mostly covered by liquid) Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the centre is just set, the silhouettes of the rice grains push at the milky surface, and a few dark spots appear at the very edges. Remove and leave to cool for at least an hour.To make the optional syrup, in a small saucepan on a high heat, bring the honey and 100g water to a boil. Take off the heat, add the tarragon, cover, and leave to steep for five minutes. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the tarragon.Cut the rice pudding into 12 squares, then serve warm, cold or at room temperature topped with a generous spoonful of tarragon-honey syrup. Once completely cooled, the squares can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days.Good & Sweet, by Brian Levy, is published by Avery at £35.99.
