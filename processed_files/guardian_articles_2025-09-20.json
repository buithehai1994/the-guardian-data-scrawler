How did they bid farewell to their loved ones before setting off? What had driven them to accept such a mission? The answers to those questions, like the identities of the sailors, remain a mystery to Brazilian police.What investigators are certain of is the purpose of the vessel: a dungeon-like “narco-submarine” that they say was days away from starting a hellish three-week odyssey across the Atlantic carrying hundreds of millions of pounds-worth of cocaine to Europe.“You could pay me as much money as you liked and I confess I wouldn’t go … on such an insane journey,” said Fernando Casarin, the federal police chief whose special forces recently captured the narco-sub on the eve of its departure from the Amazon.“You ask yourself if [for these sailors] it’s a question of great courage or a total lack of awareness of what they’re getting into,” added Casarin, who is responsible for the vast state of Pará where the sub was found in May in a secret dockyard on the island of Marajó.View image in fullscreenA semi-submersible narco-submarine seized by Brazilian forces on Marajó, displayed at a navy base in Belém, August 2025.Photograph: Alessandro Falco/The GuardianColombian drug lords first started using narco-subs – in reality handmade semi-submersibles that travel just under the surface of the water with only their cockpit sticking out – to smuggle cocaine through the Caribbean towards Mexico and the US in the 1980s.More recently, crime bosses have become far more ambitious, commissioning fibreglass creations to ship huge hauls of cocaine thousands of miles to the coasts of Portugal and Spain.Casarin said the eye-watering profits involved in cocaine trafficking explained why South American criminals continue to use subs, despite the risks.View image in fullscreenJournalist Tom Phillips enters the confiscated ‘narco-submarine’.Photograph: Alessandro Falco/The GuardianA kilo of cocaine could be bought for $1,000-$2,000 (£740-£1,480) on Brazil’s border with Colombia, the world’s top cocaine producer. In Europe, where consumption is soaring, the same amount could be sold for about $60,000. A sub that successfully smuggled 5 or 6 tonnes of the drug to Europe could net its owners $200m-$250m. “The profits are astronomical,” Casarin said.Javier Romero, a Spanish journalist who is one of the leading chroniclers of the narco-sub industry, suspected South American kingpins had inaugurated the subaquatic trafficking route in the late 90s.View image in fullscreenUS Coast Guard officers intercept a submarine smuggling cocaine in the eastern Pacific in 2019.Photograph: Us Coast Guard Handout/EPABut police only confirmed the route’s existence in 2019 whenthe first such contraptionwas apprehended off the Iberian peninsula after its three occupants endured a 27-day nightmare from their starting point in the Brazilian Amazon.Romero, who works for the newspaperLa Voz de Galicia, believed the phenomenon has intensified dramatically in recent months, with “an uptick in activity” over the summer when the number of narco-sub alerts received by Spanish police rose from one every three months to more than five per month.In mid-September,Spanish police seized 3,500kg of cocainethat had been delivered to the Galician coastline and arrested three Colombian suspects – although their narco-sub was nowhere to be seen.Three months after the Brazilian narco-sub was captured on Marajó, the Guardian was given access to the 60ft vessel. Even on dry land, clambering into its cramped control room through a small hatch is a chilling and claustrophobic experience.Two narrow wooden bunk-beds, on either side of the wheelhouse, offer the only resting space. A plastic windscreen would have been the sailors’ only window to the world as they forged ahead through the waves towards Europe at about 16km/h.Osvaldo Scalezi, who runs the federal police’s anti-drug division, said that while most people assumed drowning was the greatest risk of travelling in a narco-sub, he believed it was suffocation. “You’ve got a very high-powered engine in there … and the exhaust pipes are really crudely made. There’s nothing to stop the combustion gases leaking into the vessel and asphyxiating them all to death,” Scalezi said.View image in fullscreenA view from inside the cockpit of the seized ‘narco-submarine’ in Belém showing the compass and the small windows used for navigation just above the waterline.Photograph: Alessandro Falco/The GuardianIn the vessel’s wooden bow, where the drugs would have been stored, sat the only creature comforts its crew would have enjoyed during their 6,000km transatlantic voyage. A 700-litre tank for drinking water, a freezer and a portable air-conditioning unit to cool the sweltering greenhouse-like machine.As he stared up at the wood and fibreglass hulk, Casarin compared the crew’s death-defying expedition to that of the American astronauts who made the first lunar landing in 1969. “It’s on that level,” he said. “It’s a crazy, pirate’s life.”The nameless blue boat was discovered two months afteran almost identical semisubmersible was caughtnear the Azores, during a joint operation in March involving Portuguese, Spanish, US and UK authorities. As well as 6 tonnes of cocaine, the vessel carried five men, three of whom were Brazilian from the Pará region.For Casarin, the arrest of those three Brazilians reinforced the idea that Pará and the neighbouring state of Amapá were becoming “a hub for the construction of these sorts of vessels”.Romero said the region’s remote jungles and mangroves were the ideal place to conceal “clandestine shipyards” that produced narco-subs. But it is far from the only location where such vessels are being built in South America – and Europe is no longer their most distant destination.View image in fullscreenA refrigerator and air conditioner onboard the narco-sub.Photograph: Alessandro Falco/The GuardianHenry Shuldiner, a researcher from Insight Crime who wrotea recent reporton narco-subs, recalled how in late 2024Colombian police intercepted a semisubmersibleas it crossed the Pacific towards Australia and New Zealand, a journey that takes at least double the time it takes to get to Europe.In January a scuttled narco-subturned upon Sierra Leone’s coast, strengthening Shuldiner’s belief thatthe narco-sub industry was going global.Despite the billions being made, little of that money finds its way to the mariners who steer the narco-subs across the Atlantic.Casarin believed Brazilian seamen earned just 30,000-50,000 reais (£4,000-£7,000) for such a trip. Romero, the author of a book about narco-subs called Operation Black Tide, said the Ecuadorian sailors on the first vessel seized in Europe had been offered about $15,000.“Narcotrafficking is an industry of exploitation, it always has been,” said the journalist, who calls the rickety vessels “propeller-driven coffins”.“Just imagine spending hours, or days, stuck inside one of these things,” Romero said. “It is total madness.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs tradeDrugsBrazilAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I have no ambition to be … ambassador to Washington.”It was a gag that got a big laugh. Burnham has never played the game of pretending that he doesn’t seek to enter No 10. But he also does not give the standard ambitious politician’s response of saying that no vacancy is available.Instead, he takes a more honest approach: that he would not have run twice to be leader of the Labour party if he didn’t want the job. Over the years, he has leftKeir Starmerin no doubt that he hopes one day to succeed him.But no one – including Burnham – thought the question would come this soon. Starmer’s government has plunged in popularity, Nigel Farage’s Reform is on the rise, a huge Commons rebellion on welfare has weakened the prime minister – and three scandals in a fortnight have seen a deputy leader and ambassador depart.After a summer dominated by Farage, more and more MPs have begun to believe their salvation lies north. They range from socialist MPs who admired Burnham’s anti-factionalism, to centrist new-intake MPs who see what he has done for growth in Greater Manchester.“His politics are now firmly at the progressive heart of theLabourparty,” one Labour insider said.His closest friend in politics these days, the mayor of Liverpool city region, Steve Rotheram, says the last seven years have been the making of Burnham. “I’ve known him for 18 years. I saw the way he started to shape politics once he left Westminster,” he said. “Before that, politics was starting to shape him.”Neal Lawson, the chief executive of the thinktank Compass, which co-founded the new Labour grouping Mainstream, which Burnham has endorsed, said the mayor now “feels comfortable in his own skin and beliefs. I think that’s instantly attractive whether you’re on the left or the right.”View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham on a Bee Network bus.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA MediaHe believes that Burnham is the most plausible successor should Starmer fail. “There is no perfect leader, but in the existential crisis we’re facing with the threat of the far right and the decline of the Labour party, a good leader is enough,” he said.Allies say Burnham is ready to run, and is just waiting for the right opportunity.Burnham v the machineThere are still huge hurdles for the so-called “king of the north” to lead an army south to take Westminster – but there are potential openings. Burnham would need a parliamentary seat as a first step towards a potential leadership run.There was a seat which had been identified. The Guardian understands that the Gorton and Denton MP, Andrew Gwynne, who was suspended from Labour and now sits as an independent, had applied on grounds of ill health for medical retirement from the MPs pension fund. However, sources said that he had then not proceeded with the claim. It is unclear why. Gwynne has not responded to requests for comment.View image in fullscreenStarmer and Burnham at No 10 Downing Street during a meeting between the PM and regional mayors.Photograph: Ian Vogler/Daily Mirror/PABurnham is said to have told one well-placed MP earlier this year that he and Gwynne had reached an agreement. But his allies deny that he has had any conversations with MPs about stepping down to make way for him. “There is no pact,” one insisted.Parliamentary sources suggested there could be other opportunities on the horizon, with at least two Manchester MPs sacked during the reshuffle said to feel disgruntled towards the leadership. “You close one door, another one opens,” a source said.The next hurdle Burnham faces is far greater: he would have no guarantee of the nomination should he decide to try to return to Westminster in a byelection.Burnham’s ambitions are not the only reason he would face a struggle against the machine. There is a deeply fractious relationship between Burnham and the prime minister.Starmer was Burnham’s deputy when he was shadow home secretary. In 2020, Starmer travelled up to Manchester to ask for support with his leadership bid, according to the biography of Starmer by Tom Baldwin. The mayor said no. He felt he should throw his weight behind one of the two local MPs standing, Rebecca Long-Bailey or Lisa Nandy.Starmer, who, according to friends, does not like asking for things, was furious. The relationship has not recovered, but the animosity was deepened by the Labour conference of 2021, when Starmer was struggling during the Tories’ “vaccine bounce”.Burnham’s face was everywhere, hinting at his leadership ambitions. “It was intolerable,” the aide said. Burnham at the time said anyone offended should “be less sensitive, I guess” about his attempts to start conversations about the party’s lack of vision.Now, as Starmer’s Labour government struggles against an insurgent right, Burnham has been at the front of the launch of Mainstream, calling for “a more inclusive, less factional way of running the party”. It is designed to press for change in the way Labour operates, though it could be turned into a leadership vehicle.Another complication: Burnham’s selection as a candidate – should a byelection occur – is in the hands of Labour’s national executive committee.Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, has been able to ruthlessly control selections up until the election. But blocking Burnham would be a different magnitude of controversy – and Lucy Powell, a close ally of Burnham, will take a spot on the NEC if she becomes deputy leader. His fate, however, would ultimately be determined by a three-person NEC panel – who could be chosen for their loyalty.“Of course it’s possible to block him. They would just take a huge political hit doing so,” one sceptical MP said. “Letting Andy Burnham in after caving to pressure from their own moaning MPs, just to have him mount a leadership challenge would be very on-brand for this inept No 10.”Even if Burnham does win any selection, in the current climate, Reform UK could win the seat. The mayor’s friends are bullish. “Andy is a big beast in his own right, and people in Greater Manchester know he is on their side, whatever they think of the Labour party nationally.”Left, right and centreView image in fullscreenJeremy Corbyn after winning the Labour leadership in 2015.Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex/ShutterstockAs a young political adviser, and then a minister, Burnham had a reputation as a Blairite but when Ed Miliband was leader he began to push left. “He would complain that we were too much Hampstead and not enough Hull,” one contemporary said.As one of Miliband’s senior frontbenchers, Burnham played an instrumental role in what came next. During the reform of the leadership election rules in 2014, he “pushed very hard” to bring down the threshold of MP nominations to qualify to 10%, from the original proposal of 20%, complaining that the higher barrier would prevent him from running in future. It would have also, it turns out, prevented Jeremy Corbyn from running.His second campaign for leader in 2015 was a pivot, one that is “almost painful to recall”, says one backer. In what was a major right turn, he launched his campaign at Ernst & Young, accompanied to the podium by Rachel Reeves, now Starmer’s chancellor.He told a crowd of assembled businessmen that entrepreneurs “will be as much our heroes as the nurse”, pledging to scrap the mansion tax policy and saying there should be an early EU referendum.It was an obvious wrong turn. One perhaps born of the fact that, his parliamentary backers saw his potential weak spot as being seen as too far left. It was rumoured that Burnham-backing MPs were told to nominate Jeremy Corbyn, who could run to his left in order to cast Burnham as a centrist. It was a catastrophic misreading of the party membership.When Corbyn won, Burnham was the only other leadership candidate to serve in his shadow cabinet. He stayed loyal and was not one of the frontbenchers who resigned en masse in 2016 to try to force him out. Instead, the same year, he stood down from parliament and successfully ran to become the first mayor of Greater Manchester.In almost a decade as mayor, the city under Burnham has been a great success story for devolution. It is one of the few parts of the country with economic growth. He has used new transport powers to create the Bee Network of buses now fully under the control of the authority, designing it for users rather than profit.But it was his defence of the city during Covid which really won him recognition as an independent thinker and a fighter.The other cause which has been the making of Burnham has been his tireless campaign for the victims of the Hillsborough disaster. To cynics, it was only taken on after he was booed at Anfield at a memorial service as culture secretary, when the government was still resisting a full inquiry. Burnham himself acknowledges that was a turning point; he raised the issue at cabinet within days. It was the first step towards the inquiry that wouldultimately reach the verdict of unlawful killing.Back to the ‘bubble’In parliament there remain a number of high-profile MPs who remain close to Burnham, the former cabinet minister Louise Haigh as well as Powell, and other friends in the cabinet such as Lisa Nandy and Jonathan Reynolds. He has considerable loyalty from MPs across the political spectrum in Greater Manchester – but also in Liverpool and surrounding constituencies.One group that has long been warming the idea of an Andy Burnham run is the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs – which once would have been called Corbynites. But others, including new Labour MPs in the Labour Growth Group, are attracted to the idea of a popular northerner at the helm, with the experience of running a major city where there has been significant economic growth.Those latter MPs however are just as likely to be turned off by any close association with the former. Burnham will appear at a Labour conference event next week with several key leftwing rebels, including Lewis, Nadia Whittome and Rachael Maskell.“The hardcore welfare rebels are already behind him – he needs to urgently move to build a broader coalition across the PLP or he’s not going to be an MP, much less carry the numbers for a challenge,” one senior Labour source warned.Many of his friends say that should Burnham return to Westminster, they know he would find the confines of Whitehall deeply frustrating. “I wouldn’t do it for anything,” said Rotheram. “I don’t think the Westminster bubble is a healthy way to do our politics, too many distractions, too many lobbyists, but what I would say is that having our experience is a great advantage.“If Andy ever did decide to come back down, he would have the incentive to change that, to change the whole way politics is delivered in this country. That’s a big decision for him given where he currently is.”"

Standing on the cold sand on a Sunday morning, I saw the sun flash off powerful surf as it curved into whitewater that rushed up the beach. The sound of it boomed around the nearby cliffs. The passing clouds threw dark green patches across the frothy water, the air was crisp and dry. Today’s swim promised to be great.The members of my winter swimming club were pulling on cozzies, bright pink swimming caps and goggles as they assessed the challenging conditions. The car park was jammed with surfers from all around. Word had spread that MacMasters beach here on the New South Wales Central Coast wastheplace to experience this monstrous east swell.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsAfter sizing up the ocean, most swimmers opted to stay in the shallows where they could still stand up, or headed to the protected rockpool to do a few laps. After all, the only rule of the winter swimming club is to get your head wet.But I decided to swim out, along with one other swimmer.View image in fullscreen‘My desire to swim further out evaporated. I didn’t know what had happened but it was time to get out of the water.’Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianTo avoid the dumping waves as they hit the shore, and to negotiate the partially hidden rocks, timing was everything. When a lull arrived we ran and dived in, feeling the shock of the cold water. As I reached deeper water I pulled on my swim fins and goggles and let my breathing adjust to the chill.I was about a hundred metres from shore when a large set loomed, broke and rushed towards me. I dived deep into gloomy green water and felt the wave’s power move through and over me. More waves came and I dived again. After the third dive I came up and felt something was wrong.White noise rushed into my left ear. I began to feel weak. A cramping kind of pain moved down the right side of my neck. My desire to swim further out evaporated. I didn’t know what had happened but it was time to get out of the water.I tried swimming freestyle but my face suddenly hated the idea of immersion. I tried sidestroke interspersed with bursts of freestyle and pauses, hoping for a wave that would take me to shore. Absurdly, I kept an eye on my fellow swimmer, who did not have swim fins on, in case he needed help. We inched closer to shore, where worse awaited me.The beach was steep, eroded by the crash of waves. I tumbled around in the shallows, confused by the jumble of sand and water, and a little embarrassed that I seemed so uncoordinated. Wave after wave hit me, pushing me, pulling me back out to sea. I didn’t have much say about where I went.View image in fullscreen‘I looked up to see a surfer in his wetsuit with a board under his arm, crouching down with a look of concern.’Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianOther members of the swimming club saw that I was close to shore and turned back towards the clubhouse, assuming I was just having trouble removing my fins. I wanted to call out for help but I couldn’t. They were a few metres away but I couldn’t make a sound.In place of fear or panic there was a void. Every inch of me was devoted to trying to regain my senses.‘Mum, my brain’: how I learned to walk, talk and even dance again after a devastating stroke at 36Read moreI reached the sand but any relief was short-lived. I could not stand up. My head weighed a tonne, my neck was as weak as string, helpless as a newborn baby. All my skull wanted to do was connect with the ground. There I might find rest, I might stop the beach from spinning and the arcs of distortion in my vision might ease.Minutes went by with me slumped in a nauseous lump on the sand, sometimes sitting, sometimes on all fours, but always with my head inches from the ground. People walked past me. I was still too confused to ask for help.Then a hand touched my shoulder. “Are you all right, mate?”I looked up to see a surfer in a wetsuit with a board under his arm, crouching down with a look of concern. My brain had no choice in the face of such a direct inquiry. I told him I couldn’t stand up, that my left ear was full of white noise and that he needed to alert my club mates. He ran to get help.Relief sluggishly spread over me. Someone knew I needed help and my friends – who were surf lifesavers like me – would know what to do. I rested, watching as two of them ran up the beach towards me.I was half-dragged to the club, placed on a chair and wrapped in a space blanket. I mumbled about getting someone to call my wife to pick me up. Two ambulances arrived instead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

My blood vessels were fascinating, she said with a hint of excitement, with a congenitally narrow one the source of the problem.It was hard not to feel anything other than utterly blessed. The stroke had not stopped me from getting to shore. Nurses told me I had had the best possible stroke – if such a thing existed – and there was every indication I would dodge the stroke mortality rates ranging from 9% to 39% that Google threw at me. The literature I was given about stroke recovery also made me realise how lucky I’d been. I left hospital a day later with a few packs of blood thinners and no impairments beyond exhaustion.Once, my father carried me into the surf. Now my arm steadies his steps back to the sea | Tim BakerRead moreA week later I returned to the beach. As I drove there I worried I wouldn’t be able to stand the sight of where it all happened. Would it bring back memories of the nauseous swirl of confusion, of the crowd of paramedics carrying out stroke tests, staring into my eyes, putting a cannula into my arm, attaching electrodes to my chest?The moment I looked out over the ocean those fears disappeared. My connection to that quietly tucked away place had become richer. I had helped save lives there for years as a volunteer surf lifesaver. Now I had my own story to tell, and God to thank for still being around to tell it.As I stood there thanking those who had saved me, it felt as though a circle had been completed. It was clear to me that we are not designed to live in isolation. We need to rely on others. My gratitude that day reminded me of the CS Lewis quote about how joy is not complete until it is expressed in praise.View image in fullscreen‘It turns out the problem in my neck had been building for a few weeks. It was sheer luck that the vessel blew at a time when help was close at hand.’Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianA couple of days earlier, I had tracked down the surfer whose instinct to check on me had made all the difference. I thanked him profusely. It felt important.When I returned to the neurologist for a check-up a month later, I found that healing was under way. But she warned me to avoid big surf in the future. I tried to negotiate her down to a few months but she wouldn’t budge. It made me realise just how much I need the ocean, how dependent I am on it, how much I use it as a counterbalance to the pressures of life. It’s where I go when I am happy, it’s where I go when I am stressed or struggling, it’s where I go to be alone, and where I go to be with others who love it in the same way. Family holidays with my wife and two daughters revolve around it. When a holiday at a seaside town ends, I joke that we will just have to go back to the seaside town where we live.Will this injury take all that away? If I go out on a big day and have another stroke, will I be as lucky?A part of me feels a little selfish for still wanting to get out there, to again feel that thrill, that force of nature. And for nearly 10 years I have loved the community and purpose that lies at the heart of surf livesaving. Would I still be able to do that?It turns out the problem in my neck had been building for a few weeks. It was sheer luck that the vessel blew at a time when help was close at hand.I have gone back to the water. Bit by bit. Not the big surf. I now know that I have a weak point. I just have to take the future one swell at a time.Graham Russell is Guardian Australia’s deputy international editorExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleStrokeSwimmingHealth (Australia news)OceansVolunteeringHealth (Society)featuresShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Matt is the co-founder ofSchool of Dough, a wonderful initiative that teaches children in some of Cornwall’s least prosperous communities how to cook; he also runs a stall calledSalt Yard Pizzaat the Boathouse on Newquay harbour. His pizza is some of the best in the country, not just because he’s mastered traditional techniques, but because he grows his own tomatoes and basil, and even rears his ownmangalitzapigs to turn into charcuterie.I love making pizza in my portable pizza oven, but it does involve a fair amount of work, from the preparation of the dough to the pressure of cooking several pizzas in quick succession. Even so, I can’t remember the last time I bought a supermarket pizza, and my only real memories of them are of those ultra-processed cardboard discs from the 1980s. Sadly, as a result of this tasting, I’ve discovered that those still exist (I don’t know what that says about British food culture), but I’m also happy to report that there are now some genuinely delicious options out there, too, with a few real standouts of near restaurant quality.I focused on lower- to mid-range margheritas, and excluded premium pizzas that stray from the classic bread-tomato-cheese formula by adding extras such as sun-blushed tomatoes. To test each product fairly, I cooked each pizza according to the manufacturer’s instructions, then tasted it with my family. The worst examples felt like 80s industrial “food” throwbacks, all bland and joyless, save for the hit of salt, sugar and fat.For such a processed-looking product, however, most supermarket margheritas actually contain relatively few ultra-processed ingredients. The main recurring additives were calcium carbonate (a flour improver and calcium fortifier) and niacin (vitamin B3), both of which are harmless in small amounts and are more often found in the lowest-quality pizzas with dense, flavourless bases. Ultra-processed foods, however, aren’t defined purely by additives. According to theNova classification, which links levels of food processing with health outcomes, ready-to-eat convenience foods such as pizza still sit firmly in the ultra-processed category.Although the best pizzas I tried were made with better, more chewy dough, really good cheese and plenty of well-balanced tomato sauce, it’s worth remembering that even the most basic oven pizza can be transformed with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt, a sprinkle of dried herbs and a few choice fresh toppings.The best supermarket margherita pizzasBest all-rounder:Doughboys classic margherita pizzaView image in fullscreen£4.95 for 340g at Ocado (£1.46/100g)★★★★☆A large, classic Italian-style pizza with a nicely puffedcornicione(crust) and just the right amount of cheese. The delicious base is topped with a balanced tomato sauce that’s sweet and acidic. The texture isreallygood, and very close to fresh pizza. Hand-stretched and stone baked in Italy, made with 100% Emilia Romagna tomato pulp. This independent British brand creates professional-standard pizzas with minimal processing. Disappointingly little information online about their sustainability practices, however.Best bargain:Tesco Finest margherita wood-fired pizzaView image in fullscreen£4.75 for 410g at Tesco (£1.16/100g)★★★☆☆A really nice-looking, Neapolitan-style pizza with a puffy crust, balls of mozzarella and fresh basil. The mix of cheese gives this a satisfying, gooey, varied topping, and the basil is wonderful. Slightly disappointing texture to the dough, though, especially considering how good it looks before baking; a higher baking temperature might improve this. Contains niacin, among other additives, but very good value.And the rest …Crosta Mollica margherita pizzaView image in fullscreen£5.75 for 403g a Tesco (£1.43/100g)£6 for 403g at Waitrose (£1.49/100g)★★★★☆In my top three, made on sourdough with a neat, slightly puffed crust. The traditional tomato sauce and mozzarella with PDO parmesan bring great flavour. It didn’t quite make best all-rounder, though, because it could really do with a touch more cheese.Picard margherita pizzaView image in fullscreen£5.25 for 420g at Ocado (£1.25/100g)★★★★☆My daughter’s favourite, and a close second for best all-rounder. An interesting style with mostly precooked grated cheese, plus some mozzarella balls. Thin, crunchy crust with a lovely, generous amount of tomato sauce that packs heaps of flavour. One of the saltiest and fattiest, which is probably why it’s one of the tastiest.Goodfella’s margherita stone baked thinView image in fullscreen£2.88 for 334g at Asda (86p/100g)£3 for 334g at Tesco (90p/100g)★★☆☆☆skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Formerly the site of Barking Reach power station, these 17 hectares (42 acres) of industrial land at Dagenham Dock in eastLondonwere due to be redeveloped into a new, purpose-built wholesale food market for the capital.However, that changed late last year when the site’s owners, the City of London Corporation, announced it hadcancelledthe development, which would have relocated Smithfield meat market and Billingsgate fish market.The corporation, which is exceptionally wealthy compared with typical UK local authorities, blamed inflation and rising construction costs, despite having already spent just under £230m of the project’s £741m cost on buying and clearing the land. It has since faced abacklashover its plans to permanently close London’s ancient food markets in 2028.“TheCity of Londonploughed a lot into clearing the site up,” says the local Labour MP, Margaret Mullane, looking through the gates at the vacant lot.View image in fullscreenWorkers were stunned at City of London Corporation’s plan to close Smithfield market, which was established in 1133.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe decision was a big blow for Dagenham, located north of the Thames on London’s eastern fringe, with a proud industrial heritage once synonymous with its Ford factory, where some of the carmaker’s best known vehicles – including the Model Y and Fiesta – rolled off the production line.The days of Ford’s dominance in the area are long gone since its1950s heyday,when it employed about 40,000 people, compared with just under 2,000 now.Barking and Dagenham council expected the markets would bring 2,700 new jobs to the area, boosting the local economy in the London borough which is home to 220,000 people, and also has the unhappy status of recordingsome of the highest levels of deprivationin the capital. The area was alsoranked fifth-worst in Englandin the most recent index of deprivation.A “food school” was also planned, which the corporation previously said would help create a new generation of market traders and “play a pivotal role in training future butchers, fishmongers and fruiterers, ensuring they acquire the essential skills to thrive in the industry”.The market development, which also envisaged the relocation of the fruit and vegetable market at nearby Leyton, formed akey part of the local planfor the borough published by Barking and Dagenham council just weeks before the corporation pulled the plug.View image in fullscreenMargaret Mullane at the proposed site of a new tube station, Bean Park.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“With the three markets not coming, and Ford, the public are quite rightly worried about unaffordable housing. What they tell politicians is it’s all about bringing good, well-paid jobs here, jobs you can raise a family on,” says Mullane, adding that many of the blocks of flats being built nearby are considered out of reach for local salary levels. “Our child poverty level is the same as Blackpool, and we have some of the lowest wages in London.”About nine months on from the decision, it is not clear what the future holds for the Dagenham site, which is still owned by the corporation, which managesassets worth billions of pounds, and collects £1.3bn in business rates annually, most of which it passes to central government.Dominic Twomey had not long been the Labour leader of Barking and Dagenham council when the cancellation of the markets development was announced.Smithfield and Billingsgate market redevelopment plans begin – but traders’ future in doubtRead moreWhile he will not criticise the financial reasoning for the decision, he concedes the planned regeneration of the site is out of his control.“We’re in the hands of the corporation,” says Twomey. “We don’t even know whether they are planning to sell the site, or are waiting until the economy improves and are looking for other alternatives.”Twomey and other locals also regret the lost prospects for young people in the borough.“It’s more a regeneration loss in terms of potential opportunities, as opposed to a financial loss,” he says. “It is the opportunities it would have brought to the area both in terms of jobs and stimulating the economy there with all of the spin-offs that we might have hoped to get such as retail shops and restaurants.”In June, the corporation announced thecreation of a regeneration teamtasked with overseeing the redevelopment of the current Smithfield and Billingsgate sites – due to become a cultural destination and housing – as well as finding a new location for the markets, and working with local representatives on redeveloping the Dagenham site.The City of London Corporation says the plot is now open for other uses, adding that it is “perfectly placed to receive goods from around the world, via the Thames Estuary Gateway”.View image in fullscreenThe last Ford Cortina – the 4,279,079th – built at Dagenham on 22 July 1982.Photograph: FordThe corporation added it would be “more specific” about the future of the site once it has engaged with property developers.Chris Hayward, the corporation’s policy and resources chair, said: “The Barking Reach site in Dagenham Dock has the potential to be a real powerhouse for economic activity in the area, with uses that work hard for local people whilst also supporting the UK economy.”Lack of clarity about the future of the site is just one way in which Dagenham could be now said to be treading water.The nearby Thames freeport – which stretches eastward along the river past the Ford site to the London Gateway port in Thurrock, Essex – has recentlyhired consultants to draw up a master planto “regenerate the region into a national centre for low-carbon industry, advanced logistics, and digital innovation”.Meanwhile, Ford still owns the sprawling 450-acre plant alongside the river, where it now builds just shy of 1m diesel engines a year for vehicles such as the Transit and converts vans into specialist vehicles such as ambulances. Two ships filled with cars dock daily at its jetty on the Thames, to be transported onwards to dealerships.However, the end of the road for diesel engines is in sight, before aplanned phase-outof new petrol and diesel cars, and large parts of the plot are underused. A company spokesperson said an assessment was being carried out into the best future use of the site.View image in fullscreenResident Lewis Richardson is disappointed that the Bean Park tube station has not been built.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianIn 2016, the carmaker sold off its stamping plant – where the strikes by sewing machinists, depicted in the film Made in Dagenham, resulted in the 1970 Equal Pay Act – that has since become a large new housing development, with 4,000 homes under construction.Despite such redevelopment of former industrial land, many residents feel let down that a long-promised railway station at Beam Park, designed to connect an area with poor transport links directly to the City of London, still has not been built, after the previous government withdrew its support.“It’s the whole reason we moved in,” says Lewis Richardson, a resident who moved to Beam Park in late 2022. “It was supposed to be built in a year or two, and my partner was going to jump on the train to work. Now we have to rent a parking spot.”One highlight of the council’s local plan has, however, come to fruition. A brand new film and television studio has recently opened in a somewhat unexpected location on a main road, opposite a Toby Carvery restaurant.Reality shows, drama and commercials are now being filmed on some of the 12 sound stages at Eastbrook Studios, the largest measuring almost a third of a hectare , while the complex also offers office and workshop space.View image in fullscreenStephen Hursthouse at Eastbrook Studios.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianFunded by the US investment firm Hackman Capital Partners and operated by its subsidiary MBS Group, the nine-hectare site was previously a Sanofi pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. The council acquired land with the goal of creating a “digital, science and tech cluster”, preventing it ending up as a supermarket distribution centre, says Stephen Hursthouse, MBS Group’s vice-president for studio real estate in UK and Ireland.“Part of the site’s appeal is its size,” says Hursthouse, driving around the huge complex in a golf buggy. “From our perspective, there’s a Travelodge over the road for crew, tick; a coffee shop, tick; the tube station is right there and it’s the closest studio of its size to central London.”While many film and TV productions tend to bring their own crews with them, Hurthouse believes there could in time be 5,000 people working at Eastbrook on multiple productions, and hopes this will inspire local young people.“Lots of people said it wouldn’t happen, but it was bold and it has been delivered,” he says.Explore more on these topicsInfrastructureLondonLocal governmentCity of LondonEnglandConstruction industryRegenerationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having spent considerable time analyzing the events of the past week, I’ve realized I should probably issue a public apology for some of my statements over the years. Here we go: I’m sorry for expressing radical and dangerous opinions like “women deserve equal rights and shouldn’t be treated like walking wombs”. I’m sorry for suggesting Palestinians shouldn’t be systematically exterminated while Donald Trump posts aboutbuilding a resort in Gaza. Going forward I will do better and ensure that I double-check all my opinions with the government. There isn’t an official Department of Thought Control yet, but no doubt we’ll get there soon.I wish I was joking about all this but, as you will have noticed, we are in a critical moment for free speech in the US. The killing of Charlie Kirk was a tragedy for his family, but theTrump administrationhas been ruthlessly using Kirk’s death to further a crackdown on dissent and erode first amendment protections.The day after Kirk was fatally shot, for example, the deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, urgedpeople to reportany “foreigners” to the state department who post on social media “praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event.” The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,later saidthat the state department has “most certainly been denying visas” to people celebratingKirk’s death. It’s obviously not in good taste to celebrate anyone’s murder, but the fact that calling out Kirk’s divisive andbigoted viewscould possibly be considered “rationalizing” his death and get you deported is chilling.It’s not just foreigners who are being told they should be wary about what they say. On Monday Vice-President JD Vance, who was guest-hosting an episode of the Charlie Kirk Show, encouraged people to report anyone celebrating the influencer’s death to that person’semployer. Presumably so said employer can fire them.There have, of course, already been numerous Kirk-related firings and suspensions. An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency wasreportedly placedon administrative leave over an Instagram post describing Kirk as “the literal racist homophobe misogynist.” MSNBC fired political analystMatthew Dowdafter he suggested Kirk’s “awful words” fueled “awful actions”. Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show wassuspended “indefinitely”after he noted “many in Maga Land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”. Washington Post columnistKaren Attiahhas also said she was fired over social media posts after Kirk’s killing.The weaponization of Kirk’s death is so alarming that even one of Trump’s former allies is rattled. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who was once one of theloudest voicesin the Magasphere, recently issued a stark warning about the way that the Trump administration appears to be leveraging Kirk’s murder to trample civil liberties.“You hope that a year from now, the turmoil we’re seeing in the aftermath of [Kirk’s] murder won’t be leveraged to bring hate speech laws to this country,”Carlson saidon Wednesday during an episode of his podcast. This was in reference to Attorney General Pam Bondi’s comments (which she has nowwalked back) that the Trump Department of Justice would “target” people disseminating “hate speech” following Kirk’s killing.“And trust me, if it is, if that does happen, there is never a more justified moment for civil disobedience than that, ever,” Carlson added. “Because if they can tell you what to say, they’re telling you what to think … There is nothing they can’t do to you because they don’t consider you human.”LikeMarjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman who has recently started speaking a limited amount of sense on certain topics, Carlson is no ally to progressives. Indeed Carlson’s hate-mongering, and his former public cheerleading for Trump, are a large part of why we are in such a mess. But the fact that even a far-right voice like Carlson is worried about the authoritarian direction in which the US isheadingshould chill you to the bones. Carlson appears to have realized that no one is safe in the dictatorship that Trump appears intent on building. Not even him.Nuns on the run in AustriaSister Regina, 86, Sister Rita, 81, and Sister Bernadette, 88, are doing it for themselves.

It is able to maximise its profits on these deals because it is exempt from most business taxes.HS2 was supposed to connect Crewe with London in under an hour, as well as delivering high-speed services to Birmingham and Manchester. It was expected to bring an estimated 6.3 million extra passengers to the town by 2036 and boost the local economy by £750m per year.View image in fullscreenThe Land Registry document says: ‘The transferee has paid the sum of eight hundred thousand pounds plus value added tax.’Photograph: Land RegistryIn preparation, officials planned a series of major upgrades to the area’s infrastructure. Acquiring land from the duchy’s estate was key and at least three plots were sold before the northern phase of the project was shelved in 2023 amid spiralling costs.In Crewe, the duchy was free to negotiate on price because, unlike other landowners whose property was acquired as part of developments linked to HS2, it is largely exempt from compulsory purchase laws.The payments were made between 2012 and 2017, when the duchy was controlled by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Its profits increased sharply during her reign, although throughout her lifetime its vast landholdings were kept secret, even from parliament.View image in fullscreenCrewe Hall, a Jacobean mansion in Cheshire, was acquired by the Duchy of Lancaster in 1936. In recent years, some of the land surrounding it has been sold.Photograph: Avalon/Construction Photography/AlamyThe king did not have to pay inheritance tax when it passed to him upon her death in 2022, as the duchy enjoys special status as a crown body. It is also exempt from corporation tax and capital gains tax.Last year, it generated an income of £26.5m. It is understood that the king voluntarily paid some income tax on this dividend, but he is not obliged to disclose how much.In July, the duchy announced it would “actively review” its policies after it was criticised for making money from public bodies and charities.It came after a joint investigation by Channel 4 Dispatches and the Sunday Times uncovered some of the business deals it had made with taxpayer-funded organisations. This included a 15-year agreement with an NHS trust, worth £11.4m. The trust parks its ambulances in a warehouse built on duchy land in south London.More details of its past dealings with taxpayer-funded organisations are still emerging.HS2 – first mooted by Labour in 2009 – was formally announced by the coalition government in January 2012. Crewe immediately emerged as the frontrunner to host a hub station in the north-west, although officials said a section of the A500 road near the town would have to be realigned to accommodate a rail bridge.View image in fullscreenLand Registry document quotes: ‘THE QUEEN’S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY in the right of Her Duchy of Lancaster…CHESHIRE EAST BOROUGH COUNCIL’Photograph: Land RegistryThe local authority,CheshireEast council, also planned to work with central government to turn a section of the A500 into a dual carriageway in order to improve access to the station from the M6 motorway. It said the A500 was “integral to achieving the full economic potential of HS2”.Land Registry documents show that the transport department bought several plots of land close to the A500 in 2012, when these plans were being drawn up.It paid £318,000 for a slice of duchy land next to the section of the road the local authority hoped to upgrade and later transferred ownership to the council.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It paid £800,000 to acquire the relevant land in 2014 – two years earlier it had used plans for the road in its pitch to central government for an HS2 hub in the town.The new road was opened in 2015 and named after local man David Whitby, one of the drivers of the train that was hijacked during theGreat Train Robbery in 1963.At its opening, Edward Timpson, then the MP for Crewe and Nantwich, said that Crewe now had a “transport network which is fit for purpose and really looking forward, with HS2 on the horizon”.In 2018, the council also carried out work to upgrade a roundabout at Crewe Green, a short drive from the station, widening junctions so traffic could merge from different directions. It included new footways and cycle paths.A local authority document said one objective of these upgrades was to deliver “network resilience in the era prior to the arrival of the HS2 hub”. The previous year, it paid £14,400 for duchy land it needed to build on.View image in fullscreenRishi Sunak announced in 2023 that the northern phase of HS2 would be scrapped after costs had ballooned.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFormer prime minister Rishi Sunak was accused of the biggest infrastructure climbdown in a generation when he announced at the 2023 Conservative party conference that the northern phase of HS2 would be scrapped after costs had ballooned to about £71bn.Cheshire East council said the cancellation of HS2 was a “devastating blow” which left it on the verge of bankruptcy. It recently accepted a funding package from central government of £25.3m.A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said: “As with any landowner, the acquisition and disposal of property assets forms part of routine activities.“We wouldn’t comment on individual transactions, but any such payments would be invested back into the Duchy estate rather than as distributable income to the Monarch.“The Duchy of Lancaster estate is not incorporated and therefore not subject to corporation tax. However, The king voluntarily pays income tax on income from the Duchy of Lancaster.“A decision by the Duchy Council on charity rents has been reached and any changes will be announced in due course.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The move comes despite pressure from the US and the families of hostages held by Hamas.Starmer said in July he would recognise Palestine before the gathering of world leaders at the UN general assembly next week if the situation did not improve.What the UK’s recognition of Palestinian statehood will meanRead moreAlongside the continued military offensive and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the UK government is alarmed at plans to accelerate Israeli settlements in theWest Bankwhich ministers fear will end any hope of a two-state solution.Labour has sought to stress that recognition of a Palestinian state is not a reward for Hamas, and emphasised that it would have no role in the future governance of Gaza. It is expected the government will ratchet up sanctions on Hamas in due course, and it has stepped up demands for the release of hostages.David Lammy, the deputy prime minister who will represent the UK at the general assembly, said: “It’s important to state that the recognition of a Palestinian state, it is a consequence of the serious expansion that we’re seeing in the West Bank, the settler violence that we’re seeing in the West Bank and the intention and indications that we’re seeing to build, for example,the E1 developmentthat would run a coach and horses throughthe possibility of a two-state solution.”Israel has ramped up its offensive on Gaza City, including with strikes that health officials said on Saturday killed at least 14 people overnight. Later inIsrael, thousands of demonstrators joined the families of hostages still being held by Hamas to demand that Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, negotiate an end to the war.High-level meetings at the UN summit involving world leaders begin on 23 September. Starmer has found himself at odds with Donald Trump’s administration over the move, which is opposed to giving official recognition to the state.The Labour leader previously suggested British recognition was conditional and he would refrain if Israel committed to a ceasefire and long-term sustainable peace that delivers a two-state solution, and allow the UN to restart the supply of aid.All three conditions are however unlikely to be met given the Israeli government opposes these terms. The State of Palestine is currently recognised by 147 of the UN’s 193 member states.Family members of some of the 48 hostages still in captivity have written an open letter to Starmer condemning the move.The letter said: “Your regrettable announcement of the UK’s intention to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations general assembly has dramatically complicated efforts to bring home our loved ones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We write to you with a simple plea – do not take this step until our loved ones are home and in our arms.”Criticism also came from opposition parties, with the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, accusing Starmer of “capitulating” to his backbenchers to shore up his leadership.Lammy added: “In relation to what is happening inGaza… we’ve got to see the hostages out. There can be no place, no place at all for Hamas.“The humanitarian situation is just desperate and we have continued to press Israel to deal with the scenes of malnourishment and starvation that we’re seeing, to open up more sites to get more aid in to Gaza, and we are very concerned about this continued offensive into Gaza City.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaWest BankIsraelIsrael-Gaza warForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It is the third time this year the figure for a single day has surpassed 1,000 and brings the total number this year to a record 32,103.Before Friday, there had been eight days with no arrivals recorded in Dover, Kent, due to adverse weather and sea conditions.Ministers are hoping their “one in, one out” plan will provide a deterrent to would-be asylum seekers if they believe they risk being quickly sent back. Three people have been removed from the UK so far under the deal with France.First person removed to France under ‘one in, one out’ asylum deal, says UKRead moreHome Office sources said an Iranian man had been returned on Friday, following theremoval of an Eritrean manafter he lost a high court attempt to halt his removal, and an Indian national was deported on Thursday.The first flights carrying asylum seekers from France to the UK under the deal are expected to take place next week. Labour intends to increase the number of people being sent back under the pilot deal over the coming months.The treaty allows the UK to immediately detain anyone who crosses the Channel and, within about two weeks, agree with the French authorities to return the individual.For each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in the UK will come in return. Ministers have praised the returns, with the deputy prime minister, David Lammy, saying they provided an “immediate deterrent” to people seeking to cross the Channel.But the Conservative shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said it would offer “no deterrent effect whatsoever”, adding that the numbers returned so far were “pathetic”.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

That deterrent has to be plausible and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong,” Stubb told the Guardian, in an interview in Helsinki before travelling to New York for the UN general assembly.He said the guarantees would only come into effect after a future deal betweenUkraineand Russia, but insisted that Russia would have no veto over their format.“Russia has absolutely no say in the sovereign decisions of an independent nation state … So for me it’s not an issue will Russia agree or not. Of course they won’t, but that’s not the point,” he said.After the Paris meeting last month, the French president,Emmanuel Macron, told reporters that 26 nations had committed to be part of a “reassurance force” in Ukraine, with some of them committing to be present “on the ground, in the sea or in the air”.However, the big question many in Kyiv have is whether the arrangements would come with concrete commitments. When asked if the guarantees would mean European countries were saying they would be ready to engage militarily with Russia in the case of future aggression against Ukraine, Stubb said: “That is the idea of security guarantees by definition.”It is far from clear that there is political will for this kind of commitment in most European capitals, however, where promises to a postwar Ukraine have usually been framed more as “reassurance” than as firm commitments. Up to now, the policy of most western countries has been to offer support to Ukraine but minimise the risk of a direct conflict with Russia. But Stubb said any guarantees would be meaningless if not backed up with real force.“Security guarantees in essence are a deterrent and that deterrent has to be plausible, and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong. And that means also strategic communication, so we’re not making security guarantees into the air, but we’re making real security guarantees and Russia knows that,” said Stubb.Stubbhas emerged as a key player in peace negotiationsin recent months, forging a close relationship with the US president, Donald Trump, including through rounds of golf. The personal connection has meant that Finland, with a population of just 5.6 million, has been able to play an outsized role in communications between Trump and European leaders. Stubb said he and Trump are still in contact regularly, “by phone and other means” and that he expects the pair to have a bilateral meeting this week.Stubb has said on several occasions this year that the US president was beginning to lose patience with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, but so far Trump’s occasional tough words on Putin have not translated into action, and a series of Trump-set deadlines for progress to be made on arriving at a peace deal have passed without much follow-up. Instead, Trump rolled out the red carpet forPutin in Alaska last month.Stubb said he thought progress was being made, but “it’s not a big bazooka, it’s step-by-step”. On the question of whether there is a point when Europe has to accept that the US is not a reliable ally when it comes to Ukraine negotiations, Stubb said his nation had little option but to try as hard as possible to be friendly with the Trump administration.Zelenskyy accuses allies of ‘wasting time’ as he prepares for Trump meetingRead more“I think it’s the job of the president ofFinlandto get along with the president of the United States, whoever he is,” said Stubb. “Foreign policy is always based on three pillars. It’s values, interests and power. Small states only have values and interests … but we can have influence instead of power. Engagement is better than disengagement, come hell or high water,” he added.Last week, Stubb was in Kyiv where he met the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and said he came away from the trip “confident” that Ukraine could continue fighting a long war if necessary, dismissing suggestions to the contrary as “fake news”.Stubb said much of the focus at the UN this week will be on Palestine, but that he hopes to have several meetings with Zelenskyy and others related to Ukraine. On security guarantees, he said an “American backstop” would be necessary to give them real force, and conceded that there is not yet a full sense of what the Trump administration is willing to commit.However, the talk of guarantees may all be purely hypothetical if progress is not made first on a negotiated end to the war. Zelenskyy has said many times he is willing to meet Putin, as demanded by Trump, but Putin has said he would only meet Zelenskyy in Moscow, or if numerous Russian demands are met first.Stubb conceded that there did not currently appear much chance of bringing Putin to the table. “This war is too big for him to lose. He has made probably the biggest strategic mistake in recent history, certainly since the end of the cold war, and he has failed in all of his strategic aims. It’s a question when he comes to the negotiating table, hopefully sooner rather than later, but right now I’m quite pessimistic,” said Stubb.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeFinlandVolodymyr ZelenskyyEmmanuel MacronVladimir PutinDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Gordon Brown has set out ways of raising money from gambling firms which should get careful consideration.”The policy was announced in 2015 by the Conservative government and restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households.Brownrecently backed a reportfrom the Institute for Public Policy Research, which said reforms to gambling levies could generate the £3.2bn needed to scrap the two-child limit and benefit cap.The thinktank’s research said scrapping the policies could lift 500,000 children out of poverty.Powell, who was sacked as Commons leader in Keir Starmer’s recent reshuffle, sought to differentiate herself from Phillipson, who is regarded as Downing Street’s choice for the deputy leader position.“I’m not afraid to have difficult conversations when we need to change course,” she wrote, adding: “I would be a strong independent choice for deputy leader.“I couldn’t have been prouder of getting a Labour government last year. But I know that people have been exasperated because of some mistakes we’ve made, and delivering change can sometimes be slow.”Powell said “despite our early achievements, this Labour story hasn’t been heard loud enough”, and “we’ve got to give a greater sense of who we’re fighting for”.The prime minister has not committed to axing the limit, but he has consistently declined to rule it out.Meanwhile Phillipson is reportedly looking at plans to abolish a subsidy that means two-thirds of Ofsted inspection costs are effectively discounted for private schools.The cost of providing Ofsted inspections to private schools in 2024-25 was £6.5m, according to figures set out by then education minister Stephen Morgan earlier this month. But only £2.2m of that was recovered by Ofsted.Allies of Phillipson told the Telegraph: “Inspection is crucially important for driving up standards in all schools as well as keeping children safe … but it’s time every independent school paid its fair share.“It’s frankly unfair. Taxpayers, most of whom send their children to state schools, shouldn’t have to foot the bill to make sure they’re accountable to fee-paying parents.”Powell’s intervention comes as Rachel Reeves wasurged to cancel plansto be the guest of honour at an event hosted by the chief lobbyist of the gambling industry while the Treasury is in the midst of a review of taxes on the £12bn sector.The chancellor was due to appear at a “private reception” for business leaders, organised by the corporate communications company Brunswick, at next week’s Labour party conference in Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsLucy PowellLabourGamblingTax and spendingBenefitsWelfareLabour party deputy leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

How dare they steal what it is to be British, English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish?” he said.Farron argued that he was “a proud patriot” but not a nationalist, saying: “And you can tell the difference easily. You see patriots love their country. Nationalists hate their neighbours. I love my country.”Speaking in the wake ofa mass far-right rallyin London a week ago in which many protesters draped themselves in the British orEnglish flags, and a recent spate of peoplehanging flags on lamp-postsor spraying a red cross on to streets, Farron said such symbols should never be excluding.“Our flag does not belong to Liberals, or to Conservatives, Reform, or to Labour. It does not belong to one creed or to one race. It belongs to one people, the British people. We will not let our flag be used to intimidate. We will not let our flag become the property of a minority,” he said.“So my message to the nationalists is this: I’m afraid that you do not really love your country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Welcome to England 2025 | John HarrisRead more“You cannot love your country if – as its seems – you hate everything about it and claim allegiance only to a Britain of some fantasy golden age that never existed. You do not love your country if you seek to intimidate and terrify people who are British through and through. You do not love your country if you lie about it at home and abroad, actively plan to do it harm, and suck up to our enemies.“So let us reclaim our flags for those who would reunite and rebuild. Let us be proud of our flag, be proud of our country. The British flag and the flags of our four nations are ours, they belong to all of us. Let’s take them back. Let’s wave them with pride.”The Lib Dems were notably stronger than Labour or the Conservatives in criticising last week’s rally, with Ed Davey, the party leader, particularly condemning Elon Musk after the X owner used a video address to the event totell the crowdthat “violence is coming” and “you either fight back or you die”.The best way to show love for a country, Farron said, “involves sacrifice and service”, with a community-based approach to politics.This was, he said, “not just the antidote to nationalism, it is the opposite of it. Less talk, more action. We love our country and our people, but more than that maybe … in stark contrast to the nationalists, we also rather like our country and its people.”Explore more on these topicsLiberal DemocratsThe far rightEnglandLiberal Democrat conferencenewsShareReuse this content"

However, using an abbreviation for the recentlyrebrandedDepartment of War headed by the Trump administration’s Pete Hegseth, the memo added: “DoW information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified.”It went on to say: “Only authorized persons who have received favorable determinations of eligibility for access, signed approved non-disclosure agreements, and have a need-to-know may be granted access to [classified national security information].”Journalists reporting from the Pentagon are now required to sign a pledge agreeing to restrict their movements within the building and not to access any unauthorized materials. If they refuse to sign the pledge, their Pentagon press passes will be revoked.In a post on X, HegsethsaidFriday: “The ‘press’ does not run the Pentagon – the people do. The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules – or go home.”The latest memo follows the announcement by Hegseth in May regarding new press restrictions at the Pentagon. These restrictions limit reporters’ movements within the building to specific areas including the press pens, food court and courtyard. This is a departure from the usual practice under previous presidential administrations where reporters typically had more freedom of movement within the Pentagon.Hegseth has severely limited media access after facing backlash for sharing sensitive information about US strikes in Yemen in March in aSignal group chatwhere a journalist was accidentally included.Since he assumed office, Hegseth has maintained a hostile attitude towards major media networks. He ordered theremovalof various longstanding news organizations including the New York Times, CNN, Politico and NPR from their dedicated offices in the Pentagon.The Pentagon’s latest memo has drawn criticism from journalists and free press advocates, with the National Press Club’s president Mike Balsamosaying: “This is a direct assault on independent journalism at the very place where independent scrutiny matters most: the US military.“If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting. It is getting only what officials want them to see. That should alarm every American.”Similarly, Freedom of the Press Foundationsaid“this policy operates as a prior restraint on publication, which is considered the most serious” violations of the press freedoms guaranteed by the US constitution’s first amendment.“The government cannot prohibit journalists from public information merely by claiming it’s a secret,” the foundation said.Meanwhile, Thomas Evans, editor in chief of National Public Radio (NPR),saidhis outlet was “taking this very seriously”.“We’ll be working with other news organizations to push back,” Evans remarked. “We’re big fans of the first amendment and transparency, and we want the American public to understand what’s being done in their name.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That statement followed widespreadbacklashover ABC’sindefinite suspensionof Jimmy Kimmel’s popular late-night show, on which the veteran comedian said that many in Trump’s Make America Great Again movement “are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”, referring to the 10 September killing of the rightwing activist.Speakingon Air Force One on Thursday, Trump said – without providing evidence – that “97% [of major US networks are] against me”.“They give me only bad press,” he said, adding that he believed broadcasters should have their licenses “taken away” as a result.Among those to endorse Trump’s argument was the US senator Cynthia Lummis.

The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has said she is being kept informed.“I’m aware of an incident affecting airline check-in and boarding, impacting flights at Heathrow and other European airports,” said Alexander. “I’m getting regular updates and monitoring the situation. If you’re flying at Heathrow today, check with your airline before travelling.”The attack has affected Collins’ Muse software.

It said the problem was in Collins’ hands, adding: “This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations of flights.” The airport advised passengers to check their flight status with their airline and only travel to the airport if their flight was confirmed.Berlin airport said: “Due to a technical issue at a system provider operating across Europe, there are longer waiting times at check-in. We are working on a quick solution.”Collins Aerospace said: “We have become aware of a cyber-related disruption to our Muse software in select airports. We are actively working to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to our customers as quickly as possible.“The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations. We will share more details as they are available.”The European Commission said it was “closely monitoring” the cyber-attack, adding: “While passengers are facing disruption, aviation safety and air traffic control remain unaffected … Current signs do not indicate a widespread or severe attack.”Prof Alan Woodword, a professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey, said the incident raised serious questions over why the airports appear to be reliant on Collins to fix the issue with Muse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, the Daily Record revealed thatWatt had been convicted of abusing two former girlfriendsin 2018.There was a significant police presence and febrile atmosphere with the “unity” protesters blocked in at the top of Buchanan Street, while the larger group of counter-protesters amassed further down the pedestrian thoroughfare. Those making speeches to the anti-immigration protest struggled to make themselves heard above chants of “shame on you” and heavy beats from the anti-racists’ superior sound system, which blasted out sing-a-long hits by Abba and Chappell Roan.View image in fullscreenAnti-racist protesters line up against the anti-migrant rally in Glasgow.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianStanding by the steps leading up to the concert hall, three women held aloft a banner bearing a colourful portrait of the far-right Christian activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated two weeks ago in Utah. They praised Kirk, saying “he wasn’t scared to say what other people are afraid to say” and bemoaned a lack of Christian teaching in modern Scottish schools while “too many other religions are being brought in”.One of the women, Laura Dunsmore, a nurse, said it was important to emphasise that the protest wasn’t only about illegal immigration. “It’s about the state of the country, the state of the world. You can’t access healthcare, our streets are crumbling. We can’t vote our way out of this. We need change at a higher level.”Further down the wide street, holding a handmade placard reading “This mum welcomes refugees”, Cat, a software technician from Glasgow’s Southside, was jigging to pop hits along with her partner and baby. “I felt I should lean in to the ‘mum’ bit especially because they are saying they want to protect women and children, and as a woman and a mum I’m not worried about asylum seekers. I’m far more worried about those guys over there.”She said it was important to come to the counter-protest to show solidarity in particular after last weekend’s rally in London organised by the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson.As groups at the edge of the protest began pushing and shoving, police moved quickly to separate the two groups, closing off access routes for Saturday shoppers and tourists who expressed alarm or irritation at the disruption.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson said: “A 47-year-old man was arrested in connection with an assault of a police officer during a protest on Buchanan Street.”Areas of Glasgowhave been draped in Saltiresin recent weeks, in a direct parallel with theOperation Raise the Colours movementthat has co-opted the St George’s cross in England, as ownership of the blue and white cross of St Andrew has become a cultural and political battleground in Scotland.Last summer, Scotland escaped the racist violence that spread across England and Northern Ireland after the horrific Southport killings in July. But a year later, the landscape is very different, with recent polling for More in Common suggesting that Reform was neck and neck with Scottish Labour in voting intention for next May’s Scottish parliament election, though behind the SNP.

A quote taken from a widely sharedvideoof Kirk discussinghis life’s work– “when people stop talking, that’s when violence happens” – emblematized such eulogies.Kirk toured American college campuses with his rightwing non-profit Turning Point USA, where he would set up a tent, table and microphone, and debate with undergrads. The goal, hesaid, was to “save western civilization”, and remembrances after his death positioned him as a budding statesman – a conservativehero who strodeacross the political divide for the sake of open dialogue.I don’t think Charlie entered debates to come to a common consensus or to discover the truthMasonKirk applied basic rules of civility to his debate style, asking opponents their name and saying it was nice to meet them. He engaged young people in political discourse at a time when society has been split into bitterly antagonistic camps. But his critics are taking issue with any version of hislegacythat does not account for thebigoted natureof his arguments. They are also closely examining his very style of deate.“I don’t think Charlie entered debates to come to a common consensus or to discover the truth,” said Mason, a 26-year-old graduate student who debated with Kirk on theYouTubeshow Surrounded last fall. “I think Charlie came to debates to verbally beat his opponents.”This made him a formidable combatant. “He knew the arguments for nearly every conservative principle and even theological concept, and he spent years to develop that ability, so he was very great at pivoting and changing the conversation when it was not going his way,” said Mason, who is based in Los Angeles.During one debate, Kirkinsistedon the truthfulness of a racist hoax about Haitian immigrants eating their neighbors’ pets. In another, he falselycalledthe term foetus “just a word for a human being”. He goaded college students, who eagerly stepped up to query or challenge him, with leading questions that were intended to elicit strong emotions – “what is a woman?” and “what is racism?” were two of his go-tos.“At its core, debate is supposed to be an academic exercise, with the goal being to be forthright and genuine in the information you present,” said Trent Webb, a professor of writing studies and rhetoric and director of the speech and debate team at Hofstra University. “In a good faith debate, the final goal is to reach consensus. If that doesn’t happen, then a lot of academics would consider it to be an exercise in futility.”View image in fullscreenCharlie Kirk holds a debate event ahead of his scheduled speech on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, in 2024.Photograph: David Ryder/ReutersAfter a Kirk debate, clips spun out on to social media, inviting millions into the fray. In celebration of perceived wins, Turning Point USA titled its YouTube videos things like: “Charlie Kirk ANNIHILATES Smart-Aleck Student Accusing Him of Propaganda”, “Charlie Kirk wrecks DEI talking points” and “Liberal Student Can’t Answer Charlie Kirk’s Simple Question.”Dr Charles Woods, a professor of rhetoric and composition at East Texas A&M University, and the host of The Big Rhetorical Podcast, said Kirk distilled nuanced topics into stifling, good v bad arguments.“Charlie turned myriad opportunities for meaningful dialogic transactions rooted in civility and turned them into confrontational interactions by amplifying binaries in his argumentative structure,” Woods wrote in an email. “What we know is that there is a spectrum of ideologies and worldviews, not just two: Charlie’s and whoever is on the other side of the microphone.”Hasan Piker, the popular leftist Twitch streamer who was scheduled to debate with Charlie Kirk later this month,wrotein a guest essay published in the New York Times that his would-be opponent was an “expert” at “[taking] advantage of people’s resentments and [redirecting] them toward vulnerable communities”.Still, leftists lined up to debate with him. Some, like asociology professorwho appeared genuinely curious to talk about the economic prospects of young people under Donald Trump, desired a meeting of the minds. For his part, Pikertold Slatethat while he is “not the biggest fan of the debate format”, he finds the forum “entertaining” and “galvanizing”.Perhaps no forum fit Kirk’s shtick better than the platform given to him by Jubilee Media, a YouTube channel that producesSurrounded, a thunderdome of debate where one person is encircled by a ring of ideological opponents who attempt to undercut his stances in lightning-fast rounds of verbal sparring, governed by literal red flags.You got the sense that you were an opponent to him even when you weren’t debatingNaima Troutt“Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative?”askedthe series’ first episode, an hour and a half of nonstop ragebait released last September. In the show, Kirk debated with his opponents such statements as: “Abortion is murder and should be illegal” (wherein Kirk said yes, he would hypothetically make his 10-year-old daughter carry a child to term if she were to get pregnant from rape); “college is a scam”; and “Kamala Harris is a DEI candidate.” (Consider these Kirk’s greatest hits; he often debated these topics on campuses.)Naima Troutt, a 22-year-old film student at the University of Southern California, said the students made $25 for their appearance on the show, which has since raked in more than 35m views on YouTube and spawned countless viral clips.A campus organizer who was involved with Black Lives Matter and Palestinian solidarity protests, Troutt did not know who Kirk was when she showed up to set that day, which helped her see him as less of a rightwing celebrity and more as a man she disagreed with.View image in fullscreenNaima Troutt faces off against Charlie Kirk on Surrounded in 2024.Photograph: Jubilee MediaTroutt described a “camaraderie” between the students, with some of the more “chronically online” trying to explain Kirk’s significance to her before they started filming. But Kirk was not as eager to chum it up. “He was either on his phone, or outright rude. You got the sense that you were an opponent to him even when you weren’t debating.”Troutt jumped into the hot seat twice to spar with Kirk over fetal viability, Harris’s qualifications for president and affirmative action. They agreed on practically nothing, but Troutt found some merit in debating Kirk. “I think I became much better at articulating my viewpoints and defending my viewpoints, because one thing about Charlie is that as much as I disagree with – and at times hate – everything that he believed and stated in the past, the fact is he’s one of the only rightwingers who regularly puts themselves out there,” Troutt said.Troutt is not alone in this opinion. California governor Gavin Newsom, whodebated with Kirk on his podcastearlier this year (and admitted his son was a fan),wrotein a statement that he “admired [Kirk’s] passion and commitment to debate”. Representatives for New College of Florida, formerly a progressive school thatfell under the controlof rightwing allies of Governor Ron DeSantis, announced it will commission a statue of Kirk with his table and mic on campus. The school’s social media officertoldFox News that the statue will represent “what America is all about”.Ultimately it was not rhetorical prowess but an insult that made Troutt a social media folk hero in #resistance circles: after Kirk attempted a gotcha moment by saying that “foetus” means “little human being” in Latin, Troutt called his self-satisfied smile “creepy”.You can’t negate that it’s very interesting to watch, but those students are not armed with proper data and evidenceTrent Webb“Smiling is creepy?” Kirk clapped back, to which Troutt responded: “No,yoursmile specifically.” The quip landed her an Interview magazinefeaturebranding her “the college student who owned Charlie Kirk”. (Foetusin Latin actually means “a bringing forth; producing; fertile”.)In March, Kirk asked her to come to the stage for a 10-minute debate he held at USC, where they tussled over DEI again.“I was shocked by that,” Troutt said. “I literally just roasted this man, and now he wants to debate with me again. But the second time he was a lot nicer. A lot of Trump and Kirk supporters came to watch it, and it was a more hostile environment, but he was less hostile to me.”Mason, who debated with Kirk on Surrounded, describes himself as a progressive and felt it important to showcase leftist values.View image in fullscreenMason debates with Charlie Kirk on Surrounded.Photograph: YouTube“They’re so often caricatured, especially for those in echo chambers of the right,” Mason said. (He asked that his last name not be shared for privacy reasons.) “As someone who feels very confident in my beliefs and convictions and my ability to communicate, I think it’s beneficial for me to go on a platform like this.”Mason and Kirk’stopicwas gender and transgender rights. Mason got Kirk to admit that he did not know the bimodal theory of gender, to which Kirk called him “condescending”; Mason apologized for his tone, but said he was “trying to match” Kirk’s energy toward other debaters. Despite the testiness, the pair had a lively debate.“Having a conversation with him was very easy to do,” Mason said. “I’ve consumed so much of his content that I knew what he was going to say. I wouldn’t say that it was easy for a lot of the other [Surrounded debaters], because he understands the sport of rhetoric and debate, and is really good at controlling the conversation. I had to put in a strong effort to assert myself.”Webb, the Hofstra professor, called the unmoderated format of Surrounded where claims are not factchecked, “unnerving”.“You can’t negate that it’s very interesting to watch,” Webb said, “but those students are not armed with proper data and evidence, and a lot of times they’re speaking to things that sometimes are blatantly untrue.”After the debate, Kirk hinted that he wanted Mason to come on his radio show. That never happened, but the two kept in touch. The second time they debated – about wealth inequality at the USC event – Kirk praised his “high IQ”. But Kirk never put the debate up online. “I like to believe that’s because the conversation didn’t go the way he planned,” Mason said, “but it could have also just been because I don’t have the same online presence as someone like Naima.”The circus around Kirk’s social media did not just advance conservative causes. His work boosted young leftists likeTrouttand to a lesser extentMason.Gaining a platform as “the girl who owned Charlie Kirk” overwhelmed Troutt at first. “It did feel like getting thrown to the wolves,” she said. But she sustained her viral moment and has over half a million followers on TikTok, where she posts about politics.This small online community of Kirk debaters consider themselves an influential voice of reason against “alt-right” internet stars like Kirk, Ben Shapiro andCandace Owens.Hungry for another go, Troutt and other Surrounded debaters were scheduled to star in a reunion episode with Kirk later this month. On the morning of the day Kirk was killed, debaters in a Surrounded group chat were theorizing what topics might come up so they could start preparing. “It was surreal that in the middle of all of that, we got a news article sent by someone, saying: ‘Oh my God, this just happened,’” Mason said.After Kirk died, a range of reactions poured out on social media, with many recalling Kirk’s incendiary takes or honoring his memory. Kirk allies advocated forfiring thosewho they said spoke against him. Meanwhile, some of the debaters were criticized by followers for their eulogies of their former opponent and the sadness they expressed about his killing.View image in fullscreenA woman lights a candle at a makeshift memorial for Charlie Kirk outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA in Phoenix, Arizona, on 17 SeptemberPhotograph: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesDean Withers, who appeared on the Surrounded episode and wascalled“the Democrats’ Bro Whisperer” by the the New York Times, mourned Kirk’s death through tears in a TikTok video. Tilly Middlehurst, a student who Kirk asked about feminism and what defines a woman at an event for Cambridge Union Society,her university’s debate club, choked up as shesaidthe act of political violence left her “shaken and disgusted”.Withers latersaidthat he became emotional watching the violent video of Kirk’s shooting online, because a close friend had been in the audience of the event and because he knew Kirk personally. “My tears weren’t me telling you how you should feel, but rather you happening to see me in how I felt,” he said. Middlehurst made her social media profiles private. (Neither responded to a request for comment. A representative for Cambridge Union Society wrote in an email: “Any comments made by speakers who openly debated with Mr. Kirk during our event earlier this year are expressed in a personal capacity and do not reflect the views of the Cambridge Union.”)Troutt felt “hesitant” to speak about Kirk’s death, though people looked to her for comment. “I don’t want to say the wrong thing and hurt people and lead to more violence. But I do want to help people in this moment process what this means for our country,” she said.After speaking with the Guardian, Trouttposted her ownTikTok. “All acts of gun violence are horrible and must be condemned. That is my baseline,” she said in the clip. She added: “Mind your karma, watch what you put online.”Virulent debater and clickbait savant: how Charlie Kirk pushed a new generation to the rightRead moreMason believes that “two things” can be true at once: “The video [of the shooting] was incredibly grotesque, this is terrible across the board, and I do grieve for his young children, but that does not make the life or the principles that the victim stood for any more palatable.”He found it hard to square the Kirk he interacted with, if briefly – a professional, nice enough man – with the hateful views he promoted.“I think that speaks to the dissociation that politics allows, where somebody can have these abstract concepts of what a group is, or speak ill of them, but it’s much more difficult to be insulting or vitriolic toward somebody who’s right in front of you,” Mason said.In the aftermath of his death, Kirk’s legacy remains as divisive as one of his debates. But there is no denying his influence on public discourse.“When we teach argumentation and debate in our classrooms, it’s not necessarily agenda-driven,” said Webb, the rhetoric professor.“Social media has taught us to believe that all opinions said online are valid and require response, and because of that, people are nowadays easily baited into these ‘debates’.”"

Later, police also confirmed that a man and a woman had been charged.A month later, Lochee locals are still processing the reverberations: ‘Dundee girl’ was declared a hero by far-right influencers, including Tommy Robinson, with memes depicting her as Braveheart, while mainstream media called the area “Scotland’s Bronx”, highlighting “tower blocks stuffed with addicts and migrants”.What the hot takes and hatchet jobs didn’t explain is that this online frenzy concluded a summer of tragedy for Lochee – one in which community spirit, rather than division, has shone through.In a brutal killing of the kind rarely seen in the area, Dr Fortune Gomo, 39, a scientist from Zimbabwe who graduated from Dundee University, was found fatally injured in the street in early July. And later that month a popular teenager and ice hockey champion who grew up there, Gary Kelly, fell to his death while on holiday in Ibiza.“It’s been a really sad time for Lochee but it’s also shown it at its best,” says Heather Henry, chair of Love Lochee community group. “For all the tragedy and the negative press, there’s an amazing community spirit. And we’ve seen that over the past month, all the love that has poured out for those poor families.”Henry dismisses Musk in a word: “Clickbait. People have said: ‘This is not who we are.’ But you have to come here to see it.”Because what has likewise escaped global attention are the dogged efforts by volunteers, many of them women, to take on Lochee’s undeniable challenges at street level. The colourful murals that brighten up the lanes off the high street were commissioned by Henry’s group. Kayley, who grew up in Lochee and is shopping here with her mum, says she loves them but wants something done about the sky-high rents that have resulted in empty units where once were thriving independent businesses.View image in fullscreenLochee Community Hub.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAt the top of the hill, a group of street drinkers huddle on a bench, but Kayley says local efforts – which include a new drop-in centre for addicts – have improved antisocial behaviour from drug users, and is full of praise for the community hub across the road.Councillor Siobhan Tolland offers a brisk tour of community endeavours – the library offering a warm space to visit for a cuppa in winter, a food bank that is struggling to keep up with demand, the community garden with its laden apple tree: “There’s a lot of poverty in Lochee and it’s not an easy life, but [after Musk] there was a sense of ‘don’t put us down’.”View image in fullscreenCouncillor Siobhan Tolland.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianWhile police said that Dr Gomo’s attack was not believed to be racially motivated, her death prompted women from all communities to speak more openly about a recent shift in mood on the streets across Dundee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She plans to use ‘Dundee girl’ as a case study: “Everyone looked at the weapons, not what was going on behind it.”And the aggression isn’t reserved for recent migrants. Back on the high street, the Polish owner of a vintage clothing shop, Joanne Wodkowska, who has lived in Scotland for 17 years, tells how her shop was attacked by kids throwing eggs and using anti-Polish slurs last year. Earlier this year, a white Scottish customer walked out of the shop telling her: “I’m not buying clothes from someone who doesn’t speak English.”Last Saturday, an anti-immigration protest organised on the other side of Dundee attracted a few hundred demonstrators, as well as counter-protesters, but passed off with no worse than angry chanting and egg-throwing.In Lochee, there’s a genuine desire, says Tolland, to focus on inclusivity after the events of the summer. “Lochee is a place of immigration, from the Irish who settled here to work in the mills to the New Scots who came this century.“Some of us had a real fear that Elon Musk might spark some violence here, and it’s testimony to the people of Lochee that they didn’t take the bait. They should be proud they resisted.”Explore more on these topicsDundeeImmigration and asylumScotlandElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was standing outside the theatre in Adelaide when I first spotted Nick. He was with a mutual friend, Eliza, who introduced us.We made eye contact and I was immediately drawn to him. I thought Nick was extremely handsome; I remember his beautiful hands and his gorgeous thick hair. It turned out we shared a lot of mutual friends, as Nick was an actor. Eliza later told me she had a premonition that me and Nick were going to fall in love and get married – this was before gay marriage was even legalised in the UK.A few days later, I started making inquiries to friends about who Nick was. I asked one to call Nick and tell him I wanted to go out on a date with him.View image in fullscreenDaniel and Nick in Wānaka, Aotearoa New ZealandI’ll never forget our first walk through the Persian Garden on the banks of the River Torrens in Adelaide. At one point we were both laying together on a Persian rug and I was falling pretty head over heels in love or lust, or both. It was opening night of the festival and there were so many friends there but I only wanted to be with him.Meanwhile, the show I was working on became one of the biggest successes of the festival – more than 4,000 people attended. Although we were both very busy (Nick was a festival judge seeing many shows), I remember how he would make himself available around my schedule, which I found really amazing. He’d just meet me at the end of the show, or sit with me at the right moments.As feelings between us grew, something else came up. When he spoke I sensed that he was a little sad and stressed as he knew I was leaving. I said, “Let’s just feel this. Let’s not stop what we are feeling because I have to leave.” I knew we would find a way to make this work.The night before leaving, I sat down and wrote a marriage proposal. Nick now jokingly calls it my business proposition. I asked him to marry me 10 days after we met. And he said yes.The next day I was going to Sydney, then back to the UK. When we went to the airport with our families and said goodbye, I felt so sad to be leaving him. I knew we’d found something real.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nick entered the competition – he had a gut instinct that we had a good chance.Then, very early one morning, Nick called me and passed on the incredible news that we’d won – he was so excited. Nick decided to move to the UK so we could be married. It all felt so right!View image in fullscreenDaniel and Nick on their wedding dayThe wedding was beautiful. We had a penthouse suite, 30 friends came including Sarah from the show, who sang for us. My 18-month-old niece was the flower girl. My sister came over as did Nick’s mum and stepdad. There was a ceremony, a five-course dinner and then a cocktail party in our room on the Thames.

What can other countries learn from this ‘ground zero’ of misogyny?Raphael RashidSat 20 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareOn a November evening in 2023, in the South Korean city of Jinju, a woman called On Ji-goo was working the late shift at a convenience store when a young man stormed in, aggressively knocking items off the shelves. When she asked him to be careful, he turned to her, saying, “I’m angry to my bones right now, so don’t touch me.”The situation escalated. When On tried to call for help, he seized her phone and threw it in the store’s microwave. She tried to stop him and he grabbed her by the collar and arms, dragging her several metres while slamming her into display shelves. It was the start of a brutal assault. Throughout it, he repeatedly said he “never hits women” but feminists “deserve to be beaten”.When an older male customer tried to intervene, the attacker turned on him, too, demanding, “Why aren’t you supporting a fellow man?” When the police arrived, he announced he was part of a men’s rights group and called for male officers to handcuff him. He later admitted he had singled out On because of her short hair.“Before this, I had only the most basic understanding of feminism – the kind any woman might naturally have,” says On, an aspiring author who uses a pen name.We meet on a sunny afternoon in a coffee shop in Jinju, where she still lives, just blocks from the shop. It’s a sleepy provincial city of under 350,000 people, four hours from Seoul by high-speed train. On’s face is hidden behind a face mask, a beanie pulled low. Having endured insensitive questioning from local media in the aftermath of her assault, she takes a while to drop her guard. “I didn’t fully grasp the discrimination women face, or rather I had accepted it as normal,” she says.The attack left her with permanent hearing loss and severe trauma. The perpetrator received a three-year prison sentence. In a landmark ruling, theappeals court recognisedmisogyny as the driving force behind the assault, the first time a South Korean court had acknowledged such hatred as a criminal motive.On’s story is not unique in a country where systemic inequality and virulent online misogyny have pitched mainly gen Zs and millennials into a bitterbattle of the sexes. While similar fights over gender and feminism are playing out across the world, from the US to Europe, South Korea has become ground zero for gender wars, its highly connected, digitally literate population amplifying this trend at a pace not seen elsewhere.In male culture, you can’t speak up to those above you. So where does that frustration get directed? Sideways, at womenOn the surface, South Korea appears a hypermodern society, defined by its positive contributions to global pop culture, cutting-edge technology and sleek urban landscapes. But beneath this veneer lies a widening gender divide that seems to belong to another era. Among nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the countryranks firstfor women’s tertiary education attainment,yet maintainsthe bloc’s largest gender pay gap. Women remainlargely excludedfrom leadership roles, and South Koreaconsistently rankslast in measures of workplace gender equality. While the country leads the world ininternet connectivityand hi-tech innovation, these same digital spaces have become breeding grounds forsome of the mosttoxic anti-feminist communities, turning virtual hatred into real-world violence.The most horrifying manifestation of this came in 2016, when a 23-year-old woman wasbrutally murderedin a public bathroom near Seoul’s Gangnam station, in the heart of the business and entertainment district. The killer, who waited hours for a random female victim, told police he did it because “women have always ignored me”. The case became a watershed moment, sparkingmassive protests, yet the digital targeting of women continued. By 2018, it had become so normalised that it was routine to see signs in public toilets confirming they had been checked for hidden cameras, and thousands of women protested over anepidemic of spy camerasand “revenge porn”. The crisis deepened in 2020 with the notorious “nth room” case of digital sexual slavery, in which users of a network of Telegram chatrooms blackmailed women and underage girls into producing sexually explicit material at home. In 2024, a new threat emerged:deepfake pornographytargeting schoolgirls, with perpetrators, often minors themselves, using AI technology to superimpose women’s faces on to sexually explicit content and distribute the images through Telegram channels, some with hundreds of thousands of members.These digital crimes didn’t emerge in a vacuum. In the darkest corners of South Korea’s internet, young men gather anonymously to share their rage. While the west has 4chan and Reddit, South Korea has Ilbe – “daily best” – which at its peak in the mid-2010s ranked among the top 10most visited websitesin the country. The forum’s influence reaches far beyond the digital realm. Its users pioneered derogatory terms such askimchi-nyeo(“kimchi girl”, often translated as “kimchi bitch”) to mock women as materialistic gold-diggers. These terms soon infiltrated mainstream discourse, with media outlets adopting -nyeosuffixes in headlines to critique any woman behaving badly in public.As its influence grew, Ilbe began to radicalise, aligning itself with far-right politics and orchestrating provocative offline stunts. In 2014, an Ilbe userdetonated a homemade explosiveat a progressive activist’s talk, claiming the speaker was pro-North Korea – a common rightwing accusation in a country where the left-right divide remains shaped bycold war divisions– while others taunted families of those who died in 2014’sSewol ferry disasterbygorging onpizza in front of bereaved parents on hunger strike as part of their demand for new legislation following the tragedy.While Ilbe’s popularity has waned, its legacy endures in online communities known asnamcho, short fornamseong chogwa, meaning “excess of men”. These manospheres have spread across forums and messaging apps, allowing young men to share grievances about feminism and what they see as reverse discrimination.View image in fullscreen‘Men don’t know why they got into this place’: Kim Min-sung, founder of the Korean Game Consumer Society.Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian“If you get access to the open internet before you get formally educated, your worldview will be fucked,” says Kim Min-sung, speaking at his office in Guri, a city on Seoul’s eastern edge. The 22-year-old activist, once an anti-feminist himself, speaks with an infectious energy, punctuating serious points with bursts of laughter.Like many Korean boys, Kim encountered these forums at a young age. He recalls searching for innocent content, such as funny videos, only to be gradually exposed to misogynistic material. He admits he repeated anti-feminist rhetoric without understanding it, simply because it was what everyone around him did.Kim’s turnaround came via an unlikely source: fantasy role-playing games. Here, he found a community that was predominantly female and progressive. At first, he says, “I kept my mouth shut and just played Dungeons & Dragons. But listening to them, you just naturally have casual conversations and you realise the worldview you had from these online forums was just exaggerations, caricatures and fantasy.”Today, Kim runs theKorean Game Consumer Society, fighting the same online hatred he once participated in. He now receives regular death threats he says he finds oddly validating. All the same, “I’m just battling symptoms. I don’t think what I’m doing is solving the core of the problem. Men don’t know why they got into this place, they don’t know why they became unhappy.”According to professor Seungsook Moon, a sociologist and gender studies expert at Vassar College in the US, the anger exploding online reflects deeper societal shifts. She traces young men’s discontent to South Korea’s embrace of neoliberalism. “Before democratisation, when military regimes ruled Korea, the government could create stable jobs,” she says. “Up to the late 80s, men with only a college education could get jobs in good companies. The economy was expanding rapidly.” But by the mid-90s those men were being laid off and “when social hierarchy changes, groups used to more powerful or privileged positions will respond with intense emotional reactions to their loss of status and respect”.This resentment is acute around military service – a mandatory 18 months for able-bodied men that many view as an unfair burden in today’s precarious economy. It’s not a new grievance: in 1999 the constitutional court ruled against the military servicebonus point system, which had granted veterans additional points in public sector job applications. The court found it discriminated against women and people with disabilities, intensifying many young men’s sense that they were losing traditional privileges without gaining new protections.The sense of male victimhood is widespread: a 2021 Hankook Researchsurveyfound that while only 38% of men in their 20s believed women face serious discrimination in society, 79% believed men do. Seventy per cent of men in their 30s saw themselves as victims of gender discrimination.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators outside City Hall in Seoul call for the ousting of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, December 2024.Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty ImagesInto this landscape of frustration have stepped new voices claiming to represent young men’s interests. Among them isNew Men’s Solidarity, whose influence became clear when On’s attacker proudly declared his membership. The group and its leader, Bae In-gyu – South Korea’s answer toAndrew Tate– rack up millions of views on YouTube with content blaming feminism for young men’s struggles. Baeclaimsit is a “mental illness”anda “social evil”, and has sparked outrage by declaring the “nth room” victimswere “whores”.Bae’s rise reflects the shift of Korea’s anti-feminist movement from online anonymity to real-world action. Polished and theatrical, he presents himself in crisp suits, addressing crowds on protest stages or fromatop vehicles, blending his rhetoric with broader far-right Korean politics, fervently anti-China, anti-North Korea and anti-communist. Like his western counterparts, he positions feminists as an existential threat, “extreme misandrists” who “advocate for female supremacy” with “the specific purpose of causing gender conflict”. Referring to himself as “hyung” (older brother), Bae cultivates an affectionate bond with disaffected young men, rallying them to fund his activismwith donations.This approach has inspired a broader ecosystem of anti-feminist content creators such as “cyber wrecker”PPKKa, a masked YouTuber with more than a million subscribers who wassuspendedfrom making money on YouTube for mocking women’s concerns about deepfake pornography. Together, these digital personalities have built on the legacy of earlier male rights activists such as Sung Jae-gi of the Man of Korea group, whosesuicidein 2013 – jumping from a bridge to raise the profile of his organisation – created a martyr figure for the movement Bae would later rebrand and radicalise.These anti-feminist voices have had a critical influence on the country’s politics. On 27 May this year, four candidates vying to become South Korea’s next president went head to head in a national TV debate. Lee Jun-seok, a 40-year-old Harvard graduate and leader of the relatively minor conservative Reform party,posed a graphic questionto a rival: “If someone says they want to stick chopsticks into women’s genitals or some place like that, is that misogyny?” Lee’s commentsent shock wavesacross the country. Social media exploded with outrage, university students held press conferences demanding Lee withdraw from the race and women’s groups filed complaints with police.View image in fullscreenLee Jun-seok, a presidential candidate whose misogynist comments in a debate in May sent shock waves across the country.Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/APLee first gained prominence as a pundit, arguing that the younger generation “had not experienced gender-based inequality” and that policies such as quotas for women were“anachronistic”. As with Jordan Peterson in the west, Lee’s elite credentials and articulate style gave intellectual legitimacy to views that had been confined to anonymousnamchoforums.His anti-feminist messaging was adopted by former president Yoon Suk Yeol, who saw how effectively such rhetoric could mobilise young male voters. When running for office in 2022, this ex-prosecutor with no prior political experience claimed there was “no structural gender discrimination” in South Korea. In a move that foreshadowed the Trump administration’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion programmes in the US, Yoon promised to abolish the country’s gender equality ministry, arguing that it focused too much on women’s rights and was no longer necessary. The strategyproved decisivein one of the closest presidential races in South Korean history, with Yoonwinning byjust 0.73% – fewer than 250,000 votes.Exit polls revealeda dramatic gender divide among young voters: nearly 59% of men in their 20s supported Yoon, while 58% of women the same age backed his progressive opponent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

On the night of 3 December 2024, Yoon made a shocking announcement: he was declaring martial law to combat “anti-state forces” and accused the opposition-controlled parliament of being a “den of criminals”. Within hours, troops had surrounded the National Assembly and politicians were seen jumping over gates and pushing past soldiers to convene an emergency vote. The decree was ended just six hours after it began.This was followed by months of mass protests demanding Yoon’s removal, led overwhelmingly by young women. At Seoul’s ancient Gyeongbokgung Palace, Jeong Yeong Eun of the Seoul Women’s Association helped coordinate the “Yoon Suk Yeol out” feminist rallies, where participants took turns denouncing the administration’s attacks on women’s rights. “When he declared martial law, it was a natural extension of how his administration had been undermining democracy and excluding women’s voices,” she told me at the time. These demonstrations continued through the bitter Seoul winter. “People frame it as if women just appeared for the first time,” Jeong said. “We were always there in previous protest movements. We’re determined not to let our contributions be erased and to make our voices heard.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re determined to make our voices heard’: Jeong Yeong Eun of the Seoul Women’s Association.Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The GuardianIn April, South Korea’s constitutional courtunanimously upheldYoon’s impeachment, finding his declaration of martial law a “grave betrayal of the trust of the people”. The snap election that followed in June 2025 would see Lee Jae Myung of the Democratic partyemerge victoriouswith 49.42% of the vote.But it was Lee Jun-seok who would come to symbolise the depth of South Korea’s gender divide. His chopsticks remarks may have cost him votes, but they solidified his appeal among his core supporters. While he got just 8.34% of the vote nationally, theexit poll breakdown revealedyet another stark gender and age divide: nearly one in four men in their 20s voted for him, along with 17.7% of men in their 30s. Dismissive of the mainstream candidates, they had rallied behind a figure who embodied their resentments about feminism, military service and what they saw as reverse discrimination. Even new president Lee Jae Myung seemed to take up this cause in July when heasked his cabinetto research “male discrimination” and develop countermeasures.This political divide along gender lines isn’t unique to the country: it’s part of a global pattern where young women lean left while young men drift right. However, nowhere is the “ideology gap” more extreme than in South Korea, where the intensity of the divide stems from a collision between economic pressures and changing values, according to political scientist Min Hee Go at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “It’s about who gets more of the pie, be it material resources, job opportunities, even good partners,” she says. “It is very cut-throat, especially in an environment where young people have to compete in an unprecedented way.”This year’s election also issued a stark warning about the future of women’s participation in South Korean politics. For the first time in 18 years, none of the six candidates for president was a woman.As the gender war has intensified, even the anti-misogynists have sometimes adopted toxic tactics. What began as “mirroring” – flipping misogynistic rhetoric to target men – has spiralled into increasingly extreme forms of resistance. When male forums mocked women’s bodies, the feminists ofMegalia– an online community that emerged in 2015 – ridiculed penis size. When women were called “kimchi bitches”, Megalians coined terms for men such ashannam-chung(“Korean male bug”). Though Megalia has now closed, it has become a convenient bogeyman for those seeking to delegitimise feminist activism.Nick wanted to drop bodyfat and build his own micro-harem of women: how my friend fell for the red-pill hucksters of the manosphereRead moreIn the past year, global attention has turned to the fringe“4B” movement, which advocates complete withdrawal from a system it sees as irredeemably patriarchal. Its adherents reject dating, marriage, childbirth and any romantic relationships with men.Such radical responses have helped fuel a broader backlash against feminism. Even men and women who support gender equality now often distance themselves from the term, which has become akin to a slur. Today, the mere accusation of having feminist sympathies can triggerpublic apologiesfrom companies.In 2023, a seemingly innocuous animation in a promo for the game MapleStory sparked afirestorm. It showed a character’s hand gesture transitioning from a fist to a heart, but male gamers claimed one frame resembled a feminist hand signal mocking small male genitalia. Within hours, online forums had erupted. The studio issuedan apology, and anonymous users combed through the social media accounts of female employees, searching for proof of feminist sympathies. When they found a female artist who fitted their perceived enemy, they demanded her immediate firing.The company, initially ready to comply, changed course only after intervention from the Korean Game Consumer Society, which convinced management to stand firm against the online mob. Ironically, it was later revealed that the animation had been designedby a male artistin his 40s. Despite this, the female artistwas doxed onlineand harassed with sexual insults.Some activists are working quietly to address the root causes of South Korea’s gender divide. In his cosy, cabin-like office near Seoul’s Mangwon market, Lee Han is preparing to travel across the country, leading classroom discussions about gender-based violence. It’s a delicate balance – schools often tell him to avoid discussing anything deemed controversial. But Lee and his group,Feminism With Him,insist dialogue is the only way forward: “We need to speak up and share what we’ve learned.” What began in 2017 as a small book club reading feminist texts soon evolved into something more ambitious. Now, with eight active members, they organise discussions, attend political rallies and work to create spaces for honest dialogue about gender.View image in fullscreen‘Who created this system? Men, not feminists’: Lee Han, an activist at Feminism with Him.Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The GuardianLee’s approach is shaped by his own journey through military service: “It was miserable. You can’t even put your hands in your pockets, can’t listen to music, can’t easily drink or smoke. Having your freedoms taken away is traumatic and terrifying.” Now he also teaches gender equality to military leaders and senior officers, arguing that men who channel their resentments at women have picked the wrong target. “Who created this system? Men, not feminists. Male politicians and the establishment thought: men are strong, women are weak, so don’t send women to the military,” he says. Despite pressure for reform, the defence ministry says it hasno plans to introducefemale conscription.Efforts to address these issues face fierce resistance, particularly from South Korea’s powerful conservative Christian lobby, which has successfully blocked anti-discrimination legislation for almost two decades. “I’ve been prevented from speaking at schools because they complained I was promoting feminism,” Lee says. Yet he and his colleagues remain determined. While their numbers are small, their work offers hope that dialogue is possible. “Young men can’t express their fears and anxieties,” Lee says. “In male culture, especially in Korea, where hierarchy is so important due to Confucian values, you can’t speak up to those above you. So where does that frustration go? It gets directed sideways, at women, the easier target.” By creating safe spaces for men to discuss these issues openly, groups such as his aim to redirect that anger towards constructive change.Back in Jinju, On is still recovering from the attack – she recently spent a month in hospital dealing with trauma. After a year dominated by court proceedings, she just wants to get back to normal: “I want to find work, treat my family to meals and buy toys for my cat.”She has been moved by how many strangers have rallied to her cause. When a petition calling for her attacker to be punished reached 50,000 signatures in less than a month, she created a social media account to thank her well-wishers. Gradually she began posting detailed updates about her court proceedings, drawing so many supporters to the trial that some had to stand. She continues to share news about similar cases, which she sees as a small act of solidarity with other victims.“I wouldn’t have survived the year without the people who stood by me,” she says. For On, the solution isn’t about fighting over who suffers more discrimination. “We need to focus on how to resolve these conflicts and create a safer society for everyone,” she says.Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsFeminismSouth KoreaGenderWomenMenSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He reveals the trauma and triumph that taught him why it’s more important to be a good man than a nice guySat 20 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShare“Simon!”Matthew McConaugheybarks. “How do, sir?!” Matthew McConaughey could not be more Matthew McConaughey if he tried. And he’s only said four words. Charming, sincere, intense, 100% Texan and 101% eccentric.Five years ago, the Oscar-winning actor wrote a memoir calledGreenlights. It wasn’t a conventional memoir, more a collection of life lessons, bullet-point anecdotes and gnomic philosophies. Now he has written a book of poetry calledPoems & Prayers. For McConaughey, the two are interchangeable. It’s another memoir of sorts – this time, a portrait of his faith and its impact on his everyday life. In it he addresses faith in the broadest sense. There’s plenty of talking to God as he searches for the divine in himself, loads of Amens, but it’s also about faith in himself, his family, his career, the world, the works.The gospel according to Matthew advocates a world of relentless positivity that rejects the concepts of hate or “can’t”; a world of conservative discipline and traditional family values. But of course, this being McConaughey, it’s also a creed in permanent tension with earthly delights and soiled realities, where he misses his own birthday party because he’s so stoned that he sits in his car listening to a Janet Jackson song 32 times in a row, where his God-fearing parents beat the living crap out of each other, and his dad shags himself to death one early morning at the age of 62. As a rounded philosophy, I can’t pretend to make sense of it all. I’m not sure that McConaughey does, but he has a good go.His earliest poems are written as an 18-year-old taking a gap year in Australia as a Rotary Club exchange student. Already, he says, he was pushing the existential envelope. “I was on my own and I didn’t have any of my friends to bounce stuff off. The conversations were all Socratic, with myself. I was a foreign man in a foreign land. Quite lonely. And I was trying to make sense of the world, trying to make sense of my home. Trying to make sense of Texas and life.”What was he struggling with? “I was asking similar questions then as I am now. What are we calling success? What are we rewarding people and ourselves for in this life? What are we chasing? What are we living for? Is it just money and fame? And this is before I had any money and fame. I was already questioning that. Character and integrity meant a lot to me then. I was calling out what I saw as the mendacities of the world.” At the heart of his personal battle is learning to distinguish between McConaughey the nice guy and McConaughey the good man. The nice guy is liked by everyone and conflict-averse; the good man is values-driven, takes a stance, and is going to piss some people off along the way.View image in fullscreenWith Rory Cochrane in Dazed and Confused, 1993.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyView image in fullscreenWith Kate Hudson in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, 2003.Photograph: The Kobal CollectionMcConaughey has had three distinct stages in his movie career. First, there was the indie kid in his early 20s who worked with directors such as Richard Linklater inDazed and Confusedand John Sayles inLone Star. It was in Dazed and Confused that he made his name as drawling stoner extraordinaire David Wooderson, a twentysomething perpetual adolescent who still hangs around with high-school students. His catchphrases: “Alright, alright, alright” (the first words he ever said in a movie) and “You just gotta keep livin’, man. L.I.V.I.N.” entered the indie movie lexicon and have been linked with McConaughey ever since.Surprisingly, he then became a conventional leading man in mainstream movies, playing lawyers in courtroom procedurals (A Time to Kill, Amistad) and smooth-chested, smooth-talking heart-throbs in romcoms (The Wedding Planner, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past).Then, in 2011, came the much celebrated third stage when McConaughey gave free rein to his quirkiness, inhabiting a series of memorable off-the-wall characters. In other hands, they might have been too far-fetched, but somehow he managed to make them utterly convincing. Every outlandish idiosyncrasy rang true – from homophobic rodeo cowboy turned Aids activist Ron Woodroof saving the lives of gay men inDallas Buyers Clubto unhinged hedonist stockbroker Mark Hanna inThe Wolf of Wall Streetand inscrutable nihilist Rust Cohle inTrue Detective. And then there were the physical transformations. In Dallas Buyers Club, for which he won the best actor Oscar in 2014, he lost about 45lb to play the Aids-emaciated Woodroof; inGoldhe gained about the same amount by guzzling cheeseburgers and beer to play corpulent prospector Kenny Wells; and forMagic Mikehe got rid of virtually all his body fat to play superbuff strip-club owner Dallas. This stage of his career became known as the McConaissance, and is ongoing.Today he is speaking via video link from his home in Austin, Texas. I’m warned by the publicist that we cannot show footage from the interview because McConaughey is not “camera ready”. Camera ready or not, he’s looking pretty good. Trim, clean-shaven, younger than his 55 years but not ridiculously so. He’s sipping from a huge bottle of honey-based kombucha.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Derek Shapton/The GuardianI believed I would have made a good monk. I revere dedication. But a friend who’s an abbot said: No. You  need to tell stories. That is your giftWhile studying for a degree in radio, television and film at the University of Texas at Austin, he was cast by Linklater in Dazed and Confused. It was meant to be a much smaller role, but the director was so taken by his ability to improvise he expanded the part. As for McConaughey, he never assumed acting would be more than a fun hobby. So what did he think he would do with his life at the point he started writing poetry in Australia? “I believed my calling was to become a monk.” Would he have made a good one? He pauses. “Yeasssss. I would have made a good monk. I revere dedication, a life that dedicates itself to God, that sees God in every natural thing, at all times.” But he says he thinks he would have missed out on too much stuff. I expect him to talk about sex and stimulants. But no. “I had long talks about it with a Benedictine monk friend of mine who’s now an abbot at a monastery, and he said: ‘Nononononononoonono,you’re a communicator, you’re a storyteller, do not go to live a hermetic life. You need to communicate and tell stories. That is a gift you have been given. Do not dampen that gift or put a blanket on that gift by becoming a monk or hermit.’” At times he sounds like God’s own cowboy; vowels elongating and contracting by the syllable, one word gliding into the next, gloriously unpunctuated, sentences flowing like a raging river.He started writing at a time he felt his Christian faith challenged. “I found myself looking at the world around me and not finding evidence of things I want to believe in. I didn’t want to quit believing, but I was looking at how we’re treating each other, the low barometer of trust, and there seemed to be a sense of win at any cost. It doesn’t matter how you did it, just win. I became a little cynical. And then I was like: ‘How dare you, youarrogant, entitled prick.’ That is a disease. Cynicism is, I believe, a disease.”McConaughey grew up in Texas with two older brothers to Methodist parents. His father, James, who struggled with alcoholism, made fortunes in the oil-pipe supply business and lost them. His mother, Kay, was a teacher. Both were tough disciplinarians, though they didn’t necessarily practise what they preached.I’ve read so many improbable stories about his parents that I assume they must be apocryphal. For example, that they both got married three times – to each other. “Yep.Yep. Married three times, divorced twice. They never married anyone else. As far as I know there was never anybody else besides the two of them. I just think they needed some breaks from each other.” Having said that, his mother told him recently that sheknewhis fellow actor and good friend Woody Harrelson’s father, a convicted contract killer, and that she befriended him in one of her breaks from McConaughey’s father. This has led to rumours (admittedly started by McConaughey and Harrelson) that they are half-brothers.View image in fullscreenWith his mother Kay earlier this month at Toronto film festival.Photograph: Chris Chew/UPI/ShutterstockFrom my mom and dad you got expectations. There was fear of disobeying and doing wrong. You couldn’t say ‘can’t’ or ‘hate’. They were like cuss words in our householdIt was only a few years ago that he learned about his parents’ triplicate marriage, he says. “I was around 13 the second time they got divorced. I thought Mom was having an extended vacation in Florida. Ha ha ha!” He rocks with laughter. “Dad and I were living in the trailer park.”Is it true that his mother broke three fingers attacking his father? “Noooooooo!” he says, outraged at the suggestion. “The same finger. The middle one each time. ‘Pop! Pop!! Pop!!! Pop!!!!’” He imitates her, poking his father’s head with maximum force. “‘Katie, stop!KATIE, STOP!’” Then he makes a crunching noise. “And her finger would go.” In Greenlights, he describes his mother going for his father with a 12in chef’s knife having already broken his nose, and him retaliating with a bottle of Heinz ketchup.And yet they adored each other. His father always said he’d like to die making love to Kay. And, sure enough, he got his wish. “When I got that call it was a Monday afternoon, and I was in Austin and they were in Houston. Mom said: ‘Your dad has moved on,’ but she didn’t tell me on the initial call how. When I got back she told me. They hauled him out on the gurney and they tried to cover him up, and my mom’s in the driveway, and she pulled the sheet off him. It was 7.30am. My understanding is that they made love that morning about 6.30am and as soon as they finished having sex he had a heart attack.” What’s the relevance of pulling the sheet back – did that make it obvious how he died? “It didn’t make it obvious. But my mom wasn’t into standing on ceremony. ‘That’s Big Jim, he’s gonna go out how he went. Don’t be trying to cover up how he went out. He’s in his birthday suit and he’s right there. Don’t be covering that man up!’”Big Jim and Kay were staunch Christians. “It wasn’t heavy-duty fire and brimstone. But consequences were a big thing. From my mom and dad you got expectations. There was fear of disobeying and doing wrong.” What kind of things? “Respect. Not talking back. Making an effort. You couldn’t say ‘can’t’ or ‘hate’. Hate and can’t were like cuss words in our household. You could say ‘cunt’ but you couldn’t say ‘can’t’.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Derek Shapton/The GuardianHe remembers the day he learned the word “hate” at school. “It sounded like a grownup word to me. Kind of edgy. And my older brother did something to me on my own birthday, I can’t remember what, and I said: ‘I hate you,’ and I remember my mom stopping the birthday party and grabbing me and saying: ‘Don’t you ever, ever say that word, especially about a family member.’” As for “can’t”, it simply wasn’t in Big Jim’s vocabulary. “If I said I can’t do something, he would always say: ‘Aren’t you just having trouble?’ My weekend chore was to do the lawn and one morning I’d been pulling on the lawnmower and the damn thing wouldn’t start. I went inside and said: ‘Dad, I can’t get the lawnmower started,’ and he looked up. He’d hear that word, and you’d see him start twitching. He didn’t say a word, walked with me out of the kitchen to the back. He tried to start the lawnmower, but it wouldn’t start. He went down, unhooked a couple of things and started it. He calmly got up, looked me in the eye and said: ‘You see, son, you were just having trouble!’ Beautiful thing.”If McConaughey was struggling with his faith when he went to Australia at 18, it’s not surprising. Greenlights is a manifesto for positivity as much as a memoir. At one point he describes some of the bad things he has experienced to make the point that ultimately they still didn’t dent his outlook on life. Two of the lowlights are shocking – he was blackmailed into having sex for the first time at the age of 15, and he was molested by a man when he was 18 while knocked unconscious in the back of a van. Both revelations are dealt with in bullet points and never referred to again.I tell him I want to discuss something serious from Greenlights, and begin to quote from the book. Before I complete the sentence he’s cackling. “Ha ha ha ha! I knew that was coming. Ha ha ha ha!” His response makes me feel parental. Well, Matthew McConaughey, I say, it’s easy to be glib about this, but I don’t believe the reality was anything like that. He stops laughing: “Well, that may be how you received it. There was never any intent to be glib. There was absolute intent,absolute intent, to be terse and concise because I know, and you know, that if I go into that story then or now that’s the headline. That’s why I won’t tell the details now, either.”I’m not interested in the details, I say, I’m interested in the impact the incidents had on you. “Well, OK, did it crush some innocence of mine, that my nice guy, young Matthew, believed in the innocence of the world and no one would try to do harm to me or anyone else unless I provoked it? Did it step on my innocence that the first intimacy would be beautiful and innocent and natural? Sure.” The assault in the van is beyond terrifying, I say. “Oh, yeah, and I got out relatively unscathed. It could have been worse is what I’m saying. Talk about divine intervention. I remember waking up [in the van], and it was right before it could have been worse. That idea of the dangers of the world that are out there, about being aware, where to be, where not to be, how not to get into dicey situations, being aware of your zone, yeah. I look back and go, there are things I could have done differently to not have ended up in that situation.” He whistles, to himself more than me. It’s a long, pained whistle of relief – a wordless acknowledgment that somehow he survived. “To be more aware and wise; good man, not nice guy.”We have to admit the evil and the doubt that’s in the world. We have to admit it’s out there, and it’s inside us. And then choose to believe in something better or notBoth incidents – perhaps the second in particular – jolted him into a recognition of the realities of the world. “We’re going to go from innocence to naivety to scepticism and we’re going to stop there because we’re not going to go to cynicism. OK, let’s be a little bit more sceptical.” And now he has become McConaughey the preacher man, delivering a turbo-charged, profoundly felt one-to-one sermon. “We have to admit the evil and the doubt that’s in the world. We have to admit it’s out there, and it’s inside us. And then choose to believe in something better or not; to make the choice, to say that I’m going to chase faith instead of lie down to doubt. I didn’t go: ‘Woe be me, the world is a bad place.’ There are bad agents, and I guess we’ve all got a bad agent in our suit. So let me shake hands with that, look in the mirror, but also choose – do my best to choose – a higher road. I’m going to pick something that’s more selfish. I think ultimately that is more selfish, especially if there is a heaven. If we believe that what we do here has to do with where we end up, and again I don’t know, wouldn’t that be the most selfish way to act? And if there’s not, Simon, I still believe it’s better for me, it’s improving my life while I’m here on Earth in this way.” In other words, acting nobly is truly selfish because it leads to a better outcome whether you have faith or not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve never felt as helpless as in that moment. I’ve never felt so vulnerable and unable to do anything about it. That was a nightmare.” I won’t ask about the details, I say, but how did you get away. “I escaped,” he says.It’s hard to know where to go after a conversation like that, so we return to the poems. Revel in the Post is a lovely sensual verse that concludes: “And even on a hot summer evening you can smell October / through the sweat where you left the windows open and forgot to shave.” It sounds like a memory, I say. He smiles. “It was a particular wonderful night with my wife.”View image in fullscreenWith his wife Camila Alves McConaughey and children (from left) Livingston, Vida and Levi, 2025Photograph: Rick Kern/FilmMagicSome of the poems are love letters to his wife, the model and entrepreneur Camila Alves, thinly disguised as daft instructional ditties. One goes: “Best thing you can do for your marriage. / One way to surely get ahead. / Is get rid of that king-size mattress. / And sleep in a queen-size bed.” Is that, by any chance, based on personal experience? He laughs. “You want success, it starts with the engineering. Just get a smaller bed. We have kids, right, and we saw this bed that this friend had, which was two king-size beds put next to each other, and all the kids were sleeping in it, and we were like: ‘Dude that’s great. So we did that, and it was great. The kids would come in, everyone had room to sleep, but then the kids quit sleeping in the bed, and I’m over here by my side table and 18ft over there is Camila with her side table and we’re like [he shouts], ‘Nighhhhhhht!’ And you wake up in the morning and you got, like, 20ft between you and this is not good for our marriage. So we got rid of it and got a queen-size bed and we’re snuggling up to each other. This was genius. Much better.”Alongside the poems are musings about modern life and mini polemics. At one point, he writes: “So many of us today are out to prove that the truth is just an outdated nostalgic notion, that honesty, along with being correct and right, is now a deluded currency in our cultural economy. With an epidemic of half-cocked logic and illusions being sold as sound conclusions, it’s more than hard to know what to believe in; it’s hard to believe. But I don’t want to quit believing, and I don’t want to stop believing in … humanity, you, myself, our potential.”View image in fullscreenSet designer: Caitlin Doherty. Styling: Sandra Amador. Makeip: Kara Bua. Hair: Marcus Francis.Photograph: Derek Shapton/The GuardianI assume you’re talking about Trump, I say. “In the name of progress are we going to throw out every tried-and-tested truth of the past?” he says elliptically. “I don’t think that’s real progress.” So is he referring to Trump? “Wellllll, there’s something inherently there for sure. I don’t know what to believe in those pep rallies that they hold. I’ve been around politics and politicians enough to see and hear that the score is not always what they say it is; that they don’t keep the score accurately.”The reason I’m not diving into politics presently is I want to do my best to get three kids out of the house. But I’m fascinated with itDoes Trump’s disregard for the truth concern him? “Well, sure it concerns me. But that’s nothing new, either. You can go back and there are many things to question over decades and centuries about what the truth was. Trump’s going about things in a different way than other politicians have. It’s direct. He’s cutting out the middle man.”But, McConaughey says, his comments about lost values are not simply directed at politicians. “It’s also about the parents I’m around. I talk to fathers and I think: ‘What are you teaching your children? You don’t know. Don’t do that! That’s not what your child needs now!’” What kind of things is he talking about? “I see parents becoming best mates with their child when they’re very young, so it’s very simpatico between them. It’s not about right or wrong. But that child is trying to learn from you, that child doesn’t understand the concept of character, and how to become a good young man or woman.”Now he’s on a roll. “Delayed gratification, I believe, is one of the most important things you can teach a child. I’m noticing that more and more adults are giving no value to delayed gratification or sacrifice. And if we do that we miss out on real value, real profit.” So many young people today, he says, lack a sense of shame. “I think you’ve got to have guilt. Please! Embarrassment. I wish people were a little bit more embarrassed these days. People aren’t embarrassed!” And his voice rises with anger, or disappointment, as he preaches from that imaginary pulpit. “‘You don’t mind that you half-assed that situation so poorly? This your best effort, really? I would be embarrassed.’ Guilt. You’ve gotta have some guilt. I think it’s a very healthy thing, to a certain extent.” Where does his sense of guilt come from? “Shoot! I don’t know. I’m Irish, if that’s anything to do with it.”In recent years, McConaughey has expressed an interest in going into politics. “It’s something I started thinking about six years ago. The reason I’m not diving into it presently is I want to do my best to get three kids out of the house. But I’m fascinated with politics.” What party would he be aligned to? “It could be an independent party.”So much of what he believes in goes back to that recurrent question in his poetry – what makes a good man as opposed to a nice guy? When he looks back at himself as a young man, he sees a nice guy who had to do some growing. He did some of it on solitary trips to the Amazon and Mali in the 1990s. “I put myself in these very monk-like situations to force myself to deal with myself.” But he still had plenty of growing to do. In 1999, he was arrested at 2.45am for playing bongos naked while under the influence of marijuana. The drug charges were dropped, but he was fined $50 for disturbing the peace.I’m imploding from the wacky weed and decide it’s a really good idea to listen to Janet Jackson’s That’s the Way Love Goes, 32 f-ing times in my car. I missed my own birthday partyAnd then there was the time in his 30s, before he got together with Camila, when he was so stoned that he missed his own birthday party. What happened? “I’d smoked the wrong weed. Well, not the wrong weed. The heavy stuff that weed has become. My friends had rented this place for dinner, and I’m imploding from the wacky weed and decide it’s a really good idea to listen to Janet Jackson’s That’s the Way Love Goes, 32 f-ing times in my car, and by the time I went in everyone was gone. I missed my own birthday party.” Did he smoke less after that? “Yeah, exactly. And I like that song, but I don’t need to listen to it 32 times.” Did Linklater cast him in Dazed and Confused because he was a top stoner then? “Nononononono, I was never a top stoner. I was a guy who would take a hit and go to the damn library for three hours.”Professionally, the crunch came when he turned his back on playing nice guys in romcoms despite earning an estimated $10m-$15m a film. His latest movie, The Lost Bus, is a survival drama about a struggling driver who has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through Butte County’s hellish inferno in 2018 (the deadliest wildfire in California history). In short, it is about a flawed nice guy learning to become a good man.As so often, with his immersive process, the part required extensive research. This time he had to learn to drive a bus. Or more specifically, to drive a bus through fire and alongside cliff edges. Even today, he has prepared for the interview by reading up on me. (At one point, he compares his mother to mine, whom I have written about.) I ask if he always does this. “I’d rather if I can. I like to have a little insight.” He says it makes talking to journalists less an interrogation and more an authentic conversation.McConaughey’s transformation from himbo to character actor was about challenging himself. He was hugely successful, but his reputation had taken a dip. He was now regarded as a Hollywood hack who never pushed himself. The challenge was not so much as an actor (he has always insisted that romcoms demanded as much skill as the more critically lauded films) but as a man. Was he prepared to snub the safe option and risk everything when he had a fabulously lucrative career (he was worth an estimated $160m in 2024)? After his final romcom, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, in 2009, he turned down every part he was offered for the best part of two years. Eventually, in 2011, the roles he was looking for came his way, starting with psychological thrillerKiller Joe. And that led to the McConaissance, with McConaughey now feted for the courage of his choices.When he quit romcoms, he had just become a father and was loving life, but his work left him unsatisfied. “I was good at something I wasn’t loving. I was never looking in the mirror going: ‘My life’s more vital than my work, oh I wish my work was as vital as my life.’ I remember going: ‘Well good luck, because if it’s got to be one way or the other, good on you that you feel your life’s more vital than your work and that it’s not the other way around.’ But I was like, ‘I want to go for it, I want to see if my work can be an experience for me that is so vital and alive that it challenges the vitality I’m having in my own life.’”He says that he and Camila took the decision as a team and were determined to stick with it, but others thought he’d lost the plot. “My brothers were like: ‘Little brother, what is your majormal-fucking-function? What are you thinking?’ And I was like: ‘No, this is clear to me and Camila, we’re going to do this. We’re not going to pull parachute. We’re gonna ride this.’ And 20 months later, the levee broke and the offers came in that I wanted.”Life, he says, continues to surprise him. Even today, he’s discovering things that shift perspectives on the past and help explain the present. As a young boy, he says his parents instilled him with such self-belief. His mother hung a framed photo of him as a gorgeous seven-year-old in a cowboy hat holding his Little Mr Texas trophy on the kitchen wall. “Every morning Mom was like: ‘Look at you, Little Mr Texas!’” It gave him confidence. A few years ago, he zoomed in on the photograph to read the engraving. He discovered it said “Little Mr Texas Runner-Up 1977”. When he asked his mother about it, she told him the technical winner was a wealthy boy who had cheated by wearing a fancy suit, so McConaughey was the true winner. The difference between believing you’re a winner or a runner-up can transform a life, he says. “Hell man, would I be sitting here right now if I’d thought I was just the runner-up?”Poems & Prayers is published by Headline; to support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Since ABC made the decision to indefinitelysuspend comedian Jimmy Kimmelfrom his late-night talkshow after on-air remarks about the killing of Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump has encouraged further action against other late-night hosts.Yet, such topical humor has been a feature of late-night TV since NBC launched the format in the mid-1950s. In fact, throughout modern history, presidents in particular have understood the cultural value of late night TV and dutifully played their part in this uniquely American symbiosis – from JFK to the present-day politicians.Steve Allen, the radio man who launched what would become the Tonight Show, regularly poked fun at political figures in his opening monologues – but in a measured, self-deprecating style that was typical of the era.Media giants accused of ‘cowering to threats’ as Trump tries to stamp out criticismRead moreIt wasn’t until comedian Johnny Carson took over in 1962 that the Tonight Show transformed into acultural institutionwhere politics was mined for nightly material. Carson resorted to impersonations and satire to highlight the human inconsistencies within politics, and borrowed from Abbott and Costello’sWho’s on First?sketch to parody Ronald Reagan’srhetorical double speak. Carson, oft-touted as “the king of late-night”, stuck to humor that called out the absurdities of politics without taking a particular side.As the Tonight Show mushroomed into one of the most popular shows on US television, attracting 17 million nightly viewers at its peak, Americans came to see Carson as a clearer lens on current events than straight news.A 2022 article in the journalSocial Science Researchfound that Carson’s daily mentions of Richard Nixon or Watergate in the early 1970s was a major contributor to the president’s approval rating crash, underscoring Carson’s tremendous influence on the bygone monoculture in his nearly 30 years on air. Before Carson, political figures really only sat down withDick Cavettand similarly tweedy late-night hosts; Cavett’s 1970 interview with Georgia lieutenant governorLester Maddox, which saw the segregationist storm off in response to Cavett’s pointed questioning, definitely wasn’t played for laughs.Nixon’sandJohn F Kennedy’sseparate Tonight Show appearances in the 1960s as presidential candidates broke ground; the office was thought to be above late-night larking. But then Reagan’s Tonight Show stops asgovernor of Californiaandhis clubby relationshipwith Carson firmly established late-night TV as an extension of the political arena and announced the former workaday actor as a true star.It wasn’t until the 1990s, when Carson was heading for retirement and the competition for his crown and ratings wasgrowing more intense, that you begin to see presidential hopefuls pursuing late-night appearances as part of a strategy to connect with younger voters keen for a more relatable stripe of politician.View image in fullscreenBill Clinton plays the saxophone as host Arsenio Hall stands by during a presidential campaign stop on the Arsenio Hall Show in Los Angeles on 3 June 1992.Photograph: Reed Saxon/APFamously, Bill Clinton’s inaugural presidential campaign was invigorated when he appeared on the Arsenio Hall Show – a younger, hipper and multi-racial rival to the Tonight Show at the time. Clinton accompanied the house band on the saxophone fora rendition of Heartbreak Hotel, earning himself a level of impassioned support from Black voters thatstill endures.In 2000, candidate George W Bush joined the Late Show with David Letterman in a reading of the comedian’s trademark top 1o list –this one, of “Changes I’ll Make to the White House”. (“Give Oval Office a heckuva scrubbing,” Bush said in a sly nod toLewinskygate.)In 2009, Barack Obama joined Carson successor Jay Leno on the Tonight Show, the first ever late-night TV appearance bya sitting US president, to sell his economic recovery plan.Even as the Clinton era gave rise to more pointed and partisan political skepticism from late-night shows such as the Daily Show and Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher (who waspulled off the air by ABCfor his 9/11 takes), presidents accepted the relentless punchlines as part of the job.But Trump is a different political animal. Unlike predecessors who became monologue fodderafterannouncing their campaigns, Trump pre-Oval Office persona would be shaped from late-night comedians riffing off his exhaustively documented divorces, business failings and rebound in reality TV.Trump was a well-established character by the time he appeared on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2016, the singular presidential hopeful who had already hosted SNLtwice. Infamously, Fallon mussed Trump’s hair – a gesture thatmedia observers arguenot only humanized Trump and his polarizing brand of politics, but also spoke to Fallon’s fundamental unseriousness. Fallon would later express regret for his role in helping to “normalize” Trump; Trump responded by calling out Fallon’s manhood.View image in fullscreenJimmy Fallon messes up Trumps famous hairdo on The Tonight Show in 2016.Photograph: The Tonight Show with Jimmy FallonThat was effectively the start of Trump’s late-night pivot from desperate guest to acid-tongued critic. He has been especially harsh on Kimmel – who has kept the Maga movement, its corrosive policies and polarizing rhetoric in crosshairs since candidate Trump backed out of a scheduled 2015 appearanceat the last minute. (Trump showed up two months later, and there were no signs of friction then.) Reportedly, the first Trump administrationput pressure on ABC and parent company Disneyto rein in Kimmel – and for years his request was just met with tougher jokes when Kimmel also hosted the Oscars. So Trump took to social media to air out his many grievances. Often while lamenting the quality of today’s late-night hosts, Trump has called on TV to “bring back Johnny”. Never mind the fact that Carson, who himselfcautionedagainst entertainers alienating audiences with their political views, has been dead for 20 years.Fast forward to July, when CBS made the decision to abruptlycancelthe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,an unrelenting Trump critic. While CBS and Paramount chiefs claimed it was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night”, the move was largely seen as a larger corporate effort to circumvent monopoly law to pave the way for parent company Paramount’s billion-dollar sale to Skydance Media and decried as a crackdown on free speech. This comes as Nexstar Media, a conservative-leaning TV station conglomerate with many ABC affiliates, is pushing the Trump administration to clear a path for its own potential monopoly through a merger with rival Tegna.But late-night comedy isn’t just under pressure from its politically obsequious corporate masters. It’s also fighting to remain a bellwether of truth at a time when US journalism institutions are being hollowed out, attacked and discredited by Trump and his many powerful allies in a polyculture where truth is no longer absolute.The 2008 book Strange Bedfellows: How Late-Night Comedy Turns Democracy into a Joke further underscores the “relay race” between newspaper coverage of Watergate and Carson’s monologue mentions. With fractured audiences having deeply eroded late night’s once healthy profit margins, late-night shows now risk losing more than just audience share by mocking the Trump administration or its designated mouthpieces.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators gather outside El Capitan Entertainment Centre, where Jimmy Kimmel Live! is filmed, to protest ABC’s decision to pull Kimmel off the air after his remarks about Charlie Kirk in Hollywood, California, on 18 September 2025.Photograph: JW Hendricks/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“When you go back and take a look, all they do is hit Trump,” the president said from aboard Air Force One while threateninganyone with an FCC broadcast licensewho spends too much time criticizing him, however he defines it. “They’re not allowed to do that! They are an arm of the Democratic party.”‘Censor-in-chief’: Trump-backed FCC chair at heart of Jimmy Kimmel stormRead moreIronically, Disney’s decision to suspend Kimmel would send the company’s stock price tumbling amidprotestsandlost subscribers. Meanwhile, Kimmel’s surviving peer hosts looked to the state-run media of strongman-controlled regimes for their comedic cues.Fallon and the Daily Show’s Jon Stewart each kicked off their shows with satirical set pieces thatbowed to the presidentandpaid mock respect to himas an authoritarian. Colbert dusted off hisrightwing blowhard characterto get in a few subliminal digs at Trump.The jokecraft speaks to the seriousness of the times, and late-night’s determination to carry on serving as the country’s political lens – regardless of the ultimate cost.Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelDonald TrumpUS television industryCharlie Kirk shootingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It helps that Petrenko has a first-rate octet of soloists, led by the baritone Wolfgang Koch as Gabriel, but the sense he believes in the quality of every bar is inescapable.”Andrew ClementsRead the full reviewExplore more on these topicsThe week in reviewsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

England are into the Rugby World Cup final against Canada next Saturday and the tournament organisers can breathe again. Had the Red Roses slipped up in the semis the prospect of a finale likely to yield a record TV audience in Quebec was not quite the dream scenario they had been praying for.But, goodness, the Red Roses made their fans perspire at times. At no stage did France ever back down and, withouttwo scintillating tries from their curly haired golden girl Ellie Kildunne, England might have had a far less enjoyable afternoon. The final scoreline does not reflect how tight the game was for lengthy periods, nor the costly chances that France were crucially unable to convert.Kildunne double takes England past France into Women’s Rugby World Cup finalRead moreAs a result the vast majority of the 80,000-plus punters bound for Twickenham now have the final they craved and England’s smiling post-match lap to thank their adoring public will not be their last such procession. If Kildunne can sparkle like this again in the final, furthermore, the prospect of England being crowned world champions for the first time since 2014 will be duly enhanced.Kildunne is certainly box office in anybody’s language. From the opening minutes she was already dancing and skipping past a host of defenders, clearly keen to make up for lost time having been forced to sit out the Scotland game. And then, courtesy of a loose ruck ball which should have resulted in England being penalised for accidental offside, the recent world player of the year was handed another opportunity just on halfway. Away she surged and, 50 metres later, the gleeful dive behind the posts mirrored the joy around most of the stadium.Her second-half effort, also from more than 40 metres and involving a diagonal surge past more powerless opponents, brought the house down again at a stage of the game when England needed a fresh spark from somewhere. Because, let’s face it, if you keep Kildunne quiet and shut down England’s scrum and maul the Red Roses can look rather more mortal than they would like.Both those mission statements, admittedly, are big ‘ifs’ and in the final analysis France could not quite tick both boxes for the entire 80 minutes. England, not least in the form of Hannah Botterman and Meg Jones, also have others who relish a big occasion and have the ability to produce their absolute best when it really matters. But will Canada’s finest spend this week downcast and devoid of hope? Hardly.View image in fullscreenHannah Botterman enjoys the big stage during England’s semi-final victory against France.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianFrance, for their part, will now face New Zealand in the bronze final nursing a frustrating sense of deja vu. En route to their 2003 men’s triumph England were due to meet France in the semi-final with a close encounter widely anticipated. But come the day of the match, when the French players pulled back their bedroom curtains in beachside Bondi, there were already raindrops on their windows. Instinctively Les Bleus began to fear the worst.The forecast had been similar for Bristol this time. England’s forwards love a rainy night almost as much as Eddie Rabbit once did. And as they showed againstScotland in the quarter-finalon this same stretch of grass, a stop-start, scrum-heavy contest is a perfect one as far as this Red Rose pack are concerned. Particularly in a big knockout fixture with no prizes for artistic merit.As it turned out the predicted rain drifted away and, in drying conditions, France were frequently compelling. At scrum-half the brilliant Pauline Bourdon Sansus played beautifully and the loping Madoussou Fall Raclot was everywhere. England spent so long without the ball that, at half-time, they had collectively made 107 tackles to France’s 28.‘Absolutely incredible’: England captain Zoe Aldcroft relishing sold-out Twickenham finalRead moreThe majority of the first-half champagne moments were of French origin, too. Twice they were within one more pass of registering cracking tries but first Marine Ménager failed to find the unmarked Léa Champon inside her and then Gaby Vernier’s looping long pass to Ménager drifted forward with the line begging. Had they taken both gilt-edged chances, who knows?England’s steely defence, though, bails them out of tight corners on a regular basis. Before this game the highest number of points they had conceded in a single match all tournament was eight against Scotland last weekend. England’s bench depth also remains another obvious plus. They have the luxury of replacing one outstanding front row with another and, once again, their ‘finishers’ added a significant gloss to the scoreboard.But will it be enough for them to win the game of their lives on Saturday? World Cup glory can never be guaranteed, even for a host nation who haven’t lost a game for three years. And on the evidence of this weekend they will also have do it the hard way given their sternest test undoubtedly still awaits. How good were Canada on Friday night as theyshredded the supposedly indomitable Black Ferns?More than good enough, if given the chance, to turn lofty English ambition into the sweetest maple syrup.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025England women's rugby union teamFrance women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

The win is notable as it can be used as the calling-card performance for the Ruben Amorim project. In the first half 10-man Chelsea were pummelled mercilessly by a United unit that was quicker, stronger, more menacing and just plain better than the Club World Cup winners.After this, the conditions and Casemiro’s sending-off in added time before the interval evened things up after Robert Sánchez’s own early shower, and the teams levelled each other out.‘Return to that urgency’: Amorim urges United players to keep winning mentalityRead moreAn 80th-minute Trevoh Chalobah header made it 2-1 – the defender rising between a dozing Leny Yoro and Amad Diallo to meet Reece James’s cross – but United passed the test of closing out the three points. As a sizeable boost this was, as Amorim said, “really important”.Amorim had said his side needed to be better in both penalty areas and here they were. The United story machine’s latest plotline had a former beloved son, Alejandro Garnacho, returning as a bete noire, and a head coach saying not even the pope would shift him regarding the maligned 3-4-3.Of the papal soundbite, afterwards he could smile, saying: “It was a joke, you guys love it, when we have another win I will give you another one;” while United fans delighted in Garnacho being an unused substitute booed on arrival and when warming up.Chelsea’s plan was torn asunder four minutes in. Altay Bayindir’s hoof took a Benjamin Sesko flick, Bryan Mbeumo ran on to the ball, eluded Sánchez, and the visiting goalkeeper took the Cameroonian down. Even before Peter Bankes raised the red card Sánchez knew he was off. This forced a rejig from Enzo Maresca, with Estêvão Willian hooked for the new keeper, Filip Jörgensen, and Tosin Adarabioyo brought on for Pedro Neto.United were a whir of red, tumbling relentlessly at Chelsea, and soon breached Jörgensen. Noussair Mazraoui skipped along the right, chipped in, Patrick Dorgu headed to Bruno Fernandes and he tipped home for a 100th United strike. A lengthy inquiry by the video assistant referee ruled Chalobah had kept him onside.View image in fullscreenRobert Sánchez fouls Bryan Mbeumo, resulting in the Chelsea goalkeeper being sent off.Photograph: Peter Powell/EPAThis was after 13 minutes. A torrid opening 20 for Maresca’s men closed with their A-list act, Cole Palmer, being replaced because of injury by Andrey Santos and already Chelsea’s substitute count was three.From United’s3-0 humbling at Manchester Cityhad gone Manuel Ugarte and Yoro – for Harry Maguire and Casemiro – and Amorim’s unit was far slicker. Chelsea’s sole threat came when the isolated João Pedro bobbed into the home area and Mazraoui stuck a leg out and the forward went down, but Bankes was not interested.Now came United’s second: a tale of Luke Shaw’s desire, James’s clownish defending, and Enzo Fernández’s timidness. Mazraoui spiralled a ball to the far post from the right and James had the chance to clear Dorgu’s misdirected header. Instead, the captain sliced the ball up, Shaw came crashing in to head on as Fernández watched, and Casemiro headed past Jörgensen.Chelsea were a dizzied boxer staggering up at the eight-count due to United’s constant haymakers. Fernandes slipped Sesko in but he could not control. The ball was bounced to Mbeumo, who tried to put his left boot through it but missed. Marc Cucurella chopped down Mazraoui and Bankes booked him. United cruised. So, as is the way of this post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, they made life “complicated”, Amorim sighed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It seemed as harsh as Casemiro’s decision to grapple with Santos was foolish.At the free-kick United slept and Cucurella went close, and for the second period Sesko was sacrificed for Ugarte to take Casemiro’s berth. More yellows were shown, for Fernández and Chalobah, though on a surface causing the players to aquaplane, there was scant surprise at niggle creeping in.A Maguire arm on Santos’s chest was the next to cause Chelsea ire and when Fernandes released Dorgu down the left and United roved in the contest had some actual football once more.Ten versus 10 was the glimmer Chelsea needed and a James cross which Diallo hooked away, then a later James cross Matthijs de Ligt crashed out for a corner, were warnings. As was a Wesley Fofana header correctly ruled offside.By the 69th-minute Yoro, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha were on for United, Maguire, Mbeumo and Mazraoui the trio who exited.Chelsea rallied and United had to defend their box, and did.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A Liverpool statement expressed the club’s deep shock and sadness at the news.Beard guided the club to two WSL titles in consecutive seasons in 2013 and 2014, in his first of two spells in charge of the club. In the second spell, he led them to promotion back to the top flight. He is the most successful manager in Liverpool’s women’s team’s history.Beard’s wife, Deb, wrote on social media: “It is with great sadness that our beautiful Matthew Beard has passed away tonight [Saturday] at 7.28pm. He is a loving husband, father, son, brother and uncle. He was the most amazing, caring man who was loved by anyone who had the pleasure to meet him.“All of our family kindly ask for time to grieve in peace at his loss. We will love you forever, you absolute legend.”View image in fullscreenMatt Beard and his players celebrate Liverpool’s promotion to the WSL after the Championship match against Bristol City at Ashton Gate in April 2022.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesLiverpool said: “Liverpool Football Club is deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of former LFC Women manager Matt Beard. The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Matt’s family and friends at this devastating time.“Matt was not only an extremely committed and successful manager, he was also a person of real integrity and warmth, who will always be remembered with genuine fondness by everyone he worked with at the club.”In a statement on X, the WSL said: “Everyone at WSL Football extends its deepest sympathies to the family, friends and loved ones of Matt Beard following news of his passing. Matt played an instrumental role in the growth of women’s football and will be missed by everyone associated with the game.”Beard, who was in charge of Liverpool last season and was most recently the manager at Burnley, was also a Cup finalist while in charge of West Ham, and had spells managing Bristol City, Chelsea and Boston Breakers.Beard was named as the WSL’s manager of the year in 2013 and 2014. He was appointed as the Burnley manager in June 2025 but resigned in August.The Professional Footballers’ Association said: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Matt Beard. Matt was a hugely respected and loved figure across the game, and we extend our condolences to his family, friends, and all who knew him.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpool FC WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Piero Hincapié – who joined on an initial loan from Bayer Leverkusen – was handed his debut in Spain and the versatile Ecuador central defender, who is also capable of playing as a left-back, gives Arteta even more options.Arsenal drew seven and lost one of 14 Premier League matches they played directly after a Champions League game last season – including both 2-2 draws against Liverpool – and their manager acknowledged they must try to be more consistent to sustain a challenge. “That’s something we want to improve,” said Arteta. “We will try to do better.”He is banking on Arsenal’s array of attacking options to make the difference. After Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard came off the bench to score in Bilbao, Arteta made no secret of the fact he has taken inspiration from rugby union inviewing his substitutes as “finishers”, although he could just as easily have found it by watching Sarina Wiegman manage England to a second successive European title in the summer.View image in fullscreenArsenal kicked off their Champions League campaign with victory at Athletic Club.Photograph: Luis Tejido/EPA“If you look historically, the top teams, the teams that have won a lot, the impact that the finishers had has always been really, really high,” said Arteta on Friday. “You need that quality nowadays to unlock games and to do it consistently every three days. It’s even harder and that’s what you need. We are very lucky because we have players that can make that impact. They certainly did that the other day and now we need consistency on that.”There were rumours that Martinelli and Trossard could be allowed to depart in the summer but it is understood Arteta was keen to keep both despite the arrivals of Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze. Martinelli and Trossard scored 10 goals each last season and made regular contributions, even if the former has struggled to hit the heights of the 2022-23 campaign when he managed 15. But the Brazilian’s pace provides a very different option on the left to Eze, who prefers to drift inside.Finding the right balance as the games come thick and fast over the coming months will be the next big problem for Arteta to resolve. For example, Myles Lewis-Skelly has yet to start a game this season as Riccardo Calafiori has established himself at left-back thanks to his ability to provide more width. The 18-year-old did play for England against Andorra last week but was left out of the squad that travelled to Serbia a few days later. “When you don’t play, you have to fight to win that place back – that’s it,” said Arteta of Lewis-Skelly before the international break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With continuing doubts over Martin Ødegaard’s fitness after the captain missed the win over Athletic with a shoulder issue, he is likely to stick with a midfield of Martín Zubimendi, Declan Rice and Mikel Merino against a City side that hope to be boosted bythe presence of Rodri, who missed the 5-1 defeat in February after sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the 2-2 draw at the Etihad earlier in the season.Merino has also shown his versatility as a back-up striker to Viktor Gyökeres as Kai Havertz continues to recover from a knee operation. Gyökeres required stitches after he and Merino sustained head injuries against Athletic that have not ruled them out of the City game.“Winning those matches creates that conviction that you can go and win the game but not against them, against any opposition,” said Arteta of Arsenal’s recent success against City. “That’s the feeling I have now with the team and the players individually: that on Sunday we are going there to win the game.

Gold with 6,988 points. Then Ireland’s Kate O’Connor, with a national record of 6,714pts for silver.There was a further wait for the third name to appear, and when it did her heart sank. Taliyah Brooks, USA, 6,581 points, bronze. But then it began to beat with joy again. Almost instantaneously, Johnson-Thompson’s name came up with 6,581 points next to it, along with a bronze medal symbol. For the first time anyone could remember at a global heptathlon there had been a tie.View image in fullscreenThe American Anna Hall celebrates crossing the line to win the 800m and the gold medal in the heptathlon.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters“I thought that I wasn’t going to get it because my name was underneath hers on the scoreboard,” Johnson-Thompson said after receiving her 12th major medal. “I’ve never seen it before. And I’m not questioning it.“I didn’t celebrate until they actually put the medal around my neck because I was thinking: ‘What the hell was that?’ Exactly the same points, you couldn’t write it. And I’m so happy that neither of us lost by a point because that would have been horrendous.”It all came down to the final event, the 800m. Johnson-Thompson, who had started day two in third, had slipped to fourth behind Brooks after a 6.42m long jump and a modest javelin of 41.94m. It left her facing a simple equation: run six seconds quicker than Brooks and the bronze would be hers.There was not much between them on the first 400m, but Johnson-Thompson extended her lead on the second lap to finish in 2min 07.38sec. Brooks then battled home in 2:13.17, a personal best. There was a nervous wait. Scoring tables were consulted. Numbers crunched. And then came unbridled joy.‘You can be an academic badass and a track goddess’ – GB sprinter Amy Hunt revels in shock 200m silverRead more“I didn’t know how far she was behind and I didn’t want to look,” said Johnson-Thompson. “I just thought: ‘Wait until the official result has come.’ And then when it did, I still didn’t have any answers.”Afterwards the pair exchanged a few words. “We just couldn’t believe it,” the 32-year-old said. “We chat a lot up there. It’s like we were all drunk at the end of it.”She was understandably emotional, given that four years ago at the Tokyo Olympics she tore her calf during the 200m and hobbled off the track on crutches. “I’ve been through it in this stadium,” she said. “It holds so much emotion and to finish the 200m meant the world, and to finish with a medal this time around I can’t put into words the full circle moment I’ve just been through. It just feels like I’ve rewritten a better story about this city.”But it was a story that was four years in the making. Even when she came to the track last week, to support her training partner Jazmin Sawyers, it brought back painful memories. “I literally started crying straight away,” she said. “It instantly just hit me. It’s the same track where the big trauma happened in my life.“I have no words. I’m still in a bit of disbelief. It really does mean the world to me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the WorldAthleticspresident, Sebastian Coe, and the world record holder, David Rudisha, watching on, the Olympic champion, Emmanuel Wanyonyi, just held off the fast finishing Djemal Sedjati of Algeria to take gold in a championship record 1min 41:86sec.Sedjati was just 0.04 back, while Canada’s Marco Arop was third in 1:41.95. Ireland’s Cian McPhillips swooped from the gods to finish fourth, while Burgin was sixth in a race where all eight finalists finished in under 1:42.80.Elsewhere it was a bad night for Britain’s relay squads, with the women’s 4x400m team finishing last in their heat, the men’s 4x100m quartet dropping the baton, and the men’s 4x400m team just sneaking into the Sunday’s final.View image in fullscreenGreat Britain’s Jona Efoloko fails to hand the baton to Eugene Amo-Dadzie during the men’s 4x100m relay heat.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAOnly Britain’s women’s 4x100m team looked up to their usual high standards and the stark reality is that the relay squads, which gave Britain a clean sweep of five medals at the Paris Olympics, look like providing only one in Tokyo.The British 400m runner Victoria Ohuruogu admitted that finishing last was a “huge disappointment” but added: “We gave everything we had. I don’t want to make excuses but it’s been a long championships.”However the listless performance led to justifiable criticism from the 2012 Olympic men’s long jump champion, Greg Rutherford. “I’m all for building everybody up and giving them a fair chance,” he told the BBC. “That’s not good enough.

Goals from Alex Iwobi and Harry Wilson plus an Ethan Pinnock own goal enabled Marco Silva’s men to bounce back from an early concession to take three points with something to spare. In claiming the spoils once again in this west London derby, Fulham also took some of the shine off Keith Andrews’ start asBrentfordmanager in the process.This was a meeting both of local rivals and of the Premier League’s burgeoning middle class, with both teams capable of mixing their approach and in possession of squads of technically gifted yet physically imposing athletes. Silva’s tactical tinkering, shifting Harry Wilson to negate Keane Lewis-Potter down the right, linking Iwobi with Ryan Sessegnon on the left, ultimately outdid the trusted Brentford strategy of limiting opportunities to opponents and maximising set pieces. The inefficiencies with which Andrews’ men effected their strategy, however, will be of concern.“We were the best team on the pitch, our first half was top level from the first minute,” a bullish Silva said. “We were on the front foot, we were very aggressive, we created many problems for them. We conceded a goal we didn’t deserve, but the support for Josh in that moment was lovely to see and what a reaction. We kept cool and we showed our resilience.”Silva was referring to the error from Josh King that continued the 18-year-old’s baptism of fire in the Premier League, just two games after his first senior goal waschalked off incorrectly by officialsagainst Chelsea. Starting once again as Fulham’s playmaker, he came deep to collect the ball in the 20th minute, but played it blind across the pitch, leading to an interception by Mikkel Damsgaard and a cool finish past Bernd Leno. The teenager’s teammates were immediately on hand, however, Alex Iwobi wrapping an arm around King as they walked back towards halfway.Iwobi went on to become the central figure in the game asFulhamdug in and fought their way back into the match. On the half-hour, his understanding with Sessegnon down the left helped him tee up the full-back for an effort that Caoimhín Kelleher could only spill to Rodrigo Muniz, who lofted the ball over from a tight angle. Eight minutes later Iwobi had the equaliser himself, capitalising on uncertainty among any number of Brentford defenders to turn home low under the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper.View image in fullscreenEthan Pinnock (not pictured) scores an own goal at Craven Cottage.Photograph: Adam Davy/PATwo minutes later, the Nigeria international also had an assist to his name, as Wilson gave Fulham the lead. This was a delightful goal, in both its precision and its efficiency. More fumbling from Brentford’s backline, this time a scuffed header from Nathan Collins, allowed Muniz to seize the ball.The Brazilian drove forward then shifted possession to his left to Iwobi, who looked back across the pitch to where Wilson was driving infield from the right, begging for the ball. Iwobi found him with a wonderful pass that bisected the entire Brentford backline and Wilson arrived in the box to finish first time with his left foot beyond Kelleher’s right hand.The noise in Craven Cottage lifted a notch from that moment and in the second half the home side become more dominant. They got a third goal in the 50th minute thanks to Sessegnon’s left foot, a cross whipped across the line of the Brentford six-yard box causing now predictable uncertainty and ending in a stooping Pinnock turning the ball into his own net. A fourth goal appeared to arrive five minutes later after Muniz bullied his way to goal, a little too forcefully according to Michael Oliver who, at the behest of the video assistant referee, found a trailing elbow from the Brazilian had bloodied Collins in the buildup and ordered an overturn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s three away defeats out of three now, and eight points conceded from winning positions.“We’re building a new team and at this level when there’s indecision it can hurt you,” Andrews said. “There was a period where they just started to get the better of us.

They have spoken to the former Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espírito Santo and areconsidering a reunion with Slaven Bilic. Gary O’Neil, the former Wolves manager, is open to the job.Asked if he felt the support of the board, Potter said: “Yeah, I have no reason to think not but I also understand the environment and the results. I have no complaints at all with the support that we’ve had and the support from the supporters and everyone at the club.“Do I believe I can turn it around? Of course. I also understand it’s tough.

There’s nothing I can say.“Everybody connected with the club feels that because the situation isn’t what we want. The results aren’t good, you have to face it up and you have to ensure that we’re stronger next week. It’s as simple as that.”West Ham’s frailties were summed up by them conceding from a corner for the seventh time this season when Jean-Philippe Mateta headed Palace into the lead. Jarrod Bowen equalised but Potter’s luck was summed up by the unlikely figure of Tyrick Mitchell volleying in the winner for Oliver Glasner’s side.Glasner insisted he was not thinking about Champions League qualification after Palace rose into fourth place. “I’m never relaxed,” Palace’s manager said. “The better we will perform, the better we will be at the end of the season.”Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

Understeer, oversteer in different places on the straights, going left to right. To basically nail everything and also then the big interruptions that we had was just very tricky.”Williams’ Carlos Sainz had the track’s measure to claim a remarkable second, while Liam Lawson was third for Racing Bulls, his best qualifying result.

Time after time drivers were caught out, being too hot into corners and made to look decidedly average.From the championship perspective it was the unusual unforced error from Piastri, who ploughed into a wall, which might have been most costly. “I braked a little bit late,” said the Australian championship leader. “It was a case of trying a little bit too hard and paying the price.”Yet just as his title rival Norris had a shot at reeling in the 31-point gap to his teammate, he failed to capitalise when he too brushed a wall on his final lap. He felt it cost him a little time but believed the team should have put him out later on those final decisive laps, asRed Bullhad with Verstappen.Quick GuideAzerbaijan F1 gridShow1Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull 1min 41.117sec2Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams 1:41.5953Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bulls 1:41.7074Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedes 1:41.7175George Russell(GB) Mercedes 1:42.0706Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull 1:42.1437Lando Norris(GB) McLaren 1:42.2398Isack Hadjar(Fr) Racing Bulls 1:42.3729Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLaren No Time Set10Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrari No Time SetQ211Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martin 1:41.85712Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrari 1:42.18313Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Kick 1:42.27714Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin 1:43.06115Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas F1 No Time SetQ116Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine 1:42.77917Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Kick 1:42.91618Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpine 1:43.13919Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams 1:43.77820 *Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas F1 1:43.004*Placed last due to failing test on rear wingWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As it is neitherMcLarendriver has much chance of catching the Dutchman, who was quick throughout qualifying, and the duo are in a fight of their own on Sunday for those vital championship points.

The red flag was deployed once more before anyone had set a time.A one-shot showdown to decide the grid was all that remained in the final four minutes and Norris went out first. He wrestled with the car, which was squirming beneath him on a damp track, and he too brushed the wall at turn 16. His chance of putting a big point swing on Piastri was likely gone.Verstappen, as ever given half a chance, grasped it and was flying, quickest in the first sector he held his nerve to claim the top spot with a 1min 41.117sec lap. It was his first pole in Baku, where he has yet to win, and with a Williams and a Racing Bull closest to him he will fancy he has every chance to convert it to victory.It is a fitting opportunity for holding it together in Baku where, on the form his colleagues demonstrated in qualifying, a long-old race may be in prospect on Sunday too.Lewis Hamilton was disappointed to manage only 12th, knocked out in Q2 for Ferrari after he had felt more confident as the weekend progressed.

I’ve never seen a player in my whole life get booked for taking a quick free-kick. I don’t know where that rule has come in. Even the stoppage-time, three minutes and one minute – I’ve never seen that in the Premier League in the last two or three years.“There were frustrations with the referee. Sometimes you want to let the game go, I completely get that, but you can’t not give us something and then two seconds later one of their defenders goes down after getting touched in the back and he gives it.“You come to these stadiums and the crowd are on them, I feel that they feel they have to give it. Kiernan [Dewsbury-Hall] is on four yellows now and he got one for taking a quick free-kick. We want to get the game going, we’re losing.”Everton had the better of the second half after a much-improved performance compared with their offering before the break and caused Liverpool problems. “Three minutes was very strange,” Moyes said of the time added at the end. “Every quick free-kick had to be stopped and brought back for the whistle and then we get a booking for it. I find it quite unbelievable.”Arne Slot praised Liverpool’s resilience after they held on to secure a fifth straight Premier League win. On three occasions this season, Liverpool have thrown away two-goal leads before coming back to win late on, but on Saturday there was no requirement for a dramatic ending.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Again. Improbably, we are on the 17th iteration (give or take) of the product that single-handedly ruins our lives every day with incessant vibrations alerting us to some horrifying calamity, plus every song in the Bruce Springsteen back catalog. Coming up with new features for the never-ending information machines we all keep in our pockets isn’t easy, but this time, Apple managed to develop a big (or should I say small) one. There’s now a thinner iPhone Air, which is being marketed asthe thinnest iPhone ever. These gadgets have never exactly been gargantuan, so it’s kind of like identifying the tiniest grain of sand in the desert. Still, people around the world are fascinated by the sheer lack of phone here.Technology, design, and art are all trending toward a certain scarcity model, prepping us for a lack of bells and whistles, as though both your parents are unemployed and they want you to expect fewer trips to Disneyland. Life on Earth feels more and more like the experience of entering aSweetgreen– beige, spartan and unobtrusive. Sure, iPhones haven’t gotten cheaper, but they have certainly gotten … lesser. The iPhone Air is so small, I feel like I’ll sit on it and it will slide seamlessly up my rectum, never to be seen again. For some, I’m sure losing your device inside your bowels might be a feature, but I think it’s a rather uncomfortable bug.Technology used to be clunky and even a bit embarrassing, the domain of the lonely nerd. My family had a “computer room” for most of the 90s – the place we hid the gray, awkward Compaq PC that allowed me to access pornography, instant messaging apps, and Star Trek promo photos. Whatever dirty business needed to take place on that glowing screen was meant to be donein private. Computers were ugly, industrial machines for hard work or antisocial digital wandering. Then, Steve Jobs asked: “What if that dumb gray box was beautiful, simple and cruelly trapped you in a never-ending cycle of desire and self-hatred? Plus, the entire back catalog of Bruce Springsteen.” The first iPod and iPhone were descendants of the miraculous Macintosh computer, which revolutionized personal computing. But, for me, the height of Apple’s design success was thecolorful, translucent iMac desktop. Back in 1998, the iMac offered a computer that wasn’t drab, but candy-coated, maximalist and something you’d actually be able to stow in a place of honor in your home. It was true design and had more in common with the bold work of theMemphis Group design traditionthan the stuffed shirts at IBM. The iMac looked like it should have been in Pee-wee’s Playhouse rather than some dimly lit vestibule at my parents’.iPhones, on the other hand, value minimalism above all else. Yes, you can get them invarious muted, metallic colors, or customize yours with a case that celebrates your favorite sports team or boldly declares that you “Can’t Be Arsed”. But for the most part, Apple offers a clean brand of futurism where nothing about the object offends (exceptthe contentyou can access with it). This is the way of everything now –minimalist wardrobes, bland farmhouse living rooms, restaurantsso pared down that they barely register as more than a kitchen and some tables.While in London this summer, I saw thelatest revival of the musical Evita at the Palladium, directed by the king of minimalist theater, Jamie Lloyd. Lloyd is known for sparse set design, barely there staging, and bold technological innovations in productions like the Tony Award-winning Sunset Boulevard. Evita is a period piece about the Argentine celebrity and political figure Eva Perón. It takes place in the 1950s and was created in the 1970s. Historical context matters. It’s usually staged with sumptuous sets and period-appropriate costuming. What Lloyd chose to do is strip all of that down, place its characters on a dark, nearly empty stage, and offer next to no sense of place or time. Evita, then, is presented to the audience inside a black void, with scantily clad dancers flailing about in front of a large, lit-up sign that says, simply: “EVITA”, in case you forgot what you wandered into. The dystopian phantom zone where Evita takes place is a manifestation of how it feels to live in the perpetually wired digital age of 2025. Lloyd is also responsible for a new production of Waiting for Godot in New York, which similarly has almost nothing on the stage for the actors to interact with. At least there, it’s kind of warranted.I was one of the only people who walked out of Evita with a sour look on my face. The orgasmic rapture of the surrounding crowd made me feel like an old fool, desperate for ball gowns and flimsy plywood buildings. But what troubled me was the realization that this aesthetic isn’t an outlier, it’s the unquestioned norm. Less is considered more. Being “tacky” is seen as the greatest imaginable sin. Odd, considering who’s the president of the United States and whathe’s done to the White House, but maybe that’s the origin of all this cold minimalism. To be spare and quiet is to be the opposite of all that golden grotesquerie. Minimalism is the new status symbol of the upwardly mobile. Interior design is overrun withcold, Scandinavian influences. The art direction ofHBO’s Successionwas a window into the tactile expression of iciness that defines the modern-day uber-rich. It leaves me feeling hollow, and as alone as I was in my parents’ computer room.Minimalism is a means of control, a way to assert dominance over the physical space – rooms unsullied by thought, risk or humor. Minimalism’s iron grip on reality is not honest or articulate. It’s a manifestation of a world that is actually out of control. TheiPhonescreams chaos at us, but it looks clean and perfect. It’s the ideal delivery device for madness, because it seems so restrained on the outside.Evita is a bloody tale of revolution and propaganda and authoritarianism. Staging it like Elvis’s Las Vegas residency in the 1970s wipes all of that out. Without the culturally specific or historically significant aesthetic touches, it robs the story of anything that truly makes it a story at all. It’s like being trapped in an empty room with a flashmob or a roving band of Santacon drunks. Minimalism sells us the notion that we can be masters of our environment, but the truth is, we have never had less control over our destiny.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsDesignOpinioniPhoneAppleSmartphonesMobile phonescommentShareReuse this content"

And the gains from property are in part due to their astute eye for a bargain and dedication to upgrading their homes, making them more desirable and expensive to buy.For the rest of society, this plea rings hollow. If they worked hard, it was never so diligently or productively that it paid for a 30-year retirement.Of the misconceptions that pensioners and early retirees are prone to believe, the one about pension investments being a fund, amassed over time and drawn on as an income in later life is one of the most widespread.The phrase pension pot fuels this line of thinking, presenting savers with the image of cash piled high in a huge bank vault, ready to be dispensed every month to its owners. But a pension depends on its investments rising in value and paying an income. This, in turn, depends on today’s private-sector workers being competitive in a global marketplace and successful at continually winning new business and innovating to stay ahead of rivals.Employers are encouraged by their owners – which could be pension funds or more likely, private equity firms using pension fund money – to pay dividends at the expense of research and development. These employers restrict pay rises and cut hard won terms and conditions to increase profits and raise their share price, hitting younger workers the hardest.If pension investments are in government bonds, then retirees are complicit in charging governments high interest rates for their borrowing. This is borrowing that is largely needed to fund a health service and pension payments for the benefit of retirees.Pension savers are alsosubsidised by the taxpayers to the tune of more than £50bn a year. And many boomers will have gained the most, enjoying a 40% supplement to their monthly savings by at some point being a higher rate taxpayer.In this way one could consider the personal retirement savings of a pensioner – and the determination of fund managers to increase returns at any cost – to be a blight on the nation and a tax on the younger generation.Reeves’s £50bn problem solved: stop giving it away in pension tax relief | Phillip InmanRead moreIn the property game, another myth dominates. Baby boomers believe they have made huge gains by virtue of their own decision-making, whether by extending the property or by choosing to buy their home or homes in desirable parts of the country, whether in cities, fashionable suburbs or coastal towns.What is desirable is determined by many factors with home improvements being the least significant. The most significant rise in land values – in places where homes already exist – follows significant investment by the state in local amenities, transport, improving schools and cutting crime.So it is clear that property and pension investing involves a massive transfer from younger people and renters to older homeowners.This argument has been made many times by organisations like Generation Rent and the Intergenerational Foundation, a research charity, but few want to join the campaign.As in France, where people riot to protect their unaffordable pensions, the campaigning goes in the opposite direction.Reeves could sweeten the pill by imposing taxes on the ultra-rich to add to the sense of fairness.Yet they can prove elusive, meaning only middle-income boomers and their wealth can increase the Treasury’s coffers significantly enough to close the state funding gap.Boomers will say the chancellor is reneging on longstanding guarantees to savers and homeowners. The German builder, his elderly friend and their wives, who were considered by the court to be complicit in the financial adviser’s kidnap, all thought the same before the financial crash wiped them out financially.They thought a generous retirement was their right when all around them were losing their jobs or seeing their living standards fall. British boomers should avoid thinking the same way.Explore more on these topicsOlder peopleViewpoint columnEconomic policyEconomicsRachel ReevesPensionsSavingsHousingcommentShareReuse this content"

The NGO is one of the most active and respected bodies working on the Middle East in the British parliament. It promotes conflict resolution, human rights and civil society.The purpose of my visit, alongside my parliamentary colleague Simon Opher, a doctor like me, was to begin to understand the state of healthcare for Palestinians in theWest Bank. Unfortunately, we never set foot in Israel, let alone visited any hospitals in the occupied territories.Instead, all I was permitted to see was the no man’s land of the Sheikh Hussein border crossing, the Jordan river reduced to a trickle. As I waited while the border officials made up their minds about me, I finished off the one thing I’d brought with me to eat – a small bag of KP nuts – and reflected on how lowIsraelhas been brought by its current government and how much it has changed, almost beyond recognition.It’s not the first time that Israel has denied British parliamentarians entry – a similar fate befell two of my colleaguesin April. I don’t defend their removal from Israel for a moment, but my removal is different.View image in fullscreenBritish MPs Peter Prinsley (left) and Simon Opher in Jordan earlier this week.Photograph: Peter PrinsleyIt represents the extent to which the Israeli governmenthas isolated itself. It saddens me to say that Israel today seems to be a world away from the inclusive, pluralistic, open and democratic principles on which it was founded in 1948.I am Jewish, one of just a dozen or so Jewish members of the House of Commons. I visited Israel for the first time as an idealistic medical student and have since returned for happy holidays, visiting family who live there. I am a member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and a committed supporter of my local synagogue.The official Israeli document denying my entry cited “public security or public safety or public order considerations”, without providing any explanation as to how I, a 67-year-old former ear, nose and throat surgeon from Suffolk, might pose any threat at all.I decided to join the delegation because it would have given me an opportunity to talk to doctors, patients and medical charities on the ground, and expand my knowledge of the horrendous events in the Middle East and how it is affectingmedical facilities, medics and the patients they treat. As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to be as informed as possible.We have had months of devastating images broadcast nightly on our TV screens as thehumanitarian catastrophein Gaza unfolds.

Now, I know you can’t speak truth to power if power controls your wordsSat 20 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 09.39 EDTShareThe BBC I joined on my first day of professional journalism – 40 years ago this week – is unrecognisable today. While, for most of its history, the corporation had largelydefended the status quo, under the director general at the time, Alasdair Milne, its journalists were sometimes allowed to stick it to power. This, I believe, is what journalism exists to do – and seldom does.As a student, I’d hammered on the doors of the BBC’s Natural History Unit, insisting there was a major gap in its coverage: investigative environmental reporting. If they took me on, I argued, I could help them fill it. The phone rang as I was leaving the house for one of my final exams. It was the head of the unit, saying: “You’re so fucking persistent you’ve got the job.”My immediate boss, the head of radio, instructed me to “get the bastards”. Investigative journalists were much freer then. It was easier to obtain permission to set up a fake company, pose as a buyer and penetrate criminal networks and unethical corporations.We broke some big stories. On one occasion, we amassed powerful evidence to suggest that a ship leaking oil on a sensitive coastline had been deliberately scuppered. That programme won a Sony award. On another, I had the head of customs in Abidjan, in Ivory Coast, offering to sell me chimpanzees for experiments. It was gripping and felt meaningful: we could see the difference we made. This was all I ever wanted to do, and I thought I was set up for life.On 29 January 1987, disaster struck. The BBC’s investigations had infuriated the Thatcher government, particularly theSecret Societyseries, which had exposed clandestine decision-making, and the Panorama programme Maggie’s Militant Tendency, alleging far-right views among senior Conservatives (which they denied). The BBC boardforced the resignationof Alasdair Milne. The following day, when my boss came into the office, he told me: “That’s it. No more investigative journalism.” How can you have journalism if it’s not investigative, I countered. “Don’t tellmethat. It’s come from the top.”It wasn’t just my career that hit the buffers: it was my worldview. I had naively believed that humanity’s problem was an information deficit. Shine a light and change would follow. Now, I began to see, while the pen might be mightier than the sword, the wallet is mightier than the pen.View image in fullscreenGeorge Monbiot being painted for a ceremony by Arara people in the Brazilian Amazon in the mid-1990s.Photograph: George MonbiotI was recruited at the tail end of the“great compression”: a period of radicallylower inequality. The two world wars had destroyed much of the politicalpower of capital, enabling high taxation of the very rich, the creation of a welfare state and a widening spectrum of politics and opinion. Since then, as the money and power of the very rich have multiplied once more, the governments they support have sought tocrush dissent. The process is accelerating, as thesuspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s showandexclusion of ABCfrom Trump’s press conference in the UK suggest.When Milne was sacked, I had been working on our biggest investigation yet: into the transmigration programme in Indonesia run by the Suharto dictatorship – and funded by the World Bank and, indirectly, the UK and US governments. The policy involved moving hundreds of thousands of people to the country’s outer islands, to displace and corral local populations. It was a brutal, ecocidal and, in West Papua, genocidal scheme. I sold the story to a publisher instead. But I felt unready, so I took a six-month job producing current affairs at the BBC World Service. It was an excellent schooling in global politics, but I realised I could never thrive in a newsroom. On a slow news day, we were debating the lead for our programme among several dull options. Ten minutes before transmission, the editor strode into the studio, clapped his hands and announced: “Great – 110 dead in Sri Lanka!”I spent the next six years working freelance in the tropics, investigating some extremely dangerous stories, scraping a living by writing books and making occasional radio programmes. When I returned, I found the BBC and other broadcasters had become furiously hostile to environmental programming. I decided to try print.I entertained another crazily naive belief: that I should work only for the rightwing press, reaching people who would otherwise never see such stories. I managed to place a couple of articles in the Telegraph, though they were severely trimmed and relegated to the back pages. I knew a sympathetic junior editor at the Daily Mail, who commissioned me, across three years, to write 21 articles. All but one were spiked by her seniors. Finally, I had one published, on the impacts of car pollution. Discussing my proposal, an editor had asked me: “So what’s the solution? More research?” No, I answered, “stronger regulation”. Reading the published article, I discovered that the solution was “more research”.I finally saw the bleeding obvious: you cannot speak truth to power if power controls your words. I was lucky to be taken on by the Guardian. It remains among the very few mainstream outlets, anywhere, in which you can freely criticise the real elite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was shocked to discover how far things have gone. The Telegraph columnist Tim Stanley “argued” that the media can’t be predominantly rightwing, because GB News says it has been “captured by the loony left”. The rightwinger Inaya Folarin Iman called the idea that billionaires influence the media they own a “grand conspiracy” and “false consciousness”. Such people are now so dominant that they no longer even have to make sense.Power is the rock on which truth founders. It will always find willing enforcers: no one ever lost money by telling billionaires what they want to hear. The mainstream media, with a few exceptions, is a single-issue lobby group, whose purpose is to assert the rights of capital.But perhaps the ground is shifting. Citizen journalism is flowering, through theBylines network,openDemocracy,Double Down News,Novara,DeclassifiedandDeSmog, and in particular at the local level. Most established local newspapers are a graveyard of good journalism. But they’re being pushed aside by innovative new outlets, such as theBristol Cable,Glasgow’s Bell,View Digitalin Belfast,Manchester’s Mill, theLeicester Gazette,West Country Voices,Birmingham’s Dispatch, theOxford Clarion, theHastings Independent, theWaltham Forest Echo,Inside Croydon, theSheffield Tribuneand theLiverpool Post.Something is stirring; something that could become very big – a citizens’ revolt against the propaganda of power.

But we don’t have a language to discuss what great beauty can feel like for menSat 20 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 10.42 EDTShareRobert Redford, whodied this weekat the age of 89, was, as well as being one of Hollywood’s brightest stars both in front of and behind the camera, graced with “all-American good looks [that] couldn’t be ignored” as theBBC wrote. Breaking through in the “new Hollywood” era, his luscious blond curls, defined jawline and gentle, charming smile provided him the typical pretty-boy advantages that beauty offers for a career in entertainment, though his talent and zest for acting pushed him further still.It was his role as the gunslinging, sharpshootingSundance Kidin 1969, alongside the more established Paul Newman, which propelled him to fame – though the film’s creator, William Goldman, haddismissed Redfordas “just another California blond … throw a stick at Malibu, you’ll hit six of him”. Yet what comes through about Redford in the commentary and obituaries following his death is this sense that he transcended his beauty; that he defied the blank California Ken doll archetype to become genuinely prodigious within US cinema.It is then easy to understand why Redford appeared to undermine his own beauty and reject his status as a sex symbol. In the way he presented himself he did little to undo the perception of him as a symbol of male elegance: indeed, a Financial Times piece abouthis incredible style– published, incidentally, the day before his death – evidences that he was active in the selection of fine tailoring. But beauty was still something of a prison. In an interview with the New York Times in 1974, Redford stated that “this glamour image can be a real handicap. Image is crap”, and he was repeatedly disdainful of the fact that his appearance often prevented him from being taken more seriously.ANew Statesman piecebizarrely laments that Redford represented the last of a tradition of male “beauties we could count on”, seemingly because such beautiful men were an embodiment of virtue and trust. And there is aTelegraph pieceby Joan Bakewell, who interviewed him in the 1970s and writes that “he was … good looking, but he took his job as a film star seriously”, as though it is remarkable or contradictory for a beautiful person to care about anything other than their face. There is this strange tendency to pit beauty against other qualities – as though a person is a balance sheet, and a better face must mean less talent or brains. But when do we ever observe this in our real lives? Think of the beautiful people you know and think of everything else they can do. Why is the fact that beauty is one quality among many something that people must always strive to prove, when we all simply know it to be true?It is not that there has been a shortage of coverage of Redford’s achievements in Hollywood, from his dexterous performances and his advocacy ofindependent cinemato his Sundance film festival; nor of hisenvironmentalismor championing ofNative AmericanandLGBTQ+ rights. But such consistent emphasis on beauty goes against the kind of figure Redford attempted to be throughout his career. He refused to be typecast as a “pretty boy”, preferring more substantial and challenging work, such as portraying a journalist investigating the Watergate scandal in All the President’s Men. He even initiallyturned down the roleas Barbra Streisand’s Waspy romantic interest in The Way We Were, only agreeing once the character was transformed from “a Ken doll with no dimension” to something more flawed and complex.View image in fullscreenR&B singer D’Angelo’s talent was eclipsed by the sex symbol status conferred on him.Photograph: Gregory HarrisI think this matters not only in framing how we remember Redford, but because discussions about male beauty and how society interacts with it feel continually underdeveloped. Sociologically, we have sex symbols, of any gender, as a litmus test for a narrow set of societal beauty standards and to commission images that can further certain media and commercial projects – that is, sex sells. But I think there is also a vulnerability implicit in the idea of a sex symbol or an emblem of beauty; because as much as they may be admired, envied or lusted after, they are also a source of relief. Possessing such beauty can be viewed as a fantasy or a distant goal, the burden of another person that we can enjoy without being involved in it, even if that means emphasising it where the person has not invited it.The burden of being a sex symbol has been significantly more consequential for famous women – the scrutiny, tragedy and objectification faced by the likes ofPamela Anderson, Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield are well understood. But I do wonder also what it feels like for beautiful men – many of whom, like Redford, have evidently expressed a discomfort and even rejection of the fascination with their beauty and their own sexualisation.Assumptions about the conquest of heterosexual male sexuality – that the attractiveness opens your access to women – might make you feel that no man would ever be uncomfortable with the attention his looks receive. And yet actors such asKeanu ReevesandSterling K Brownhave actively sought to distance themselves from their sex symbol status, particularly where – as with Redford – it has undermined being taken seriously.Robert Redford: the incandescently handsome star who changed Hollywood foreverRead moreI remember Brown’s Emmy-nominated turn in the hit political thriller Paradise being reduced on my social media timelines to ashower sex scene, which was circulated in praise of his muscular back and behind. Years before that, Jesse Williams, whose sex symbol status was cemented by topless scenes in Grey’s Anatomy, expressed his disappointment when audience members at a Broadway performance he was in filmed a nude scene –and spread it online.Sex and beauty have their place in art – and have certainly helped these men’s careers. Yet it is not the sum of them. It can lead men to a darker place, too. The neo-soul singer D’Angelo, a disciple of Prince, has exceptional musical talent, dulcet vocals and a mastery of multiple instruments. Yet that talent was obscured and eclipsed by the sex symbol status that was conferred on him after his music video for Untitled (How Does It Feel), in which heappears naked and writhing, and which was credited with the sexual awakening of many a millennial woman and gay man. This inability to cement himself as a soul legend because of the trappings of beauty profoundly affected D’Angelo – he took an 11-year hiatus from music and struggled with addiction, as hetold GQin 2012. Predictably, when D’Angelo resurfaced not as buff and chiselled, the commentary on his weight gain and appearancewas cruel.None of this is to say that male beauty, like all beauty, cannot be celebrated. But it feels as though we don’t have a language or real understanding of what great beauty can feel like for men. And where they do express it, or distance themselves from it, we insist on bringing them right back to those confines. Redford knew he was a beautiful man, but he would not countenance his looks being obsessed over even in death. Why is it that we can’t help ourselves but to continue?Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

But half-hearted word salad won’t stop the rise of hateSat 20 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 02.01 EDTShareIdon’t mind committing to record that I am a fan of Coldplay. A Rush of Blood to the Head, Parachutes andViva La Vida …are legitimately good albums. And Fix You remains a tearjerker despite decades of overuse in medical dramas.Yet, if your taste is better than mine, you may not know thatthey’re on tour. On my Instagram stories, at least, there has been a conspicuous absence of Coldplay posts, compared to the wall-to-wall coverage of the Oasis reunion shows (though I’m not convinced Oasis have more good songs in their catalogue).When I attended last week, the stalls were packed with perhaps the most diverse and global crowd I’ve ever seen. Even the haters – not that there were any present – would have to admitColdplayput on a dazzling show, with 3D special effects and guest performers, including Fela Kuti’s son Femi, Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna and an entire orchestra from Venezuela. In some ways it was a triumph of technology and globalisation, but as a platform, I couldn’t help feeling it was squandered.Such was Chris Martin’s eagerness to preach peace, love and tolerance from the stage that he overshot it a bit, entreating us to direct our good feeling “to Ukraine … and Russia, Palestine … and Israel” and everywhere else besides. Well – sure. People aren’t their governments, and there’s suffering everywhere. But in those conflicts, suffering is not evenly proportioned. Elyanna sang Coldplay’s single We Pray with palpable emotion. I wondered: what would she have said if she’d expressed herself more?Similarly, on Friday at Wembley, the closing night of the tour, Martin exhorted the crowd to “send love anywhere you wanna send it in the world”. He went on: “You can send it to Charlie Kirk’s family. You can send it to anybody’s family. You can send it to people you disagree with but you send them love anyway.” It is this lack of a definitive statement, along with the barely there acknowledgment of how genuinely divisive these issues and events are, that rendered his warm-fuzzy sentiments hollow even by stadium-rock standards, like a Christian music concert with zero mention of God.Perhaps this really is as deep as his engagement goes: you don’t get to 10 studio albums and more than 20 years of world-dominating success by being a firebrand. And, maybe controversially, I don’t believe artists are obliged to speak out about politics: it’s generally neither edifying nor productive for the cause when they weigh in half-heartedly with word salad.When the 1975’s Matty Healy paused theirotherwise brilliant headline set at Glastonburyto elaborate banally on their “conscious decision” to eschew politics in favour of “love and friendship”, it struck a bum note for me in the crowd. No fan of the 1975 needs or expects Healy’s hazy expansions – why stop the show to saynothing?Many artists, notably young women, do consistently address the conflict in Palestine and other struggles – Chappell Roan, Renée Rapp, Jade Thirlwall among them. Whether this reflects the higher standards placed on women in the public eye, the pressures of their politically engaged young fans or the fact that they are genuinely invested is up for debate; their frequent eloquence, and fearless references to genocide, suggests the last. But their powers of influence are limited: girls and young women are a formidable economic force, but less influential politically.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we must not rewrite his life | Moira DoneganRead moreColdplay, on the other hand, are middle Britain. I’m willing to bet that there will have been a far greater proportion of Tory – and no doubt Reform – voters at Wembley than the other gigs I’ve attended this year. Only by the most creative interpretations of peace, love and understanding can either party be said to stand for them (loving the St George flag, maybe?). What would it mean, I wondered, for Martin to say: “And, while we’re at it, don’t vote for Nigel Farage”?Maybe nothing. After all, Charli xcx’s “Kamala IS brat” and Swift’s “childless cat lady” endorsement didn’t get Harris over the line. And relative to many acts, Coldplay already do a lot of good – albeit for uncontroversial causes – as laid out on screens before the show:funding small music venues,cleaning up oceans, rewilding forests,generating clean energy. That’s not nothing – for their beneficiaries, it’s doubtless transformative. Though with the ongoing threat of the climate crisis, these appeals somewhat amount to an understatement of reality.Nobody should expect political salvation from pop stars – especially Coldplay. To give the Peep Show quote routinely parroted at Coldplay fans: “People like Coldplay and voted for the Nazis – you can’t trust people.” For now, the former group outnumbers the latter, but hatred is doubtless figuring more prominently in global political movements, and it is not placated or stalled by vague appeals to love. So perhaps it wouldn’t hurt for more artists to take a clear, well-defined stand, rather than aim for palatability and maximum consensus.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsColdplayOpinionPop and rockPalestinian territoriesThe 1975Middle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

In the US, the calls for a crackdown have already begunSat 20 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 12.31 EDTShareOn the night of 27 February 1933, six days before national elections, the German Reichstag was set on fire. Firefighters and police discovered a Dutch communist named Marinus van der Lubbe at the scene, who confessed to being the arsonist. The Nazi Reichstag president, Hermann Göring, soon arrived, followed by the future propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and Adolf Hitler, who had been dining together.Two competing, still unresolved, conspiracy theories would circulate about the real culprit: the Nazis, with van der Lubbe as front; or a communist cabal. But the three men had no doubts. Göring pronounced the crime a communist plot. Hitler called it “a God-given signal”, adding: “If this fire, as I believe, is the work of the communists, then we must crush out this murderous pest with an iron fist.”On 10 September 2025, within minutes of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, before a suspect or a motive had been identified, acacophony of voices– from neo-Nazi influencers to Republican members of Congress – were blaming the left for the murder of the hugely effective far-right political organizer.Donald Trumpamplified the indictments. “Radical left … rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now,” he said, in atelevised addressfrom the Oval Office that night, pointedly omitting examples of violence against progressives or Democrats.IsKirk’s assassinationTrump’s Reichstag fire?There are major differences between Germany in 1933 and the US in 2025. Germany’s democracy was but 14 years old at the time. Created amid the privation of the postwar depression and attended by popular ressentiment at the country’s defeat, the Weimar Republic was unstable from the start. And simultaneously, out of those same conditions, the Nazi movement was born and gained strength.Hitler’s attempted coup d’etat of 1923 – the beer hall putsch – failed but brought him national attention. During what the Nazis called the “time of struggle”between 1925 and 1932, stormtroopers and assorted thugs committed nearly continual acts of terrorism and violence toward political foes. Jews, and other minorities. The conflagration of 27 February 1933 burst from tinder ready to combust.By contrast, US democracy is nearly a quarter of a millennium old. It has weathered division, corruption, and violence – and, in many instances, stood stronger, better governed, and more just in their aftermath. Today – despite attacks on the press, boldly partisan gerrymandering, police brutality against peaceful protests, and the rightward lurch of the judiciary – Americans still have civil liberties, however frayed and endangered. That is more than Germans had after the Reichstag fire. But it is becoming clearer that, without widespread popular resistance, it will not stay that way.Important differences notwithstanding, this moment in the US contains many parallels with what happened in Germany over 90 years ago. American history is full of injustice and repression – from the dispossession of Indigenous people’s lands to the permanently heightened surveillance of everyday life since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But the scale and scope of Trump’s assaults on democracy are unprecedented. We need to learn from the past to recognize how dangerous a moment we are in, and where we might be going.Within hours of the Reichstag fire, German president Paul von Hindenburg signed an emergency decree “for the protection of people and state” that snuffed out civil liberties, including the freedoms of speech, association, and the press and the rights of due process.A massive repressionensued, including thousands of arrests of communists and Social Democrats, trade unionists, and intellectuals on a list compiled by the paramilitary Sturmabteilung (stormtroopers or SA). The first night, 4,000 people were taken to SA barracks and tortured. The violence did not let up.On 23 March 1933, with almost all opposition members prevented from taking their seats, the Reichstag passed the statutory partner of the 28 February decree, theEnabling Act,which permanently suspended civil liberties and assigned all legislative power to Hitler and his ministers. Just weeks later, the first concentration camp, Dachau, opened. Accelerated by the blaze in Berlin, German democracy was reduced to ashes.Now theTrump administrationis using Kirk’s assassination, as the Nazis used the fire in Berlin, to instigate its own massive repression. Trump has not blocked Democrats from taking their seats in Congress nor arrested opposition members en masse yet. But he is using the instruments of government to bring to heel anyone who speaks the mildest ill of him or his friends.In just the last few days, the FCC chair threatened Disney, ABC and its affiliates with punitive action if they did not cancel Jimmy Kimmel Live after the host made a joke in which he implied that Kirk’s killer was one of the “Maga gang”. The companies caved and Kimmel’s show was indefinitely suspended. Autocrats are not known for gracefully taking a joke.Assigning blame for Kirk’s murder on the entire American political left came not just from extreme-right podcasters, influencers and militia leaders. Republican representatives, administration officials, and White House advisers loudly, almost triumphantly, joined the fray.“The Democrats own this,” congresswoman Nancy Mace, of South Carolina, toldNBC News, calling Kirk’s then-unknown killer a “raging left lunatic”.“EVERY DAMN ONE OF YOU WHO CALLED US FASCISTS DID THIS,” Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna posted onX. “You were too busy doping up kids, cutting off their genitals, inciting racial violence by supporting orgs that exploit minorities, protecting criminals … Your words caused this. Your hate caused this.”Laura Loomer, one of Trump’s closest allies,chimed in: “Prepare to have your whole future professional aspirations ruined if you are sick enough to celebrate his death,” she wrote. “I’m going to make you wish you never opened your mouth.”Of course, the bully at the bully pulpit spoke loudest. “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity & to other political violence,” Trump promised, “including the organizations who fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country.”Taking over as host on Kirk’s radio show Monday, JD Vancevowedto “go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence” – which he also called “left-wing lunatics”. Of these, he named the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundations, the latter run by George Soros, the progressive, pro-democracy philanthropist and Jewish Holocaust survivor, who has long been the subject of neo-Nazivitriol. Vance also threatened to investigate the non-profit status of the venerable leftwing publication the Nation.Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff , also on the show,added: “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, homeland security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these [radical left] networks and make America safe again for the American people.”On Tuesday, after Trump was confronted by protesters who chanted “Free DC! Free Palestine! Trump is the Hitler of our time!” in a Washington DC restaurant, deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said on CNN that hemight investigatethem as “part of an organized effort to inflict harm and terror and damage to the United States”.The presidentmore recentlytold reporters he conferred with US attorney general Pam Bondi about bringing federal racketeering charges against these “agitators” and wouldsupportdesignating “antifa” as terrorists.In many senses, the crackdown on dissent has been under way for months. Trump began his second term implementing the Heritage Foundation’sProject Esther, punishing professors, students, whole college departments, and anyone accused of “antisemitism”– defined as criticism of Israel – with names supplied by Zionistinformants. The witch-hunt is expanding.All of this, along with Trump’s earlier moves, recall senator Joseph McCarthy’s crusade against communists and other alleged subversives in the 1950s. McCarthy instituted loyalty oaths for government workers, and many states followed suit. Failure to sign meant resignation or firing. In June, a plan to test potential federal employees for fidelity to Trump’s mission wasdroppedafter criticism, but employees and higher officials have since then been regularly fired for failure to demonstrate it, or just for telling a truth inconvenient to the president. The FBI director, Kash Patel, published alist of traitorous “deep state” figuresand has alreadypunisheda third of them. He denies it is an “enemies list”, referring to the list McCarthy claimed to have.The president hastoyed with invokingthe Insurrection Act amid protests against immigrant roundups. He has declared a spectral“crime emergency”as apretextto send troops into Washington DC and other cities, andorderedthe formation of a federal “quick response force” for “quelling civil disturbances”. He has deputized Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to terrorize and brutalize brown, Spanish-speaking people its agents assume to be undocumented immigrants, a policy of racial profiling and a violation of the fourth amendment against illegal search and seizure, which the US supreme court has allowed.Before the National Socialists became Germany’s one, murderous ruling party, Nazism wasa popular movement. But movements and parties are not separate entities, and governments need to mobilize consent – or squash opposition – to survive. Our lawless government supports and is supported by a lawless movement. “It is shocking how day after day, naked acts of violence, breaches of the law, barbaric opinions appeal quite undisguised as official decree,” the German Jewish philologist and diarist Victor Klempererwroteon 17 March 1933. The same could describe the US under Trump.The criminal president has criminals at his back. One of the provisions of the Enabling Act was a grant of amnesty to anyone who had committed a crime “for the good of the Reich during the Weimar Republic”.“He who saves his country does not violate the law,” Trumpposted, quoting Napoleon a few weeks afterpardoningall the January 6 rioters, including those who had assaulted and killed police officers. “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,” he said in a 2016 presidential debate. He is now hinting that it’s time for them to act.The challenges are enormous. But in addition to the resilience and longevity of US democracy, there are reasons to hope that a resistance movement can survive and win this time around.Repression is quickly metastasizing. But the same social media that polarize opinion, spread disinformation, and abet government surveillance enable political organizing, foil censorship and substantiate truth, and link global networks to elude repressive laws, such as the feminist cells distributing abortion pills into red states.The country seems hopelessly divided. Yet the same federalism that gives the states the right to gerrymander and enact undemocratic legislation is useful to states that are intent on governing well, providing for their residents and sheltering them from the abuses of Washington.The Democrats in Washington are clueless, but local progressive candidates are winning elections. Law firms and major media companies are surrendering to Trump’s extortion without a fight. But the ACLU still exists, as do independent news outlets.And try as Trump may to erase America’s histories of oppression and of the liberation movements against it, they are not forgotten. We know what capitulation and passivity lead to and what the struggles for peace and justice can ultimately achieve. It is easy to feel defeated, but we cannot give up now.Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

Runkles has since been released on bond,” Arizona DPS said, ABCreports.A spokesperson for Turning Point USA, which Kirk founded, later told Fox News that Runkles had been doing “advance security for a known guest” but that it wasn’t properly coordinated with Turning Point or the US Secret Service, which is securing the event because Donald Trump and JD Vance are among the scheduled speakers. “We do not believe this person was attempting anything nefarious,” the spokesperson reportedly said.Earlier on Saturday, the US Secret Service said that it was coordinating with local law enforcement in Glendale, Arizona, to investigate “an individual who was observed exhibiting suspicious behavior at State Farm Stadium”.“The individual was approached by Secret Service and stated during the encounter that he was a member of law enforcement and that he was armed. The individual is not a member of authorized law enforcement working the event and is currently in custody,” the Secret Service said.Runkles was armed with at least one gun and one knife when he was stopped, according to a law enforcement official whospoketo the Washington Post. The official added that Runkles had presented “inactive law enforcement credentials” and informed the Secret Service that he was there to provide private security.Sunday’s memorial service for Kirk is expected to draw up to 100,000 attendees to Glendale, where Turning Point USA is based.

It was the first time the justice department said it was bringing a capital case after Donald Trump’s second presidency began in January with a pledge to revive federal executions, which his predecessor Biden had put on hold.Mangione’s lawyers argue that Bondi’s announcement – which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance – showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit” and, they said, her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.Trump, who oversaw an unprecedented run of 13 executions at the end of his first presidency, offered his own opinions about Mangione on Thursday – despite court rules that prohibit any pretrial publicity that could interfere with a defendant’s right to a fair trial.“Think about Mangione. He shot someone in the back, as clear as you’re looking at me or I’m looking at you. He shot – he looked like a pure assassin,” Trump told Fox News.“There is a high bar to dismissing an indictment due to pretrial publicity,” Mangione’s lawyers wrote in their 114-page filing. “However, there has never been a situation remotely like this one where prejudice has been so great against a death-eligible defendant.”Federal prosecutors have until 31 October to respond. Mangione is due back in court in the federal case on 5 December, days after the start of pretrial hearings in his state case. No trial date has been set for either case.Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges.Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson, 50, from behind on 4 December 2024 as he arrived to a Manhattan hotel for his company’s annual investor conference. Police say “delay”, “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.Mangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (370km) west of Manhattan. Authorities say he had a 9mm handgun and a notebook describing his intent to “wack” an insurance executive.Mangione’s lawyers contend the simultaneous prosecutions amount to double jeopardy.In the federal case, Mangione is charged with murder through use of a firearm, which carries the possibility of the death penalty, as well as stalking and gun offenses.On Tuesday, the judge in his state case threw out terrorism charges that carried the possibility of a mandatory life sentence without parole. But judge Gregory Carro rejected the defense’s request to dismiss the state prosecution entirely, saying the double jeopardy argument is premature because neither case has gone to trial or resulted in a guilty plea.The state case will proceed with other charges, including an intentional murder count that carries a potential punishment of 15 years to life in prison, with the possibility of parole. Unlike the federal system, New York does not have the death penalty.Mangione has attracted a cult following as a stand-in for frustrations with the health insurance industry.A few dozen supporters – mostly women – packed three rows in the rear of the courtroom gallery at his hearing Tuesday in state court. Some wore green, the color of the Mario Bros video game character Luigi, and one woman sported a “FREE LUIGI” T-shirt.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The official exchanges, spanning June and July, show the extent of concern that recent racial violence could escalate into a much graver outbreak.Immigrants have trickled into Northern Ireland since the 1998 Good Friday agreement but ethnic minorities still account for just 3.4% of the population, far below the rest of the UK. Even so, a campaign ofvandalism and intimidationhas for years targeted non-white families, especially in loyalist areas of County Antrim.Riots in England in July 2024spread to Belfast, where mobs targeted foreign-owned businesses. Ballymena erupted in June this year when mobsattacked the homes of Roma familiesand other foreigners. Avigilante groupin east Belfast that styles itself the Belfast Nightwatch First Division challenges dark-skinned males to produce identity documents. Copycat groups have reportedly spread to other parts of the city.The Stormont documents show how officials are bracing for more crises. “Support centre locations cannot be shared,” said one Department of Communities official in June after masked men torched a leisure centre in Larne that had sheltered families displaced from Ballymena.Council staff organising emergency accommodation faced intimidation, the official wrote. “These concerns could reduce the ability to open centres due to staff fears – realistically (my view) secure MoD sites might be only option.” The riots subsided in mid-June, averting the need for Ministry of Defence sites.Officials struggled to keep track of people “decanted” from certain areas, especially those who went “off-grid”, raising concerns that children were missing school. Unaccompanied asylum seeker children in the care of health trusts were told to lock doors and windows, to keep their phones charged and other security measures.British and Irish governments to present new Troubles legacy proposalsRead moreA spokesperson for Stormont’s executive office said authorities had established a strategic coordination group and recovery coordination group for a “joined up” effort to improve community relations and mitigate the risk of further unrest. “Work to tackle racism and hate is a key part of our wider good relations work to build a more inclusive place for everyone.”Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland director, said the documents showed the “terrifying impact” of racist violence. “The likelihood of more racist violence seems certain. What is less clear is whether the Northern Ireland authorities are ready to step up to keep people safe.”Geraldine Hanna, the Northern Ireland Commissioner for victims of crime, said the displacement of vulnerable people, especially children, was deeply distressing and required urgent action. “The events in August 2024 and June 2025 were not isolated incidents but part of a disturbing pattern of violence and intimidation that has left many victims traumatised and entire communities living in fear.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He died on Friday in Glasgow’s Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, his DJ partner Jonnie Wilkes (AKA JG Wilkes)announced.“In a 28 year partnership he changed my life immeasurably and together we took our work in directions and to places few people are lucky enough to explore,” Wilkes said. “I am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend.”McIvor grew up in Edinburgh in a family who “had the most middle of the road, blandest music taste imaginable”, he later said, but after moving to Glasgow to go to university in 1986 he became involved in club culture across both cities.He began DJing electro and EBM (electronic body music) at a club night in Edinburgh, graduating to house and techno as those styles reached the UK and the acid house era began. The night was shut down by police after a brawl between football hooligans, but McIvor began a new night called Pure with the blessing of the authorities by making it a members only event. “It gave us the chance to start again from scratch and do a club 100% on our own terms,” he said. “Out went anything to do with all the awful Madchester-related music and in came a completely different crowd.”Pure became a core event in the Scottish house and techno scene, but McIvor – who grew to find DJ culture “all pretty boring” – began another event in 1997 that gave voice to the breadth of his catholic taste. Taking its name from the track Optimo by New York punk-funk band Liquid Liquid – which McIvor would go on to remix – the Sunday night event at Glasgow’s Sub Club alongside DJ partner JG Wilkes (Jonnie Wilkes) ran every week until 2010.View image in fullscreenJD Twitch and JG Wilkes, AKA Optimo.Photograph: Sam Kovak/AlamyMcIvor said the pair were not “aligned to any one particular musical movement” – championing electroclash, punk, new wave, soft rock and a range of other styles alongside dance tracks, and hosting bands such as LCD Soundsystem and TV On the Radio as well as guest DJs. Optimo pre-empted the open-mindedness of the internet age, and became lauded as one of the most significant events in global dance culture. Thereafter McIvor and Wilkes continued to DJ internationally under the Optimo name.McIvor was also a producer, and as Optimo’s star rose he was sought after as a remixer for the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Róisín Murphy, Manic Street Preachers, Florence + the Machine and more (“Discogs tells me I did 108 remixes, though it’s probably a few more,” he said in 2023). McIvor also founded the label Optimo Music (plus spin-offs such as the Brazil-focused Selva Discos), and Optimo created acclaimed compilation albums such as How to Kill the DJ (Part Two). McIvor also curated the soundtrack to Beats, a 2019 film set in the 90s rave scene inScotland, and put out music under the alias Tomorrow the Rain Will Fall Upwards.McIvor announced his illness in July 2025, saying: “My symptoms weren’t immediately diagnosed, and my health declined very rapidly over just a few weeks … I am currently trying to process this news and prioritising spending precious time with the people I love.”Wilkes added in his tribute to McIvor: “I am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend. Keith’s intensity and passion for life, for music, for creativity and for positive change simply never let up. He was formidable. His belief in people and the idea that standing together, that our collective strength is powerful was unwavering. I loved him for that.”After thanking hospice staff and others, he added: “Keith left us far too soon. He will go now to travel those space-ways but I know his energy remains in every one of us who had the privilege of knowing him. I love you forever Keith.”Explore more on these topicsDance musicClub cultureElectronic musicScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

We need to find all the levers that are available to us, to see how we can accelerate further.”On Wednesday, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, Stiell and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, will make a final plea to world leaders – excluding Donald Trump, who is snubbing the meeting – to present national plans on the climate, before theCop30 climate summit in Brazil in November. These plans – known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – are required under the Paris agreement, to set out how countries will limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, beyond which the impacts of the climate crisis become catastrophic and irreversible.The deadline for the plans, which cover the next crucial decade of greenhouse gas emissions, was meant to be February this year, but in the midst of Trump taking office and global political upheaval,Stiell extended it to the end of this month. At that point, the UN will assess the NDCs and judge whether they fulfil the Paris aims.Stiell knows the NDCs will fall short of the 1.5C target, as many countries are likely to present inadequate responses. These include the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia, all of which havesought to disrupt recent climate talks. But there are also significant concerns over the plans of other big emitters, such as China and the EU, which outwardly profess commitment to the climate.View image in fullscreenSimon Stiell: ‘We have this perception that we need to solve all aspects of the climate crisis in a single Cop.’Photograph: Bernd Arnold/The GuardianDespiteChina’s roaring successesin the green economy, with renewable energy now generating a quarter of electricity,electric vehicles now taking 50% market shareand booming exports oflow-carbon goods worth $177bn (£131bn) last year, China is widely expected to submit an NDC that is much weaker than it should be, and over-conservative in its estimates of how fast the country can drive down its emissions. This is partly because of Beijing’s perennial desire to underpromise and overdeliver, but also out of caution, faced with the volatility of Trump’s White House.The EU, for decades the champion of climate action, ismired in internal tension among member statesspooked by aseeming backlash from the populist right.The bloc has still not finalised its NDC, and will not meet the end of month deadline, but this week issued a “statement of intent” from ministers for a cut of between 66.25% and 72.5% by 2035, compared with 1990 levels. This is weaker than the 79% or more campaigners had hoped for, and that experts say is possible.Stientje van Veldhoven, regional director for Europe at the World Resources Institute, warned: “Europe’s statement shows scope for progress, but the wide range risks sending a confusing message, eroding investor confidence and undermining jobs, energy security, and competitiveness. The pathway matters: if the EU lands on the lower end of the range, like 66.3%, the final stretch to 90% just five years later will be a steep and uphill climb. That does not provide the long-term policy credibility that investors and companies need.”Australia set out its NDC last week, pledging to cut emissions by 62-70% by 2035. That is also too low, compared to the 75% cut analysts said would be in line with a 1.5C limit, and the failure to agree a full phase-out of fossil fuels angered green groups. Australia is bidding against Turkey to host the Cop31 summit next year.Yet Stiell believesCop30can still be a success, if it can point the way to remedying the shortcomings and investing in the benefits of a green economic transformation.“We know [the NDCs] are going to be softer than what science dictates is needed,” he told the Guardian in an exclusive interview at the UN’s climate headquarters in Bonn. “But it’s about how the real economy picks up those signals. Inadequate as some may think they are, those signals have a significant impact on what’s happening in the real economy.”He pointed to global private sector investments last year of more than $2tn in green energy and low-carbon industry, dwarfing the $1tn poured into fossil fuels. “I see promise, I see action,” he said. “I see tangible output. But not enough.”It is easy to look at the UN’s annual Cops and say nothing happens – in the words of Greta Thunberg,“blah blah blah”. But before the2015 Paris agreement, the world was headed for more than 5C of heating – a level that would leave the world unrecognisable. Ten years later, the projection – if all current commitments are fulfilled – is for 2.7C of heating. That is still far too high, and this year’s NDCs must at least “bend the curve” towards 1.5C, Stiell said, even if they still fall short of meeting it.People should see the Cops as a process, rather than having too high expectations of any single meeting, he believes. “We have this perception that we need to solve all aspects of the climate crisis in a single Cop. We set false expectations that everything needs to be resolved in that given moment.”Stiell also wants the UN to change tack, away from thedire warnings of calamitythat have frequently fallen on deaf ears among governments grappling with economic woes. Instead, he will present concrete examples of how governments such as China have gained access to billions in investment and reaped bumper profits, by turning to clean energy and a green transformation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It doesn’t get into other elements: the economic benefits of taking climate action, and what this means in terms of jobs, food security, water security. What does this mean in terms of better health, better livelihoods? Looking at those opportunities and the economic growth that can be stimulated through strong climate action, and how that impacts economic development and growth.”Countries are also beginning to wake up to the costs of inaction too, he believes. Hikes in the cost of living around the world have been exacerbated by food price rises resulting from extreme weather. Wealthy regions, including areas of the US and the UK, have had homes and businessesbecome uninsurable– an experience that until recently was confined to poorer and vulnerable regions.Climate crisis on track to destroy capitalism, warns top insurerRead moreStiell said: “When those realities that vulnerable countries have been facing for well over a decade now are being translated to the richest and most sophisticated and advanced of economies, you know something is shifting.”The bill for climate damage already runs to hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and is getting higher. Within little more than a decade,costs of more than 5% of GDP a year are likely to bite. “That means significant recession. It speaks of a level of recession that we’ve never seen before [because the damage will continue year on year, rather than abating as conventional economic recessions tend to].”If inflation in the last four years has toppled governments and lost votes for incumbent parties, the effects of the climate crisis on the cost of living will be much more dramatic. Stiell said: “We’ve seen theimpact of the price of eggsand how that was singled out as a barometer of skewed economic policy and mismanagement. Multiply that across every single item that you purchase, the food you eat, the clothes you wear, the vehicle you drive, the cost of heating or cooling your home.”Compared with that, “Covid and the global financial crisis would pale into insignificance”, he said. “Governments who choose to ignore this, financial advisers and economics who chose to ignore this, do so at their peril.”Stiell understands the effects of the climate crisis firsthand. Last year,Hurricane Beryl ripped through his home island of Carriacou, part of Grenada in the Caribbean. The devastation mirrored other events that he has seen in countries around the world. “That burns deep inside of me,” he says. “There’s anger, there’s frustration within that.”His challenge is presenting what is at stake at Cop30, the complexities of the UN process, and the warnings of scientists, in terms that resonate with the global public. Stiell said: “Just raising an alarm is not enough – it has to be rung in a way that translates beyond numbers on a spreadsheet, and is understood by ordinary people, consumers and voters.“But then the flip side is I also see opportunities. I see hope, I see resilience. The grit of humankind is empowering.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsUnited NationsChinaParis climate agreementAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the two circle-shaped scars of dark soil on a Norfolk pasture are ghost ponds being brought back to life by an innovative and cheap form of nature restoration.“It looks awful now. ‘What have they done? It’s a disaster!’” says Carl Sayer, a professor of geography at UCL, who is dancing with glee around the bleak-looking, freshly dug hole. “The colonisation is so quick. Within a year, it is full of water plants. Within two years, it looks like it’s been there forever. It’s a spectacular recovery, and you’re truly recovering ancient assemblages of plants.”View image in fullscreenProf Carl Sayer and team near East Harling, Norfolk. L to R: Prof Helene Burningham, Hayley McMechan, Tim Holt-Wilson, Carl Sayer, Tim Kett, Dan Hoare and Gilbert Addison.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianThe two ponds returning on farmland are the 25th and 26th ice age ponds to be restored by Sayer’s team of academics, volunteers and an enthusiastic digger driver in the Brecks, a hotspot for ancient ponds and “pingos” formed by ice-melt 10,000 years ago.Over the past two centuries, thousands of such ponds have been filled in as land was drained and “improved” for crops.So far, most of the 26 ponds have been revived onland bought by Norfolk Wildlife Trust, which hassupported the restoration effortwith funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund’sBrecks Fen Edge and Rivers landscape partnership scheme.But the latest two ponds have been dug out thanks to a Norfolk farmer, who is one of an increasing number of private landowners reviving ghost and“zombie” ponds.New surveys by Sayer’s team have revealed that 22 of the ghost ponds restored since 2022 now support 136 species of wetland plant. This represents 70% of the wetland flora found in more than 400 ponds on Norfolk Wildlife Trust’sThompson Common, an internationally important nature reserve whose ponds have survived since the ice age.The resurrected ponds include rare species lost from the surviving ponds, such asvarious-leaved pondweed, which is only found on one other site in Norfolk.The magic, Sayer points out, lies in a layer of distinctively dark soil, which his team carefully reveals.View image in fullscreenA member of the team unearths an animal bone from the soil of the former pond’s base.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianThis peat-like sediment is the old bottom of the pond, formed from centuries of decaying aquatic plants, and it is still full of seeds.“It’s a perfect time capsule,” says Sayer. “It’s dark, moist, cool and anoxic – there’s no oxygen. This is nature’s emergency recovery mechanism. We’ve buggered almost everything up but this will still bring them back.”One of the pond restorers, Hayley McMechan, is working on a germination trial for her PhD. Sediment of different antiquities from these ghost ponds is being monitored in tanks at Kew Gardens’ seed bank atWakehurst. It is likely some seeds older than 1,000 years old can still spring to life.“It shows you the resilience of nature – that seeds have evolved to last that long,” says McMechan. “It’s not rewilding, it’s not restoration, it’s resurrection. If you want to recreate a woodland you’ve got to plan it and plant your own trees. Here, a human can’t get it wrong – it’s all ready to go, like an instant cake mix – just add water.”Resurrecting a pond begins with Prof Helene Burningham, a colleague of Sayer’s in the UCL geography department, studying old maps. Many small ponds are missed off maps but old field names sometimes provide clues. Lidar (light detection and ranging) is also used to identify depressions in the land, while satellite imagery can reveal former pond sites which often show up as a circle of green – still having a higher moisture content – during dry summers such as this one.On site, the team start by using an auger to drill down to confirm the bottom of the ghost pond, a soil layer also characterised by white fragments of pond snail shells which have a more pointed whorl than land snails.Then a straight trench is dug to find where the sediment is deepest, which reveals the centre of the pond. “The middle is never where you think it is but careful digging will find the centre and then you work out from there,” says Sayer.A second trench is dug across the first to form a cross of trenches, which helps identify the exact dimensions of the pond.The digger then takes over but it is precision work to create the gently declining natural edges of the pond, rather than steps or shelves, and being careful not to dig below the seed layer.“When we get to the right level we can leave it to Dale the digger driver,” says Sayer. “He is truly brilliant.”View image in fullscreenA member of the team unearths pottery  from the soil of the former pond’s base which they speculate is either of Roman-age or medieval origin.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianDigging out a pond takes a long day but Dale Garnham “absolutely loves” this unusual task. “This is my favourite sort of work, I just hope it really kicks off. On a building site, you dig a hole, put a pipe in and cover it up. So it’s nice to come back here and see what you’ve done and how it progresses.”As Garnham skilfully scrapes off the top soil, volunteers identify treasures beneath. Volunteer Dan Hoare finds a pristine shell of a banded river snail which probably lived in Roman times. Another volunteer identifies a shard of Roman pottery and late neolithic “pot boilers” – charred flints heated in a fire to boil water. “Wetlands were a place where people needed to be,” says Sayer.The only thing they are not pleased to find is an old section of plastic drain. The digger will follow the drain – installed during agricultural improvements in the 1980s – breaking it up. “Any pipes we find are smashed. We don’t want water draining away but we don’t want water to drain in either,” says Sayer.Once the ponds are filled naturally with clean rainwater, they are rapidly colonised. Some sceptics have suggested the plants are not from ancient seeds but are brought in by waterbirds. But Sayer points to not only unique rare plants in the restored ponds not found anywhere nearby but the sheer quantity of new plants. “All this cannot come in so fast on a duck’s bottom,” he says.Despite them not being connected to any other waterways, the ninespine stickleback fish has also rapidly returned to the ghost ponds.“We’ve no idea how it got there. There is no biological mechanism that would do it without a hydrological connection.” Could solving that conundrum be another PhD? “We want a few mysteries like this. Keeps me in a job,” says Sayer.According to Sayer, pond restoration provides a huge nature boost for a modest sum of money, much less than it costs to restore a meadow or ancient woodland.He and his team of volunteers can excavate a pond in a day for about £2,000, with the main expenses being hiring a digger, a dumper and a skilled digger driver.“Landowners are keen to do it– the only barrier is funding,” says Sayer. “Millions go into river restoration but they are so hard to fix. Restoring a pond has a small footprint and a massive impact. So many wetlands have been filled in. You could take what we’re doing here and spread it everywhere.“I’ll never be involved in anything so important. It’s the ecological restoration you dream of.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeConservationEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Corbyn had previously urged people not to use the “supposed membership portal”, and said legal advice was being taken over its launch.Late on Friday evening, Sultana said there had been “baseless attacks on my character [that] are politically motivated”, adding that she intended to “hold to account those responsible for making them. To that end, I have this evening instructed specialist defamation lawyers.”The Coventry South MP claimed several “false and defamatory statements” had been published about her. “The portal was properly launched in accordance with the party’s roadmap. At no point was members’ data misused or put at risk. All funds received from members were ringfenced and protected in the appropriate manner.”Sultana’s statement comes after she previously said she had been subjected to a “sexist boys’ club” amid the row over the membership system.Meanwhile, Corbyn spoke out in defence of a key aide Sultana had named in criticism of the way the party was being run. Speaking at the annual conference of his Peace and Justice Project, Corbyn said: “She has had an awful lot of stick and criticism this week. I just want to say this. I’ve known Karie Murphy for many, many years and I’m appalled when people attack an individual like her.”Noting that it is rare for Corbyn to become personally involved in confrontation – and to publicly name aides – the Times quoted him as saying: “She’d walk on burning coals for a cause that she believes in and I want to say: ‘Thank you, Karie.’”Sultana had previously said: “I do not believe members will accept Karie Murphy and her associates having sole financial control of members’ money and sole constitutional control of our conference. This undermines the democratic principles we agreed to uphold.”On Thursday morning, an invitation went out to supporters of the outfit, so far described as “Your party” in its campaign material, inviting them to officially sign up and give it financial backing.Share your views on the fallout between Corbyn and Sultana over their new party’s membership portalRead moreBut Corbyn described this as an “unauthorised email” and warned people not to sign up using the link, in a statement also signed by the four other independent MPs who have set up an ad-hoc parliamentary group with Corbyn and Sultana.In turn, Sultana said: “After being sidelined by the MPs named in today’s statement and effectively frozen out of the official accounts, I took the step of launching a membership portal so that supporters could continue to engage and organise.”Despite Corbyn’s warning, she said supporters of Your party should “sign up now” as the portal was a “safe, secure, legitimate” means of becoming a member of the party.She added: “My sole motivation has been to safeguard the grassroots involvement that is essential in building this party. Unfortunately, I have been subjected to what can only be described as a sexist boys’ club: I have been treated appallingly and excluded completely.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And she has also reportedly clashed with Adnan Hussain, the independent MP for Blackburn, over their different views on transgender rights.The party appeared to be building momentum, with Sultana claiming more than 750,000 supporters had signed up.Explore more on these topicsZarah SultanaJeremy CorbynnewsShareReuse this content"

I believe this leaves the door open to foreign actors trying to spy on the house,” Hoyle said.“This door must be closed hard. We must pursue all avenues to ensure the protection of members and people that work within the House of Commons. It will not be tolerated.”Cash worked as a parliamentary researcher and was director of theChinaResearch Group. He was closely linked to then senior Tories, including the former security minister Tom Tugendhat and Alicia Kearns.The director of public prosecutions said there was no “outside pressure” influencing the decision to drop the charges.Hoyle’s warning follows remarks made that day, when he said he was a “very unhappy speaker” after being told the case would not go ahead.“Given the very important issues raised by this case, I am asking officials to consider whether any further steps which should be taken, operational, strategic or legal, to ensure that all those who work in this parliament are able to undertake their activities securely and without interference,” Hoyle said.“I am a very unhappy speaker with what’s happened. The fact that for two years, two years, and it’s taken until today for somebody to withdraw this case. That is not good or good enough.”Stephen Parkinson, the chief prosecutor in England and Wales, said he shared “the disappointment, and indeed frustration, expressed by many parliamentarians, as well as members of the public, that this prosecution had to stop”.He said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which he leads, had determined the case had to be stopped because of “an evidential failure”.Cash and Berry had denied allegations that they collected and communicated information that could be “useful to an enemy” between December 2021 and February 2023.On Monday, they found out they no longer faced prosecution as Little told the Old Bailey that the “evidential stage of the case” was “no longer met”.Parkinson said in a letter: “Although I am not in a position to address in detail the reasons that we came to our decision, I think it important to highlight two points stated in court that were not repeated in all sections of the media.“First, prosecution counsel Tom Little KC informed the court that, having kept the case under review, we had determined that the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test (which you will be aware is the requirement that there is a realistic prospect of a conviction).“Accordingly, the reason that this case had to be stopped was due to an evidential failure. It is important that I reiterate that at the time the charging decision was made it concluded, correctly in my view, that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute.”Parkinson noted that securing a conviction would have required proving China was an “enemy” as stated in the Official Secrets Act 1911.The law has since been changed with the National Security Act 2023, which he said “contains more extensive provisions to deal with espionage and those who are acting on behalf of foreign powers”.Explore more on these topicsEspionageChinaCommons speakerHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

The parents were unaware that Meta’s settings permitted it to do this. One mother said her account was set to private, but the posts were automatically cross-posting toThreadswhere they were visible. Another said she posted the picture to a public Instagram account. The posts of their children were highlighted to the stranger as “suggested threads”.The recipient told the Guardian the posts felt “deliberately provocative and ultimately exploitative of the children and families involved”.The father of a 13-year-old who appeared in one of the posts said it was “absolutely outrageous”. The images were all of schoolgirls in short skirts with either bare legs or stockings.“When I found out an image of her has been exploited in what felt like a sexualised way by a massive company like that to market their product it left me feeling quite disgusted,” he said.Meta, the $2tn (£1.5tn) company based in Menlo Park, California, said the images did not violate its policies. It said it recommended people to visit Threads by showing them publicly shared photos that comply with its community standards and recommendation guidelines. Its systems do not recommend Threads shared by teenagers, but these were posts made from adults’ accounts that were set to allow public viewing.The man who received the posts said that as he was only sent promotional posts of schoolgirls – there were no boys in school uniform, for example – there appeared to be “an aspect of sexualisation”.The mother of a 15-year-old whose picture was used in a promotional post that featured a large “Get Threads” button said: “For me it was a picture of my daughter going to school. I had no idea Instagram had picked it up and are using it as a promotion. It’s absolutely disgusting. She is a minor.”She said she would have refused consent and “not for any money in the world would I let them use a girl dressed in a school uniform to get people on to [its platform]”.With 267 followers, her Instagram account usually had modest reach but the post of her child attracted nearly 7,000 views, 90% from non-followers, half of whom were aged over 44 and 90% of whom were men.Another mother whose post of her 13-year-old was used in a promotional post said: “Meta did all of this on purpose, not informing us, as they want to generate content. It’s despicable. And who is responsible for creating that Threads ad using children’s photos to promote the platform for older men?”Meta said it called such posts “recommendation tools” and that public postscould be used for this purpose.A company spokesperson said: “The images shared do not violate our policies and are back-to-school photos posted publicly by parents. We have systems in place to help make sure we don’t recommend Threads shared by teens, or that go against our recommendation guidelines, and users can control whether Meta suggests their public posts on Instagram.”The 37-year-old Instagram user from London who received the posts and asked to remain anonymous said: “Over several days I was repeatedly served Meta adverts for Threads that exclusively featured parents’ images of their daughters in school uniform, some revealing their names. As a father, I find it deeply inappropriate for Meta to repurpose these posts in targeted promotion to adults.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the only reason that they could think it appropriate to send pictures of schoolgirls to a 37-year-old man – as bait – Meta is a wilfully careless company.”She called on the regulator Ofcom to consider if measures, introduced this summer to prevent unknown adults connecting to children, make clear that “companies cannot offer sexualised images of children as bait to unknown men”.Ofcom’s illegal harms codes intended to tackle online groomingrequire that“children’s profiles and locations – as well as friends and connections – should not be visible to other users”.Meta’s system means that if a Threads profile is public, posts on adult profiles may be suggested on Facebook or Instagram “so people can discover, follow, and interact with you”.

If she fails to do so at the budget she will have serious questions to answer over whether events like this one influenced her at all.“To show she cares about taxpayers more than big gambling firms the chancellor should commit to raising taxes on online gambling giants ahead of the budget.”Brunswick said Dugher’s role in the gambling industry was “completely separate” from his work for the public relations firm.The debate over whether to raise taxes on gambling puts Dugher at the centre of a tug of war between leading Labour figures with whom he has longstanding ties.Dugher was formerly a special adviser to Brown, who has called for taxes on online gambling to rise by as much as £3bn to help fund an end to the two-child benefit cap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He will be hosting the event jointly alongside partners from Brunswick’s public affairs team.”The Guardian approached the chancellor for comment.Explore more on these topicsLobbyingRachel ReevesGamblingTax and spendingBudget 2025House of CommonsMichael DughernewsShareReuse this content"

Investigators say they hurled homophobic slurs at the victim, who was attacked on a street near a transit center in Renton and suffered serious injuries.“They chased her, knocked her to the ground, and repeatedly assaulted her,” police said in their statement.Police documents obtained byABCelaborate, recounting how the woman told officers she first encountered the group while telling them to stop “harassing” people at a local transit center. That drew the group’s attention, and they began “charging towards her”, the police documents alleged.She told police she fell and heard someone yell a transphobic slur. As she tried to get up and leave, members of the group began assaulting her, and one of the alleged attackers choked her. The victim reportedly said she believed she was going to die.ABC reported that video of the reported attack – recorded by a witness – showed the group “violently punch and kick the victim” in her head and upper body, including while she was on the ground, according to what police wrote in documents. The group walked away while the woman was on the ground, police said.Police arrested two of the suspects – boys ages 15 and 17 who were siblings – near the scene of the alleged attack soon after it happened.A third boy, 16, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of assault and a hate crime. Police put out a plea on social media to help identify the fourth suspect, posting surveillance pictures of him, taking note of his distinctive facial hair, necklace and jacket. Court filings cited by ABC said officers identified him through his high school campus security team.A family member on the local Crime Stopperschapter’s website recognized the man in the photo and urged him to surrender. Police said that man then turned himself over to police to be booked on counts of assault and a hate crime.Police did not identify the three teen suspects because of their ages. They identified the fourth as 25-year-old Ramodre Edwards.King county prosecutors charged the two sibling suspects with assault, strangulation, great bodily harm and a hate crime. Both pleaded not guilty and were ordered to remain on electronic home monitoring, prosecutors reportedly said.The third teen suspect was put on electronic home detention pending a charging decision from prosecutors, which was expected on 23 September, as ABC first reported, citing prosecutors. A charging decision for Edwards – whose bail was set at $300,000 – is also expected 23 September.Explore more on these topicsWashington stateUS crimeHate crimeLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities did not rule out additional arrests in the coming days as they review camera footage.Thousands of people joined a protest organised by a rightwing activist demanding stricter immigration policies and a clampdown on asylum seekers, just more than a month before a national election.Large groups of protesters, many waving Dutch flags and flags associated with far-right groups, clashed violently with the police, throwing rocks and bottles, footage from broadcaster NOS showed.A police car was set on fire and a group of protesters briefly blocked a highway near the site of the demonstration.Local media reported that protesters also smashed several windows at the headquarters of the centre-left D66 party.“Scum. You keep your hands off political parties,” the D66 party’s leader, Rob Jetten, wrote on X. “If you think you can intimidate us, tough luck. We will never let extremist rioters take our beautiful country away.”A smaller group of rioters headed for the Dutch parliament complex, which is fenced off as it undergoes renovation.Geert Wilders, the anti-migration populist politician who won the previous election in theNetherlands, was invited to speak at the demonstration but did not attend.Instead Wilders, who has retained his lead in opinion polls in the lead-in to the 29 October vote, condemned the violence on X, saying the use of force against police was “utterly unacceptable”, and calling those involved “idiots” and “scum”.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Or more mundanely was it the result of geological salt movements?Today, the decades-long scientific debate can be settled. The Silverpit crater 700 metres below the seabed under the North Sea was in all likelihood created by a direct hit from an asteroid or comet about the size of York Minster that hurtled towards the Earth more than 43m years ago.The 160-metre-wide asteroid smashed into the sea causing a 100-metre-high tsunami, say scientists. It was probably a very bad day for any early mammals in the area – but not as bad as the consequences of the asteroid smash thatwiped out the dinosaurs 66m years ago.The Silverpit crater is nowhere near the scale of the Chicxulub crater in Mexico, when anasteroid about 6 to 9 miles widestruck Earth, resulting in a mass extinction of 75% of plant and animal species. But it is still interesting and, as the only impact crater near what is now the UK, extremely important, say experts.Crater mapUisdean Nicholson, a sedimentologist from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh who led the research team, said new seismic imaging had given them an unprecedented look at the crater.Getting the proof was “definitely an exciting moment”, he said, describing the investigation as “a needle in the haystack approach”.The 2-mile-wide crater, surrounded by a 12-mile wide zone of circular faults, was discovered in 2002 by petroleum geoscientists.Those who found it believed it was indeed a hypervelocity impact crater, pointing to characteristics often associated with them including a central peak, circular shape and concentric faults.It was initially estimated to be more than 60m years old when it made headlines in 2002. “Crater could be asteroid strike,” read aGuardian report from the time.But some scientists were not convinced, arguing that it had a far less interesting origin story – it was most likely caused by the movement of salt rocks at depth.View image in fullscreenThe location of the Silverpit crater in the North Sea, showing the extent of the crater rim and the damage zone.Photograph: handout“I feel like I’m spoiling the party,”said the geologist Prof John Underhill, from the University of Edinburgh, who led the doubters at the time. “It’s a less glamorous explanation, but that’s what the scientific data is saying.”In 2009, there was a debate at the Geological Society that Nicholson remembers. “I was a PhD student at the time and it was quite a well-known debate, within geological circles at least.“They had the big debate and then they had a vote. It was overwhelmingly decided that it was a non-impact origin. Most people favoured the mundane explanation and I think that reflects a tendency to reject the more spectacular explanation.”The vote was 80-20 against the impact hypothesis, raising the question of whether geologists are naturally conservative. “There are different flavours of geologist,” said Nicholson. “People say I get too excited by certain ideas.”Nicholson was asked to look at Silverpit because of his experience discovering another impact crater in west Africa.With financing from the Natural Environment Research Council the Nicholson-led team used seismic imaging, microscopic analysis of rock cuttings and numerical models to provide what they say is the strongest evidence yet that Silverpit is one of Earth’s impact craters.Asteroid crashes are mercifully rare, with none in recorded human history. The craters left by the impacts are also rare because “plate tectonics and erosion destroy almost all traces of most of these events”, Nicholson said. “Around 200 confirmed impact craters exist on land and only 33 have been identified beneath the ocean.”Silverpit is exceptionally preserved and important, he said. “We can use these findings to understand how asteroid impacts shaped our planet throughout history, as well as predict what could happen should we have an asteroid collision in future.”The findings are published inNature Communications.Explore more on these topicsAsteroidsCometsYorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Vines and a canopy keep the terrace of Mohammed Feras’s cave home cool despite the searing summer heat rising from the rocky valley.“I have lived here all my life. I’ve never been anywhere else and I cannot imagine not living here. This area is part of who I am and I cannot leave it,” the 44-year-old farmer and sometime tourist guide said.Within months, Feras and dozens of other Bedouin from the Bdoul community are likely to have left the caves they call home. There is little place for them in Petra as it is transformed by a major development programme that aims to build new facilities, regulate an anarchic tourist trade and provide a better experience for thehundreds of thousands of visitorsdrawn to the ancient site.Feras’s home, which he shares with his wife and nine children, comprises four connected 2,400-year-old caves and an adjoining tent. Just a 10-minute walk away are the remains of Petra’s grand temple and its colonnaded main street. It is also just a short hike from the monument known asthe Treasury, made more famous by the 1989 blockbuster Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.The caves occupied by the Bdoul were originally an integral part of a wealthy trading city – the thriving capital of the Nabateans for 500 years before it was annexed by the Romans in around AD100 and eventually abandoned three centuries later.View image in fullscreenFeras surveys his cave home.Photograph: The GuardianInternational human rights campaigners have called on Jordanian authorities to halt looming evictions. “Jordan’s displacement of the Bdoul from their historic homes in Petra puts their culture at risk,” saidAdam Coogle, a Middle East and north Africa deputy director at Human Rights Watch. “The Jordanian government should halt the relocations and respect the rights of Petra’s Bedouin community.”Officials charged with the management and development of Petra say the Bdoul who still live on the site are there illegally. They contend that many have alternative accommodation and that their use of the caves as homes, animal shelters, shops and storerooms risks causing irreparable harm.“If we want to preserve the integrity of the site for future generations then we have to stop the use of the caves for damaging activities,” said Dr Fares Braizat, the chief commissioner of thePetra Development and Tourism Region Authority. “Everyone in the site, whoever they are, has to abide by the law, and it is illegal for anyone to live in or use the archaeological monuments within the [site of Petra] for whatever purposes.”Historians say the Bdoul have lived in Petra’s caves for about 200 years. Efforts to remove the community from the site began shortly after its classification by the United Nationsas a world heritage sitein 1985. Then, in a deal negotiated with community leaders, thousands of people were moved to a purpose-built village nearby. Some evaded the relocation or have since moved back to their cave homes.In recent years, with tourism a major contributor to Jordan’s flagging economy, big investments have been made at Petra. There is a new museum, cultural village and network of walking trails. Hundreds of stalls that choked the site have been cleared away, as have guides who harassed visitors. An effort has been made to cut down on overnight stays in caves being offered to tourists on social media or popular booking sites.View image in fullscreenFeras’s five-year-old daughter outside the family home.Photograph: The GuardianThe new campaign to clear the caves began in late 2024 and targeted a dozen or so extended families now living around theSutuh al-Nabi Harun mountain. The Jordanian authorities have been accused by campaigners of using “coercive tactics”.Feras, who earns a thin living from farming goats and sheep and occasionally acting as an guide, has rejected an offer from authorities of a house in the village where other Bdoul from Petra are now living. He said he was sent to prison earlier this year for failing to pay a heavy fine for destroying a heritage site. He was released after two weeks but now faces a new court hearing.“It’s ridiculous to accuse us of damaging the caves,” Feras said. “We are their guardians. We are not destroying anything. We just live the way we have lived for hundreds of years.”Yasin Ahmed , one of Feras’s neighbours, said he had also received a court summons, as well as fines totalling tens of thousands of dollars, which he too could not pay.“I just don’t have that kind of money. I am not wealthy,” he said. “I grew up here and I don’t know anything else. I can’t survive in a house in a village … They are offering only a very small house but I have 10 children.”The tourist trade in Jordan has been badly hit by the war in Gaza, with the number of visitors to Petra falling dramatically. The Bdoul who made a living from guiding tourists or selling souvenirs or soft drinks have lost much of their income.Rayya Hussein, 85, has sworn never to leave her cave home, where she has lived all her life. Her parents are buried in the mountains close by. “If they want to force me to move out, I will go up on the mountain and jump,” she said.View image in fullscreenJordanian flags flying over dwellings that the authorities consider illegal.Photograph: The GuardianDr Olivia Mason, a political geographer at Newcastle University who has researched Petra and its development, said authorities saw the Bdoul as a nuisance, despite the UN making clear that their cultural heritage was an integral part of the site’s significance.“At the moment it’s the Jordanian authorities against the Bdoul, and no one acknowledges that they can work together,” Mason said. “There has to be some level of development, but that shouldn’t come at the expense of the local community.”Braizat said authorities had already promised some very elderly inhabitants that they could stay in their caves if they wanted to, and that the government-built houses offered to the Bdoul were adequately sized, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.He admitted there was limited funding available for new housing in or near the existing and overcrowded village established for the community, but said there was a project to offer the Bdoul alternative livelihoods.“We are shouldering our responsibilities to give these people a better life, with access to schools, roads, hospitals and everything that they need,” Braizat said.But to many of the Bdoul such words mean little. “We have lived here all our lives. Our freedom is being outside,” Feras said. “Here the children have freedom to go out with the sheep and run over the mountain. This is our soil.”Some names have been changed to protect identitiesExplore more on these topicsJordanInternally displaced peopleMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the story sounds familiar, it’s because it was inspired by real-life events.Fall, the artistic director of theYoung Vic, said: “I was doing a play with the writer Suhayla El-Bushra at the National [Theatre], and we were approached about making a film.“At the time, the media was full of stories of young people that made that fateful journey to Syria, includingShamima Begum[the London teenager who travelled in secret to Syria to become an IS bride in 2015]. We noticed how those young women were so vilified. They were portrayed as monsters, and nobody was really seeing the experience from their point of view. We felt that that was really needed.”‘I live for a chance to leave Iraq’: how I survived torture and slavery at the hands of Islamic StateRead moreThe film, which premiered at Sundance and is released in cinemas this month, resists easy condemnation of its two protagonists (played by Ebada Hassan and Safiyya Ingar). Instead, it traces their perilous journey through Turkey towards the Syrian border, during which they lose their passport and money, stay in a bus station clerk’s family home, survive a police chase, and hitchhike their way out of the city.View image in fullscreenNadia Fall drew on her past experience of working with young people, including in pupil referral units and mental health settings.Photograph: Courtesy of Neon Films/Rosamont“It’s fictionalised, but we shaped our story according to real life acts,” Fall said. “We shot at the real bus station in Turkey where Shamima Begum and her friends waited. Even the social media stuff about kittens and ‘halal Haribo’ is real.”Fall said she was inspired by “the greatest road movie of all time”, Thelma and Louise, as well as other films about young women such as Never Rarely Sometimes Always. She drew on her past experience of working with young people, including in pupil referral units and mental health settings. The teenage brain, she said, had always fascinated her.“As teenagers, we’re hardwired to take risk and make impulsive decisions. When people say, ‘Why do people make this journey?’, there’s no one size fits all. Our research showed there were so many different reasons.”There is little discussion or analysis of terrorism in Brides. You never actually see the girls in Syria, and the word Isis is never used. For Fall, this was intentional: she wanted to focus on the intensity of adolescent friendships.“It’s a love letter to teenage girls. There’s all sorts of incredible documentaries about Syria. We’ve watched the news, we know exactly what it was like on the other side of that border. For us it wasn’t about that, it was about the journey. What if they could have the freedom that they find on the journey and choose another path?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ‘unite the kingdom’ march was packed. People are being radicalised. They believe these narcissists in power who say: ‘that person is taking things away from you’. It’s divisive, it’s cynical, and it’s horrific.”If Brides makes a plea, it is for empathy. “We go to the gym for our health, we eat well for our health, and similarly, we need to regularly practice the art of empathy. If we do it in communion with strangers at a cinema or a theatre, all the better.”View image in fullscreenEbada Hassan and Safiyya Ingar in Brides.Photograph: Courtesy of Neon Films/RosamontFall herself grew up in Southwark and the Middle East, the daughter of south Asian parents. After training as a director, she became an associate at the National Theatre, then ran Stratford East, formerly known as Theatre Royal Stratford East, before taking over at the Young Vic. This month marks her first full season at the helm, and she is determined to start off bold.The season opens with Fall directing Joe Orton’s cult queer classic Entertaining Mr Sloane. Also on the bill is Rajiv Joseph’s Pulitzer and Tony-nominated Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, directed by Omar Elerian; and Arthur Miller’s rarely performed Broken Glass, revived by Jordan Fein.The latter, written in response to the rise of fascism in Europe, centres on a Jewish woman in 1930s Brooklyn who becomes paralysed after reading about pogroms in Germany. “It asks: when terrible things happen in the world, what do you do? Ignore it, or stare right at it?” Fall said. Other plays explore austerity Britain and systemic injustices in British institutions.View image in fullscreenThe film focuses on the intensity of adolescent friendships – ‘a love letter to teenage girls’.Photograph: Courtesy of Neon Films/RosamontThe director said there was “something mischievous” about the new season, which was important at a time when “everything’s become a bit homogeneous”. She said funding cuts meant theatres were increasingly scared to take risks, “but that’s where the exciting stuff happens.”She added: “It’s tough across the sector. Our buildings are falling apart. We need to pay staff. I wish that our government seemed more interested. Why don’t they extend the tax relief scheme? Why don’t they forgo the Covid loans?”Fall also said that low pay and the rising costs of tickets could result in less diversity across the industry. “Would I celebrate a world where my theatre was packed, but each ticket was £300, which is what’s happening on Broadway? This is where the maths could lead us: theatre as a pastime for the elite.”Explore more on these topicsFilmIslamic StateYoung VicSundance film festivalShamima BegumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The house would be rigged with hidden cameras and the child would be an actor of age, playing the role of an excitable pre- or young teen, maybe even suggesting they both drank alcohol as a further illicit act. But before things went the way that the guest expected they would, out came TV’s Chris Hansen, an award-winning broadcast journalist accompanied by a camera crew. Tears would be shed, apologies would be given and most often, the illusion of being “free to go” would be followed by an arrest carried out by gun-toting police officers.To Catch a Predator: exploring the uneasy legacy of the controversial TV seriesRead moreBetween the years of 2004 and 2007, Dateline’s To Catch a Predator was a prime-time ratings hit in the US, a cleanly packaged version of something undeniably dirty, a punchy reminder to parents that the ever-expanding online world was not to be trusted. It was “a strange mix of schadenfreude and horror,” says David Osit, an Emmy-winning documentary film-maker, whose latest film Predators looks back on the show and the controversy surrounding it. It’s one of a number of new documentaries revisiting a strange, exploitative era of television, one without the regulations and moral code we’re now more accustomed to mostly expect. Netflix has explored the problems withThe Jerry Springer Showand more recentlyThe Biggest Loserand will soon revisit the horrors ofAmerica’s Next Top Model, a series that’s since been accused of cruelly imposing impossible and uneasy beauty and body standards on vulnerable young women. The victims in To Catch a Predator are far harder to feel sorry for, paedophiles who were willing to do something indefensibly grotesque and impossible to empathise with, but the method of catching them remains deeply uncomfortable, cops working hand-in-hand with a TV crew, and the questions it asks about us and why we would want to play witness, are incredibly troubling.In the film, Mark de Rond, an ethnographer, narrates a montage of money shots, when the bad guy is caught, their faces grappling with the reality of a point of no return. “In that moment, time stops,” he says. “What you’re seeing is effectively someone’s life end and they realise it. The goal of the show was to educate people about the evils of the internet, the ‘stranger danger’ folk but it ended up shocking an entire nation.”Predators, which premiered at Sundance earlier this year, is not an easy film to watch and an even harder film to process after. Osit, whose previous documentary Mayor followed the day-to-day of a Palestinian politician dealing with Israeli oppression, managed to get his hands on a staggering amount of footage that takes us beyond the bombastic NBC edit and deeper into the moments we weren’t supposed to see. He found a lot of it via fan communities online and then through a series of Foia (Freedom of Information Act) requests, he found even more, including post-show interrogations with police. Much of it shows the men tearfully begging for help, eager for therapy or something to change (“To show these men as human beings, the show kind of breaks down,” De Rond says).“I remembered the show, and hadn’t watched the show in years,” he tells me over Zoom. “Then I’d watch the raw material and feel abject horror.” The feeling troubled him, as it did me when I watched it, being forced into extreme empathy for someone whose behaviour sickens me. “I remember thinking, wow, I’m having a very mysterious mix of feeling disgust for these men, antipathy for these men, and sadness for these men, depending on which order of raw material I watch first,” he says. “What if I could basically not only give that experience to an audience, but make that what the film’s about?”Alongside the previously unaired footage, Osit speaks to the young actors who played the decoys, many of them now parents themselves. They talk about “how taxing it was emotionally and mentally” to live with what they had been a part of (“There were a few, I wanted to just be like ‘go home,’” one of them says), acting as a key component of a criminal sting operation. He also speaks to Greg Stumbo, a former Kentucky attorney general, who partnered with NBC for three stings. After proudly showing off his official Dateline cap, Osit asks him if he ever wondered about how to fix the broader problem. “That’s not my job to rehabilitate them,” he says before dipping into a very Trump-like contradiction, mentioning these men didn’t have criminal records before the show while also calling them “hardened criminals”.Osit also shows us clips of how the show was received at the time, the bizarre place it held in pop culture. Jimmy Kimmel called it “the funniest comedy on television”, Oprah Winfrey praised Hansen and his “amazing work” while Jon Stewart told him “you should have your own channel of this show”. Hansen cameoed on both 30 Rock and The Simpsons.“We all, I think, have these sorts of calcified senses of what we think is right and what we think is wrong,” Osit tells me. “Regardless of whether you’re liberal or conservative, we can decide some people aren’t worth humanity. We’re seeing that with Gaza and the genocide. We’re seeing that throughout human history and throughout modern history.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: MTVBut it would be difficult to imagine even the most hardened viewer not finding some humanity in what happened next. In 2006, the show’s sting involved Bill Conradt, a Texas district attorney, someone who chose not to turn up to the rigged house for sex. Instead, the makers made the unusual choice of travelling to where he lived and a police ambush resulted in him shooting himself and dying in front of police. Watching it unfold is devastating, an act of recklessness made worse by the callous response of the officers on camera, one of whom is captured making jokes about it soon after. It led to a shift in the conversation, questions being finally asked about the role of the show and the blurry lines between a police investigation and entertainment, as well as a $105m lawsuit. It went away soon after.What’s then most shocking is finding out that Predators isn’t over. That was just the first chapter. Because while To Catch a Predator went away, the format just mutated and made the inevitable move to YouTube with copycats creating even less regulated and even more problematic new versions. “I was surprised at the popularity of the new formats where now you have predator hunter videos and each one gets more views than an episode of Saturday Night Live,” Osit says.Osit follows one in particular, known as Skeet Hansen, modelling himself after his hero as he goes about making his own shoddily assembled, yet grimly popular, rip-off. The videos can be violent and even harder to watch than the ones they’re trying to emulate, a team even less prepared for the challenges they’re faced with. There remains an awkward relationship between the team making it and the police and there was also awkwardness for Osit who suddenly started to question his role in events.“I felt like I wanted to, if nothing else, just make a film that was about how uncomfortable I am with what I do for a living sometimes,” he says. While filming with Skeet, he wanted to be “anywhere but here” and found it difficult to watch the footage he captured. “I’m watching it through the eyes of the person that we’re filming, who is this man whose identity I don’t know, who now hastwocamera crews filming him … Does he know that I’m different? No, I’m just another camera. I’m just another source of his embarrassment … Ultimately, I felt like I was looking in the mirror and I didn’t like what I saw and I felt uncomfortable with that.”After Osit received acclaim for Mayor, he told me he was offered a number of true crime projects. It’s a lucrative subgenre that makes him uneasy and Predators partly grew out of that feeling. In the last act, Osit also gets time with Hansen, who is now making a newer, trashier version of the show, the film somehow getting bleaker with each chapter. Hansen’s final target is an 18-year-old called Hunter, planning to meet a 15-year-old, an age difference that wouldn’t be illegal in certain states. They run with it anyway (“I hope we’re not ruining his life,” one of the producers says, offhand, during lunch) and we get to meet Hunter’s parents in the aftermath, a life ruined just before graduation. “I just don’t know how the worst day of my life could be something that people are getting snacks for,” his mother says.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: MTVHansen is an open and unrepentant interviewee yet Osit found some similarities with him.“He’s seen the film and we’ve talked about it,” he says. “And I think I have to strain a bit to see that there’s not a huge difference between him and I. We both believe in what we’re doing. We both are basically film-makers. We’re both trying to create material out of people’s experiences and people’s lives, trying to propagate the opinions and beliefs and worldviews that we have. The only difference really is that I just believe that what I’m doing is not harming anybody, but he also believes that too, or that there’s some people that it’s OK to harm to get to your goals.”Osit knows that, especially at this particular moment, Predators is not going to change or even simply challenge the minds of many.“There are plenty of people who cannot watch this material with two things in their head,” he said. “There are plenty of people who resort to a binary of this is good or this is bad. And that’s really what the show is trading in as well.” He adds: “In my personal experience, I feel like empathy shouldn’t be offered based on who someone is, it should be offered based on who we are.”Predators is out in US cinemas now and will be released in the UK on 14 November and Australia at a later dateExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Telling this story metes out another small dose of justiceRachel AroestiSat 20 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareEarly on in The Hack –AdolescencewriterJack Thorne’s new series about the News International phone hacking scandal – Guardian journalistNick Daviesappears on the Today programme to promote his 2008 book,Flat Earth News. It is an indictment of the contemporary British press; its sloppiness and corruption. “The logic of journalism has been overwhelmed by the logic of commercialism,” he tells the host and a glowering Stuart Kuttner, the managing editor of the News of the World. Nowadays, says Davies, so-called reporters are simply “passive processors of unchecked second-hand material”.My first thought is: OK, this is not your common-or-garden ITV drama. No hand-holding, no pandering, no schmaltz; we’re about to get a proper, grownup deep dive into the tabloid malfeasance – illegal surveillance, toxic power plays – that Davies began exposing in this newspaper in 2009. Bring on the machiavellian office politics, the labyrinthine narratives of your Successions, your Industrys, your Line of Dutys. (My next thought is: second-hand material? What, like yetanotherdramatisation of a recent major news story?)But The Hack (Wednesday 24 September, 9pm, ITV1) loses its nerve pretty quickly. This opening episode casts Davies (David Tennant at his chameleonic best in a frizzy grey wig and comfortingly 90s leather jacket and jeans combo) as our fourth-wall breaking guide, apparently determined to inject some zaniness into proceedings. We witness his attempts to begin his (real, brilliant) 2014 book Hack Attack, an account of the investigation that eventually helped destroy Kuttner’s paper and root out some of the rot at the heart of the British establishment. “Shit!” he groans to camera after struggling to formulate an opening sentence. Relatable content for all writers – even if it is immediately undermined by hisslightlyunconvincing second go: “My name is Nick Davies. I am a journalist.” (Useful exposition though!)Further surreal flourishes arrive. Tube adverts come to life, as do the posters on the wall of Davies’s study. Characters are given pseudonyms such as “Detective Buzz Aldrin”. When he meets his first source, Davies explains he must keep his identity secret – an eminently graspable fact that is nevertheless hammered home via a jarringly random parade of celebrity cameos.You suspect The Hack doesn’t fully trust viewers to stay interested in the subject matter. To wit: we’re also treated to a trite subplot about Davies’s home life involving his incredibly reasonable ex-wife and a bullied teenage son. Disappointing for lovers of quasi-intellectual drama, but understandable. The Hack has a lot in common with ITV’s colossal hit of last year,Mr Bates vs the Post Office– both prominently featureToby Jones(here he plays former Guardian editorAlan Rusbridger, despite being his physical inverse), cover a technology-based scandal and share a theme of maddening injustice in the UK – and is probably gunning for the same impact. Yet this is no easily digestible tale of brave, innocent civilians taking on The Man. Here, journalists are both the heroes and the villains – as are the police and politicians. It’s infuriating but not heart-rending. It doesn’t write itself.View image in fullscreenGuardian angle … Tennant with Toby Jones as Alan Rusbridger (left) and Nadia Albina as Gill Phillips in The Hack.Photograph: ITVThe crowd-pleasing pizzazz is justifiable, then. Besides, if you don’t like the silly stuff, wait for the second episode, which chronicles the investigation into the murder of Daniel Morgan by Met DCS Dave Cook (Robert Carlyle) in the manner of a more traditional hardboiled police procedural. (Having only seen the first two episodes, I do wonder what else is in store: Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson’s affair as a cheesy studio sitcom? The Leveson inquiry redone in the style of a musical?)Wherever The Hack goes next, I hope it manages to capture the significance of this sprawling, spectacular story – one that reveals the cold hard truth about how this country truly operates. Tennant has the ability to make anything sound exciting; he can carry this. Hopefully there’s more Steve Pemberton as Rupert Murdoch. As ever with these ripped-from-the-headlines shows, we know exactly how things pan out: some people who believed they could operate above the law got their comeuppance, of a kind. To air their dirty laundry again is to mete out another small dose of justice.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherPhone hackingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about being longlisted again — and the immigration raids creating fear in her New York neighbourhoodSat 20 Sep 2025 04.01 EDTShareNot long after the novelist Kiran Desai published her second book,The Inheritance of Loss, which won the Booker prize in 2006, she began working on her third. The title,The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, came to her quickly, and she knew she wanted to write a “modern-day romance that wasn’t necessarily romantic”, one as much concerned with the forces that keep us apart – class, race, nationality, family history – as those that bind us. Writing the book itself took almost two decades.One problem with devoting so many years to one book is that people worry for your welfare, Desai says with a laugh. “People begin to wonder what’s wrong. Are you really working on something?” One neighbour – who observed how Desai would rise early each morning to write, eat her breakfast and lunch at her desk, take a short break to do her food shop or housework and then write until as late as she could manage in the evenings – attempted an intervention. “You need to come out of your house,” he told her. “You will go crazy writing a book! This is no way to live!” Her 90-year-old uncle observed, with affection, that she was starting to look “like a kind of derelict”, which she acknowledges was true. “It was becoming absurd!” And yet Desai says she loved living this way, in complete service to her writing.At times she sounds mystified by why the writing took so long. The book runs to almost 700 pages, “but then I also have to think there are authors who write books this long several times over. Look at Hilary Mantel or Dickens or Tolstoy.” Perhaps, she muses, “I was just writing this book over and over, and letting it take different forms.” By around 2013 her notes had swelled to 5,000 pages, and she puzzled over which strands she should extract and weave into a story. How far back in time should she travel, and how far forward? How far outwards should she expand from Sonia and Sunny to explore the lives of their friends and relatives?This feels like the big book of my life. I don’t have time to do it againEven when these questions felt unresolvable, she kept working. “It was just a stubbornness that I cannot explain,” she says. “I become very determined and very stubborn and not very nice if I am kept away from my writing.” She feels “lucky” that she was able to work with such intensity, because she does not have to fit her writing around children or family life. In the year or two after her Booker win she felt a sense of pressure, but over time “that self-consciousness fell away”, she says, “and I was just living in a very isolated way and working”. She phones her mother daily and visits her often in upstate New York, and she would see friends a few times a week.But mostly, for decades, she wrote alone at home in New York or on long trips to Mexico.“There have been times in my life when I have been very, very solitary,” she says. So solitary that her social identity appeared to dissolve. “I didn’t think of myself as a person, particularly. I didn’t think of myself as being from somewhere. I didn’t think of myself as a woman, particularly, because I was so alone and what does it mean, without context?”View image in fullscreen‘It’s ordinary life now’ … Kiran Desai.Photograph: Benedict EvansWe meet at her home on a quiet street in Queens, where she migrates daily from her kitchen table to an upstairs desk to catch the best light. Copies of the UK editions of her book have recently been delivered and remain in a box at her front door. Even now, she finds herself thinking: “I really could have done it this way, if I had just taken that out and put it somewhere else … ”Desai was 35 when she won the Booker – making her, at the time, the youngest woman to win – and now she is 54. She is slim, elegantly dressed in a pale pink linen tunic and dark pink trousers, a grey stripe running through her hair, and has a gentle, precise manner of speaking. To finish the book felt “anticlimactic”, she says, “because it’s ordinary life now, after living in a completely artistic world”. She doesn’t quite know what to do with herself.The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, like her previous novel,is an epic, multistranded, sometimes darkly humorous family saga that takes on big political and philosophical themes. Sonia and Sunny are both Indian writers who moved to the US as students and whose paths first cross when Sonia’s family send Sunny a marriage proposal. The proposal goes nowhere, because Sunny is dating an American woman and has no interest in old-fashioned customs. Sonia herself is in thrall to Ilan de Toorjen Foss, a needy, abusive, much older artist.View image in fullscreenDesai celebrates winning the Booker prize in 2006.Photograph: John D Mchugh/AFP/Getty ImagesMany of the “loving” relationships in this novel, whether romantic or familial, are destructive, uneven, constrictive. The characters turn to art as a salve and means of escape from their difficult or disappointing lives, but art is also another source of exploitation. Ilan is a thief and a parasite, who profits from the suffering of others. He, in turn, gives himself entirely over to his art. “If you are a good artist … you give more of your life to art, you begin to subtract your life so it becomes such an emptiness that you dare not look upon it,” he tells Sonia. Does Desai ever feel that way about herself? “I do feel that I made that exchange,” she says. “I don’t regret it but … it did displace my life. Or maybe I just filled it up.”Desai says she has always “lived in her head”, but growing up in Delhi, the youngest of four siblings, she was never alone. Her father worked for an oil company, and her mother was expected to support him, which meant putting on a beautiful silk sari every evening and either hosting or attending a party. Desai speaks with admiration of her mother’s resourcefulness, how she nonetheless found the time and confidence to write, and managed to fill the family bookshelves with hard‑to-find books.Anita Desaiwas nominated for the Booker three times, but the children understood her fame “sort of backwards”, only when their mother’s glamorous foreign-language translators began coming to stay. “It opened up the door to the world and eventually she stepped through it and left, and took me with her,” Desai says. When she was a teenager, her mother was offered a fellowship at Cambridge and Desai, the only child still at home, went to the UK with her.“It was scary to me, because I had never left India,” Desai recalls. She found it “startling” to witness the vast power divide between the two nations, something for which her voracious reading of British children’s classics did not prepare her. “I could not put it together with Paddington Bear and The Wind in the Willows and all kinds of other books I read early on that were so strange,” she says. In the end, the book that best helped her understand her immigrant experience was VS Naipaul’sThe Enigma of Arrival.When fear enters a nation it’s almost the end of itA year after moving to Cambridge, she and her mother emigrated to Amherst, Massachusetts, and Desai enrolled in a US high school. “I have to say that in comparison to India the American system of education seemed so unbelievably easy, you just got smiley faces and encouragement,” she jokes.She went on to Bennington, a liberal arts college in Vermont, where she took her first creative writing class. “I remember just being so happy, the first story I wrote,” she says. It was called Hair Oil, about a man obsessed with his hair; the next was about a snooty civil servant sent to rural India. “Very odd,” she says, laughing. “I don’t know why I was writing those stories.” She also began working on her first book,Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard, which was published in 1998, a satire about a young man who goes to live in a guava tree and is mistaken for a holy man.Shortly after, Desai completed an MFA at Columbia University in New York. She found that one downside to studying creative writing is that when your work is regularly read by a group it “makes you very, very self-conscious – and you need to lose that to be able to write well”. Afterwards she did not join writers’ groups and she wrote The Inheritance of Lossthe “old-fashioned way”, alone, over seven years. Her mother is always her first reader, because she understands instinctively what her daughter is trying to achieve. “She knows the landscape I’m working from, so she understands what I am trying to do, even though it’s not yet on the page,” she says.In Desai’s new novel, Sonia is working on a story that sounds very similar to Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard,and she shows it to Ilan, who tells her to stop writing “orientalist nonsense” and to keep away from magical realism or subjects such as arranged marriages. “He’s uttering something that a lot of people say, and is a legitimate thing to say,” Desai explains. Like Sonia, she has grappled with the question of how India should be represented to a western readership, and she ultimately includes several arranged marriage plots and an element of magical realism in the novel.As Sonia learns, there are no simple answers. In the novel, Sonia changes one of her stories so that the character eats an apple rather than a guava, rendering it less “exotic” to western readers but also less true, because apples are more expensive and less plentiful in India. “Most marriages in India are arranged, that is the truth of the matter. But should you not write about it because of the audience it’s going to be sold to? I think a lot of it comes down to: are you a good or a bad writer?”Desai has been a New Yorker for more than 25 years, but until her father’s death in 2008 she visited India every year. Now that the family home has been sold (her parents were separated after she and her mother moved to the US), she visits less frequently, and she felt this novel might be her last chance to write about India. She wanted to take a snapshot of the country around the turn of the millennium, when Hindu nationalism began rising and dinner party conversations shifted in ways that alarmed Desai. “You would be in the living room with friends and suddenly something else was acceptable,” she remembers. When she visited India last winter, she was struck by the fear expressed by friends from religious minorities. “I did learn the lesson that when fear enters a nation that’s almost the end of it. And I never thought it would happen in the United States as well,” she says, but now she sees similar fear in her multicultural neighbourhood of Jackson Heights. “Underneath the subway tracks, before Trump was elected, it was very lively. People were selling arepas and tacos and skewers of food and religious charms and breads, and actually a lot of women soliciting prostitution,” she says. But now many of these enterprises have been shut down. “People are very scared,” she says, because of immigration raids.View image in fullscreen‘My mother knows the landscape I’m working from – she understands what I am trying to do’ … Desai with her mother, Anita Desai.Photograph: Graziano Arici/eyevineDesai loves living in this diverse community, and at a healthy remove from the New York literary scene. She lives next to families from Ireland and Tibet, and until his recent death she used to often visit her nonagenarian Egyptian neighbour to drink coffee under his fig tree and hear stories of his upbringing in Alexandria – “so I wasn’t entirely solitary”, she concedes. We take a walk along a row of South American restaurants and grocery stores and phone shops and money exchanges until suddenly she stops and says, delighted: “Can you smell that? Curry!” Within one block, the culture of the street has shifted, completely, from South America to the Indian subcontinent. She points out the best kebab shops and we stop to admire the opulent, gem-encrusted, 24-carat gold wedding jewellery. A man hands us each a business card promoting a “World Famous Indian Astrologer” and Desai notices, amused, that as well as reuniting lovers and securing promotions, this man purports to solve the ambiguous “kids mistake” (sic). She shows me the tucked-away Tibetan dumpling shop that Sunny visits in the book, and the bank he frequents.At 4.30pm, her mother phones, as is their tradition. Anita Desai is 88 and has had a few falls recently, and Desai, who of the four siblings lives closest and is her first port of call, was very worried about leaving her mother to go on book tours. She had inadvertently added to her anxiety by reading several books set in old people’s homes, includingMrs Palfrey at the Claremontby Elizabeth Taylor and Elizabeth Strout’sOlive, Again– the latter passed to her by her mother, who said: “You should read this, it’s terrifying!” Despite this, her mother, who is “thrilled” Desai’s novel is finished, has been urging her not to hold back on any travel plans.The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny has already been longlisted for theBooker prize, which Desai says feels like remarkable recognition. “I feel relieved, as if I have averted some nebulous disaster, and very lucky,” she says. She is not yet ready or able to start a new project but already knows that whatever comes next for her, it cannot be quite as ambitious in scope. “I could never do it again, it would not be strategically smart,” she says. “This feels like the big book of my life in that way. I don’t have time to do it again.”The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny by Kiran Desai will be published by Hamish Hamilton on 25 September.

It made me question my sexual orientation: was I attracted to men, as I suspected, or did I simply have a desire for gratification?When I tip-toed around the topic of queerness in conversations with past girlfriends, more than once it was made clear to me that bisexuality was an unattractive trait for a man to have. The shame heaped up. And yet my secret fantasies continued. It wasn’t just men I fantasised about, it was the possibility of different power dynamics, of multiple bodies, of feeling seen.I think my father had something to do with this. He became a manipulative, and sometimes violent, alcoholic by my teenage years, and I came to associate addiction, anger and excess with him. My longing for sexual exploration felt like the early stages of the kind of lascivious male appetites that I knew could wreck lives. And so I bottled these feelings up.This was a fool’s errand. I felt isolated and wary of other men. Then, a few years ago, when I was 23, I moved from the rural English town I grew up in to London. I came into contact with queer communities and saw that intimacy and love could take different shapes. But if something like that was out there for me, it still seemed a long way off. And then I listened to Faith byGeorge Michael.It was an era-defining album for the masses, and yet I could have sworn it was written just for meIt was only after Michael died, in 2016, that I began to pay attention to his music, intrigued by the stories that began pouring out about the countless acts of generosity that he had kept to himself throughout his life. I had known little about him, beyond Careless Whisper and a handful of Wham! songs, and them I decided to listen to his debut solo album start to finish.It was an era-defining album for the masses, and yet, when I first listened to it, I could have sworn it was written just for me. The first three tracks – Faith, Father Figure, I Want Your Sex – unashamedly celebrate sex as a site of play, connection and understanding in times of pain and confusion. I was enthralled.On One More Try, Michael sings “’Cause, teacher, there are things that I don’t want to learn”. My mind raced back to my early sexual encounters with men. They were anonymous and short-lived, and afterwards I would leave in a hurry, grappling with guilt, fleeing from the spectre of my own sexuality. As I listened, I mourned the way my shame had robbed me of the learning potential of those experiences.The often-overlooked Look at Your Hands felt like a slap round the face on that first listen. In it, Michael warns against settling for a life of repression and suburban mundanity. “Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like your life,” he taunts his ex-lover. Was I also blindly heading towards a future where I would look back on my 20s as a wasteland of missed opportunities for sexual discovery?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It helped me clear the sleep out of my eyes and realise that I had nothing to be ashamed of, that my desire wasn’t something that needed to be suppressed.I began to speak more openly with my girlfriend about wanting to explore sexually. She was accepting of who I am, and before long we were signing up for queer sex parties. I felt apprehension at first – would I be recognised as an impostor? But almost immediately, I got chatting to other queer people accepted me straight away. It was hugely liberating, being surrounded by like-minded people who have also overcome their shame.Today, my sexuality is a big part of who I am. Sex is self-acceptance, exploration and communion. Though he’s no longer with us, I’ll always be grateful to George Michael for helping me to unshackle my sexuality from my shame.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

We are silent because we are both working on the same puzzle, and neither of us wants any help from the other at this point.The front door opens and my wife comes in, bringing with her the middle one and all his worldly possessions. Only the youngest one, the last to leave, has yet to return home, but he lives just minutes away and, like the other two, he has a key.There was an actual point when all three of our adult children had flown the nest, when we suddenly had an embarrassment of spare rooms and a sense of unlimited possibility. Now all I can think is: it’s a good thing I didn’t buy a rowing machine.“I guess we’re back to big milk,” I say, tipping the last of a dainty pint container into my coffee.“Can you help us unload everything?” my wife says.It’s not actually that much: when the middle one moved out two years ago, he had two carloads of stuff. Somehow, it’s been halved. This could be down to wear and tear, I suppose, or perhaps the other half has already migrated back over a period of months. I haven’t been concentrating.“There are going to be some changes round here,” my wife says.“That’s right,” I say, not entirely sure what she’s talking about.“First, you need to let us know whether you’re in for supper every day, by midday,” she says.“Fine,” says the middle one.‘How was the flat viewing?’ my wife asks the oldest one, in a voice cautiously tinged with hope“Can’t we set up some kind of phone alert, that everyone has to answer?” she says.“I’m sure it’s possible,” says the oldest one.By Monday the bulk of the middle one’s stuff has been rammed into already full storage spaces, under the stairs and in the eaves. The oldest one is out all morning, viewing a flat with his girlfriend. He returns in time for lunch. We are all, it seems, working from home today.“How was it?” my wife says, in a voice cautiously tinged with hope.“We put an offer in,” he says.“You’re not buying it,” she says.This, he says, is how things work now. You can’t just grudgingly agree to pay an extortionate amount of rent and move in; you have to make an offer, and hope nobody makes a better one before the lease is signed.“Ridiculous,’ my wife says.“I need to know how many we are for supper tonight,” I say.“Check the alerts,” the middle one says.“I can’t work those,” I say.“Look in your calendar,” he says.“My what?” I say.“I definitely added you to the group,” he says, tapping at the keys of his laptop.“I get the alerts, but there’s no way to act on them,” I say.“Here,” he says, turning the screen to face me. “You’ve already said you’re not in for supper.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At about six I leave my office shed to figure out what to do about it. My wife and the oldest one are in the kitchen.“What are we having?” I say.“He’s cooking,” she says, pointing to the oldest one.“Is he?” I say. “Finally, I’ve been replaced.”I go to the shops to buy beer and a big milk for the morning. I watch TV with my wife for a while, and then wander into the kitchen, where the oldest one is preparing an elaborate stir-fry. It took me a long time to get used to cooking for two, but cooking for five suddenly looks daunting.“A lot of food,” I say.“Yeah,” says the oldest one. He adds more ingredients, until the huge pan he’s using starts to spill over.“You’ve still got all this rice to go,” I say, pointing.“I know,” he says, looking perturbed.“You’re gonna struggle to fit all that in,” I say.“I am struggling,” he says.“I mean, you could probably do the rice separately,” I say.“What?” he says.“Get out another pan, heat some oil, some garlic, and then …”“OK,” he says. “Can you do that?”Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By mimicking the action of a hormone called GLP-1, they reduce appetite and feelings of hunger, slow the release of food from the stomach and increase feelings of fullness after eating.“It works by slowing how much food leaves the stomach – making a person feel fuller – and also stops another hormone from the pancreas releasing more sugar from the liver,” said Dr Simon Dryden, the head of biosciences at London Metropolitan University. “It also increases the amount of insulin a person produces which helps reduce blood sugar in a person with type 2 diabetes and more carbohydrate gets into body organs.”Studies also show theyreduce the desire to drink alcohol.2.Unhealthy foods become less appealing – at least temporarilyBecause GLP-1s reduce the “reward value” of fatty, sugary and salty food, as well as reduce appetite, many patients go off these foods, said Alexander Miras, a professor of endocrinology at Ulster University.The effect is similar to that in patients who have bariatric surgery, which helps them to lose weight. After bariatric surgery, there is at least a fivefold increase in endogenous GLP-1s that naturally occur in our guts. ”We know that this hormone works in parts of the brain that decide how rewarding food is, and it reduces the reward value of food, especially high fat, high sugar foods,” Miras said.About 20% of bariatric patients’ taste buds change their food preferences in the long term, while a much bigger percentage of people experience these changes in the months immediately after bariatric surgery, before food preferences and taste perception go back to normal. “What we are seeing now with GLP-1 medications, seems to mirror our experience with bariatric surgery,” said Miras.3.Altered palateAs a species, we are hardwired to like things that used to be scarce in evolutionary terms – specifically large amounts of fat and sugar. If pleasure eating those things diminishes by taking GLP-1s, that can open up your palate and allow you to appreciate other tastes, said Prof Jason Halford, of the European Association for the Study of Obesity.“You remove that noise and remove that drive for sugar and fat, and therefore your relationship with food has changed, and your relationship with flavours has changed. And so you’re looking for other things which will be interesting, because you’re not getting that hit any more.”4.Everything can taste saltier or sweeterWeight loss drugs also seem to change how food tastes. According to anew study, about one in five patients taking Ozempic, Wegovy or Mounjaro say food tastes saltier or sweeter than before but the perception of bitterness or sourness was unchanged.Participants who reported that food tasted saltier or sweeter were also twice as likely to report feeling fuller, compared with those who said their perception of saltiness or sweetness had not altered. Those who found food sweeter were also 67% more likely to report a reduction in appetite and 85% more likely to report a reduction in cravings, compared with those whose perception of sweetness was unchanged.“These drugs act not only in the gut and brain areas that control hunger but also on taste bud cells and brain regions that process taste and reward,” said Prof Othmar Moser,the lead author of the study from the University of Bayreuth, Germany. “This means they can subtly change how strong flavours, like sweetness or saltiness, are perceived. This, in turn, may affect appetite.”5.Gastric irritation can increaseTastes can change because the weight loss drugs can make you feel ill if you eat unhealthy food.Gastro intestinal effectssuch as nausea, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation are among the more common side effects of GLP-1s. These effects can be exacerbated by acidic, spicy or fatty foods and drinks. If chocolate makes you feel sick, you’re less likely to eat it.“When people start eating high energy foods when they are on these medications they also start feeling unwell,” said Miras. “So it’s not just that these hormones reduce the pleasure of these foods, but also that some people have what we call post-ingestive side effects. So they might be avoiding [unhealthy food] purely because it makes them feel ill.”Explore more on these topicsObesityFoodkey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Thanks to this pizza, you can have both. This recipe is written in memory of the beloved pizza of my youth:​ a vegetarian delight ​t​hat I ate on the regular with my cousins​ at one of the many Indian-Italian restaurants on Leicester’s Belgrave Road (AKA the Golden Mile) circa 1990, right before washing it down withRubicon mango juiceand doing handbrake turns in a nearby car park.Golden mile pizzaThis recipe was published in my book,Dinner, last year.​ The dough comes together in ​f​ive minutes in a food processor and proves overnight in the fridge. You’ll need to start the day before, but it can be kept in the fridge for up to four days. You’ll need two large containers or bowls to prove the dough​ in, a 30​cm x 40cm tray ​for the pizza, and some chaat masala, which you can ​g​et from any Indian supermarket​ or online.Prep15 minRest/prove1 day +Cook40 minMakes2 large pizzas, to feed 4For the dough3 tbsp rapeseed oil, plus extra for greasing750g strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting1 tbsp caster sugar2 tspfine salt7g (2 tsp) instant yeastFor the sauce1 tbsp rapeseed oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed400g tinchopped tomatoes½ tsp kashmiri chilli powder2 tbsp tomato ketchup½ tsp fine sea saltFor the toppings200ggrated mozzarella300g cherry tomatoes, halved100g sweetcorn kernels, fresh or frozen and defrosted1 green pepper, stalk, pith and seeds discarded, flesh cut into 1cm-thick slices (100g net)½ large red onion(100g), peeled and cut into ¾cm-thick slices2125g ballsfresh mozzarella, drained and tornFor the chaat masala oil2 green finger chillies, very finely chopped1 tbsp chaat masala4 tbsp rapeseed oilGrease the two tubs or bowls that you’re going to use to store the dough in the fridge. In a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar, salt and yeast a few times, until well mixed. Add the rapeseed oil and 500ml lukewarm water, pulse again until the dough comes together into a ball, then continue to mix for another 20 seconds.Pop the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead for five minutes, until you have a smooth ball. Divide the dough in two, roll into balls and pop one in each greased container. Cover with a lid or clingfilm, then chill in the fridge for at least a day, and up to four.To make the tomato sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan on a medium heat. When it’s hot, add the garlic and sweat, stirring, for up to a minute, until it turns sticky. Add the tomatoes and kashmiri chilli, leave to bubble away for 10 minutes, then stir in the ketchup and salt, and take off the heat.On the day you want to make your pizzas, take the dough out of the fridge at least an hour before baking. Fifteen minutes before you want to cook them, heat the oven to its hottest setting – ideally about 280C (260C fan)/535F/gas 10 – and move an oven rack to the centre of the oven. Have ready all the toppings in front of you in small bowls. In another small bowl, mix the finely chopped chillies, chaat masala and oil.Grease two oven trays and your hands with oil. Gently push and stretch one ball of dough into one tray, until it’s an even thickness and reaches right into the corners; be careful not to push out all the air bubbles in the dough, especially at the edges.Spoon half the tomato sauce on to the pizza base and spread it out evenly with the back of a large spoon. Scatter half the toppings over the top, starting with the grated mozzarella, then the cherry tomatoes, followed by the sweetcorn, green pepper, onion and, finally, the torn fresh mozzarella. Bake for 15 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and browning, then remove and drizzle the chaat masala chilli oil over the top. Slice into eight wedges and tuck in. Repeat with the remaining pizza dough and toppings.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodIndian food and drinkItalian food and drinkPizzarecipesShareReuse this content"

Under the trees, autumn arrives as a scent; the smell of damp decay, as the summer plants give way to fungi.To the mycophile, this forest funk is a call to action, a reminder that mycelium in the leaf litter is proliferating and preparing to fruit. And so, as a self-confessed mushroom lover, I find myself, basket in hand, contemplating the scentscape of this shaded woodland. There is something different here, though, a sickly note of rotting flesh amid the background odour. Most would walk on, fearing a macabre scene, but recognising the olfactory calling card of a very special mushroom, I start to search.Aerial scent trails are by no means linear, and it is with much sniffing and rummaging about that I find my prey among the bracken. The common stinkhorn is at once bizarre and familiar, with a form unmistakably reminiscent of human anatomy. Its Latin name,Phallus impudicus, translates to “shameless phallus”, and was, incidentally, the first binomial name I felt inspired to commit to memory as a young naturalist.The bulbous head of this specimen is still coated in reeking “gleba”, a sticky brown substance that attracts flies, then sticks to their feet, making them unwitting transporters of the spores contained in this carrion-scented glue.Edible but predictably unloved, this mushroom is usually eaten immature in its embryonic sac, where it offers a surprisingly radish-like experience to those brave enough to work through the thick jelly also contained within this “witch’s egg”. For me, however, it is the mature stinkhorn’s essence of putrefaction that offers the truly exciting potential. Dried and ground, I have discovered that fully grown stinkhorns bring an extraordinary depth of flavour to vegan dishes in place of aged beef, a product which, after all, owes its savoury character to the controlled process of decomposition.This one is a solitary specimen, so I move on, leaving it to unashamedly spread its spores. There will be other fungi to fill my basket and grace my table, ones that the rest of my family might actually eat.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsFungiCountry diaryRural affairsAutumnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Of this, £18.3bn was tax-free cash – an increase of 62% on the £11.3bn the previous year.Many financial experts say “budget jitters and fiscal rumours” are driving this trend as speculation swirls about what measures the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, will announce in her budget on 26 November.UK state pension: what is the triple lock, and could it be ditched?Read moreThey warn kneejerk decisions could wreak havoc on people’s long-term plans.Eamonn Prendergast, a chartered financial adviser at Palantir Financial Planning,said pension potswere “meant to last decades, not be raided in panic. The government must do more to quash rumours early and give clarity.”Rachel Vahey at the investment platform AJ Bell said the concern is “people aren’t making decisions based on what’s best for them but because they are worried about possible changes to pensions tax incentives”.Currently, from the age of 55 (57 from April 2028) you can usually take up to 25% of your pension as a tax-free lump sum, to a limit of £268,275.However, there is speculation that the government may slash this maximum or make other changes.Stephen Lowe at the retirement specialist Just Group said rising living costs could be forcing more people to dip into their pension money to pay the bills, but added that the sums being withdrawn might also reflect concern the Treasury may view tax-free cash as “an easy target”.Splashing the cash: how wealthy retirees are avoiding ‘inheritance tax raid’Read moreThe figures came after what some called an “inheritance tax raid” on unspent pension money that was announced last October.Pensions tend not to be counted as part of a person’s estate for inheritance tax (IHT) purposes. However, from April 2027, money left in a defined contribution pensionwill be included in IHT calculations.In March, the Guardianreportedthat financial firms were reporting a “huge” increase in well-off older people taking sizeable sums out of their pensions to splash out on family holidays and give to their childrenThe question of whether to take cash out is a complicated area. For some well-off older people it could mean avoiding a bill later. Despite this, it is vital people ensure they have enough money to support themselves through their later years, so individual financial advice is worth seeking.Explore more on these topicsPensionsConsumer affairsFinancial Conduct AuthorityRachel ReevesBudget 2025BudgetRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Famously, it spawned era-defining pop stars including Spandau Ballet, Sade and Boy George. Equally, though, fashion was central to its success.A new exhibition at the Design Museum,Blitz: the Club That Shaped the 80s, attempts to unpack its cultural and sartorial history, featuring clothing, photography, magazines and even an Instagram-friendly recreation of the bar complete with beer bottles and a projection of Egan “playing” music.The exhibition includes items made by regulars such as the fashion designer Stephen Linard, who worked with David Bowie and Boy George, milliner Stephen Jones, BodyMap’s David Holah and Stevie Stewart, and Darla Jane Gilroy, who featured in the 1980video for Bowie’s Ashes to Ashes. It also showcases the sometimes breathtaking creativity of the clubbers’ outfits. The experimentation led to them mixing 1940s tailoring with theatrical costumes, charity shop finds, full faces of makeup and hair that defied gravity. In a video shown in the exhibition, one club-goer describes how it takes three hours for her to get ready to go out.View image in fullscreenLesley Chilkes wearing an ensemble by David Holah at the Blitz, about 1979.Photograph: Derek Ridgers/Unravel ProductionsThe objects included here – from club flyers to record covers and early editions of magazines such as i-D and the Face – are worth examining. But it’s the images of the so-called Blitz kids that most convincingly display the moment in time. A wall of photographs features the artistDuggie Fieldsin a 40s printed suit and quiff; two club-goers with makeup to resemble women in Picasso’s blue period; a woman dressed as Queen Elizabeth I; Linard in a lace ruff and pillbox hat and a man encased in clingfilm smoking a cigarette. Bowie, pictured in a leather shirt pouring a beer, looks relatively pedestrian by contrast.At a preview of the exhibition, the curator, Danielle Thom, said the time these young people were living in was part of why the looks were so experimental. “Fashion provided an element of escapism,” she said. “It’s the tail end of the winter of discontent, Thatcher has been elected … although, for the most part, they didn’t see themselves as especially political in the sense of being politically active, they were undoubtedly influenced by the political context of the day – rising unemployment, literally bin bags piled high in the streets.”View image in fullscreenTwo Blitz attendees, in about 1980.Photograph: Robyn Beeche FoundationPunk – although on its way out by 1979 – was essential to how the Blitz kids’ look developed. “In terms of their ethos and their work, the spirit of punk very much carried on – the idea of DIY and a disregard for existing hierarchies of taste,” says Thom. The young people who went to the Blitz often lived in squats, and rejected a 9-5 lifestyle. “[But] the visuals of punk, the predilection for deliberately offensive imagery, the deliberate ugliness as a provocation, that was consciously rejected by embracing elegance and a degree of romance.” Thom argues that, much like the music and graphic design of the time, the fashion was “quite postmodern – picking and choosing from the past to create something new”.View image in fullscreenSpandau Ballet’s debut photoshoot in 1980 at a squat in Warren Street, London.Photograph: Graham SmithIf the scene itself was tiny, Blitz soon loomed large in the media, thanks to Strange. “He was very proactive,” says Thom. “He would ring up journalists and say: ‘I’ve got this club night. You must come and have a look.’” As a lot of the TV footage and newspaper clips included in the exhibition show, the coverage was more likely to show alarm at the outfits than be in favour of them. Even so, Strange’s strategy worked – there were soon queues to get in on Tuesday night.Fashion, again, was central to policing this new popularity. “A lot has been made of the exclusivity, that you could only come in if you looked right. But that exclusivity was as much a safety strategy as it was about creating mystique,” says Thom. “Blitz wasn’t explicitly a gay club in the sense that Heaven might be, but it was a club in which many of the regular attendees were gay, were queer, were exploring their sexual identities.” Fashion allowed Strange – who stood at the door and decided who was allowed in – to protect his clientele. “This is London in 1980, not exactly a tolerant time or place,” says Thom. “Inside Blitz was a safe space – to use a contemporary term.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thom thinks this new interest is partly down to timing. “For people who weren’t there the first time, there’s novelty about just how analog everything was,” she says. “And for people in their 50s and 60s, it’s a hit of nostalgia.”More poignantly, there is a wistful fascination. “You can argue that many of the conditions that made [80s club culture] possible are being eroded,” says Thom. “Nightclubs are closing at an alarming ratebecause of rising rents, university is once again the preserve of those who can afford it. Even something as simple as sourcing your secondhand clothing, it’s a highly professionalised vintage marketplace, it’s not nipping to a charity shop and finding an amazing bargain.”Put in these terms, this exhibition is the latest in a series of shows that are about far more than outlandish outfits, hedonistic club kids and pop stars in their pomp. Says Thom: “I hope this serves as a warning as well as a love letter to the importance of club culture.”Explore more on these topicsFashionClub culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The men sway in a circle, singing plaintively. The women surround an elderly lady who smokes tobacco rolled in writing paper. And I settle into swapping stories with the girls. Alina and her younger cousins Miching and Blinka may be draped in the silks and heavy jewellery of the Indigenous Aath Pahariya Rai community, but they’re as keen to talk love and travel as any young women. “I’m too independent to get married until I’m very old,” declares 21-year-old Alina. “When I graduate, I want to go to Paris – and then come home to Sipting. Life’s peaceful here and the air is clear.”View image in fullscreenI’m in the little-visited Dhankuta region of eastern Nepal on a trip hosted byCommunity Homestay Network(CHN). This social enterprise is working with governmental organisations and non-profits such asHuman and Social Development Centre (Husadec)to support women – including Alina’s mother, Prem Maya – to open their homes to travellers. Since launching with just one homestay in Panauti, south-east of Kathmandu, in 2012, CHN has grown to more than 362 families across 40 communities. This is the first in the country’s rural east.View image in fullscreenThe writer stayed with Prem and her daughter AlinaAs rising temperatures, seasonal flooding and erratic monsoons force droves of Dhankuta’s subsistence farmers over the border into India, this remote region is turning to international tourism for the first time. Empowering women to earn without having to leave their villages, and working on sustainable rainwater-harvesting solutions, is central to this vision.While tourism contributed about $2.2bn (£1.64bn) to Nepal’s GDP in 2024, it remains concentrated around Khatmandu, trekking routes such as Everest and the Annapurna Circuit, the second city Pokhara and Chitwan national park. The result is overloaded infrastructure, traffic jams at key viewpoints and the economic benefits of the industry concentrated into just a few hands. Schemes such as CHN hope to spread the tourist dollar and offer visitors a memorable experience away from the crowds.View image in fullscreenThe orange-painted buildings of DhankutaAfter a 40-minute flight from Kathmandu and a two-hour-plus bus journey along a road that winds upwards like a series of sickle moons, our first stop is the town of Dhankuta. It served as the region’s administrative hub until the 1960s, when it sank into a slumber. At first, it appears the government’s new tourism policy might not have registered with local residents. As I wander past the orange-painted buildings, the sewing machine in a tailor’s shop stills as its owner looks up at me in astonishment; a shopper wearing a shirt emblazoned with the words “Mama’s little man” drops his bags to stare; and a woman freezes in her doorway, oblivious to the dal dripping from the wooden spoon she’s holding.“In the last few decades this neighbourhood was so empty that jackals roamed the streets,” explains our guide, Kalpana Bhattarai. “Locals painted it to celebrate their history as orange growers before climate change – and in the hope of appealing to visitors. It seems they’re a little surprised to see it actually working.” She flashes a winning smile, and they all beam back.View image in fullscreenA view on the hike through the hill forest to KhambelaBringing as many local people as possible into the tourism supply chain is central to CHN’s ethos, which is why it also runs programmes to train youngsters as guides. After a night in the comfortableHotel Murchunga Internationalin Dhankuta we meet one of the programme’s first two graduates, Nabin Rai of the Aath Pahariya Rai community. This morning, he’ll be leading the 7½-mile forest hike to his home village of Khambela for the first time and, given my incessant questions, I suspect this is a baptism of fire.‘When I come to the forest, it feels like my own house,’ Nabin Rai says, leading the wayAs we walk, he talks about his life as the only young man remaining in the village – staying behind partly to care for his disabled father and partly out of love for this place. “When I come to the forest, it feels like my own house,” he says, leading the way along a path studded with silver silica particles that gleam like the Tamor River below. “You can feel the gods here.”As we enter Khambela through trees woven with jasmine, Nabin points out the rainwater storage tanks installed by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), which help to supplement the unreliable supply from the government pipeline two hours away by foot.View image in fullscreenOne of the village elders in KhambelaThe hike ends with vegetable curry in a courtyard owned by a woman in her 60s who tells us to call herDidi(big sister), and observes our fascination with her home with quiet amusement. As we prepare to leave, she presses a veena into my hand: a hand-carved instrument that hums grudgingly when I blow through it and tug its string with clumsy enthusiasm.After another night at our hotel, we wander round Dhankuta’shaat(bazaar), where Rais, Magars, Limbus and people from several Hindu castes haggle for everything from buffalo-skin stools to cucumbers as fat as a child’s leg. Then we take the bus to Sipting to meet the Aath Pahariya Rai family, our hosts for the next few days.Prem leads the way up a dirt staircase hewn from the mountain to her home, the highest in the village. From its squat toilet to three bedrooms haunted by a kitten called Nimki, it’s impeccably clean and has arresting views over the valley’s forested floor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A towel folded in the shape of a butterfly and the light left on – a gesture that always reminds me of my parents – suggest that this couldn’t be more true.Over the next few days, I adjust to the rhythms of life in Prem’s house: the scent of cow dung and woodsmoke as I learn to fold large leaves that will be used as dishes; the way the valley appears almost flat beneath the midday heat, and becomes soft and deep in the afternoons; Alina recalling that when she was little and her father, Ram, carried her to bed, she fancied the stars were walking with them.“I can’t read or write beyond my name and have never earned my own money before. Now I’m a businesswoman,” says Prem, watching with approval as I demolish a millet pancake bursting with potato curry.The road winds through rhododendron forests and  villages where I sense that we are the first westerners local people have ever seenBy day, Kalpana leads us on intriguing outings. At Dhoje Dada, we climb through a mogul cemetery in a cloud that echoes with the calls of cuckoos, only for it to clear in rapid, smoke-like wisps to reveal the sunrise. As darkness swallows the mountains at Kachide, we harvest sour tree tomatoes and learn local recipes from a woman who is using the income to fund her daughters’ university educations.The road winds through dripping rhododendron forests and mountain villages where I sense that we are the first westerners local people have ever seen.Himalayan highs … and lows: trekking in NepalRead moreAt Cholung Park, most visitors seem more interested in watching me receive a blessing from a Mundhum samba (a figure in charge of rituals for the Limbu people, who flicks a leaf on to my throat that clings like a damp butterfly’s wing) than browsing the museum’s collection of sacred Limbu artefacts. Given the queues that now form at the peak of Everest and on Annapurna’s trails, getting such an unfiltered glimpse of Nepali life feels like an enormous privilege.For my final breakfast in Sipting, Ram watches through the window while Alina and Prem fill my pockets with freshly picked passion fruit and tuck a sprig of mugwort behind my ear to ward off evil spirits on the road to Janakpur. Prem patiently attempts to braid alacha dori(a colourful thread adorned with beads) of Alina’s into my slippery bob. “We’re so sad to see you leave,” she says. “Come back whenever you like – this is your home now.”The trip was provided byCommunity Homestay Network;itseight-dayEastern Nepal: The Road Less Takenadventure blends nature,Indigenous culture, homestays and hikesand costs US$2,359 for a single traveller, $2,657 for two or $3,597 for a group of four, including a local guide, ground transport, accommodation and most meals.

Managers at a factory in Halewood, Merseyside, told industry contacts there might have been a hack – although it was not clear then just how bad the situation was.That changed quickly on the Monday morning. JLR, the maker of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, quickly shut down systems afterrealising the severity of the cyber-attack. Three weeks later, the carmaker is still incapacitated, unable to produce at any of its factories across the UK, Slovakia, Brazil and India (although a Chinese joint venture is thought to be operating).The hack is likely to cost JLR hundreds of millions of pounds, and has caused turmoil across its sprawling supply chain – particularly in the West Midlands surrounding the company’s headquarters in Gaydon and the Solihull factory, where it makes its money-spinner Range Rovers. With little hope of an imminent restart, the UK government is facing increasing calls for financial support for suppliers that fear going bust if the sudden revenue drought continues.Officials at the Department for Business an Trade are understood to be speaking to JLR daily, while the National Cyber Security Centre has been working with the company since last Wednesday to provide support in relation to the incident.View image in fullscreenJaguar Land Rover’s chief executive, Adrian Mardell, pictured with Keir Starmer, has oversee a turnaround strategy called ‘reimagine’.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty ImagesMorale has – unsurprisingly – been badly hit across the workforce. Factory workers have been toldnot to return until at least Wednesday, but several people close to JLR believe the wait could be longer still. Managers may have access to emails, but computer-aided design, engineering software and product life-cycle software was down this week. However, the company has put in workarounds to make payments and ship cars to customers, and has focused on keeping existing customers happy with a flow of spare parts.The JLR chief executive, Adrian Mardell, had been planning a quiet few months before stepping down after three years at the top (and 35 years at the company). Instead, he and JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Group, have been plunged into weeks of scrambling to restart production. Mardell met the business and trade minister Chris Bryant last week to discuss the incident, and government officials are in daily contact for updates.The hack will cast a shadow over Mardell’s legacy. His task over three years in charge had been to oversee a turnaround strategy, called “reimagine”, that involved selling fewer cars but at much higher prices. That resulted in11 consecutive quarters of profits, despite Donald Trump’s tariffsand global instability prompted by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Mardell had alsodecided to wait for the right momentfor a new electric Range Rover and thenew Jaguar after a controversial rebrand– with further delays now possible.Outsourced cybersecurityJLR has beenowned since 2008by Tata Group. The carmaker is not the only part of the sprawling conglomerate to have questions to answer after the hack: in 2023 JLR outsourced a huge part of its computer systems to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). TCS is one of the biggest outsourcing companies in the world and makes the bulk of the dividends paid out to the Tata family’s holding company.TCS has been at the centre of the response to the hack that has crippled JLR, with a large number of employees scrambling to work out the source of the intrusion. TCS did not respond to requests for comment.Under the five-year, £800m contract agreed in 2023, TCS and JLR planned to “rapidly transform, simplify, and manage its digital and IT estate, supporting its broader strategic business transformation”. TCS runs large parts of JLR’s key computer systems, ranging from its networks to data connections, and, crucially, its cybersecurity.Part of the reimagine strategy required more flexible software to enable the luxury carmaker to produce Range Rovers in precisely the configuration demanded by the global rich paying £120,000 plus – all while retaining the efficiency of a high-volume factory.“I would argue that JLR’s software is probably more complex than Nasa putting a spacecraft into space,” said one supplier (with perhaps a touch of hyperbole). “When it works it’s a thing of wonder. This has exposed it.”One of TCS’s jobs was to manage the upgrade of JLR factory systems to the latest software from the German company SAP. That software was vital to managing production of vehicles and getting parts to the right place at the right time, as well as the “handshake” systems that link to other suppliers. SAP declined to comment.View image in fullscreenThe hack will raise questions for TCS, which runs large parts of JLR’s key computer systems.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyIn a video with JLR published on TCS’s website, the TCS president of manufacturing, Anupam Singhal, highlights “smart factories where everything is connected” to try to “remove waste” and use artificial intelligence to “avoid plant downtime”.The fact that “everything is connected” in JLR’s systems appears to have become a vulnerability. When it discovered the intrusion, the carmaker was unable to isolate factories or functions, forcing it to shut down most of its systems.The hack will raise questions for TCS, which alsoworks with Marks & Spencerandthe Co-op, two British retailers who suffered attacks this year. Reuters reported in May that TCS was the “means of access” for hackers to get into M&S’s systems over the Easter weekend. TCS said in a June statement that “no TCS systems or users were compromised”.The links with the JLR attack and the retail incidents have led to speculation that the hacks could have been carried out by the same group. The M&S and Co-op hacks have been blamed on an English-language speaking hacking community known as Scattered Spider. Four arrests have been made in the UK in relation to the M&S and Co-op hacks.Soon after the JLR incident achannel on the Telegram platformposted a screenshot of what appeared to be the carmaker’s internal IT systems, as well as a news article about the attack. The channel’s name was, pointedly, a combination of Scattered Spider and two other English-language-speaking, or western-based, hacking groups known as Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters.M&S was a ransomware attack, a form of hack that effectively locks up a target’s IT systems and is typically associated with groups based in former Soviet states. JLR has not confirmed the nature of the attack that has closed its factories.One piece of circumstantial evidence was a person on the Telegram channel called Rey, who shared the same pseudonym as a member of Hellcat, the English-language speaking ransomware gang that claimed to have extracted data from JLR earlier this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One law enforcement source advised caution against taking anything from the channel at face value.JLR declined to discuss details of the hack.Supply chain pressureJLR has access to about £6bn in cash, likely enough resources to cope with the crisis even without the help of its huge parent conglomerate, Tata.Jim Williamson of the bond rating agency CreditSights estimated that JLR could burn through as much as £900m of cash in September, with a £1.7bn decline in working capital – although it could probably recoup a big chunk of that through catchup sales. Williamson added that JLR had “plenty of options” if it needed short-term cash, including issuing new debt, borrowing from banks, or event the government’s UK Export Finance to save the day.But for some companies in the supply chain the problems may be existential.JLR has set up a help desk for suppliers. Yet some believe the government needs to step in. JLR has not asked for state support for itself, but is trying to share information on the extent of its supply chain, which may include more than 700 companies making the 30,000 parts that can make up a luxury car.View image in fullscreenJLR’s supply chain may include more than 700 companies making the 30,000 parts in a luxury car.Photograph: Matt Crossick/Alamy“It would be irresponsible if the government didn’t do something if they’re committed to the automotive sector,” said one supplier. “Government need to move quickly.”For supply chain workers,every day without production raises the threatto their jobs. The Aim-listed insulation supplier Autins Group and the German seat controls manufacturer Brose said workers would be paid for “banked” hours to be worked later on, while the axel maker Dana, the seat maker Lear Corporation and the sunroof maker Webasto were among the other companies where temporary or permanent workers’ jobs were at risk.The Unite union said the government needed to step in with a furlough scheme to pay wages of factory worker members unable to work, amid concern for the fate of the supply chain.The industry minister Chris McDonald said on Friday JLR was “taking the lead on support for their own supply chain”. A government source did not rule out some form of support – although a furlough scheme is thought to be unlikely. The government is focusing on working out if supplier collapses could hold up a restart.Meanwhile many people in JLR are still in “investigation mode”, according to one person close to the company – while others try to rebuild systems in parallel. Several people said the company genuinely did not know when it would be able to restart.Even when JLR manages to recover its computer systems, the restart will be complicated by more than a thousand cars on lines in various stages of build. JLR will either have to make individual plans for the parts needed for each vehicle on the production lines, or manually move the vehicles off the lines and then try to put them back into the system.“Does it feel like it’s going to be months?” a supplier said. “Maybe. Is it weeks? Absolutely.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He learned this week that the case against him had been abandoned.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersUK newsThe aide, the associate, the ‘Chinese agent’ – and the collapse of a long-awaited UK spy trialCase against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry was suddenly dropped, leaving questions for CPSDan SabbaghandAmy HawkinsSat 20 Sep 2025 04.04 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 04.16 EDTShareShortly before 10am on Monday, the Conservative MP Alicia Kearns received an unwelcome phone call. “I don’t know how to tell you this,” said the specialist police officer on the line. Ten minutes later the Old Bailey heard what Kearns now knew. A long-awaited trial of two men – a former parliamentary aide to Kearns, Christopher Cash, and an associate, Christopher Berry – accused of spying for Chinawas to be abandoned. “The cops were equally disappointed,” Kearns told the Guardian.The trial had been expected to be an extraordinary test of London’s already fraught relationship with Beijing. Scheduled to begin at Woolwich crown court on 6 October, it had been expected to hear allegations that “politically sensitive” information was passing from Westminster to a member of China’s ruling politburo.Kearns, a key witness, had no forewarning. A week earlier, police from the Metropolitan police’s SO15 unit, which handles spy as well as terror cases, had called to arrange a familiarisation visit to the court for her. Now she has been left frustrated. “Something is very amiss. If the Crown Prosecution Service has the evidence, why not put it in front of a jury and test it?” she said.The CPS said the case had been “kept under continuous review”. Prosecutors said on Monday that the “evidential standard” was “no longer met”, though the same standard applied when the two men were charged in April 2024 for allegedly breaching the Official Secrets Act, a decision to prosecute that required the consent of the then attorney general, the Conservative Victoria Prentis.Cash and Berry, who had always maintained their innocence, now had no case to answer. Cash said outside the court: “The last two and a half years have been a nightmare for me and my family.” . Berry’s solicitor, John Armstrong, complained that his client had “not been given the satisfaction of knowing why it was dropped”.Cash, 30, was first an intern, then a researcher and finally the director of the China Research Group, a group of Beijing-sceptic Conservative MPs set up in April 2020. Its first chair was Tom Tugendhat, and Cash assisted him on China issues. After Tugendhat became security minister in September 2022, Kearns succeeded him as chair and inherited Cash.View image in fullscreenAlicia Kearns.Photograph: Parliament TVSoon after, the backbencher also became chair of the foreign affairs select committee. At the end of November that year, Kearns led a delegation of MPs from the committee to visit Taiwan, a trip that was heavily criticised by Beijing, which considers the island nation to be part of its territory.The young researcher, a Mandarin speaker, was “very capable”, Kearns said. She asked Cash to obtain a parliamentary pass – a process that requires a degree of vetting – so he could be more readily available, though he was normally based at a serviced office in Waterloo.Kearns described Cash as somebody who “often described his love of China – but was always heavily critical of the Communist party”. Cash helped the MP lobby to insert national security provisions aimed at preventing Chinese companies from undercutting British rivals into a procurement bill and expose the presence of covert Chinese police stations in the UK.She said he was within the trusted personal circles of her staff. Nevertheless, she was confident he had “no access to anything secret” because she was not in government, though she acknowledged he had no shortage of “colour on how parliament works; what do MPs read, consume, how they operate”.Allies describe Cash as an “old-school guy” who felt a strong loyalty to the UK. “Having always been a law-abiding citizen and working in an area in which I was committed to promoting the interests of my country, I was suddenly accused of betraying that country,” Cash said on Monday, reflecting on his shock at what had been for him and his friend Berry a dizzying turn of events.For months their arrest in March 2023 remained secret in normally gossipy Westminster. It wasnot until that Septemberthat newspapers picked up the story, but details were limited because it was legally difficult to discuss the case before it came to trial.The case that the CPS outlined in April 2024 can now be reported on, though prosecutors ultimately decided the evidence for their version of events did not meet the standard required.The CPS alleged a simple chain of communication from Cash to Beijing’s politburo. An individual judged to be “a Chinese intelligence agent” was said to have commissioned at least 34 reports from Berry on subjects of political interest, some of the ideas for which were touted by Berry. In turn, the CPS alleged, Berry obtained information for inclusion from Cash.Christopher Berry is now a self-employed financial analyst ‘just trying to pick up the pieces’.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PAThe two had known each other for several years: both were teachers in China’s eastern city of Hangzhou between 2017 and 2019. Though the CPS claimed “most of the information” provided by Cash was solicited by Berry, it said over time Cash shared “unsolicited, ‘off the record’ information too”.Meanwhile, the “Chinese agent” was alleged by the CPS to have passed on “politically sensitive information” obtained from Cash via Berry to a “senior member of the Chinese Communist party and a politburo member”. This was deemed “prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK” because the information they passed on was “directly or indirectly useful to the Chinese state”.China criticised the proceedings from the outset, using language typical of its public pronouncements. This week a spokesperson for the embassy said the allegations were “entirely fabricated and malicious slander”.Cash did not have to defend himself in court but allies say he was neither paid nor blackmailed into helping. Though he accepts he passed on information to Berry in good faith, it was said to be material in the public domain on how parliament or British politics works, or uncomplicated analyses – who he thought would win the next election.Berry’s legal team was expected to argue that he believed the 34 reports at the centre of the case were written for a corporate client in China looking to expand in the UK. Armstrong, his lawyer, said the reports were a “confection of open-source material from various sources”, with Berry “offering his thoughts on contemporary politics”. Any information from Cash was unclassified Westminster gossip, he said.Some speculate that prosecutors were responding to political pressure as Labour tries to improve the UK’s trading relationship with China. Kearns noted that Keir Starmer was “hoping to visit” China, perhaps sometime in 2026, and she accused Labour of a “supine approach” to the ruling Communist party.On Monday a Downing Street spokesperson said it was “extremely disappointing that these individuals will not face trial”. Similar comments were made by the security minister, Dan Jarvis, during a Commons debate on Monday in which multiple MPs were critical of the outcome. The decision to drop the case had been “an independent one” for the prosecutors, Jarvis said.Luke de Pulford, the executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, believes that if the case had gone ahead the defendants would have tried “to litigate the question as to whether China was an enemy”. Such a definition was required by the 1911 Official Secrets Act, under which the two were prosecuted, though it is not by its replacement, the 2023 National Security Act.Defining China as an enemy goes beyond normal government language and may not have pleased Beijing. In last June’s strategic defence review, China was said to pose “sophisticated and persistent challenge” to the UK. However, the issue is well established and was known about when Cash and Berry were charged.Prosecutorsdeny that any outside pressureplayed a part in their decision. It may have been a surprise, but the CPS says it concluded that the case was no longer strong enough, leaving two wrecked lives in its wake. Armstrong, Berry’s lawyer, said his client, now a self-employed financial analyst, was “just trying to pick up the pieces”.Cash, meanwhile, said he was unhappy to see some MPs still trying to imply he had a case to answer. “My arrest has destroyed my life and the career I loved,” he said. “This further campaign to assert my guilt simply amplifies the injustice that I have already had to face. I will comment more in due course.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsConservativesEspionageChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Just days before Trump returned to office, Biden’s administration announced an extension of the status .Noem rescinded the extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who benefited from the 2023 designation.“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court’s orders on the emergency docket,” the justice department told the supreme court in its filing.Some lower courts have expressed confusion and frustration in recent weeks as they attempt to follow supreme court emergency orders that sometimes come with little reasoning – or none at all.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationVenezuelaAmericasTrump administrationUS supreme courtUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Chen was sentenced to 15 years in prison on 22 August.“These executives turned a Chinese chemical company into a pipeline of poison, shipping hundreds of kilos of fentanyl-related precursors into the United States, disguising them as everyday goods, and cashing in through cryptocurrency,” Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) chief Terrance Cole said in a statement.Wang and Chen were among eight Chinese nationals and four Chinese companies charged by the justice department in June 2023 with trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals into the US.It was the first time the United States had charged Chinese companies for trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals inside the United States, rather than shipping them to Mexico, the origin of most of the fentanyl found in the country.Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more powerful than heroin and much easier and cheaper to produce. It has largely replaced heroin and prescription opioids such as oxycodone as a cause of overdoses in the United States.The June 2023 indictment of the Chinese executives and companies drew protests from Beijing.“It is completely illegal and seriously damages the basic human rights of Chinese citizens and Chinese companies,” the Chinese foreign ministry said at the time. “China strongly condemns this.”Although Mexico has been the main source of fentanyl sold in the United States, Washington has increasingly focused its attention on China-based suppliers of ingredients.Explore more on these topicsUS newsNew YorkUS politicsFentanylChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The documents reveal:Their meeting was locked in just days before;Officials’ uncertainty over the status of the meeting;The response among Australian officials when the US president cancelled meetings with Albanese and other world leaders.Newsroom edition: Albanese gears up for a tricky Trump test - podcastRead moreThe prime ministerlast week claimed“in the real world, no one cares” when he meets Trump – but a bevy of staff inside the departments of prime minister and cabinet (PM&C) and foreign affairs (Dfat) had worked to secure the June bilateral.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThree FoI requests to the foreign affairs minister’s office, Dfat and the prime minister’s department returned 103 pages of correspondence related to the meeting slated for Kananaskis, Canada. Nearly all correspondence was redacted by the departments under Freedom of Information Act exemptions allowing redactions if information was “communicated in confidence by or on behalf of a foreign government”.But unredacted texts and email chains, including between US ambassador Kevin Rudd, Dfat secretary Jan Adams, Albanese’s office and senior diplomats, reveal the meeting was only confirmed on 13 June, five days before it was scheduled for 18 June. Trump abruptly left the G7 on 17 June.On 13 June, a text on messaging app Signal to Adams from an unidentified sender – likely a senior Dfat official – read “some good news. Meeting now confirmed.”Another text to Adams, undated but likely on the same day, read: “really pleased with getting meeting confirmed”.Earlier that day, texts between a Dfat official and another unidentified recipient discussed negotiations for the meeting. The recipient is again likely a senior bureaucrat.The Dfat official writes “fun. Thanks. I’ll let PMC know” in response to a redacted message. Two further messages are nearly entirely redacted, before the other person replies to the Dfat official “WH now confirmed for 510pm Tuesday for bilat”.Several emails to and from Rudd around that time are entirely redacted.It is not unusual for meetings at international conferences to be confirmed close to the date, owing to complicated travel schedules and packed itineraries. But the documents also show uncertainty among Australian officials about locking in the meeting.On 12 June, a Dfat assistant secretary noted in an email that White House press secretary, Katherine Leavitt, had spoken about Trump’s G7 meetings. Leavitt that day mentioned Trump would meet “quite a few” foreign leaders, which the White House was still finalising.Republicans warn Australia of ‘punitive measures’ over recognition of Palestinian stateRead moreThe Dfat assistant secretary wrote: “the White House had decided to agree to a meeting between the President and the Prime Minister in Alberta. They did not know when precisely the meeting would occur. But that was what they’re working towards.”The next day, 13 June, Jason Robertson – deputy head of Australia’s embassy in Washington – emailed senior Dfat officials with an update that Trump’s travel to Canada for the G7 was “still on” and officials were “still working on bilateral meetings”.Shortly after Trump departed the G7, Dfat officials circulated “talking points” with the email subject line “PM-Trump meeting not proceeding”.Talking points memos are commonly circulated by politicians and departments to ensure a consistent message, explanation or response for developments.Headlined “Australia’s reaction to President Trump cancelling his meeting with Prime Minister Albanese”, the talking points circulated by Dfat state that Australian officials “understand why President Trump felt it necessary to leave the G7 early due to global events.”“The meeting between Prime Minister Albanese and President Trump couldn’t go ahead, along with several other engagements the President had scheduled,” the talking points state.“They [Albanese and Trump] have spoken three times now by phone – all were very constructive conversations.”The talking points, unsurprisingly, closely mirrorpublic responses from Albanese and other Labor MPs. Albanese recently spoke to Trump on the phone for a fourth time.Last week, Albanese downplayed the importance of a meeting. On ABC TV, Albanese claimed: “It is journalists who are obsessed by this.”“We will meet when we meet … people’s arrangements will be finalised when they’re finalised.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAnthony AlbaneseDonald TrumpUS foreign policyFreedom of informationAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The airport described the planned construction as its biggest expansion since the 2000 games.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe airport’s chief executive, Scott Charlton, has said Kingsford Smith must compete with the new, government-owned Western Sydney airport, scheduled to open in late 2026. The new airport is aiming for 82 million passengers annually by 2063.But already there are concerns about Western Sydney’s viability, not least because of uncertainty overtransport links. So what does Kingsford Smith’s plan mean for the new contender out west? Here are the winners and losers in the contest for Sydney’s airspace.The plansSydney airport’s draft 2045 master plan – open to feedback until December – accommodates 36.4 million international passengers and 36.2 million domestic and regional passengers by 2045.Freight will grow to 1.4m tonnes annually, more than double current levels.The plan centres around the linking of the two domestic terminals, T2 and T3, adding up to 12 international gates to create a precinct from which regional, domestic and overseas services all depart. Two further gates will be added to the T1 international terminal.View image in fullscreenThe Western Sydney international airport terminal building. The airport plans to service 10 million passengers by 2033.Photograph: Trevor Mein/Western Sydney International AirportMeanwhile, Western Sydney airport’s 2045 master plan – subject to government approval later this year – details steps to reach 10 million total passengers by 2033, and 19.3 million by 2045.Its freight volumes are projected to rise to about 547,000 tonnes annually by 2045, with long-term forecasts at 1.8m tonnes annually.The new airport’s domestic and international services will operate from a single terminal, and just one runway until at least the 2050s.The winnersThe head of the school of project management at the University of Sydney, Nader Naderpajouh, says competition is a good thing for travellers and airlines. “Now we have an airport that is … pushing the other airport to also improve and expand.”While Sydney airport’s passenger numbers are forecast to go up 75% by 2045, the number of flights will go up by 34%.Mathew Hounsell, a transport expert at the University of Technology Sydney, says passenger targets will be achieved by increasing passenger density and load, “which means cramming more people in and using wide-body aircraft”. That may mean more competitive fares from the airport, but don’t expect lots of legroom.Sydney’s master plan also confirms changes to flight paths, principally to its main north-south runway, to accommodate Western Sydney airport’s 24-hour runway. Sydney airport’s three runways are subject to an 11pm to 6am curfew.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the airport’s distance from the CBD means it won’t make a dent in Sydney airport’s “cash cow” routes to Brisbane, Canberra and Melbourne, he says.Flight path changes will see the route taken by planes on Sydney airport’s north-south runway shift west slightly, over inner-west suburbs including Dulwich Hill and Ashfield, offering suburbs closer to the CBD some respite at the expense of others.“There would be some relief,” says Hounsell of the airport’s noise-reduction strategy, adding that the airport’s promise of quieter planes, such as the Airbus A350, is only “a relative measure”. The airport’s master plan still references its cap of 80 movements an hour, which is a plane taking off every 45 seconds.The losersHounsell says Western Sydney airport stands to lose out from its rival’s ambitious master plan, characterising it as move to “kneecap” its new competitor.Sydney airport declined to comment on the potential impact of its 2045 targets on its rival. A spokesperson for Western Sydney airport said its targets remained the same, and its position as “Sydney’s only 24-hour international gateway” meant it was “well-positioned” to bring in new operators.Only four airlines – Qantas, Jetstar, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand – have so far confirmed their plans to use the new airport. Hounsell says the airport may need to “take a chill pill” when it comes to 80 million passenger target.Naderpajouh says neither airports’ plan takes into account the impact of the climate crisis on the number of passengers wanting to travel.Hounsell says the airports haven’t factored in the effects of rising house and energy prices and stagnant wages on passenger demand, adding high targets also show “no one in this industry is considering climate change”, including pollution.Asked about the impact of high passenger targets on the climate, Sydney airport’s spokesperson deferred to the climate resilience strategy in its master plan, which sets out its plan to achieve net zero emissions in its operations by 2030.A spokesperson for Western Sydney airport said the new terminal incorporated recycled materials, as well as thousands of solar panels. It has infrastructure to support sustainable aviation fuel and electric ground services vehicles “over the years ahead”.Of the timing of Sydney airport’s push and its impact on a fledging Western Sydney airport, Naderpajouh says there is “never a right time for a project”. He cites the Opera House, which was “hugely over time, massively over budget”.“When you look at it 50 years after, it’s a great success, not only for Sydney, but the whole of Australia.”Explore more on these topicsTransportAir transportSydneyTourism (Australia)Airline industryNew South WalesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Authorities did not rule out additional arrests in the coming days as they review camera footage.Thousands of people joined a protest organised by a rightwing activist demanding stricter immigration policies and a clampdown on asylum seekers, just more than a month before a national election.Large groups of protesters, many waving Dutch flags and flags associated with far-right groups, clashed violently with the police, throwing rocks and bottles, footage from broadcaster NOS showed.A police car was set on fire and a group of protesters briefly blocked a highway near the site of the demonstration.Local media reported that protesters also smashed several windows at the headquarters of the centre-left D66 party.“Scum. You keep your hands off political parties,” the D66 party’s leader, Rob Jetten, wrote on X. “If you think you can intimidate us, tough luck. We will never let extremist rioters take our beautiful country away.”A smaller group of rioters headed for the Dutch parliament complex, which is fenced off as it undergoes renovation.Geert Wilders, the anti-migration populist politician who won the previous election in theNetherlands, was invited to speak at the demonstration but did not attend.Instead Wilders, who has retained his lead in opinion polls in the lead-in to the 29 October vote, condemned the violence on X, saying the use of force against police was “utterly unacceptable”, and calling those involved “idiots” and “scum”.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has said she is being kept informed.“I’m aware of an incident affecting airline check-in and boarding, impacting flights at Heathrow and other European airports,” said Alexander. “I’m getting regular updates and monitoring the situation. If you’re flying at Heathrow today, check with your airline before travelling.”The attack has affected Collins’ Muse software. The company is a subsidiary of RTX, which advises other firms on cybersecurity, as well as providing services supporting military operations.Heathrow said passengers should check their flight status before travelling, and asked them not to arrive any earlier than three hours before a longhaul flight, or two hours before a domestic one.View image in fullscreenPassengers have been warned not to arrive any earlier than three hours before a longhaul flight, or two hours before a domestic one.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersBrussels airport said the attack happened on Friday night and it meant the check-in and boarding processes could only be handled manually. It said the problem was in Collins’ hands, adding: “This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations of flights.” The airport advised passengers to check their flight status with their airline and only travel to the airport if their flight was confirmed.Berlin airport said: “Due to a technical issue at a system provider operating across Europe, there are longer waiting times at check-in. We are working on a quick solution.”Collins Aerospace said: “We have become aware of a cyber-related disruption to our Muse software in select airports. We are actively working to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to our customers as quickly as possible.“The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations. We will share more details as they are available.”The European Commission said it was “closely monitoring” the cyber-attack, adding: “While passengers are facing disruption, aviation safety and air traffic control remain unaffected … Current signs do not indicate a widespread or severe attack.”Prof Alan Woodword, a professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey, said the incident raised serious questions over why the airports appear to be reliant on Collins to fix the issue with Muse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said that, if the system was indeed centralised, this left open the possibility the attackers had so far picked only some of the airports they could target.Maria Casey, from Aldershot in Hampshire, was on her way to a two-week backpacking holiday in Krabi, southern Thailand, flying through Abu Dhabi.

That deterrent has to be plausible and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong,” Stubb told the Guardian, in an interview in Helsinki before travelling to New York for the UN general assembly.He said the guarantees would only come into effect after a future deal betweenUkraineand Russia, but insisted that Russia would have no veto over their format.“Russia has absolutely no say in the sovereign decisions of an independent nation state … So for me it’s not an issue will Russia agree or not. Of course they won’t, but that’s not the point,” he said.After the Paris meeting last month, the French president,Emmanuel Macron, told reporters that 26 nations had committed to be part of a “reassurance force” in Ukraine, with some of them committing to be present “on the ground, in the sea or in the air”.However, the big question many in Kyiv have is whether the arrangements would come with concrete commitments. When asked if the guarantees would mean European countries were saying they would be ready to engage militarily with Russia in the case of future aggression against Ukraine, Stubb said: “That is the idea of security guarantees by definition.”It is far from clear that there is political will for this kind of commitment in most European capitals, however, where promises to a postwar Ukraine have usually been framed more as “reassurance” than as firm commitments. Up to now, the policy of most western countries has been to offer support to Ukraine but minimise the risk of a direct conflict with Russia. But Stubb said any guarantees would be meaningless if not backed up with real force.“Security guarantees in essence are a deterrent and that deterrent has to be plausible, and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong. And that means also strategic communication, so we’re not making security guarantees into the air, but we’re making real security guarantees and Russia knows that,” said Stubb.Stubbhas emerged as a key player in peace negotiationsin recent months, forging a close relationship with the US president, Donald Trump, including through rounds of golf. The personal connection has meant that Finland, with a population of just 5.6 million, has been able to play an outsized role in communications between Trump and European leaders. Stubb said he and Trump are still in contact regularly, “by phone and other means” and that he expects the pair to have a bilateral meeting this week.Stubb has said on several occasions this year that the US president was beginning to lose patience with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, but so far Trump’s occasional tough words on Putin have not translated into action, and a series of Trump-set deadlines for progress to be made on arriving at a peace deal have passed without much follow-up. Instead, Trump rolled out the red carpet forPutin in Alaska last month.Stubb said he thought progress was being made, but “it’s not a big bazooka, it’s step-by-step”. On the question of whether there is a point when Europe has to accept that the US is not a reliable ally when it comes to Ukraine negotiations, Stubb said his nation had little option but to try as hard as possible to be friendly with the Trump administration.Zelenskyy accuses allies of ‘wasting time’ as he prepares for Trump meetingRead more“I think it’s the job of the president ofFinlandto get along with the president of the United States, whoever he is,” said Stubb. “Foreign policy is always based on three pillars. It’s values, interests and power. Small states only have values and interests … but we can have influence instead of power. Engagement is better than disengagement, come hell or high water,” he added.Last week, Stubb was in Kyiv where he met the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and said he came away from the trip “confident” that Ukraine could continue fighting a long war if necessary, dismissing suggestions to the contrary as “fake news”.Stubb said much of the focus at the UN this week will be on Palestine, but that he hopes to have several meetings with Zelenskyy and others related to Ukraine. On security guarantees, he said an “American backstop” would be necessary to give them real force, and conceded that there is not yet a full sense of what the Trump administration is willing to commit.However, the talk of guarantees may all be purely hypothetical if progress is not made first on a negotiated end to the war. Zelenskyy has said many times he is willing to meet Putin, as demanded by Trump, but Putin has said he would only meet Zelenskyy in Moscow, or if numerous Russian demands are met first.Stubb conceded that there did not currently appear much chance of bringing Putin to the table. “This war is too big for him to lose. He has made probably the biggest strategic mistake in recent history, certainly since the end of the cold war, and he has failed in all of his strategic aims. It’s a question when he comes to the negotiating table, hopefully sooner rather than later, but right now I’m quite pessimistic,” said Stubb.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeFinlandVolodymyr ZelenskyyEmmanuel MacronVladimir PutinDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "12h ago10.14 EDTClosing summaryThis blog will be closing shortly, below is a recap of today’s developments:Polish and allied aircraft were deployed early on Saturday to ensure the safety of Polish airspace after Russia launched airstrikes targeting westernUkrainenear the border with Poland, armed forces of the Nato-member country said.“Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, while ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have been brought to the highest state of readiness,” the operational command said in a post on X.Russia fired 40 missiles and about 580 drones at Ukraine in a “massive attack” that killed three and wounded dozens, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday.“Every such strike is not a military necessity but a deliberate strategy by Russia to terrorise civilians and destroy our infrastructure,” Zelenskyy said on social media, urging Kyiv’s allies to provide more air defence systems and hit Moscow with extra sanctions. He said attacks took place across nine regions, including Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Kyiv, Odesa, Sumy and Kharkiv.Sergiy Lysak, the head of the Ukrainian military administration in the Dnipropetrovsk region, said Russia’s latest strikes killed one person and wounded 30, with one man in a serious condition.Vyacheslav Chaus from the regional administration in Chernigiv in northern Ukraine said a 62-year-old man died in a drone attack. About 20 residential buildings were damaged in the Khmelnytskyi region, local official Sergiy Tyurin said on Telegram, adding that one body was found “during the extinguishing of a fire in one of the houses.”A Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s south-western Samara region killed four people,the local governor said on Saturday as Kyiv saidUkrainehad been targeted with hundreds of Russian drones overnight.A cyber-attack at a service provider for check-in and boarding systems has disrupted operations at several major European airports including London’s Heathrow, Brussels and Berlin’s Brandenburg, causing flight delays and cancellations on Saturday.Collins Aerospace owner RTX said on Saturday that it had become aware of a cyber-related disruption to its MUSE software in selected airports, adding that it was “actively working to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to our customers as quickly as possible”.Volodymyr Zelenskyy will urge Donald Trump to impose sanctions on Russia when they meet next week at the United Nations in New York, and has called on Ukraine’s allies to “stop wasting time”.Zelenskyy said he expected further sanctions to be imposed ifVladimir Putinrefuses to meet him for face-to-face talks or to agree to a ceasefire. “If the war continues and there are no moves towards peace we expect sanctions,” he said.Three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland on Friday,Estoniasaid, triggering complaints of a dangerous new provocation from the EU and Nato.Italian F-35 fighters attached to Nato’s air defence support mission in the Baltic states were scrambled to intercept the Russian jets and warn them off, Estonian and Italian officials said, with alliance chief Mark Rutte praising the “quick and decisive response”.Russia’s defence ministry on Friday denied that three of its MiG-31 fighter jets had illegally entered Estonian airspace.The ministry said the jets were on a “scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states, as confirmed by objective monitoring”.Zelenskyy on Friday condemned the move, calling the 12-minute incursion “outrageous” and accusing Moscow of deliberately expanding its “destabilising activity” three and a half years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.“These are not accidents. This is a systematic Russian campaign directed against Europe, against Nato, against the West. And it requires a systemic response,” Zelenskyy posted on X.UK chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce plans to explore using frozen Russian assets to fund a “reparations loan” that could provide billions of pounds for Ukraine’s war effort.The chancellor is expected to make the announcement at a meeting with her European counterparts in Copenhagen on Saturday, saying it is “right to explore all options to support Ukraine”.One or more large fires erupted early on Saturday at Russia’s Saratov oil refinery as it was hit heavily by Ukrainian drones that attacked the target deep inside Russian territory for at least the second time in a week.Videos vetted and posted by online analysts showed incoming UAVs followed by big explosions and flames rising from the site while air raid sirens blared. The major refinery is nearly 600km (370 miles) east of the frontline in Ukraine. The Russian governor in the area, Roman Busargin, confirmed an attack by UAVs.Share"

This was not the case, he said, among the younger generation, many of whom have formed a collective to encourage and inspire one another to take risks and have fun. Others to break through recently with their directorial debuts include Emilie Blichfeldt, withThe Ugly Stepsister, and Thea Hvistendal, withHandling the Undead.“What is so great is that all of us have a very different visuality. That’s a really important thing in Norwegian cinema,” said Ullmann Tøndel. “Because inSwedenfor example, everybody tried to make Ruben Östlund films for a while and in Denmark everyone tried to make Lars von Trier films for a while. So we really try to nurture our own singularity.”If there is a face of this new wave, then it is almost certainly the unvarnished expressions ofRenate Reinsve, who can be found collapsing into seven minutes of laughter in Armand and finding her way through the micro-details of romantic relationships in all their joy, pain, awkwardness and humour as she did in the 2021 hitThe Worst Person in the World.“She is so intuitive and smart, and goes very deep into her roles, but she does it with a lightness,” said Ullmann Tøndel, adding that she is also very funny. “She has a remarkable understanding, it seems, of what makes us human.”View image in fullscreenRenate Reinsve in Joachim Trier’s The Worst Person in the World (2021).Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyNorway’s newfound international stature in the film world has not gone unnoticed by its neighbours.“It hurts to admit it because of our countries’ eternal rivalry, but Norway is light years ahead of Sweden in terms of cultivating original cinematic voices,” said Kristoffer Viita, an author and film critic for the Swedish broadcaster SVT.While Viita takes some consolation from the fact that Ullman Tøndel’s grandfather – the legendary director Ingmar Bergman – was Swedish, he is not sure that the young Norwegian director would have been able to follow his same path in Sweden, where the film industry is focused mainly on Swedish audiences.Henriette Steenstrup, who wrote and starred in Pernille, said that as a Norwegian she had not expected her series to be an international success – because of the specifically Norwegian society it showed. Unlike Nordic noir’s focus on crime and detectives, her series focused on everyday subjects such as family and loss. “There is a lot of drama in everyday life,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Especially since the streamers are not doing as much drama and films and TV series as they did, that’s an issue.”There was also the problem of streamers seeking to make films more appealing to wider audiences, which Hauff Hvattum said could result in making them generic. “If you want to tell a story that is honest and precise, I believe that is easier if you write out of a local perspective to capture the nuances – it’s more interesting,” she said.View image in fullscreenHenriette Steenstrup in Pernille. ‘There is a lot of drama in everyday life,’ she said.Photograph: NetflixKjersti Mo, the CEO of the NFI, said Norway’s success was the product of long-term state investment in film-making – about 670m NOK (£50m) this year – and the professionalisation of its film industry in terms of working with international partners.The NFI tries to help independent film-makers in the way it structures their financing, by making it dependent on theatrical release and owning their own rights. “We have to empower our creatives and producers so that they still have a choice,” said Mo. “In the ecosystem the money from the streamers still matters but we will not let them design everything.” The NFI’s job, she said, was to “empower the art side” of film-making.Contrary to an overall move towards dumbing down, Mo said that increasingly, films selected by the institute for their artistic merits were also the ones that were popular among audiences. “That makes me really happy. We are building awareness in the Norwegian population so they are proud of the films and proud of the film-makers.”Norway, she said, had always been “the little brother or sister” to Denmark and Sweden when it came to film. “They are mostly happy for us,” Mo said. “I think it is also an inspiration.”But Sarah Iben Almbjerg, the film editor at the Danish newspaper Berlingske, said it would not be long before Danish film was “back in the international limelight”.

The move comes despite pressure from the US and the families of hostages held by Hamas.Starmer said in July he would recognise Palestine before the gathering of world leaders at the UN general assembly next week if the situation did not improve.What the UK’s recognition of Palestinian statehood will meanRead moreAlongside the continued military offensive and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the UK government is alarmed at plans to accelerate Israeli settlements in theWest Bankwhich ministers fear will end any hope of a two-state solution.Labour has sought to stress that recognition of a Palestinian state is not a reward for Hamas, and emphasised that it would have no role in the future governance of Gaza. It is expected the government will ratchet up sanctions on Hamas in due course, and it has stepped up demands for the release of hostages.David Lammy, the deputy prime minister who will represent the UK at the general assembly, said: “It’s important to state that the recognition of a Palestinian state, it is a consequence of the serious expansion that we’re seeing in the West Bank, the settler violence that we’re seeing in the West Bank and the intention and indications that we’re seeing to build, for example,the E1 developmentthat would run a coach and horses throughthe possibility of a two-state solution.”Israel has ramped up its offensive on Gaza City, including with strikes that health officials said on Saturday killed at least 14 people overnight. Later inIsrael, thousands of demonstrators joined the families of hostages still being held by Hamas to demand that Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, negotiate an end to the war.High-level meetings at the UN summit involving world leaders begin on 23 September. Starmer has found himself at odds with Donald Trump’s administration over the move, which is opposed to giving official recognition to the state.The Labour leader previously suggested British recognition was conditional and he would refrain if Israel committed to a ceasefire and long-term sustainable peace that delivers a two-state solution, and allow the UN to restart the supply of aid.All three conditions are however unlikely to be met given the Israeli government opposes these terms. The State of Palestine is currently recognised by 147 of the UN’s 193 member states.Family members of some of the 48 hostages still in captivity have written an open letter to Starmer condemning the move.The letter said: “Your regrettable announcement of the UK’s intention to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations general assembly has dramatically complicated efforts to bring home our loved ones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We write to you with a simple plea – do not take this step until our loved ones are home and in our arms.”Criticism also came from opposition parties, with the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, accusing Starmer of “capitulating” to his backbenchers to shore up his leadership.Lammy added: “In relation to what is happening inGaza… we’ve got to see the hostages out. There can be no place, no place at all for Hamas.“The humanitarian situation is just desperate and we have continued to press Israel to deal with the scenes of malnourishment and starvation that we’re seeing, to open up more sites to get more aid in to Gaza, and we are very concerned about this continued offensive into Gaza City.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaWest BankIsraelIsrael-Gaza warForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, members of the Yemeni army’s press arm were finishing the weekly print edition, according to the publication’s editor-in-chief, which increased the number of journalists present during the strike.At least 35 people were killed in the attack, including one child who accompanied a journalist to the office, and 131 were wounded, according to the Houthi ministry of health. All of the journalists worked for either the Houthi-affiliated 26 September newspaper orYemennewspaper.The attack was the second-deadliest against journalists that the CPJ had ever recorded, after the Maguindanao massacre in the Philippines in 2009.“It is a brutal and unjustified attack that targeted innocent people whose only crime was working in the media field, armed with nothing but their pens and words,” Nasser al-Khadri, the editor-in-chief of 26 September, told the CPJ.Killing journalists or media workers, even those who have an affiliation to armed groups, is against international humanitarian law unless they directly take part in hostilities.The Israeli military said in a statement that it had struck “military targets” in Sana’a that included the Houthi public relations department, which distributed “psychological terror”. It also said the strikes were in retaliation to continued Houthi attacks on Israel, which theHouthishave said are meant as “solidarity” with Palestinians during the war on Gaza.The Houthis have consistently launched missiles at Israel since the beginning of the conflict inGaza, and have targeted ships in the Red Sea, which they determine to have an association with Israel.The CPJ said the attack in Yemen comes as part of a larger pattern of Israel killing media workers across the Middle East and excusing those killings by attempting to portray journalists as combatants. Since 7 October 2023, Israel has killed247 journalists in Gaza, according to theUN human rights office.When Israel bombed media tents and killed six journalists, including Al Jazeera’s Anas al-Sharif, in Gaza City on 10 August, Israel claimed without evidence that they were members of Hamas. On 26 August, an Israeli double-tap strike on al-Nasser hospital in southern Gaza killed five more journalists.IDF warns aid workers only hospitals are protected sites in northern GazaRead moreIn Lebanon, Israel also killed journalists affiliated with pro-Hezbollah channels, as well as members of Hezbollah’s media office, all of whom would be considered civilians under international law.“Since 7 October 2023, Israel has emerged as a regional killer of journalists … This latest killing spree is not only a grave violation of international law, but also a terrifying warning to journalists across the region: no place is safe,” said the CPJ regional programme director, Sara Qudah.There has been a global outcry against Israel’s systematic killing of journalists in Gaza, but no apparent consequences for Israeli soldiers who killed media workers. The killing of Yemeni journalists went largely ignored by governments, creating fears of further impunity.Explore more on these topicsJournalist safetyYemenMiddle East and north AfricaNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesIsraelHouthisnewsShareReuse this content"

Friday’s resolution, put forth by South Korea, received support from only four countries – China, Russia, Pakistan and Algeria.The vote is likely to further strain relations between Iran and the west. Under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, any member of the agreement can call for a resumption of UN sanctions within 30 days if it considers Iran to not be in compliance with its terms. This would automatically re-impose all UN sanctions placed on Iran before 2015, which include an arms embargo, asset freezes and travel bans.Last month, France, Germany and the UK triggered the snapback provision of the deal afterIran refused to cooperatewith International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors, which is tasked with monitoring implementation of the deal.Two weeks later, Iran agreed to resume cooperation with the IAEA, but it has not yet been able to carry out all of its inspection activities and the body’s ability to operate in the country has been restricted for years.Since the initiation of the snapback mechanism, intense diplomacy has taken place between mainly European powers and Iran to reach a deal to prevent the sanctions. Talks have not been fruitful, though the UK indicated on Friday after the vote that it was still open to diplomacy.A message from Tehran to Britain, France and Germany: in your own interests, you should change course | Seyyed Abbas AraghchiRead more“The United Kingdom remains committed to a diplomatic solution. We are ready for further engagements diplomatically in the next week and beyond to seek to resolve differences,” said Barbara Woodward, the British ambassador to the UN.The Iranian foreign ministry said in a Friday statement that it had consistently kept the path of diplomacy open and that it viewed the reimposition of sanctions as “unlawful, unfounded and proactive”.Iran is still dealing with the impact ofthe 12-day Iran-Israel war, when Israel launched surprise attacks that it said was a pre-emptive move against the country’s nuclear programme.

Vines and a canopy keep the terrace of Mohammed Feras’s cave home cool despite the searing summer heat rising from the rocky valley.“I have lived here all my life. I’ve never been anywhere else and I cannot imagine not living here. This area is part of who I am and I cannot leave it,” the 44-year-old farmer and sometime tourist guide said.Within months, Feras and dozens of other Bedouin from the Bdoul community are likely to have left the caves they call home. There is little place for them in Petra as it is transformed by a major development programme that aims to build new facilities, regulate an anarchic tourist trade and provide a better experience for thehundreds of thousands of visitorsdrawn to the ancient site.Feras’s home, which he shares with his wife and nine children, comprises four connected 2,400-year-old caves and an adjoining tent. Just a 10-minute walk away are the remains of Petra’s grand temple and its colonnaded main street. It is also just a short hike from the monument known asthe Treasury, made more famous by the 1989 blockbuster Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.The caves occupied by the Bdoul were originally an integral part of a wealthy trading city – the thriving capital of the Nabateans for 500 years before it was annexed by the Romans in around AD100 and eventually abandoned three centuries later.View image in fullscreenFeras surveys his cave home.Photograph: The GuardianInternational human rights campaigners have called on Jordanian authorities to halt looming evictions. “Jordan’s displacement of the Bdoul from their historic homes in Petra puts their culture at risk,” saidAdam Coogle, a Middle East and north Africa deputy director at Human Rights Watch. “The Jordanian government should halt the relocations and respect the rights of Petra’s Bedouin community.”Officials charged with the management and development of Petra say the Bdoul who still live on the site are there illegally. They contend that many have alternative accommodation and that their use of the caves as homes, animal shelters, shops and storerooms risks causing irreparable harm.“If we want to preserve the integrity of the site for future generations then we have to stop the use of the caves for damaging activities,” said Dr Fares Braizat, the chief commissioner of thePetra Development and Tourism Region Authority. “Everyone in the site, whoever they are, has to abide by the law, and it is illegal for anyone to live in or use the archaeological monuments within the [site of Petra] for whatever purposes.”Historians say the Bdoul have lived in Petra’s caves for about 200 years. Efforts to remove the community from the site began shortly after its classification by the United Nationsas a world heritage sitein 1985. Then, in a deal negotiated with community leaders, thousands of people were moved to a purpose-built village nearby. Some evaded the relocation or have since moved back to their cave homes.In recent years, with tourism a major contributor to Jordan’s flagging economy, big investments have been made at Petra. There is a new museum, cultural village and network of walking trails. Hundreds of stalls that choked the site have been cleared away, as have guides who harassed visitors. An effort has been made to cut down on overnight stays in caves being offered to tourists on social media or popular booking sites.View image in fullscreenFeras’s five-year-old daughter outside the family home.Photograph: The GuardianThe new campaign to clear the caves began in late 2024 and targeted a dozen or so extended families now living around theSutuh al-Nabi Harun mountain. The Jordanian authorities have been accused by campaigners of using “coercive tactics”.Feras, who earns a thin living from farming goats and sheep and occasionally acting as an guide, has rejected an offer from authorities of a house in the village where other Bdoul from Petra are now living. He said he was sent to prison earlier this year for failing to pay a heavy fine for destroying a heritage site. He was released after two weeks but now faces a new court hearing.“It’s ridiculous to accuse us of damaging the caves,” Feras said. “We are their guardians. We are not destroying anything. We just live the way we have lived for hundreds of years.”Yasin Ahmed , one of Feras’s neighbours, said he had also received a court summons, as well as fines totalling tens of thousands of dollars, which he too could not pay.“I just don’t have that kind of money. I am not wealthy,” he said. “I grew up here and I don’t know anything else. I can’t survive in a house in a village … They are offering only a very small house but I have 10 children.”The tourist trade in Jordan has been badly hit by the war in Gaza, with the number of visitors to Petra falling dramatically. The Bdoul who made a living from guiding tourists or selling souvenirs or soft drinks have lost much of their income.Rayya Hussein, 85, has sworn never to leave her cave home, where she has lived all her life. Her parents are buried in the mountains close by. “If they want to force me to move out, I will go up on the mountain and jump,” she said.View image in fullscreenJordanian flags flying over dwellings that the authorities consider illegal.Photograph: The GuardianDr Olivia Mason, a political geographer at Newcastle University who has researched Petra and its development, said authorities saw the Bdoul as a nuisance, despite the UN making clear that their cultural heritage was an integral part of the site’s significance.“At the moment it’s the Jordanian authorities against the Bdoul, and no one acknowledges that they can work together,” Mason said. “There has to be some level of development, but that shouldn’t come at the expense of the local community.”Braizat said authorities had already promised some very elderly inhabitants that they could stay in their caves if they wanted to, and that the government-built houses offered to the Bdoul were adequately sized, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.He admitted there was limited funding available for new housing in or near the existing and overcrowded village established for the community, but said there was a project to offer the Bdoul alternative livelihoods.“We are shouldering our responsibilities to give these people a better life, with access to schools, roads, hospitals and everything that they need,” Braizat said.But to many of the Bdoul such words mean little. “We have lived here all our lives. Our freedom is being outside,” Feras said. “Here the children have freedom to go out with the sheep and run over the mountain. This is our soil.”Some names have been changed to protect identitiesExplore more on these topicsJordanInternally displaced peopleMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Between a quarter and half a million of the city’s estimated 1 million inhabitants have already fled but some displaced Palestinians traumatised by the advance said they had no means to leave.Status of crossings in GazaVehicles for the gruelling six- to eight-hour journey south can now cost as much as $2,000 (£1,500).“The situation is really bad. All night long, the tank was firing shells,” said Toufic Abu Mouawad, who left a camp for the displaced on the city’s outskirts but had nowhere else to go. “I want to flee with the boys, the girls, the children. This is the situation that we are living in. It is a very tragic situation.”Israeli officials said they were preparing a “humanitarian zone” in the overcrowded, underdeveloped al-Mawasi coastal area in southern Gaza by building new aid distribution sites nearby, supplying electricity to desalination plants, providing some water and allowing in more aid.Most of northern Gaza is already emptied of civilian and in ruins. If Israeli troops take over Gaza City, the entire 2.1 million population of the devastated territory will be confined to a small enclave in the south. Currently, all these checkpoints through which goods and people can enter Gaza are in the south, with the Zikim checkpoint which served the north closed since last week.Interactive map showing the change of the Gaza landscape between 5 June and 14 SeptemberMuch of the north lies in ruins after 23 months of conflict and a campaign of systematic destruction by Israeli forces that has intensified in recent months. Little of Gaza City is expected to escape the new Israeli offensive.“People might want to go back but what would they go back to? It is very difficult to imagine how it could work,” said one senior aid official working in Gaza. “There is an emotional attachment but there is a real question mark over how you would live.”Kitchen expressed scepticism over the IDF claim that hospitals would be considered protected, as health facilities in Gaza have been targeted multiple times during the conflict.The Israeli army has constructed two new aid distribution hubs close to Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, which will be used by the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an opaque US and Israel-backed private organisation that started work in May. The GHF has been running five such sites where food boxes were handed out on a first come first served basis, but three are thought to have been shut.In an email, GHF said that 12 truckloads of food had been distributed on Wednesday at two existing sites in the far south of Gaza , one in the ruins of Rafah and another in Khan Younis. The new sites are close to the Egyptian border.The main entry point from Israel serving the north of Gaza has been shut since last week. Aid convoys from the south face massive logistic difficulties and are often refused permission by the IDF. Last month afamine was declared in Gaza Cityby UN-backed experts.The IDF has said it is expanding the Kissufim crossing to allow more aid to reach the designated “humanitarian zone” in al-Mawasi. This too will serve the south of Gaza only, aid workers said.All aid into Gaza was blocked by Israel between March and May, and only very minimal amounts were allowed to enter until recent weeks. About 250 trucks were now bringing food and other essentials into Gaza daily but such quantities were only a fraction of what was needed, and tight restrictions remained in place, experts said.“It is better no doubt than in June and July but not the kind of better that will move the needle in any major way on the famine, for children dying of malnutrition or in terms of the day to day life of the average Gazan,” said Katy Crosby, Mercy Corps senior director of policy and advocacy.A high proportion of trucks are commercially operated and are bringing in items such as soft drinks and snacks that are not nutritious but expensive.Many Israeli observers and commentators believe the real motives for the new offensive into Gaza City are political: to keep Israel in a state of war so as to fend off early elections in which Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition could be unseated – and to ensure that north Gaza is made uninhabitable, which would please the Israeli prime minister’s far right allies.It could also encourage Palestinians to leave Gaza permanently.Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that administers access to Gaza, on Wednesday issued advice to Palestinians in the territory who wanted to leave, while Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister,described Gazaas a “real-estate bonanza”, according to Hebrew media last week.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelAidnewsShareReuse this content"

For five years – since hisarrest in September 2020under a draconian terrorism law – he has remained India’s most prominent political prisoner, to many a potent symbol of the systematic crushing of dissent under the dominant Hindu nationalist regime of the prime minister, Narendra Modi.This month the Delhi high court became the latest to deny the bail pleas of Khalid and his alleged co-conspirators. His bail case is now with the supreme court, where a hearing was delayed again on Friday. In the meantime he has remained detained in Delhi’s notorious Tihar jail without a conviction to his name.Khalid, a Muslim and leftwing activist, is accused of being a key conspirator in theDelhi riotsin which violent religious mobs rampaged across the north-west of the city in February 2020. Most of the 53 people killed in the riots were Muslims and several mosques were burned to the ground.Before his arrest Khalid had emerged as one of the faces of an anti-government protest movement after the Modi government passed a citizenship law in late 2019 that was seen as discriminatory to Muslims. The protests that erupted were the first widespread challenge to the Modi regime and were met with brute force by the state. Dozens were killed by police fire and activists were detained and tortured.In the months that followed, many of those who had been prominent protest organisers and voices began to be accused of acts of terror, while figures associated with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party who had made direct calls to violence in Delhi just before the riots erupted faced no action.Khalid has denied all charges, and the case against him and other Muslim activists named in the police charges has drawn scrutiny and criticism from lawyers and human rights groups. Much of the case against him concerns alleged secret meetings disclosed by uncorroborated witnesses and his membership of certain WhatsApp groups where he did not post any messages. Khalid was not in Delhi when the riots took place and the speech he is accused of making to stir up the riots took place more than 1,000 miles away in Maharashtra state.It was here, on camera, where Khalid told a crowd: “We won’t respond to violence with violence. We won’t respond to hate with hate. If they spread hate, we will respond to it with love.”View image in fullscreenUmar Khalid is detained while protesting in Delhi in December 2019.Photograph: Biplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Rex/ShutterstockIn a mounting number of Delhi riots cases, the Delhi police have beenfound by judgesto have fabricated evidence, created fictitious witnesses and forced witnesses to record statements dictated by officers. Delhi police have not responded to these allegations.Shuddhabrata Sengupta, a friend of Khalid’s who has written extensively about his case, said the Kafkaesque situation Khalid had been put through in trying to get bail demonstrated that “the process is the punishment here”.“The message it is intended to give is clear: that if you are a Muslim inIndiatoday, and you dare to stand up for your rights and for peace and non-violence, you will be persecuted,” Sengupta said.In a joint statement released on the fifth anniversary of Khalid’s detention last week, Amnesty International and six other human rights organisations condemned his “continued unjust detention without trial” and called for his immediate release.“Starved of justice, Khalid’s prolonged persecution exemplifies the derailment of justice in India as it makes a mockery of international human rights principles,” said Aakar Patel, the chair of Amnesty India, whose operations were shut down by the Modi government in 2020. “Khalid’s detention is not an isolated case and is emblematic of a broader pattern of repression faced by those who dare to exercise their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.”Before his arrest, Khalid had made himself a thorn in the side of the Modi government, which came to power in 2014. An outspoken student activist at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where he was studying for a PhD, he was vocal against the rising tide of anti-Muslim hatred and persecution under Modi’s Hindu nationalist regime. In 2016, after a protest against capital punishment drew national media attention, Khalid wasarrested and briefly detainedon sedition charges.It was the beginning of what his partner, Banojyotsna Lahiri, 41, who was also a PhD student at JNU, described as a “targeted campaign of hate” against Khalid by the Indian media, who routinely described him as “anti-national”. In 2018, two men turned up to a Delhi event with guns and tried to kill Khalid as a “gift for India”.Lahiri said Khalid had expected his arrest to come in 2020 and had even pre-recorded a video. However, she said they had never anticipated that five years later he would still be held as an alleged terrorist and denied the basic right to bail.“Umar is everything this government hates,” Lahiri said. “He is Muslim, he is an intellectual, he speaks about the oppressed, he is outspoken, he is fearless and he is an unapologetic dissenting voice. This is their attempt to silence him but it won’t work. We are still fighting for democracy, and in the end the truth will win.”Lahiri visits him every week in prison where he insists they keep the conversation joyful and they laugh together, even as he lived through a deadly Covid wave sweeping through the prison and the extreme heat of Delhi summers. To feed his voracious reading appetite, she usually carries in tomes for him, and she estimated he had now read more than 300 books while in jail – everything from Russian classics to contemporary Indian fiction and political biographies.Each week he is allowed a 30-minute video call with his parents in Delhi, and his sisters who live abroad also regularly patch in. “I want to tell you that Umar has no regrets, nor have the years in jail broken his spirit,” said his father, Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, recently.For Khalid, although he acknowledged in his recent writings that “nurturing hope in jail is a risky business”, he said sometimes he found himself “amazed how I have survived so long in the same confined space”. But he insisted that thanks to the solace of books and the resilience of his fellow prisoners, “mostly I have been at peace”.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the third time this year the figure for a single day has surpassed 1,000 and brings the total number this year to a record 32,103.Before Friday, there had been eight days with no arrivals recorded in Dover, Kent, due to adverse weather and sea conditions.Ministers are hoping their “one in, one out” plan will provide a deterrent to would-be asylum seekers if they believe they risk being quickly sent back.

Labour intends to increase the number of people being sent back under the pilot deal over the coming months.The treaty allows the UK to immediately detain anyone who crosses the Channel and, within about two weeks, agree with the French authorities to return the individual.For each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in the UK will come in return. Ministers have praised the returns, with the deputy prime minister, David Lammy, saying they provided an “immediate deterrent” to people seeking to cross the Channel.But the Conservative shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said it would offer “no deterrent effect whatsoever”, adding that the numbers returned so far were “pathetic”.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Gordon Brown has set out ways of raising money from gambling firms which should get careful consideration.”The policy was announced in 2015 by the Conservative government and restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households.Brownrecently backed a reportfrom the Institute for Public Policy Research, which said reforms to gambling levies could generate the £3.2bn needed to scrap the two-child limit and benefit cap.The thinktank’s research said scrapping the policies could lift 500,000 children out of poverty.Powell, who was sacked as Commons leader in Keir Starmer’s recent reshuffle, sought to differentiate herself from Phillipson, who is regarded as Downing Street’s choice for the deputy leader position.“I’m not afraid to have difficult conversations when we need to change course,” she wrote, adding: “I would be a strong independent choice for deputy leader.“I couldn’t have been prouder of getting a Labour government last year. But I know that people have been exasperated because of some mistakes we’ve made, and delivering change can sometimes be slow.”Powell said “despite our early achievements, this Labour story hasn’t been heard loud enough”, and “we’ve got to give a greater sense of who we’re fighting for”.The prime minister has not committed to axing the limit, but he has consistently declined to rule it out.Meanwhile Phillipson is reportedly looking at plans to abolish a subsidy that means two-thirds of Ofsted inspection costs are effectively discounted for private schools.The cost of providing Ofsted inspections to private schools in 2024-25 was £6.5m, according to figures set out by then education minister Stephen Morgan earlier this month. But only £2.2m of that was recovered by Ofsted.Allies of Phillipson told the Telegraph: “Inspection is crucially important for driving up standards in all schools as well as keeping children safe … but it’s time every independent school paid its fair share.“It’s frankly unfair. Taxpayers, most of whom send their children to state schools, shouldn’t have to foot the bill to make sure they’re accountable to fee-paying parents.”Powell’s intervention comes as Rachel Reeves wasurged to cancel plansto be the guest of honour at an event hosted by the chief lobbyist of the gambling industry while the Treasury is in the midst of a review of taxes on the £12bn sector.The chancellor was due to appear at a “private reception” for business leaders, organised by the corporate communications company Brunswick, at next week’s Labour party conference in Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsLucy PowellLabourGamblingTax and spendingBenefitsWelfareLabour party deputy leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

How dare they steal what it is to be British, English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish?” he said.Farron argued that he was “a proud patriot” but not a nationalist, saying: “And you can tell the difference easily. You see patriots love their country. Nationalists hate their neighbours. I love my country.”Speaking in the wake ofa mass far-right rallyin London a week ago in which many protesters draped themselves in the British orEnglish flags, and a recent spate of peoplehanging flags on lamp-postsor spraying a red cross on to streets, Farron said such symbols should never be excluding.“Our flag does not belong to Liberals, or to Conservatives, Reform, or to Labour. It does not belong to one creed or to one race. It belongs to one people, the British people. We will not let our flag be used to intimidate. We will not let our flag become the property of a minority,” he said.“So my message to the nationalists is this: I’m afraid that you do not really love your country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Welcome to England 2025 | John HarrisRead more“You cannot love your country if – as its seems – you hate everything about it and claim allegiance only to a Britain of some fantasy golden age that never existed. You do not love your country if you seek to intimidate and terrify people who are British through and through. You do not love your country if you lie about it at home and abroad, actively plan to do it harm, and suck up to our enemies.“So let us reclaim our flags for those who would reunite and rebuild. Let us be proud of our flag, be proud of our country. The British flag and the flags of our four nations are ours, they belong to all of us. Let’s take them back. Let’s wave them with pride.”The Lib Dems were notably stronger than Labour or the Conservatives in criticising last week’s rally, with Ed Davey, the party leader, particularly condemning Elon Musk after the X owner used a video address to the event totell the crowdthat “violence is coming” and “you either fight back or you die”.The best way to show love for a country, Farron said, “involves sacrifice and service”, with a community-based approach to politics.This was, he said, “not just the antidote to nationalism, it is the opposite of it. Less talk, more action. We love our country and our people, but more than that maybe … in stark contrast to the nationalists, we also rather like our country and its people.”Explore more on these topicsLiberal DemocratsThe far rightEnglandLiberal Democrat conferencenewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, the Daily Record revealed thatWatt had been convicted of abusing two former girlfriendsin 2018.There was a significant police presence and febrile atmosphere with the “unity” protesters blocked in at the top of Buchanan Street, while the larger group of counter-protesters amassed further down the pedestrian thoroughfare. Those making speeches to the anti-immigration protest struggled to make themselves heard above chants of “shame on you” and heavy beats from the anti-racists’ superior sound system, which blasted out sing-a-long hits by Abba and Chappell Roan.View image in fullscreenAnti-racist protesters line up against the anti-migrant rally in Glasgow.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianStanding by the steps leading up to the concert hall, three women held aloft a banner bearing a colourful portrait of the far-right Christian activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated two weeks ago in Utah. They praised Kirk, saying “he wasn’t scared to say what other people are afraid to say” and bemoaned a lack of Christian teaching in modern Scottish schools while “too many other religions are being brought in”.One of the women, Laura Dunsmore, a nurse, said it was important to emphasise that the protest wasn’t only about illegal immigration. “It’s about the state of the country, the state of the world. You can’t access healthcare, our streets are crumbling. We can’t vote our way out of this. We need change at a higher level.”Further down the wide street, holding a handmade placard reading “This mum welcomes refugees”, Cat, a software technician from Glasgow’s Southside, was jigging to pop hits along with her partner and baby. “I felt I should lean in to the ‘mum’ bit especially because they are saying they want to protect women and children, and as a woman and a mum I’m not worried about asylum seekers. I’m far more worried about those guys over there.”She said it was important to come to the counter-protest to show solidarity in particular after last weekend’s rally in London organised by the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson.As groups at the edge of the protest began pushing and shoving, police moved quickly to separate the two groups, closing off access routes for Saturday shoppers and tourists who expressed alarm or irritation at the disruption.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson said: “A 47-year-old man was arrested in connection with an assault of a police officer during a protest on Buchanan Street.”Areas of Glasgowhave been draped in Saltiresin recent weeks, in a direct parallel with theOperation Raise the Colours movementthat has co-opted the St George’s cross in England, as ownership of the blue and white cross of St Andrew has become a cultural and political battleground in Scotland.Last summer, Scotland escaped the racist violence that spread across England and Northern Ireland after the horrific Southport killings in July. But a year later, the landscape is very different, with recent polling for More in Common suggesting that Reform was neck and neck with Scottish Labour in voting intention for next May’s Scottish parliament election, though behind the SNP. Immigration appears to be a top concern for Scottish voters for the first time and the Scottish government is facing a refugee housing crisis in Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city.Explore more on these topicsScotlandProtestImmigration and asylumFar rightnewsShareReuse this content"

He died on Friday in Glasgow’s Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, his DJ partner Jonnie Wilkes (AKA JG Wilkes)announced.“In a 28 year partnership he changed my life immeasurably and together we took our work in directions and to places few people are lucky enough to explore,” Wilkes said. “I am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend.”McIvor grew up in Edinburgh in a family who “had the most middle of the road, blandest music taste imaginable”, he later said, but after moving to Glasgow to go to university in 1986 he became involved in club culture across both cities.He began DJing electro and EBM (electronic body music) at a club night in Edinburgh, graduating to house and techno as those styles reached the UK and the acid house era began. The night was shut down by police after a brawl between football hooligans, but McIvor began a new night called Pure with the blessing of the authorities by making it a members only event. “It gave us the chance to start again from scratch and do a club 100% on our own terms,” he said. “Out went anything to do with all the awful Madchester-related music and in came a completely different crowd.”Pure became a core event in the Scottish house and techno scene, but McIvor – who grew to find DJ culture “all pretty boring” – began another event in 1997 that gave voice to the breadth of his catholic taste. Taking its name from the track Optimo by New York punk-funk band Liquid Liquid – which McIvor would go on to remix – the Sunday night event at Glasgow’s Sub Club alongside DJ partner JG Wilkes (Jonnie Wilkes) ran every week until 2010.View image in fullscreenJD Twitch and JG Wilkes, AKA Optimo.Photograph: Sam Kovak/AlamyMcIvor said the pair were not “aligned to any one particular musical movement” – championing electroclash, punk, new wave, soft rock and a range of other styles alongside dance tracks, and hosting bands such as LCD Soundsystem and TV On the Radio as well as guest DJs. Optimo pre-empted the open-mindedness of the internet age, and became lauded as one of the most significant events in global dance culture. Thereafter McIvor and Wilkes continued to DJ internationally under the Optimo name.McIvor was also a producer, and as Optimo’s star rose he was sought after as a remixer for the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Róisín Murphy, Manic Street Preachers, Florence + the Machine and more (“Discogs tells me I did 108 remixes, though it’s probably a few more,” he said in 2023). McIvor also founded the label Optimo Music (plus spin-offs such as the Brazil-focused Selva Discos), and Optimo created acclaimed compilation albums such as How to Kill the DJ (Part Two). McIvor also curated the soundtrack to Beats, a 2019 film set in the 90s rave scene inScotland, and put out music under the alias Tomorrow the Rain Will Fall Upwards.McIvor announced his illness in July 2025, saying: “My symptoms weren’t immediately diagnosed, and my health declined very rapidly over just a few weeks … I am currently trying to process this news and prioritising spending precious time with the people I love.”Wilkes added in his tribute to McIvor: “I am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend. Keith’s intensity and passion for life, for music, for creativity and for positive change simply never let up. He was formidable. His belief in people and the idea that standing together, that our collective strength is powerful was unwavering. I loved him for that.”After thanking hospice staff and others, he added: “Keith left us far too soon. He will go now to travel those space-ways but I know his energy remains in every one of us who had the privilege of knowing him. I love you forever Keith.”Explore more on these topicsDance musicClub cultureElectronic musicScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

the White House counsel, David Warrington; communications chiefs Steven Cheung and Taylor Budowich; the national security council; and the chiefs of staff at every major intelligence agency.“The CIA just wants to blame ODNI all the time,” the official said.A White House spokesperson did not address whether there had been advance notice or when the emails were sent but said in a statement: “Director Gabbard is doing a phenomenal job and the White House has worked closely with her on implementing the President’s objectives.“The entire administration is aligned on ensuring those who have weaponized their clearances to manipulate intelligence, leak classified intelligence without authorization, and many other egregious acts are held to account,” the spokesperson said.Rescinding security clearances was supposed to be part of an effort to correct what Trump’s advisers view as flaws in intelligence assessments and to punish Trump’s political enemies for allegedly mischaracterizing intelligence about Russian malign influence operations during the 2016 election.Gabbard said inthe memo announcing the revocationslast month that her actions were at Trump’s direction and claimed that the people targeted were involved in the “politicization or weaponization of intelligence” to advance partisan agendas, or had leaked classified information.“Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right,” Gabbard wrote. “Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the interests of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.”It was also in keeping with an executive order and followed the administration pulling security clearances fordozens of Trump’s political adversariesincluding Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, as well as other figures from Trump’s first impeachment.Trump administration revokes clearances for 37 security officialsRead moreGabbard is not expected to face significant ramifications over the episode, in large part because she has emerged relatively unscathed from other fraught moments, including when Trump in June publicly contradicted her assessment that Iran was far from acquiring nuclear weapons.“I don’t care what she said,” Trump said in response to a question about Gabbard’s testimony that Iran had decided not to make a nuclear bomb, shortly after she was notably absent from a key meeting at Camp David on the matter. “I think they were very close to having it.”Gabbard also drew Trump’s ire when she posted a video in June warning of nuclear annihilation. Trump harangued Gabbard,saying it would scare peopleand that she appeared more engaged in self-promotion in order to set herself up for higher office, a person familiar with the matter said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsJoe BidenUS national securitynewsShareReuse this content"

The raids prompted protests and ledDonald Trumpto deploy national guard troops and marines to the city.It’s unclear how – or whether – the state can enforce the ban on the federal agents who have been carrying out those raids. A homeland security official called the legislation “despicable” in a statement this week, adding that the ban would only put officers in danger.Newsom, a Democrat who has railed against federal agents’ use of masks, said the measure will helpCaliforniapush back on federal overreach. He signed the bill in Los Angeles, flanked by state lawmakers and immigrant community members.“I thought Jon Stewart said it best: ‘This is not about the pronoun police, this is about the secret police,’”Newsom saidbefore signing the bill into law.The new law prohibits neck gators, ski masks and other facial coverings for local and federal officers, including immigration enforcement agents, while they conduct official business. It makes exceptions for undercover agents, medical masks such as N95 respirators or tactical gear. It doesn’t apply to state police.Trump administration officials have consistently defended the practice, saying that immigration agents have faced strident and increasing harassment in public and online as they have gone about their enforcement in service of Trump’s drive toward mass deportation, and say hiding their identities is for their and their families’ safety.Federal agents are already instructed to identify themselves and wear vests with Ice or homeland security markers during operations, a homeland security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement this week.“The men and women at CBP, ICE, and all of our federal law enforcement agencies put their lives on the line every day to arrest violent criminal illegal aliens to protect and defend the lives of American citizens,” she said.California nurses decry Ice presence at hospitals: ‘Interfering with patient care’Read moreDemocrats in Congress and lawmakers in several states, including Tennessee, Michigan, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, have introduced similar proposals calling for mask bans for law enforcement officers.Proponents said the mask ban is especially needed after the supreme court earlier this month ruled that the federal administration can resume sweeping immigration operations in Los Angeles. The new law aims to boost public trust in law enforcement and stop people from impersonating officers to commit crimes, supporters said.Constitutional law expert Erwin Chemerinsky at the University of California, Berkeley, also defended the legislation. Federal employees still have to follow general state rules “unless doing so would significantly interfere with the performance of their duties. For example, while on the job, federal employees must stop at red lights,” he wrote inan opinion piecefor the Sacramento Bee in July.The mask ban is among a number of measures approved by the Democratic-controlled California legislature in response to Trump’s immigration policies of mass deportation. Newsom on Saturday also signed legislation to prevent immigration agents from entering schools and healthcare facilities without a valid warrant or a judicial order and to require schools to notify parents and teachers when immigration agents are on campus.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS policingIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)West CoastUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the first time the justice department said it was bringing a capital case after Donald Trump’s second presidency began in January with a pledge to revive federal executions, which his predecessor Biden had put on hold.Mangione’s lawyers argue that Bondi’s announcement – which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance – showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit” and, they said, her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.Trump, who oversaw an unprecedented run of 13 executions at the end of his first presidency, offered his own opinions about Mangione on Thursday – despite court rules that prohibit any pretrial publicity that could interfere with a defendant’s right to a fair trial.“Think about Mangione. He shot someone in the back, as clear as you’re looking at me or I’m looking at you. He shot – he looked like a pure assassin,” Trump told Fox News.“There is a high bar to dismissing an indictment due to pretrial publicity,” Mangione’s lawyers wrote in their 114-page filing. “However, there has never been a situation remotely like this one where prejudice has been so great against a death-eligible defendant.”Federal prosecutors have until 31 October to respond. Mangione is due back in court in the federal case on 5 December, days after the start of pretrial hearings in his state case. No trial date has been set for either case.Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges.Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson, 50, from behind on 4 December 2024 as he arrived to a Manhattan hotel for his company’s annual investor conference. Police say “delay”, “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.Mangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (370km) west of Manhattan. Authorities say he had a 9mm handgun and a notebook describing his intent to “wack” an insurance executive.Mangione’s lawyers contend the simultaneous prosecutions amount to double jeopardy.In the federal case, Mangione is charged with murder through use of a firearm, which carries the possibility of the death penalty, as well as stalking and gun offenses.On Tuesday, the judge in his state case threw out terrorism charges that carried the possibility of a mandatory life sentence without parole. But judge Gregory Carro rejected the defense’s request to dismiss the state prosecution entirely, saying the double jeopardy argument is premature because neither case has gone to trial or resulted in a guilty plea.The state case will proceed with other charges, including an intentional murder count that carries a potential punishment of 15 years to life in prison, with the possibility of parole. Unlike the federal system, New York does not have the death penalty.Mangione has attracted a cult following as a stand-in for frustrations with the health insurance industry.A few dozen supporters – mostly women – packed three rows in the rear of the courtroom gallery at his hearing Tuesday in state court. Some wore green, the color of the Mario Bros video game character Luigi, and one woman sported a “FREE LUIGI” T-shirt.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Runkles has since been released on bond,” Arizona DPS said, ABCreports.A spokesperson for Turning Point USA, which Kirk founded, later told Fox News that Runkles had been doing “advance security for a known guest” but that it wasn’t properly coordinated with Turning Point or the US Secret Service, which is securing the event because Donald Trump and JD Vance are among the scheduled speakers. “We do not believe this person was attempting anything nefarious,” the spokesperson reportedly said.Earlier on Saturday, the US Secret Service said that it was coordinating with local law enforcement in Glendale, Arizona, to investigate “an individual who was observed exhibiting suspicious behavior at State Farm Stadium”.“The individual was approached by Secret Service and stated during the encounter that he was a member of law enforcement and that he was armed. The individual is not a member of authorized law enforcement working the event and is currently in custody,” the Secret Service said.Runkles was armed with at least one gun and one knife when he was stopped, according to a law enforcement official whospoketo the Washington Post. The official added that Runkles had presented “inactive law enforcement credentials” and informed the Secret Service that he was there to provide private security.Sunday’s memorial service for Kirk is expected to draw up to 100,000 attendees to Glendale, where Turning Point USA is based.

Sear level 1 connotes “significant events with national and/or international importance that require extensive federal interagency support”.According tothe event’s website, attendees are to expect TSA-level screening, and guests arriving with bags, even clear ones, will not be permitted entry.Kirk, 31, was shot to death on 10 September while he was speaking at a college event at Utah Valley University. Tyler Robinson, 22, has since been charged with aggravated murder in Kirk’s killing. Utah state prosecutors say theyintendto pursue the death penalty against Robinson if he is convicted.Prosecutors have said that they suspect Robinson killed Kirk because he personally had become sick of what he perceived to be Kirk’s “hatred”. But, citing three sources familiar with the investigation into Kirk’s killing, NBCreportedSaturday that federal authorities have not found any link between Robinson and leftwing groups, on which the Trump administration has threatened to crack down after the deadly shooting.Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingArizonaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

However, using an abbreviation for the recentlyrebrandedDepartment of War headed by the Trump administration’s Pete Hegseth, the memo added: “DoW information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified.”It went on to say: “Only authorized persons who have received favorable determinations of eligibility for access, signed approved non-disclosure agreements, and have a need-to-know may be granted access to [classified national security information].”Journalists reporting from the Pentagon are now required to sign a pledge agreeing to restrict their movements within the building and not to access any unauthorized materials. If they refuse to sign the pledge, their Pentagon press passes will be revoked.In a post on X, HegsethsaidFriday: “The ‘press’ does not run the Pentagon – the people do. The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules – or go home.”The latest memo follows the announcement by Hegseth in May regarding new press restrictions at the Pentagon. These restrictions limit reporters’ movements within the building to specific areas including the press pens, food court and courtyard. This is a departure from the usual practice under previous presidential administrations where reporters typically had more freedom of movement within the Pentagon.Hegseth has severely limited media access after facing backlash for sharing sensitive information about US strikes in Yemen in March in aSignal group chatwhere a journalist was accidentally included.Since he assumed office, Hegseth has maintained a hostile attitude towards major media networks. He ordered theremovalof various longstanding news organizations including the New York Times, CNN, Politico and NPR from their dedicated offices in the Pentagon.The Pentagon’s latest memo has drawn criticism from journalists and free press advocates, with the National Press Club’s president Mike Balsamosaying: “This is a direct assault on independent journalism at the very place where independent scrutiny matters most: the US military.“If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting. It is getting only what officials want them to see. That should alarm every American.”Similarly, Freedom of the Press Foundationsaid“this policy operates as a prior restraint on publication, which is considered the most serious” violations of the press freedoms guaranteed by the US constitution’s first amendment.“The government cannot prohibit journalists from public information merely by claiming it’s a secret,” the foundation said.Meanwhile, Thomas Evans, editor in chief of National Public Radio (NPR),saidhis outlet was “taking this very seriously”.“We’ll be working with other news organizations to push back,” Evans remarked. “We’re big fans of the first amendment and transparency, and we want the American public to understand what’s being done in their name.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That statement followed widespreadbacklashover ABC’sindefinite suspensionof Jimmy Kimmel’s popular late-night show, on which the veteran comedian said that many in Trump’s Make America Great Again movement “are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”, referring to the 10 September killing of the rightwing activist.Speakingon Air Force One on Thursday, Trump said – without providing evidence – that “97% [of major US networks are] against me”.“They give me only bad press,” he said, adding that he believed broadcasters should have their licenses “taken away” as a result.Among those to endorse Trump’s argument was the US senator Cynthia Lummis. The Wyoming Republican recently told the US news websiteSemaforthat such licenses are “a privilege” rather than a “right” – and she said to the outlet that she no longer believes the first amendment is “the ultimate right”.“I feel like something’s changed culturally,” Lummis said, in part. “And I think there needs to be cognizance that things have changed.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryPete HegsethTrump administrationUS politicsUS constitution and civil libertiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Iger, veteran leader of Disney, ABC’s parent company, was nowhere to be seen – but was widely reported to have been intimately involved in the decision.Iger is one of a small handful of powerful executives pulling the strings behind the most prominent media organizations in the US. David Ellison, the new CEO of Paramount Skydance, and son of the billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison, is in charge of CBS, andreportedly pursuing a deal to buy the owner of CNN.

CBSpaid a $16m defamation settlementto Donald Trump and scheduled thecancellationof the The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. ABCpaid a $15m settlementto the US president andsuspendedKimmel.And Trump is publicly pushing NBC to cancel its two late night stars, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, too.Trump v Kimmel: simmering feud ends with comedian’s talkshow yanked off airRead moreThe owners of the largest US TV networks, and the ultimate employers of their stars, are even bigger companies who conduct business transactions that most viewers may not pay a lot of attention to – mergers, acquisitions, licensing deals – but are firmly in the sights of the White House.On Wednesday, FCC chair Brendan Carr – dubbed Trump’s“censor-in-chief” – dangled the power of the federal government over ABC, and Disney, saying that the regulator has “remedies we can look at” to address comments Kimmel made about conservatives in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s killing.“These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead,” Carrsaidof the affiliates that carry ABC across the US. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”Soon after, ABC announced it would indefinitely suspend Kimmel’s show. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,” wrote Trump.But Carr is not done. “I don’t think this is the last shoe to drop,” he said of Kimmel’s suspension, in an interview on the conservative Fox News on Thursday.To Robert Thompson, a media scholar at Syracuse University who specializes in TV history, battles between government regulators and the companies that broadcast America’s favorite shows have long been a part of broadcast history. But the way TV networks are now part of far larger businesses, and complex webs of interest and influence, have changed the stakes of the fight.“Entertainment and news are controlled by these large companies that are very dependent on new acquisitions and mergers that require approval by federal government agencies,” Thompson said. “That’s why there’s a vulnerability for this kind of thing to happen.”The Telecommunications Act of 1996, signed under Bill Clinton, loosened restrictions on how many TV and radio stations a company could own nationally.Now, the dominant US TV networks – and their news and entertainment arms – are controlled by a small, but powerful, collection of entertainment giants. CBS is owned by Paramount Skydance, which includes Paramount Pictures, cable channels like MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central, and other TV channels abroad, including Channel 5 in the UK. ABC is owned by Disney, which also owns Marvel Studios, Hulu and ESPN. NBC is owned by Comcast, which is also a cable TV company and an internet service producer, while also being the company behind the European broadcaster Sky and DreamWorks movies like Shrek.The timing of recent mergers have alarmed first amendment advocates, who are starting to see a pattern of companies bowing to the Trump administration in order to get approval for their deals.CBS owner Paramount was criticized for settling with Trump and cancelling Colbert’s show weeks before the FCC greenlit an $8bn merger with Skydance, a Hollywood studio.The merger installed David Ellison, founder of Skydance, at the top of Paramount Skydance, and CBS.CBS News has sinceappointed a Trump ally as its ombudsmanand Bari Weiss, founder of the Free Press, an “anti-woke” startup, is said to be in line for a role shaping its coverage.View image in fullscreenDavid Ellison attends the Royal Film Performance and UK Premiere of Top Gun: Maverick at Leicester Square on 19 May 2022 in London, England.Photograph: Eamonn M McCormack/Getty Images for Paramount PicturesMeanwhile, Nexstar Media, a major owner of local television stations, including over 30 ABC-affiliated stations, has been looking for FCC approval for a $6.2bn merger with Tegna, another broadcast media company. After Carr’s podcast interview, Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel’s show on their ABC-affiliated stations, meaning the show wouldn’t access millions of TV viewers in specific markets. (Nexstar executives “had no communication with the FCC or any government agency” before making the call, the firm has stressed.)Christopher Anders, a senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, a leading defender of rights and freedoms enshrined in the US constitution, said Carr was using “the regulatory power the government has over media companies” through his comments.“That is exactly what the first amendment is designed to stop: the government using its power to stifle speech,” Anders said. “And if there’s any speech that’s at the very heart of the first amendment, it would be the ability to criticize those in power, particularly the ability to criticize the president.”Media giants have been “cowering to threats”, he added, ignoring the responsibility they have of defending free speech.Iger, who previously considered running for president, has tried to steer clear of theculture wars that embroiled his predecessor, Bob Chapek. Now he faces intense scrutiny for overseeing a decision – suspending Kimmel – which critics say raises serious free speech concerns.Michael Eisner, Disney’s former CEO, and Iger’s former boss at the firm, wrote on X on Friday: “The ‘suspending indefinitely’ of Jimmy Kimmel immediately after the Chairman of the FCC’s aggressive yet hollow threatening of the Disney Company is yet another example of out-of-control intimidation. Maybe the Constitution should have said, ‘Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, except in one’s political or financial self-interest.’”Native public radio braces for ‘devastating and catastrophic’ Trump budget cutsRead moreIt is still unclear when – or if – Kimmel will come back on air. The companies in charge of US television, and the government agencies who regulate their dealings, loom large.“Anyone that has the privilege of owning one of the major media networks, or owning the affiliate stations that carry those networks, ought to also have recognized the responsibility to protect the right of free speech,” said Anders. “Not just give up that right because an administration official is at least implicitly threatening to block their ability to carry out business.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJimmy KimmelUS politicsABCTelevision industryUS television industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The win is notable as it can be used as the calling-card performance for the Ruben Amorim project. In the first half 10-man Chelsea were pummelled mercilessly by a United unit that was quicker, stronger, more menacing and just plain better than the Club World Cup winners.After this, the conditions and Casemiro’s sending-off in added time before the interval evened things up after Robert Sánchez’s own early shower, and the teams levelled each other out.‘Return to that urgency’: Amorim urges United players to keep winning mentalityRead moreAn 80th-minute Trevoh Chalobah header made it 2-1 – the defender rising between a dozing Leny Yoro and Amad Diallo to meet Reece James’s cross – but United passed the test of closing out the three points. As a sizeable boost this was, as Amorim said, “really important”.Amorim had said his side needed to be better in both penalty areas and here they were. The United story machine’s latest plotline had a former beloved son, Alejandro Garnacho, returning as a bete noire, and a head coach saying not even the pope would shift him regarding the maligned 3-4-3.Of the papal soundbite, afterwards he could smile, saying: “It was a joke, you guys love it, when we have another win I will give you another one;” while United fans delighted in Garnacho being an unused substitute booed on arrival and when warming up.Chelsea’s plan was torn asunder four minutes in. Altay Bayindir’s hoof took a Benjamin Sesko flick, Bryan Mbeumo ran on to the ball, eluded Sánchez, and the visiting goalkeeper took the Cameroonian down. Even before Peter Bankes raised the red card Sánchez knew he was off. This forced a rejig from Enzo Maresca, with Estêvão Willian hooked for the new keeper, Filip Jörgensen, and Tosin Adarabioyo brought on for Pedro Neto.United were a whir of red, tumbling relentlessly at Chelsea, and soon breached Jörgensen. Noussair Mazraoui skipped along the right, chipped in, Patrick Dorgu headed to Bruno Fernandes and he tipped home for a 100th United strike. A lengthy inquiry by the video assistant referee ruled Chalobah had kept him onside.View image in fullscreenRobert Sánchez fouls Bryan Mbeumo, resulting in the Chelsea goalkeeper being sent off.Photograph: Peter Powell/EPAThis was after 13 minutes. A torrid opening 20 for Maresca’s men closed with their A-list act, Cole Palmer, being replaced because of injury by Andrey Santos and already Chelsea’s substitute count was three.From United’s3-0 humbling at Manchester Cityhad gone Manuel Ugarte and Yoro – for Harry Maguire and Casemiro – and Amorim’s unit was far slicker. Chelsea’s sole threat came when the isolated João Pedro bobbed into the home area and Mazraoui stuck a leg out and the forward went down, but Bankes was not interested.Now came United’s second: a tale of Luke Shaw’s desire, James’s clownish defending, and Enzo Fernández’s timidness. Mazraoui spiralled a ball to the far post from the right and James had the chance to clear Dorgu’s misdirected header. Instead, the captain sliced the ball up, Shaw came crashing in to head on as Fernández watched, and Casemiro headed past Jörgensen.Chelsea were a dizzied boxer staggering up at the eight-count due to United’s constant haymakers. Fernandes slipped Sesko in but he could not control. The ball was bounced to Mbeumo, who tried to put his left boot through it but missed. Marc Cucurella chopped down Mazraoui and Bankes booked him. United cruised. So, as is the way of this post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, they made life “complicated”, Amorim sighed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It seemed as harsh as Casemiro’s decision to grapple with Santos was foolish.At the free-kick United slept and Cucurella went close, and for the second period Sesko was sacrificed for Ugarte to take Casemiro’s berth. More yellows were shown, for Fernández and Chalobah, though on a surface causing the players to aquaplane, there was scant surprise at niggle creeping in.A Maguire arm on Santos’s chest was the next to cause Chelsea ire and when Fernandes released Dorgu down the left and United roved in the contest had some actual football once more.Ten versus 10 was the glimmer Chelsea needed and a James cross which Diallo hooked away, then a later James cross Matthijs de Ligt crashed out for a corner, were warnings. As was a Wesley Fofana header correctly ruled offside.By the 69th-minute Yoro, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha were on for United, Maguire, Mbeumo and Mazraoui the trio who exited.Chelsea rallied and United had to defend their box, and did.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

At times it seemed two of the few players of note who weren’t fighting with each other were Canelo and CrawfordThomas HauserSat 20 Sep 2025 09.10 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 12.27 EDTShareOn 13 September, Terence Crawford solidified his status as a great fighter witha hard-fought, unanimous decision victoryover Canelo Álvarez at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.The event was conceived, financed, and marketed byTurki al-Sheikh, the chairman of the Saudi Arabian General Entertainment Authority, and Dana White, the president and CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). It was to act as a foundation stone for their plan to make Zuffa Boxing, a company controlled by interests they represent, the dominant force in professional boxing.Boxing’s last “golden age” was orchestrated by HBO Sports. For decades, the cable giant delivered fights that fans wanted to see. Overall, the network conducted itself as though it had a fiduciary duty to the sport. It understood that, if boxing thrived, then its boxing franchise would too.HBO’s boxing program began to decline with the 2000 departure of Seth Abraham and Lou DiBella, who had been its primary architects. Ultimately, boxing declined with it. The sport moved away from a self-sustaining business model. Instead of recouping costs through ticket sales, license fees, pay-per-view buys and other fight-generated revenue, big-time boxing became reliant on “big losers”.Terence Crawford stuns Canelo Álvarez to become undisputed super middleweight championRead moreThe investment firm of Waddell & Reed lost a reported $400m (£296.8) investing in Premier Boxing Champions (PBC). DAZN has lost a reported $7bn (£5.2bn) since its inception, a good chunk of that attributable to its boxing program. ESPN kept Top Rank afloat for eight years with a generous annual rights payment. But the network was unable to monetize boxing the way it hoped to and their agreement expired earlier this year. The Saudi Arabian General Entertainment Authority has poured an incalculable sum into a boxing program that has been swimming in red ink since its inception.Most professional sports franchises in America are looked upon as community assets. There are times when boxing seems like an unwanted stepchild. Showtime followed HBO out of the boxing business. The sport’s major promoters in the United States are suffering. Mid-level promoters are falling by the wayside. There are questions as to how long PBC – once thought to be on the verge of “taking over” boxing – will survive. Top Rank is scrambling to put together deals with one or more platforms that will enable it to continue on a diminished basis.The Saudi Arabian General Entertainment Authority (GEA) and Sheikh stepped into that void.In recent years, the GEA has invested heavily in sports. It changed the economics of professional golf through creation of the LIV golf tour and has hosted significant competitions in events ranging from Formula One automobile racing to mixed martial arts. More significantly, Saudi Arabia has been designated as the host country for the 2034 Fifa World Cup.The first boxing card of note in Saudi Arabia was contested in 2018 when Callum Smith knocked out George Groves and Chris Eubank Jr stopped JJ McDonagh. The following year, Riyadh Season was launched and the fights got bigger. Anthony Joshua regained his heavyweight belts in Riyadh by decision over Andy Ruiz. Eight months after that in Jeddah, Joshua fell victim to Oleksandr Usyk in Usyk-Joshua II. More fights in the Kingdom involving Usyk, Joshua, Tyson Fury, Deontay Wilder and other top heavyweights followed. Major bouts in lighter weight classes were added to the mix.Meanwhile, the mainstream media in the United States has stopped covering boxing in a serious way, which has enabled the Saudi juggernaut to control the narrative.Further to that end, in November 2024, Sheikh purchased the Ring magazine,which gives hima platform for his message as well ascontrol over the Ring’schampionship belts and rankings. Saudi interests have also purchased a billion-dollar equity stake in Dazn, which gives them input regarding that platform’s flow of boxing content to consumers.And dissenting voices are often stifled. Critics of the Saudi boxing program have been denied credentials to cover events. Articles and video content have been altered or pulled down in their entirety by some sites because of concern that Saudi interests might be or were offended.This is the environment in which the latest initiative in the Saudi boxing program – Zuffa Boxing – has been launched.Let’s look at the players.TKO Group Holdings is a sports and entertainment company whose vast portfolio includes theUFCand World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).Sela is a live-experiences and recreational company owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Its managing director and CEO - Dr Rakan Alharthy - is an ally of Sheikh and is also close to Crown PrinceMohammed bin Salman.On 5 March 2025, a press release heralded the launch of a multi-year boxing promotional partnership between Sela and TKO under Sheikh’s leadership.“This is a strategic opportunity to reimagine the sport of boxing globally,” TKO president and COO Mark Shapiro declared.There was ambitious talk of a league that would divide 200 of the best men boxers in the world (women weren’t included in the plan) into 12 weight classes. TKO would serve as managing partner for the venture and provide day-to-day operational expertise and management under the guidance of Dana White and WWE president Nick Khan.View image in fullscreenCanelo Álvarez, left, and Terence Crawford, right, face off as Turki al-Sheikh and Dana White during a photo shoot at the Bellagio on 8 September in Las Vegas.Photograph: David Becker/Getty Images for Netflix“You know the format,” White told the Ring. “Everybody knows the format. The best fight the best. You work your way up the rankings. And once somebody breaks into the top five - there’s no question who the best five guys in the world are in each weight class - they fight it out. And once somebody holds that belt, you don’t need three [sanctioning body] letters in front of the belt. Whoever has that belt is the best in the world in that weight class. It’s a very simple model.”Fighters could be dropped by the league and replaced by new talent as circumstances warranted.But there was a hitch. The best fighters in the world (as well as their promoters and managers) were reluctant to commit to a venture that required them to cede control over career decisions to Sheikh and White. Thus, TKO shifted its focus from established stars to “exciting young prospects” who would fight for “Ring” belts rather than traditional sanctioning-body titles.Mark Shapiro spelled out the plan on an 6 August 2025 earnings call with analysts:(1) The boxing promotional company will be called “Zuffa Boxing” and is a joint venture between TKO Holdings, the Saudi Arabian General Entertainment Authority, and Sela.(2) Zuffa Boxing will promote approximately 12 “league” fight cards annually for a period of five years.Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stageRead more(3) In addition, TKO will work with Sheikh to promote several super-fights (such as Canelo-Crawford) each year.(4) The league fights and super-fights will be separate businesses.(5) TKO will have no funding obligation with regard to any of the fights and will receive a $10m annual management fee for its services. In addition, with regard to each superfight, TKO will be paid fees to negotiate media rights, sell hospitality packages, and provide other services that are likely to bring TKO an additional $10m per event.An inside source says that, although it was left unsaid, Sela owns 60% of Zuffa Boxing and TKO owns 40%.“I will build stars, put on great fights,” Dana White told Vegas PBS. “And then these guys will graduate and fight with Sheikh Turki.”Zuffa Boxing has been designed to run in the black. Canelo-Crawford – its first promotion – was expected to lose tens of millions of dollars because of the enormous purses paid to the main event fighters. But a well-placed source says that the Saudi Public Investment Fund committed to underwriting that loss. And remember; UFC ran in the red in its formative years. Canelo-Crawford was constructed to establish the Zuffa Boxing brand in the public mind and, equally important, in the collective mind of networks and potential corporate sponsors.There was a time when Canelo and Sheikh were at odds. Sheikh had wanted Canelo to commit to fighting Crawford under the Riyadh Season banner in February 2025 and declared, “I give him the offer. If he is smart, he will accept it.”Canelo didn’t accept it and instead responded, “I respect everybody but I don’t like the way he [Sheikh] talks. It’s his problem, not my problem. I didn’t ask for a fight. They wanted to meet with me and see about the fight with Crawford. I said, ‘Look, after September 14 [when I fight Edgar Berlanga], we can talk. But not right now.’”That earned a harsh rejoinder from Sheikh, who posted on X, “I heard what Canelo said, that he respects me but doesn’t like the way we do business. As for him respecting me, it doesn’t matter to me if he does or not. As for the way I do business, I know why he doesn’t like it because I only target big fights at fair prices, so of course anyone who likes easy fights won’t like that. Also, I’m not the one who’s afraid of fighting [David] Benavidez or Crawford.”Then circumstances changed. In December 2024, Richard Schaefer (who built Golden Boy Promotions and Oscar De La Hoya’s financial portfolio before a falling out between them) became Canelo’s business manager. The first thing Schaefer did was set up a meeting with Canelo and Sheikh to iron out the differences between them. A four-fight deal announced by Sheikh on 6 February resulted.The numbers were staggering. A reliable source says that Canelo’s compensation was styled as fight purse money, payment for serving as a Riyadh Season “ambassador”, and other services. Reports that he was paid $50m to fight William Scull in Riyadh on 3 May and $100m to face Crawford are a bit high. The same is believed to be true of Crawford’s reported $50m purse to fight Canelo. But Sheikh was on the mark when he called Canelo-Crawford “the most expensive boxing contract ever”.Then there was a blip. Canelo-Scull went poorly. The event was sparsely attended. Pay-per-view sales were poor. And the fight was dreadful. Canelowon a unanimous decisionand said afterward, “He just came to survive. For me, that’s a boring fight when a fighter doesn’t try to win. I hate those kind of fighters.”But the seed for bigger things had been planted. And immediately after the bout, Sheikh announced that Canelo-Crawford would be TKO’s first official boxing event.However, not all the ducks had been lined up. And a period of chaos followed.View image in fullscreenCallum Walsh, right, greets Turki al-Sheikh after his victory on last Saturday’s Canelo-Crawford undercard.Photograph: Steve Marcus/Getty ImagesCanelo likes to fight on the Saturday of Mexican Independence Day Weekend, which this year was on 13 September. But UFC had an event (Noche UFC: Lopes v Silva) scheduled for 13 September. And Dana White preferred that Canelo-Crawford take place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on 12 September. That alienated Canelo, who said that he wouldn’t play second fiddle to anyone on Mexican Independence Day Weekend.Complicating matters, the UNLV football team had a home game against Idaho State scheduled for 13 September at Allegiant Field.Sheikh sided with Canelo and, on 18 May, told the Ring that (1) Canelo-Crawford would be on 13 September, not 12 September; (2) the event would be promoted by Sela for Riyadh Season, not TKO; and (3) the fight would be moved from Allegiant Field to either Los Angeles, New York or another site in Las Vegas. He also said that the fight would be on Dazn PPV, not (as previously speculated) on Netflix.Eventually, things got sorted out.Properly incentivized, UNLV and Idaho State agreed to reschedule their game as a 23 August season opener. A reliable source says that UNLV was paid $1.75m and Idaho State received $1.5m for the switch. Noche UFC: Lopes v Silva was moved up by several hours so as to not conflict with Canelo-Crawford. On 8 June, Sheikh posted, “My brother Dana will promote [Canelo-Crawford]. It is the fight of Riyadh Season, and we have a deal with TKO to promote it and it will be the biggest fight in boxing.” Two days later, Sheikh announced that the event would stream on Netflix.Terence Crawford’s career-defining win over Canelo Álvarez was a victory for substance over styleRead moreWhite moved quickly to put his imprimatur on Canelo-Crawford. One of the first things he did was install UFC’s lead commentator Jon Anik (who hadn’t called a boxing match since 2008) as the blow-by-blow commentator. Sheikh had been leaning toward the selection of Jim Lampley.The marketing effort supporting the fight was extensive. But there were some hiccups.For 16 years, Canelo’s fights had been shown for free on Mexican television. But the promotion had sold worldwide rights to Netflix, which wanted the fight exclusively on Netflix in Mexico. Initially, Canelo took the position, “If it’s not on free television in Mexico, I won’t fight.” Eventually he relented.A planned fight-week BoxRaw Sparring Club event in Las Vegas in conjunction with the Ring was cancelled when Nevada Athletic Commission executive director Jeff Mullen made it clear that the “sparring” session would face far more stringent regulation in Sin City thana 11 July BoxRaw eventhad in New York.“We’re not having what happened in New York,” an unnamed NSAC regulator told journalist Lance Pugmire. “These are fights, not sparring. And they would require all of our safety protocols to be in place.”The Fontainebleau paid a generous site fee for the privilege of being the official fight week hotel. There were no discount room rates for the media (who were scattered at hotels throughout Las Vegas). Nor was there an active on-site media center or transportation for the media to attend various events such as the final pre-fight press conference and ceremonial weigh-in (both of which were held at T-Mobile Arena) or the fight itself.On Monday, social media was buzzing when Dana White said that he would bar World Boxing Council president Mauricio Sulaiman from entering the ring after the fight to present the WBC championship belt to the winner. In response, Sulaiman posted, “You better have 2-3 security guards in the corner trying to stop me, because I will enter that ring to place the belt on the winner.”“Dana is running this like he runs a UFC event,” one of the major players on site noted. “He’s controlling every aspect of the promotion and imposing his will on everything that matters to him.”There were times when Canelo balked. He resisted a demand that he attend a media day event on Wednesday. UFC fighters don’t refuse to appear at media day sessions. With Canelo absent, neither Sheikh or White were there either and the session was sparsely attended.Crawford dutifully appeared and took questions for 13 minutes. Asked about a claim by UFC lightweight champion Ilia Topuria that, were the two men to box, he’d knock Crawford out in the first round, Terence responded, “A lot of the UFC guys, they drink a lot. So I don’t pay attention to what they say.”Both Canelo and Crawford later declined to attend a previously scheduled “open workout”.The final pre-fight press conference was held at 6pm on Thursday. Despite White’s disdain for the world sanctioning bodies, Canelo displayed his six championship belts (including his “Ring” belt) on the table in front of him. Sheikh spoke briefly and ended his remarks with, “I want to see Saturday, blood, smashing faces.”View image in fullscreenCanelo Álvarez, red gloves, faced off with Terence Crawford last Saturday night for the undisputed super-middleweight championship.Photograph: Josh Hedges/TKO Worldwide LLC/Getty ImagesThere were moments when the tension between Sheikh and White seemed palpable. Two men with large egos, both of whom are used to having complete control.Max Kellerman (part of the Netflix commentating team) praised White as “the greatest combat sports promoter in my lifetime” and heaped equally lavish encomia on Nick Khan and Sheikh for “fixing” (as in repairing) boxing, which Kellerman said was “not as popular as it used to be”.Canelo (who lives by the mantra “boxing is life”) was doing a slow burn. Finally, he interrupted.“Hey, Max. Boxing has always been big. Don’t say boxing is not big enough. Boxing is big. I respect that other sport [UFC]. But boxing is boxing.”To which Crawford added approvingly, “No lies.”Tickets for the fight had gone on sale on 17 July and were selling on Ticketmaster a day later at prices ranging from $315 to $12,835. The promotion fueled talk of massive demand. But by Thursday of fight week, prices had dropped significantly on the resale market, in some instances to less than 50% of face value. Allegiant Stadium filled up nicely on fight night with an announced attendance of 70,482 (the second largest attendance ever for an indoor fight in the United States).How the Ali Act overhaul is clearing the path for a Saudi-backed takeover of boxingRead moreThe crowd, as expected, was heavily pro-Canelo. In a departure from the norm, no national anthems were played. That offended Canelo, particularly in light of the fact that this was Mexican Independence Day weekend.Crawfordfought well. Canelo didn’t. The judges’ scorecards (116-112, 115-113, 115-113 for Crawford) were on the mark.The fight solidified Crawford’s status as a great fighter. But it will be harder for the powers that be to monetize him than it has been to monetize Canelo. In that vein, one might note that neither White or Sheikh attended the post-fight press conference.Meanwhile, Canelo-Crawford was an important step toward establishing the Zuffa Boxing brand.Traditional promoters in the United States have been imploding. Earlier this year, Dana White declared, “I think the sport of boxing is so broken that it needs to be built from the ground up again.”Jake Paul has shown that there’s a market for boxing. If his scheduled 14 November encounter with Gervonta Davis proceeds as planned, he will have fought three times in 12 months (the first two being against Mike Tyson and Julio Cesar Chavez Jr). Those fights will have been watched by more people and, with the exception of Canelo, Paul will have made more money than any other fighter in boxing during that period. For better or worse, he has demonstrated conclusively that, in today’s world, a fighter doesn’t have to be world-class to be a huge draw.Zuffa Boxing might promote two or three big events featuring elite fighters each year. But like UFC, it will be about creating and marketing a brand. It won’t necessarily have the best fighters. But UFC might not have the world’s best MMA combatants either. It’s possible that there are dozens of MMA fighters who are better than UFC’s champions. We just don’t know who they are.Zuffa Boxing will try to reset the market and promote boxing with a formula similar to the one it uses for UFC. What it needs now is a broadcast deal to monetize its venture. The two prime attractions in TKO’s portfolio – WWE and UFC – recently signed huge network contracts.On 6 August, TKO and ESPN announced a deal that calls for Wrestlemania, Summerslam, Royal Rumble, and several other WWE premium events to be seen exclusively in the United States on various ESPN platforms beginning next year. Five days later, TKO and Paramount announced that, starting in 2026, Paramount will be the exclusive home for all UFC events in the United States pursuant to a seven-year contract with an average (but backloaded) annual license fee of $1.1bn (£816.3m). Paramount will distribute all 13 of UFC’s “marquee numbered events” and 30 “Fight Nights” annually on Paramount+ with some of the numbered events being simulcast on CBS.Paramount and TKO have been reported as being close to an agreement to televise and stream Zuffa Boxing on one or more Paramount platforms. Riyadh Season fights and Ring events would continue on a separate track independent of the league and be available on DAZN and other outlets.Canelo-Crawford might have been the final push that puts a network deal for Zuffa Boxing place. The Netflix numbers for the fight fell far short of the numbers for Tyson-Paul (which peaked at 60m households with more than 108m viewers worldwide). According to a 15 September Netflix post, Canelo-Crawford drew a total of 41m global viewers. Still, that’s a lot of viewers.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford lands a right hand on Canelo Álvarez during last Saturday’s title fight.Photograph: Steve Marcus/Getty ImagesEarlier this year, Sheikh posted on X, “This league is a project not against anyone. It is a project that will have space in the market and we will still see the four belts and the commissions and the promoters. The market is huge and no one can delete anyone from this market. I understand the panic in the market because there are a lot of companies and a lot of promoters. [But] the relationship between Riyadh Season and the relationship between Ring Magazine and the promoters will continue for at least one or two years. This depends on their reactions and what are the options that they will give us. If it is good for us, we will do it.”But “one or two years” sends an ominous message. Dana White has said that he has “no interest” in Zuffa Boxing working with the world sanctioning bodies and other promoters. And while Sheikh has cast himself as the savior of boxing, he now appears to be intent upon controlling the sport and (understandably) making money in the process.That leads to the question of whether Zuffa Boxing will be good for fighters in the long run.UFC currently pays 17-to-20% of its revenue to combatants. In the NFL and NBA, the players receive 50%. In boxing at the elite level, the number is often in the neighborhood of 80%.Explained: why the UFC is set to pay $260m to fighters after a decade-long lawsuitRead moreMoreover, UFC recently paid $375mto settle an antitrust lawsuitbrought against it by UFC fighters who alleged that they had been illegally exploited by the company. That doesn’t sound like an organization that puts fighters first.An early fighter contract (which a representative of Sheikh now says was a draft) was circulated in March of this year. The terms were not fighter friendly. Fighters who signed up would be paid $5,000 within three days of signing but had to commit to a three-year term subsequent to their first bout or, absent a bout, for two years following their signing. Each fighter would be guaranteed at least one fight every five months beginning with their first fight, although Zuffa Boxing would make a “good-faith effort” to give each fighter the opportunity to participate in as many as four fights during the first year. Purses would depend on a fighter’s “ranking” within the company and would range from $20,000 for a ten-round bout by an unranked fighter to $750,000 for a fighter who was defending a company championship.One problem with this proposal is that it’s in clear violation of the Professional Boxer Health and Safety Act and the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act (often referred to jointly as the Ali Act).To deal with this obstacle, the parties controlling Zuffa Boxing hired lobbyists who have spearheaded the introduction of legislation in Congress that would amend the act. Donald Trump has signaled his support for the legislation which is almost certain to pass.A UFC spokesperson told ESPN that the proposed changes are designed to “enhance” the Ali Act by giving fighters “more opportunities”. In truth, the proposed legislation would eliminate several provisions now in place that are designed to protect fighters’ interests. The Ali Act is rarely, if ever, enforced by the government. But it does influence the conduct of some promoters and can be a valuable tool in private litigation.Patrick English is an attorney who has devoted much of his professional life to boxing and was heavily involved in the drafting of Professional Boxer Health and Safety Act and the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act.English is blunt in saying, “The proposed Act betrays fighters. The clear intent is to favor a single promotional entity. The bill was substantially drafted by lobbyists for that entity, to wit Zuffa and its various subdivisions.”More specifically, the proposed amendments would allow for the creation of “unified boxing organizations” (UBOs) which are described in the proposed legislation as an “alternative system for compliance with the requirements of the Act”. Zuffa Boxing, by virtue of its capitalization and organization, could qualify as a UBO. Most promoters couldn’t.The Ali Act was intended to create, among other things, a firewall between ratings organizations, managers and promoters. The proposed amendment destroys that firewall. If the Act is amended, Zuffa Boxing will be able to assume the roles of sanctioning body, manager and promoter.Saudi-backed boxing card takes over Times Square – in picturesRead moreThe original Act requires that promoters make certain financial disclosures to fighters and governing athletic commissions. If the proposed changes become law, fighters would be in the dark as to how much revenue promoters are receiving in conjunction with their fights.The proposed amendments would eliminate the Ali Act’s protection against “coercive contracts” imposed on fighters and allow UBOs to control both championships and rankings. Here, it’s important to remember that, under the draft Zuffa Boxing contract, fighters’ purses would be tied directly to championships and rankings. UBOs could also exclude boxers who have not signed a long-term contract with them from participating in any of their events.Canelo Álvarez andTerence Crawfordboth enrolled for Vada testing three months prior to their fight. Vada (the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association) is boxing’s most reliable entity with regard to testing for illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Its testing is more comprehensive than that of its competitors. And unlike some testing agencies, Vada reports test results to each fighter’s camp, the promoter, and the governing state athletic commission.The drug testing provisions provided for in the proposed amendments to the Ali Act are a sham. A UBO could set up its own PED-testing program and, if it chose, have results reported only to itself.“The potential for the hiding of results,” English notes, “is obvious.”Or phrased differently: How many times since UFC instituted its own PED-testing program has a UFC fight been pulled down or the outcome of a fight changed because of a positive PED test result?There are several positives in the proposed legislation, but they’re minimal. The bill would require pay of at least $150 per round for all fighters and require all promoters and UBOs to secure a minimum of $25,000 in medical coverage for injuries sustained by a fighter during a match. But $25,000 won’t scratch the surface in the event of serious injury. By way of contrast, the New York State Athletic Commission requires a medical insurance policy that covers up to one million dollars for life-threatening brain injuries and $50,000 for everything else.If Sheikh and his Saudi backers withdrew entirely from boxing tomorrow, traditional market forces would return to play. The proposed Ali Act amendments, if enacted into law, will change the landscape of boxing far into the future.Meanwhile, without these amendments to the Ali Act, the Saudi boxing program might have to retrench. Multiple sources have told the Guardian that the unthinkable has happened: that the Saudi boxing program seems to have a cash flow problem and that some of the high-level players who came to Las Vegas during Canelo-Crawford fight week were there, not for the fight but to get paid for services rendered in the past. And they left still being owed money.Sheikh has earned plaudits (and deservedly so) for financing important fights among today’s heavyweights as well as significant bouts in lighter weight divisions such as the title unification bouts between Arthur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol. As a result of these fights, a relatively small number of fighters and promoters have made an enormous amount of money. But that could change if competing promoters are marginalized or driven out of business as a result of Zuffa Boxing’s expanding tentacles.Thus, it’s worth remembering whatCanelo Álvarezsaid in an interview with the Ring earlier this year: “The next generation of fighters needs to understand that they must manage themselves and earn well. It’s not about risking your life in the ring for nothing. Many great fighters have ended up broke because all they cared about was throwing punches.”Thomas Hauser’s email address is thomashauserwriter@gmail.com.

It concluded with a grid turned upside down and the two world championship rivals, Lando Norris andOscar Piastri, left languishing in seventh and ninth.F1: Verstappen on pole after Leclerc and Piastri crash out of chaotic Azerbaijan GP qualifying – liveRead moreVerstappen is not given to hyperbole so his verdict on qualifying was indicative of just how hard it had been. “This track is already hard enough without anything,” he said. “So, with the strong winds that we had, the car was moving around a lot. Understeer, oversteer in different places on the straights, going left to right. To basically nail everything and also then the big interruptions that we had was just very tricky.”Williams’ Carlos Sainz had the track’s measure to claim a remarkable second, while Liam Lawson was third for Racing Bulls, his best qualifying result. The session lasted a full two hours with no fewer than seven drivers – including Piastri and Ferrari’sCharles Leclerc– crashing out.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen held his nerve to claim the top spot with a 1min 41.117sec lap.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Formula 1/Getty ImagesHigh tailwinds made the cars unstable, the poor conditions compounded by drizzle late in the session – hardly a showcase for the pinnacle of motor racing. Time after time drivers were caught out, being too hot into corners and made to look decidedly average.From the championship perspective it was the unusual unforced error from Piastri, who ploughed into a wall, which might have been most costly. “I braked a little bit late,” said the Australian championship leader. “It was a case of trying a little bit too hard and paying the price.”Yet just as his title rival Norris had a shot at reeling in the 31-point gap to his teammate, he failed to capitalise when he too brushed a wall on his final lap. He felt it cost him a little time but believed the team should have put him out later on those final decisive laps, asRed Bullhad with Verstappen.Quick GuideAzerbaijan F1 gridShow1Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull 1min 41.117sec2Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams 1:41.5953Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bulls 1:41.7074Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedes 1:41.7175George Russell(GB) Mercedes 1:42.0706Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull 1:42.1437Lando Norris(GB) McLaren 1:42.2398Isack Hadjar(Fr) Racing Bulls 1:42.3729Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLaren No Time Set10Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrari No Time SetQ211Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martin 1:41.85712Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrari 1:42.18313Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Kick 1:42.27714Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin 1:43.06115Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas F1 No Time SetQ116Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine 1:42.77917Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Kick 1:42.91618Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpine 1:43.13919Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams 1:43.77820 *Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas F1 1:43.004*Placed last due to failing test on rear wingWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As it is neitherMcLarendriver has much chance of catching the Dutchman, who was quick throughout qualifying, and the duo are in a fight of their own on Sunday for those vital championship points. Norris must move forward, Piastri must go with him.The elongated qualifying barely achieved any momentum given the stoppages, four in Q1 alone, and as it progressed so the damage toll rose until the final session as light rain began to pepper the track. Sainz had set the opening quickest lap to take the top spot only for Leclerc to cause the fifth red flag of the session, putting it in the wall at turn 15 when carrying too much speed, before the other main contenders had set their times.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Surely this time to the finish?Verstappen duly went out first but before he could finish a lap, Piastri too was caught out going in with too much speed at turn three and clattering front-first into the barrier. The red flag was deployed once more before anyone had set a time.A one-shot showdown to decide the grid was all that remained in the final four minutes and Norris went out first. He wrestled with the car, which was squirming beneath him on a damp track, and he too brushed the wall at turn 16. His chance of putting a big point swing on Piastri was likely gone.Verstappen, as ever given half a chance, grasped it and was flying, quickest in the first sector he held his nerve to claim the top spot with a 1min 41.117sec lap. It was his first pole in Baku, where he has yet to win, and with a Williams and a Racing Bull closest to him he will fancy he has every chance to convert it to victory.It is a fitting opportunity for holding it together in Baku where, on the form his colleagues demonstrated in qualifying, a long-old race may be in prospect on Sunday too.Lewis Hamilton was disappointed to manage only 12th, knocked out in Q2 for Ferrari after he had felt more confident as the weekend progressed.

I have no complaints at all with the support that we’ve had and the support from the supporters and everyone at the club.“Do I believe I can turn it around? Of course. I also understand it’s tough.

The Lynx also have a solid group around her including co-Defensive Player of the Year Alanna Smith, Courtney Williams and Kayla McBride.The Lynx also have the advantage of a bit more rest then the Mercury, having finished off their series with Golden State on Wednesday.“We’ve matched up with Minnesota pretty well all season. We’re going to celebrate tonight and worry about them tomorrow,” Phoenix coach Nate Tibbetts said.The other matchup will have the experienced Aces playing a short-handed Indiana team. The sixth-seeded Fever shocked Atlanta in the opening round, winning without Clark, who is sidelined for the playoffs with a right groin injury that kept her out of the last 2 1/2 months of the regular season. Indiana is led by Kelsey Mitchell, who had the best season of her career, and Aliyah Boston.They’ll face an Aces team that needed a go-ahead basket on a follow shot with 12 seconds left to beat Seattle and reach the semi-finals. Reigning MVP A’ja Wilson has been stellar all season long and raised her game during the Aces’ winning streak and first round of the playoffs.The Aces won their final 16 games of the regular season, but struggled in their games against the Fever early in the year, dropping two of the three meetings. The last time they played was July 24 and the Aces, who won back-to-back titles in 2022 and 2023, have been a very different team since.Explore more on these topicsWNBANew York LibertyIndiana FeverLas Vegas AcesUS sportsCaitlin ClarkShareReuse this content"

There was a rare lack of late drama in their Merseyside derby triumph over Everton, instead having to cling on to secure the points.After a swashbuckling first half in which Ryan Gravenberch and Hugo Ekitiké created a two-goal lead for the champions, Everton awoke and got back into the match thanks to Idrissa Gueye. From then on the visitors were the better team and causedLiverpoolplenty of problems but David Moyes left Anfield for the 21st time without a Premier League victory.Liverpool 2-1 Everton: Premier League – live reactionRead moreEverton approached the game cautiously, putting everyone in blue behind the ball whenever Liverpool were in possession. Moyes plotted a pragmatic gameplan in the hope of keeping the league leaders quiet. Liverpool took advantage of how deep their opponents were, enjoying the vast majority of possession. An early goal felt almost inevitable and it came within 10 minutes when Gravenberch broke through the defensive lines to reach a bouncing Mohamed Salah cross, which he hooked beyond Jordan Pickford with expert technique.There were glimpses of promise for Everton to get back into the game. Playing in a direct fashion, Beto was hassling the Liverpool centre-backs and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall fired wide after a neat exchange with Jack Grealish, but these are the chances that need to be taken at Anfield.Ekitiké proved that soon after. The composure of Gravenberch has been central to Liverpool’s success this season, in which he has been given more freedom to attack. As for his goal, a gap between the left centre-back and full-back was exposed with a precision pass, this time from the Dutchman, which Ekitiké latched on to and sent under Pickford.Everton’s Grealish and Moyes hit out at referee over stoppage timeRead moreLiverpool have enjoyed two-goal leads before this season and made life difficult for themselves. With Gravenberch controlling play, Everton were not able to push back as often as required. Beto fired an Iliman Ndiaye cross wide but otherwise the hosts were comfortable, despite the opposition pushing their wingers further forward in an attempt to pressure the full-backs.Reunited with the Premier League-winning duo of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai in midfield for the first time this season, with Florian Wirtz left on the bench, Gravenberch and his partners showed the understanding they had built up over time. They know where the others will be and when to make runs, something Wirtz is still learning about. The Dutchman is one of the most efficient distributors in England and keeps Liverpool moving forward but also has the defensive intelligence and muscle to stifle opponents.Everton sent on Thierno Barry for Beto at half-time and returned to the more expansive football they had shown in previous games. Finding a route back into a match against a side of Liverpool’s quality is an inevitably difficult task and pushing to reduce the deficit opened up the fixture, surprisingly to Everton’s benefit.View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitiké shows his delight after scoring Liverpool’s second.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersLiverpool’s vulnerability at full-back was once again exposed as Grealish eased his way past Conor Bradley, before chipping a cross to the back post to the unmarked Ndiaye who laid it off to Gueye, who cannoned the ball into the back of the net. The shot was struck so powerfully, Alisson did not have time to react. Everton had hope and Liverpool had more questions about their ability to hold on to leads.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As against Atlético Madrid, the nerves were growing inside Anfield. Grealish kept attacking Bradley with the ambition of repeating his earlier trick, while Ndiaye was becoming more direct with his running in to make the Liverpool players chase towards their own goal.Liverpool were giving away cheap fouls, often because they were unable to cope with Grealish’s dribbling. The Everton wide man was showing why he was so successful at Manchester City with his energy and ability to move at speed with the ball at his feet. Everton were having the better of the attacking play and Liverpool were once again creaking but held on to complete five consecutive league wins under Slot for the first time.Everton were irritated at the end, with Grealish picking up a booking for haranguing the referee. They will be annoyed they did not test Alisson more considering the positions they got themselves into. They are lacking a top quality No 9 but their wingers and midfield are showing promise that, after years of struggle, they are on an upward trajectory that will allow them to focus on the top half of the table. Liverpool had only three shots on target but scored with two of them, showing the fine margins between the sides.Liverpool’s performances are certainly not perfect but the change in personnel this summer means everyone in the squad is still adjusting. They have points on the board, too, and plenty of quality that is highly likely to improve, as individuals and collectively.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

And that is what we’re going to do at Bethpage.”It was this parting shot that epitomisedRory McIlroy’s 2023 Ryder Cup. Stirred by a Saturdayspat with the American caddieJoe LaCava, McIlroy came close to brawling in a car park before returning on day three to lead Europe’s comprehensive victory in Rome. Amid wild celebration, he promised the Ryder Cup would be retained. Exaggerated words or ones to stand by?‘The Ryder Cup will be on Concorde’: when Europe won in the USA in 1995Read more“I am maybe more confident than I was then,” McIlroy tells me in a quiet corner of the locker room at East Lake, Atlanta. “Obviously I said that in the euphoria of winning the Ryder Cup but I think with everything that has happened since; the way our team is shaping up, Luke agreeing to be the captain again, having the continuity of the team the way it is, the form of the Europeans all of this year but especially leading into the event.“If I compare it to the last two away Ryder Cups that I have played, I would say we are in a way better spot. I still believe we are the underdogs but I feel more confident than I was in 2016 and 2021 that we can pull it off.”McIlroy returns to the Ryder Cup arena as the sixth man in history to complete a career grand slam, his already exalted status elevated further. Events at the Masters in April will serve as the reference point for this and so many other golfing years, regardless of whether or not Luke Donald and co can topple Keegan Bradley’s USA. McIlroy’s lovability was as noteworthy as the fact he ticked off his final major after a wait of more than a decade. Those words from Italy, though, prove McIlroy had Bethpage on his mind long before Augusta National was conquered.“When wewon at Medinah in 2012I didn’t appreciate what it meant,” says McIlroy. “It was only my second Ryder Cup and my first away and I think I didn’t appreciate the magnitude of what was happening, especially the way it played out that Sunday afternoon. It is a bit of a distant memory. I would love that feeling again. I can take myself back there, absolutely, and the feelings I had were great, amazing. I just don’t think I really appreciated how difficult that was to do.”View image in fullscreenA youthful Rory McIlroy (left) enjoys Europe’s miracle at Medinah at the 2012 Ryder Cup with Darren Clarke (centre) and Sergio García.Photograph: Graham Chadwick/Daily Mail/ShutterstockThere is a broader theory the Ryder Cup would benefit from even the occasional away success. “Absolutely it would,” McIlroy nods. “It’s not that it needs any life breathed into the event but it would add an extra dimension. One of the really intriguing things about the Ryder Cup now is; what team is going to blink first? It’s almost like holds of serve, who is going to break serve? When the Americans came to Rome, it had been 30 years since they won away.”McIlroy could have faced Patrick Cantlay, for whom LaCava caddies, in match three on that Ryder Cup Sunday. After conversation with Donald, McIlroy decided it would be better to remove himself from that situation. McIlroy instead saw off Sam Burns in match four. “Historically I have gone third and they knew that,” McIlroy says. “I think it was better for me, better for the team, better for all of us. On Sunday you don’t care who you win your point against.”In 2016 at Hazeltine, McIlroy was at the centre of drama involving US fans and Patrick Reed. When Rome and the vociferous nature of New York fans is added to the mix, it is reasonable to ponder what may transpire next. The tribal nature of a non-tribal sport triggers strange things. “It is not planned,” McIlroy insists. “It is not as if any of this is premeditated.“I think it’s inevitable something is going to happen in New York. It might not involve me but it is inevitable that something will happen, whether like in Rome last time or something else.“I just think when you go into that environment and you are there for five or six days and the crowd are on you for eight hours, so many days in a row … it is inevitable it will get to someone or get to us as a group at some point. We are just going to have to do a really good job of managing that, having each other’s backs and protecting each other.”View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy saw off a rival he will be facing at the Ryder Cup, Bryson DeChambeau, on his way to lifting the Masters trophy in April.Photograph: Cj Gunther/EPAMcIlroy does not so much roll his eyes as laugh when Bryson DeChambeau’s approach is raised. DeChambeau crumbled asMcIlroy triumphed at Augusta. Somewhat curiously, then, the American intends to “chirp in the ear” of McIlroy at Bethpage. The response is a withering one. “I think the only way he gets attention is by mentioning other people,” says McIlroy. “That is basically what I think of that. To get attention he will mention me or Scottie [Scheffler] or others.”The venue for this interview serves as an endearing reminder of McIlroy’s march into the pantheon of greats. Seven years ago in this very locker room McIlroy shared his thoughts with me as Tiger Woods walked past us. Woods was to win that week in Atlanta amid rapturous scenes topped only by his Masters glory the following spring. McIlroy was still waiting, waiting, waiting for the Green Jacket. Back in precisely the same spot in 2025 McIlroy signs Masters flags as we talk and Woods is no longer a competitive element.When McIlroy reached his holy grail at the Masters this year external sentiment turned towards what he may do next. This was unfair, of course, and grated with the man himself. McIlroy adds: “People started to go on about the calendar slam. I was like, ‘Let me just enjoy this one.’“I think that is what people want from sportspeople. They don’t want sportspeople to say they are satisfied because that gives off the idea that you are not putting 100% into what you are doing, which we all are. When you have had a goal for so long and you achieve it, it just takes a little time to reset some goals.”This took McIlroy into fascinating psychological territory. On one hand, he could gladly have taken months away from the game. On the other, there was a natural instinct to rededicate himself to his craft. Even when the Ryder Cup was the prominent thing in the 36-year-old’s mind, he rolled in a 30ft birdie putt to secure a playoff spot at an Irish Openhe was to eventually win.“When you have that feeling, when you win that thing, it is almost like all the other stuff doesn’t matter in a way,” McIlroy says. “Not that it actually doesn’t. It is a double edged sword.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy used an argument with Patrick Cantlay’s caddie Joe LaCava as inspiration for Europe’s Ryder Cup victory two years ago.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“I have realised over the past few years that when all is said and done, people aren’t going to remember how much money I won. What they are going to remember is how many majors I won. So getting up for those? Not a concern at all. It’s the week-in, week-out stuff that I have found a bit of a struggle at times. The majors and the Ryder Cup are the five things in golf that at this point really matter to me.“It was unbelievable to win the Masters with [caddie and best friend] Harry [Diamond]. I would love to win an Open with Harry. I would love to get that US Open that we have been so close to. It’s sometimes not just about me, it is about the other people who have been on the journey too.”McIlroy, whose home is in Florida, always looks content in Europe. There is a “reminiscent” feeling for him there that seems to feed into his Ryder Cup desires. “I think about my early days as a pro,” he says. “It brings me back to a simpler time in life where I was just so happy to travel the world and play golf. I enjoy playing in front of home crowds, which I struggled with earlier in my career. These people have watched me grow up. You can definitely disconnect with the wider golf world. It maybe doesn’t feel all encompassing. I find it easier to detach from every day tour life.”BeingRory McIlroy. It is a concept nobody else can relate to, although so many try. Offer the man himself a little peace and quiet and he might just snap your hand off.“It is a struggle for me to love the position I am in all the time,” he admits. “There are times when I would like to just breeze through life and not get the attention I do but I understand that with what I have done in the game, that is just part of it. There are times that I yearn for a little anonymity and having a quieter life. That will happen one day. This is my time in the sun. In 10 years it won’t be and that is my time to enjoy that part of it.” Enjoy him while he lasts.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyRyder CupGolfinterviewsShareReuse this content"

How has it been? How do you feel? More, or less, in love? Have you counted down the days? Are you happier, wiser, more centred, like a man in a porridge advert going for a soulful morning run in a sunlit cul-de-sac?Perhaps, to offer another perspective, you feel so viscerally nauseated at the prospect of leafing through the pre-planned partisan responses to a highly complex piece of legal wrangling there’s a danger your own intestines will liquefy and snort out of your nostrils straight into the toaster. Who knows? Maybe that was the point all along.Either way, as of this week it is one year since the start of the Manchester City charges tribunal. Remember that old thing? The 115 charges,later upgraded to more than 130. Remember the sense of something urgent and real in train, but which already feels like a period piece, the kind of thing you might see on a clip-based nostalgia show, like Ocean Colour Scene or the Ebola virus?If Chelsea are guilty over Abramovich payments a fine would make a mockery of the rules | Rob DaviesRead moreA year is a long time in tribunal world, not least because if you follow football in any way you are ultimately paying for it. As such that anniversary probably deserves to be marked in some ceremonial sense, likethe Torajan tribepeople in Indonesiawho exhume their dead every year and dress them in new clothes, have a chat and pose for family photos. Perhaps we should be out there dusting off Lord Dyson or similar, sticking a cigarette between his lips, parading him about in a sedan chair.Except, the Torajans don’t do this solely out of fondness or love, but also out of fear, reverence for the gods, anxiety over future rice harvests. And this feels about right for thePremier Leagueat the end of its year of vast expense and gruelling mental fatigue, all of it shot through by now with the sense City have already won this process, in more ways than one.This has by now become something of a joke on the football periphery. Why has it taken so long? The charges relate to financial reporting, employee remuneration and profitability and sustainability regulation. How hard can it be to resolve this?Actually very hard, and this is normal. As someone with a professional insight into the process of corporate law, there is, to use a technical term, masses of complex bullshit to wade through. One semi-dead case at my old law firm had been going on for eight years, much of that time taken up dusting off files in a south-coast hangar and aggressively ranking local seafood restaurants.But this is, of course, very far from a joke. By now that basic expanse of time is significant in itself. Time is money. Lots of time is lots of money. It has been estimated the Premier League’s bill for legal expenses over the past five years could be as high as £200m.The Nottingham Forest and Everton stuffhas also happened. Chelsea are even now dealing with historical regulatory breaches under the ownership of an oligarch widely viewed as Kremlin-connected that, frankly, nobody could have foreseen and that’s all just fine.It is also important to state explicitly that there is no evidenceManchester Cityhave used complex litigation tactics to delay and wear down their opponents. Nobody has any cause to say this. There is a word for that tactic which is not, as far as anyone knows, in play here, and that term is lawfare, a practice familiar to rich and powerful entities faced with inconvenient regulation.We know from defamation law what aSlapp suitis, also known as strategic litigation against public participation, described in the UK parliament as “a suite of litigious techniques, designed to intimidate, suppress and destroy” those in its path. Cases become endlessly complex. Related claims are submitted. Settlements are dangled, costs weaponised. You do want the pain to stop, don’t you?This process has been identified by parliament as a threat to democracy, also known in some circles as “the tyranny of the majority”. Again there is no evidence City have any interest in this, or are doing anything other than defending their right to go about their business.View image in fullscreenA leaked email said Manchester City chair Khaldoon al-Mubarak ‘would rather spend £30m on the 50 best lawyers in the world to sue for the next 10 years’ than submit to Uefa’s financial prodding.Photograph: Andrew Yates/APWell, there’s only arms-length and disputed evidence, such as theleaked historical email from Simon Cliff, City’s legal kingpin, that suggested the club’s chair Khaldoon al-Mubarak “would rather spend £30m on the 50 best lawyers in the world to sue for the next 10 years” than submit to Uefa’s financial prodding. There was the unrelated comment in October 2024 that the league’s plan to update its rules rather than collapsing them was “an unwise course [which] would likely to lead to further legal proceedings with further legal costs”. Again. You do want it to stop, don’t you?There is also the no doubt unintended consequences of City’s subsequent legal challenges to the associated party transaction rules, which both sides have claimed victory over, City despite failing on most of their points (again, this happens: just raise lots of points).It was hard to understand exactly what the ultimate intention was here. The Lawyer magazine has noted City were “particularly eager for shareholder loans to be calculated retrospectively under the new rules”, despite having previously voted in favour of existing rules on that. This will now not happen. It would explain in part why the league feels it came out relatively unscathed, because this would have basically tied it in knots, a potential review of every loan to every club by every shareholder, a process that could have effectively collapsed its ability to function.And this is all unsustainable in the long term. It’s a nightmare for the Premier League, which is not a legal entity but a light-entertainment production company whose rules are written in clear type, agreed to by everyone, and not really intended to be countered quite so aggressively. It’s a nightmare for its chief executive Richard Masters, who must have thought he was becoming a TV rights administrator, not a wartime prime minister. The clubs gave his predecessor a golden goodbye as a thank you. Masters’ key gift so far is a series of fraught legal briefings and, probably, an ulcer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even if they are substantively punished, which increasingly just feels unlikely given the timeframe and the brilliance of City’s legal team, there remains the threat of an appeal. Come. Keep coming. Follow us into the plains towards Moscow. How deep are your coffers? How strong is your will?It's the opposite of sport, and of the flawed but necessary machinery of semi-regulated capitalismPlus the past year has coincided with a general shift in the landscape, threats to boundaries and delivery systems, other mega-competitions mushrooming up. Do you really want to pursue and potentially discredit your eight-time champions like this? Is your product really so robust and discrete you can afford the consequences?More widely this already feels like a victory for the dominant paradigm in every other part of modern life: a victory for billionaire culture, for the idea of rules as a suggestion for the powerless.And also for populism, for hard power masked by obfuscation. There is something wretched about the hot-button shouting tagged to the legal process by City’s mouthpieces, a rag-bag of stuff about elites, cartels and victimisation of the overclass.Chuck in the free-market libertarian nonsense, the “commercial freedom” ideas parroted around this issue by people who don’t understand what a free market is (clue: it’s not a government spending above market on its propaganda project. This is market distortion. This is the command economy, chaps).But then, this is just a glimpse through the lens of the autocratic billionaire life. This is l’état c’est nous. It’s the opposite of sport, and of the flawed but necessary machinery of semi-regulated capitalism. It skirts around the essential, as-yet unprocessed question of why a government would want to own a football club in the first place.By now the best outcome for English football as a business entity is probably a settlement and a fudge. In realpolitik terms, everyone just needs it to stop. There is a suspicion, unfounded in hard facts, that there has already been horse trading around this, which may or may not be possible given the basic notion of an independent tribunal.What does seem certain is the outcome will not harm City’s project in any real sense, that the prospect of punishment has already lent it purpose and drive, binding adversity, conspiracy waffle, victim energy. Booing the overclass, raising your fists to the cartel, this is all deeply exhilarating. Twelve months on it is hard to see an outcome where even losing, nominally, technically, has any real meaning.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPremier LeagueFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

This is despite the country’s record on human rights, as highlighted by Amnesty International’s reports of “enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, excessive use of force, unfair trials and restrictions on the right to freedom of expression”.Since announcing Rwanda as host for the 2025 world championships, Lappartient has been dismissive of those criticising Kagame’s regime. “In all the countries in the world, you can find some points where they can be better, but when I see where Rwanda was, and where it is now, it’s great,” Lappartient said.“We are always careful about human rights because it’s in our DNA as an international federation to keep in mind the values of the Olympic movement, of peace, respect and human rights.”View image in fullscreenThe Israel-Premier Tech riders link arms during the 21st and last stage of the Vuelta on Sunday. Rival teams could boycott future races that involve them.Photograph: Javier Lizón/EPAMeanwhile, the proposed boycott of the Israel-Premier Tech team continues to gather pace with both Barcelona, venue for the Grand Départ of the 2026 Tour de France, and the Canary Islands, location of the finale of next year’s Vuelta, refusing to accept the presence of the team.Against the backdrop of the spiralling debate, which has now set the UCI against the Spanish government, the measured and precise Lappartient finds himself in the eye of a storm over sport and politics.There are those close to the UCI who feel that a man more at home pondering handlebar width and aerodynamic sock length, and who garnered only four votes at the recent IOC presidency elections, may now be a little out of his depth.There is provision in the UCI rules to suspend the licence of a UCI World Tour team to “protect the image” of the World Tour.However, complications may arise in the debate over the Israel-Premier Tech team’s status as it is not currently a World Tour team. However, neither was the Russian-registered Gazprom-RusVelo team that was banned from competition following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Liverpool statement expressed the club’s deep shock and sadness at the news.Beard guided the club to two WSL titles in consecutive seasons in 2013 and 2014, in his first of two spells in charge of the club. In the second spell, he led them to promotion back to the top flight. He is the most successful manager in Liverpool’s women’s team’s history.Beard’s wife, Deb, wrote on social media: “It is with great sadness that our beautiful Matthew Beard has passed away tonight [Saturday] at 7.28pm. He is a loving husband, father, son, brother and uncle. He was the most amazing, caring man who was loved by anyone who had the pleasure to meet him.“All of our family kindly ask for time to grieve in peace at his loss.

The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Matt’s family and friends at this devastating time.“Matt was not only an extremely committed and successful manager, he was also a person of real integrity and warmth, who will always be remembered with genuine fondness by everyone he worked with at the club.”In a statement on X, the WSL said: “Everyone at WSL Football extends its deepest sympathies to the family, friends and loved ones of Matt Beard following news of his passing. Matt played an instrumental role in the growth of women’s football and will be missed by everyone associated with the game.”Beard, who was in charge of Liverpool last season and was most recently the manager at Burnley, was also a Cup finalist while in charge of West Ham, and had spells managing Bristol City, Chelsea and Boston Breakers.Beard was named as the WSL’s manager of the year in 2013 and 2014. He was appointed as the Burnley manager in June 2025 but resigned in August.The Professional Footballers’ Association said: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Matt Beard.

Conceding lots of goals from set pieces? Hire a specialist coach who will transform your team into one of the most efficient in the Premier League. Finding it hard to get one over on your former boss after a run of eight straight defeats? Devise a gameplan that restricts their most important players and lead Arsenal to five games unbeaten againstManchester Cityif you include the Community Shield win in 2023, equalling the longest streak of any manager against Pep Guardiola, alongside Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel.“To beat them we had to lose against them,” Arteta said after the scrappy 1-0 victory at the Emirates in October 2023 that was Arsenal’s first over City in the Premier League since December 2015. “The team showed a real maturity that comes from experiences. Sometimes you need that to become a better team.”Arteta insists Arsenal have a ‘wonderful future’ despite surprise boardroom exitRead moreLast season’s5-1 victory at the Emirateswould have felt particularly satisfying, even if ultimately it didn’t deliver what Arteta craves because Liverpool condemned Arsenal to a third successive runners-up spot. With Guardiola in town again on Sunday and desperate for revenge, Arteta knows another three points will be important to keep up the pressure on Arne Slot’s side after adefeat at Anfieldbefore the international break.Impressive victories overNottingham ForestandAthletic Bilbaosince then without conceding, despite the absence of the injured William Saliba, showed the importance of having a much deeper squad, the new signing Cristhian Mosquera stepping in impressively. Piero Hincapié – who joined on an initial loan from Bayer Leverkusen – was handed his debut in Spain and the versatile Ecuador central defender, who is also capable of playing as a left-back, gives Arteta even more options.Arsenal drew seven and lost one of 14 Premier League matches they played directly after a Champions League game last season – including both 2-2 draws against Liverpool – and their manager acknowledged they must try to be more consistent to sustain a challenge. “That’s something we want to improve,” said Arteta. “We will try to do better.”He is banking on Arsenal’s array of attacking options to make the difference. After Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard came off the bench to score in Bilbao, Arteta made no secret of the fact he has taken inspiration from rugby union inviewing his substitutes as “finishers”, although he could just as easily have found it by watching Sarina Wiegman manage England to a second successive European title in the summer.View image in fullscreenArsenal kicked off their Champions League campaign with victory at Athletic Club.Photograph: Luis Tejido/EPA“If you look historically, the top teams, the teams that have won a lot, the impact that the finishers had has always been really, really high,” said Arteta on Friday. “You need that quality nowadays to unlock games and to do it consistently every three days. It’s even harder and that’s what you need. We are very lucky because we have players that can make that impact. They certainly did that the other day and now we need consistency on that.”There were rumours that Martinelli and Trossard could be allowed to depart in the summer but it is understood Arteta was keen to keep both despite the arrivals of Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze. Martinelli and Trossard scored 10 goals each last season and made regular contributions, even if the former has struggled to hit the heights of the 2022-23 campaign when he managed 15. But the Brazilian’s pace provides a very different option on the left to Eze, who prefers to drift inside.Finding the right balance as the games come thick and fast over the coming months will be the next big problem for Arteta to resolve. For example, Myles Lewis-Skelly has yet to start a game this season as Riccardo Calafiori has established himself at left-back thanks to his ability to provide more width. The 18-year-old did play for England against Andorra last week but was left out of the squad that travelled to Serbia a few days later. “When you don’t play, you have to fight to win that place back – that’s it,” said Arteta of Lewis-Skelly before the international break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With continuing doubts over Martin Ødegaard’s fitness after the captain missed the win over Athletic with a shoulder issue, he is likely to stick with a midfield of Martín Zubimendi, Declan Rice and Mikel Merino against a City side that hope to be boosted bythe presence of Rodri, who missed the 5-1 defeat in February after sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the 2-2 draw at the Etihad earlier in the season.Merino has also shown his versatility as a back-up striker to Viktor Gyökeres as Kai Havertz continues to recover from a knee operation. Gyökeres required stitches after he and Merino sustained head injuries against Athletic that have not ruled them out of the City game.“Winning those matches creates that conviction that you can go and win the game but not against them, against any opposition,” said Arteta of Arsenal’s recent success against City. “That’s the feeling I have now with the team and the players individually: that on Sunday we are going there to win the game.

Goals from Alex Iwobi and Harry Wilson plus an Ethan Pinnock own goal enabled Marco Silva’s men to bounce back from an early concession to take three points with something to spare. In claiming the spoils once again in this west London derby, Fulham also took some of the shine off Keith Andrews’ start asBrentfordmanager in the process.This was a meeting both of local rivals and of the Premier League’s burgeoning middle class, with both teams capable of mixing their approach and in possession of squads of technically gifted yet physically imposing athletes. Silva’s tactical tinkering, shifting Harry Wilson to negate Keane Lewis-Potter down the right, linking Iwobi with Ryan Sessegnon on the left, ultimately outdid the trusted Brentford strategy of limiting opportunities to opponents and maximising set pieces. The inefficiencies with which Andrews’ men effected their strategy, however, will be of concern.“We were the best team on the pitch, our first half was top level from the first minute,” a bullish Silva said. “We were on the front foot, we were very aggressive, we created many problems for them. We conceded a goal we didn’t deserve, but the support for Josh in that moment was lovely to see and what a reaction. We kept cool and we showed our resilience.”Silva was referring to the error from Josh King that continued the 18-year-old’s baptism of fire in the Premier League, just two games after his first senior goal waschalked off incorrectly by officialsagainst Chelsea. Starting once again as Fulham’s playmaker, he came deep to collect the ball in the 20th minute, but played it blind across the pitch, leading to an interception by Mikkel Damsgaard and a cool finish past Bernd Leno. The teenager’s teammates were immediately on hand, however, Alex Iwobi wrapping an arm around King as they walked back towards halfway.Iwobi went on to become the central figure in the game asFulhamdug in and fought their way back into the match. On the half-hour, his understanding with Sessegnon down the left helped him tee up the full-back for an effort that Caoimhín Kelleher could only spill to Rodrigo Muniz, who lofted the ball over from a tight angle. Eight minutes later Iwobi had the equaliser himself, capitalising on uncertainty among any number of Brentford defenders to turn home low under the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper.View image in fullscreenEthan Pinnock (not pictured) scores an own goal at Craven Cottage.Photograph: Adam Davy/PATwo minutes later, the Nigeria international also had an assist to his name, as Wilson gave Fulham the lead. This was a delightful goal, in both its precision and its efficiency. More fumbling from Brentford’s backline, this time a scuffed header from Nathan Collins, allowed Muniz to seize the ball.The Brazilian drove forward then shifted possession to his left to Iwobi, who looked back across the pitch to where Wilson was driving infield from the right, begging for the ball. Iwobi found him with a wonderful pass that bisected the entire Brentford backline and Wilson arrived in the box to finish first time with his left foot beyond Kelleher’s right hand.The noise in Craven Cottage lifted a notch from that moment and in the second half the home side become more dominant. They got a third goal in the 50th minute thanks to Sessegnon’s left foot, a cross whipped across the line of the Brentford six-yard box causing now predictable uncertainty and ending in a stooping Pinnock turning the ball into his own net. A fourth goal appeared to arrive five minutes later after Muniz bullied his way to goal, a little too forcefully according to Michael Oliver who, at the behest of the video assistant referee, found a trailing elbow from the Brazilian had bloodied Collins in the buildup and ordered an overturn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s three away defeats out of three now, and eight points conceded from winning positions.“We’re building a new team and at this level when there’s indecision it can hurt you,” Andrews said. “There was a period where they just started to get the better of us.

I’ve never seen a player in my whole life get booked for taking a quick free-kick. I don’t know where that rule has come in. Even the stoppage-time, three minutes and one minute – I’ve never seen that in the Premier League in the last two or three years.“There were frustrations with the referee. Sometimes you want to let the game go, I completely get that, but you can’t not give us something and then two seconds later one of their defenders goes down after getting touched in the back and he gives it.“You come to these stadiums and the crowd are on them, I feel that they feel they have to give it. Kiernan [Dewsbury-Hall] is on four yellows now and he got one for taking a quick free-kick. We want to get the game going, we’re losing.”Everton had the better of the second half after a much-improved performance compared with their offering before the break and caused Liverpool problems. “Three minutes was very strange,” Moyes said of the time added at the end. “Every quick free-kick had to be stopped and brought back for the whistle and then we get a booking for it. I find it quite unbelievable.”Arne Slot praised Liverpool’s resilience after they held on to secure a fifth straight Premier League win.

Though where last season in thePremier League, there was rarely anything other than surrender, there is a fighting spirit within Thomas Frank’s team.Brighton scored two fine first-half goals, Yankuba Minteh’s solo effort followed by an opportunistic long-range strike from Yasin Ayari, in a 45 minutes where Tottenham dominated possession but left open the back door. Richarlison’s poked goal before half-time set up a second-half comeback completed by Jan Paul van Hecke’s own-goal blunder under heavy Spurs pressure.Palace walls close in on Potter as dreadful West Ham beaten at home againRead moreIn May, Brighton’s 4-1 win at Tottenham, completing a home and away Albion double, proved the final act of Ange Postecoglou’s reign. Under new management, Spurs were supposed to be a different defensive proposition but at the Amex, particularly in that first half, Frank’s team showed the foibles of the previous regime before locating the fresh powers of recovery with which they rescued the match.“What I loved from the players was the mentality,” said Frank. “This group came here last year, went 2-0 up and then lost 3-2, now we are 2-0 down and got 2-2, and we are closer to the three points.”Brighton continue to be enigmatic; brilliant one minute, wasteful of opportunities and prone to the type of mishap that brought Tottenham’s equaliser the next. They were much improved from the previous week’s limp defeat at Bournemouth, benefiting from Fabian Hürzeler’s sweeping changes. “It doesn’t feel great, but there’s a lot of positives,” Hürzeler said. “I could see small steps in the right direction.”For Frank, after midweek’s defeat of Villarreal, rotating his squad to meet European commitments is a fresh challenge for someone whose previous continental assignments were Europa League qualifiers a decade ago at Brøndby. “The players looked strong, intense,” said Frank. “The physical aspect was key.”The attacking quality of Destiny Udogie – “exceptional … unstoppable” in Frank’s words – making his first start of the season, might have produced an early Tottenham penalty. Ayari lunged in but managed to pull back. Within seconds, Brighton scored from their first attack. The goal was almost wholly Minteh’s work in winning possession before racing to the return from Georginio Rutter. Brighton have often found goals hard to come by but Minteh coolly rounded Guglielmo Vicario. For Tottenham, heavy shades of the infamously malfunctioning Postecoglou high line.View image in fullscreenYasin Ayari’s effort flies past Guglielmo Vicario to give Brighton a 2-0 lead.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersRicharlison, a considerable physical specimen himself, was outmuscled by Minteh, beginning a move that finished with Ayari forcing a save. It proved a dry run. After Lucas Bergvall, his Swedish international teammate, had clumsily coughed up possession, Ayari’s dipping shot caught out Vicario.“We suffered two goals against the run of play, but that’s football,” said João Palhinha, the heart of a fierce midfield contest that Tottenham had edged. “There are a lot of things for this team to keep improving but these improvements have come week by week.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was decidedly scrappy but there was zero evidence of infringement; Lewis Dunk flailing on the line meant no offside. Thus, the stage was set for a second-half Tottenham revival, a chance to show they are no longer the soft touch of lore. Brighton had meanwhile lost the tired Carlos Baleba. That allowed Spurs a firmer grip of midfield. “He’s not a machine,” said Hürzeler of Baleba. “He only had 45 minutes in his body.”Xavi Simons was soon thrown on to add an X-factor, Rodrigo Bentancur having struggled for impact in the midfield scheming role. Simons’ first shot fizzed wide, and he next forced a fine low save from Bart Verbruggen. When Bergvall dummied a Mohammed Kudus cross, the Dutchman fired wide with his best chance.Spurs’ back door meanwhile remained open, only Udogie’s speed curbing a couple of Minteh breakaways. Some hurried Brighton finishes, one in particular from Diego Gómez, Baleba’s replacement, protected Vicario’s modesty.Eventually, after Tottenham seized back momentum, Brighton conceded the type of goal that has pockmarked their season so far. From Kudus’s cross, Van Hecke could only divert the ball beyond Verbruggen. “It is a fine point on a day where you go 2-0 down,” said Frank, his sunniness the antithesis of his predecessor. His new Tottenham continue to give off positive vibes.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionTottenham HotspurThomas Frankmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I’m very happy with the win.“I wasn’t surprised. We just played a tough game against Chelsea midweek, with all the hype that surrounded the win. Then we came here to a difficult ground.”Real Madridmaintained their perfect start in La Liga with a 2-0 victory overEspanyolat the Santiago Bernabéu courtesy of goals from Éder Militão and Kylian Mbappé in either half, handing their rivals their first defeat of the campaign.Real sit comfortably atop the standings on 15 points after five matches, five clear ofEspanyoland Barcelona, with the reigning champions having a game in hand before they host Getafe on Sunday.The centre-back Militão opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with a stunning strike from 30 metres, his thunderous right-foot effort leaving Espanyol keeper Marko Dmitrovic no chance as it flew into the top-left corner.Mbappé extended their lead shortly after the break, curling a precise shot into the bottom-left corner from the edge of the box, assisted by a marauding Vinícius Júnior.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé fires in a shot from distance to double Real Madrid’s lead.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APDani Carvajal, the captain, told Real Madrid TV: “I’m happy. I think we played a complete game. We suffered very little defensively against a well organised, very intense opponent, who had 10 points out of 12 to start the season. We’re still at the top of the table and we’ve achieved our goal today.”Veronafought back to holdJuventusto a 1-1 draw, ending the visitors’ three-match winning streak in Serie A as Gift Orban’s equaliser from the penalty spot in the 44th minute cancelled out Francisco Conceição’s strike.Conceição, making his first appearance since suffering a muscle injury earlier this month, scored in the 19th minute when he picked up Khéphren Thuram’s pass and cut in from the right, dribbling past two Verona players before finishing with his left foot from the edge of the box.A handball by João Mário in the box set up the hosts’ equaliser, and the Juventus goalkeeper, Michele Di Gregorio, got his hand on Orban’s penalty but it still went in.Verona, looking for their first win this season, thought they had taken the lead when their captain, Suat Serdar, found the net with a header in the 67th minute, but a review by the video assistant referee ruled him offside and the hosts got their third draw in four league matches.Milantook advantage of Juventus’s slip to move to within a point. Christian Pulisic marked his return to the starting lineup with two goals and an assist in a 3-0 win atUdinesethat lifted the visitors to third.

While the goalkeeper Razvan Sava instinctively stopped the ball crossing the line, it rebounded perfectly into Pulisic’s path.Milan’s lead was doubled inside the first minute of the second half when Pulisic challenged Jesper Karlstrom for the ball in the Udinese penalty area, forcing it to spill into the path of Youssouf Fofana, who cut inside and shot a low effort into the back of the net.Pulisic got his second goal in the 53rd minute to end home hopes, catching out Sava at his near post as he squeezed in a tight shot.It was Udinese’s first defeat of the season, leaving them on seven points and sixth in the Italian top flight.José Mourinho enjoyed a winning return to coaching in his native Portugal after hisBenficaside beatAFS3-0 away from home on Saturday.

The turning point came when Hibs’ captain, Martin Boyle, had a goal ruled out in the 19th minute for handball, with frustrated Light Blues supporters ready to explode in anger again.The returningRangersmidfielder Nico Raskin headed in a James Tavernier corner in the 42nd minute before the striker Bojan Miovski added a second in added time with his first goal for the Govan side since signing from Girona. It took Rangers into the semi-final draw along with St Mirren, Motherwell and the winners of Sunday’s tie between Partick Thistle and Celtic at Firhill.“It was actually right during the team talk, but it’s like I said to the guys, I can’t control any of it,” said Martin of the pre-match protest. “And also a bit of perspective, like I said, yesterday in the press conference about some family stuff this week that’s been really difficult to put in some perspective.“But we had control of the performance and we had control of, not the start of the game, but the fans at the end of the game. And I have to say I thought the fans were brilliant. They made their feelings really clear, and then once that was done, the team started playing with a bit of flow. I think they were really, really good. So I have to thank them for that.”Quick GuideScottish roundup: Charles-Cook's earns Motherwell win over troubled DonsShowRegan Charles-Cook scored a memorable first goal forMotherwellto take their early promise under Jens Berthel Askou up a notch and book a trip to Hampden following a 1-0 win atAberdeen.Charles-Cook's swerving long-range strike in the second half at Pittodrie proved enough to earn a Premier Sports Cup semi-final place and continue Aberdeen's miserable start to the season.The Scottish Cup holders were looking for a break from their league form, which leaves them bottom of the Scottish Premiership without a goal.But, despite making a decent start and hitting the bar twice, they suffered a fifth defeat of the season to leave manager Jimmy Thelin under pressure.In Friday's quarter-final,St Mirren's penalty shootout triumph atKilmarnocksparked a pitch invasion from the travelling fans at Rugby Park. Saints sealed a 5-3 win on penalties after an entertaining 2-2 draw and dozens of the Buddies fans spilled out of a packed away stand. Shamal George saved from the former Saints midfielder Kyle Magennis before Malik Dijksteel netted the clinching penalty to seal St Mirren's first trip to Hampden since 2021.Stephen Robinson, whose team led twice through impressive goals from Mikael Mandron and Jayden Richardson, said: \"We had a couple of really good chances to win the game before penalties but, if someone told you you'd win after penalties, you'd take it. It's just not the easiest thing on your heart sometimes. But it's a brilliant way to win and fantastic that the boys got to celebrate with the fans at the end.\"In the Premiership on Saturday,Dundee's Simon Murray, Joe Westley and Callum Jones scored in their 3-2 win overLivingstonat Dens Park.Livi came storming back from 2-0 down thanks to a Clark Robertson own goal and a Jeremy Bokila penalty. But, deep in stoppage time, referee Ross Hardie awarded another spot-kick to Dundee when he adjudged Danny Wilson had brought down home substitute Charlie Reilly. The official was then called over to the pitchside monitor by VAR, but he stuck with his original decision as Jones slotted home the spot-kick to secure a dramatic win for Dundee.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Many Rangers fans had voted with their feet and stayed away but none who follow the Light Blues can ignore the fact that Rangers are second bottom of the Scottish Premiership table, nine points behind Celtic andHearts, although that concern is for another day.Rangers fans were pleased Raskin, a favourite of the supporters, was back in the side after being left out of the squad completely by Martin for the previous two games against Hearts and Celtic because of an unknown issue between the two men.“I just got asked the question about any regrets and all that stuff,” said the former Southampton manager, who revealed a chat with Cavenagh after the game was positive. “I think probably myself and Nico will feel similar, it’s disappointing it went on. But also, maybe it’s necessary for this whole culture, this football club, for the players to understand, for Nico to really grow.“But contrary to popular belief, we have a good working relationship. He wants to play, he wants to win. He did some brilliant stuff today, but like everyone else, there’ll be stuff he can improve on as well to help him and help us as the group.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were also “Martin out” and “Stewart out” banners unfurled in the Broomloan Stand and in the 11th minute play was stopped after hundreds of coloured balls were thrown from the Copland Stand into Jack Butland’s penalty area.Explore more on these topicsScottish League CupRangersHibernianmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Really aggressive. The red card helped us dominate the game but we were already there. We scored two goals and then we tried to complicate our game again. It’s always complicated for us. It should have been different in this game.”He said Casemiro was feeling “worse than me. We won so I will forget a little bit and he will suffer because he’s a top professional. He understands what he did. He is experienced enough that that play should not be played like that. He cares too much. We suffered in the end but we deserved the win.”Amorim stressed United need to forget the victory and focus on the trip to Brentford next Saturday. “With this win we have to forget the good feeling of winning the game and get back to the urgency of feeling we need to win the next game,” he said. “Today we won, it’s nice to win, but let’s forget that and return to that urgency. Because in the big club it’s not that feeling, today is a really good game, let’s relax a little bit.”Trevoh Chalobah’s 80th-minute header ended up as consolation only. “The win was really important, I think we deserved it,” said Amorim. “Our crowd, our fans are easy to please. If you give everything they will be there. That is something our players need to understand.

At one stage it looked like the final of the men’s Metro Bank Cup would need a second day to throw up a winner, as was the case on this ground 12 months ago.But in the end a tournament much diluted since the advent of the Hundred produced the kind of storied climax its snazzy new sibling is yet to muster.Worcestershire, set 188 to win in 27 overs, beat Hampshire by three wickets with just two balls to spare to claim their first 50-over title for 31 years.It was not simply the manner of victory – the rain-reduced target reeled in at 7.12pm despite wickets tumbling – but what it meant to all those involved. Franchises pop up and disappear in a matter of weeks, whereas counties are built on relationships that are forged over months and years.And in the case of Worcestershire, this has meant overcoming adversity in recent times. And not just cricketing adversity. Beyond the annual floods at New Road, and though forever being at the mercy of counties with far bigger budgets, the Pears have spent the past 16 months coming to terms with something far more significant: the tragic loss of Josh Baker.A much-loved teammate who died just shy of his 21st birthday, Baker has never been far from thoughts since, with Worcestershire’s shirts now sporting the name of the charity set up in his memory. After lifting the trophy, the captain, Jake Libby, made a point of taking it over to Baker’s parents, Paul and Lisa.“It’s been a tough couple of years, so it’s brilliant to celebrate an amazing day like this with the supporters,” said Libby. “We speak a lot about Josh in our changing room. He was a special kid and it was devastating what happened.”View image in fullscreenWorcestershire’s Henry Cullen and Matthew Waite begin the celebrations after the winning runs against Hampshire at Trent Bridge.Photograph: Nigel French/PATheHampshireplayers could not begrudge their opponents this win, even if their day ended in galling fashion. Kyle Abbott thought he had caught Henry Cullen in the deep with just four runs required, only to brush the boundary sponge as he landed and before he released the ball. Once the replays confirmed this was a boundary, the Worcestershire balcony positively erupted.Perhaps there was no stopping the Pears, be it the sense of destiny they took into this final or the form that meant they topped the southern group and then overcame Somerset in the semis. It was a very Worcestershire win, too, one built on collective resourcefulness rather than individual brilliance and very much in the image of their highly respected head coach, Alan Richardson.That said, Tom Taylor shone with the ball for figures of one for 24 from nine overs, while Ethan Brookes emerging at 93 for three in the run chase and cracking 57 from just 34 balls was clearly the standout. Like a good number of the players in their squad, Brookes has revived his career at New Road after finding himself surplus to requirements at Warwickshire.“It was all a little bit of a blur but I went out with intent to try and clear the ropes,” said Brookes, having done so four times. “To share such a special memory with Josh’s parents will definitely be a highlight of my career.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among these was Ali Orr via a sharp caught and bowled, the opener walking off after a fine 110 from 130 balls that stuck 237 for seven from 45 overs on the board. On another day, Orr might well have been the story.The same could be said for Scott Currie, who flew back from England’s tour of Ireland to play in this stop-start final and finished with a maiden List A five-wicket haul for his efforts. When the right-armer removed Libby in the 20th over of the run chase to leave Worcestershire 107 for four – 81 runs still required – the trophy appeared to be heading one way.Instead, through the audacity of Brookes and Abbott’s tumble on the rope, it ended up in the hands of the Baker family and with a club who, despite their relegation from Division One, do so many things right. The Hundred may get all the attention and the investment but this one meant something.Explore more on these topicsOne-Day CupCricketWorcestershireHampshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The record currently stands at 58,498, set at Twickenham in 2023 for a Six Nations match between England and France.“It’s absolutely incredible,” Aldcroft said. “It’s a credit to the work that has gone in behind the scenes and building this tournament. Having a sold-out Twickenham is just the most special thing for women’s rugby and the future ahead. I think this is just the start of it now and I cannot wait to see what is to come.”Criticisms may be aimed at England’s performance against France but the head coach, John Mitchell, said he had swiftly drawn a line under the result.He said: “France is gone, this [final] is a different contest. It will be played differently as a result of the opposition, they have strengths and weaknesses. It’s a matter who initiates those first and exploits them and in the meantime you remain calm and build pressure on them. All the same factors we have been using in the tournament will stand out in that preparation.“We have earned the right to contest the final. It’s a new game in itself now.

These are all things England have the opportunity to grasp next Saturday at a sold-out Twickenham against Canada but it will not be an easy match by any stretch of the imagination, and based on these semi-final performances alone, the Maple Leafs should be favourites. The Red Roses were put under immense pressure by France, who posed England the most questions they have been asked since the last time they played one another in England, last April.Le Crunchis usually a tense and close battle when hosted in England, the last one coming in the Women’s Six Nations with England clinging on to a 43-42 thrilling win. France were pegged by many before kick-off on Saturday as firm underdogs but they let their actions show what they thought of that with a thoroughly impressive performance, particularly in the first half, frustrating and dismantling the Red Roses.‘Absolutely incredible’: England captain Zoe Aldcroft relishing sold-out Twickenham finalRead morePre-match it was not marked out as one that was going to be close on the scoreboard because of the disruptions to France’s squad. They had two players banned and two key stars ruled out with injury in Lina Queyroi and Joanna Grisez. As England have said repeatedly, they can only play what is in front of them and what they can control is their own performance.A complete 80 minutes has not been on display from England at this tournament and it is something their fans will have to wait to see if they can put it together in the final. Their defence in this semi-final was impressive at times, particularly through Meg Jones at the breakdown and Hannah Botterman at set pieces, but their attack needed to be more clinical.View image in fullscreenMeg Jones celebrates scoring England’s fifth try, ending France’s hopes.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThere was rain pre-match but it dried up for kick-off, much to the appreciation of those fans not sat under cover in Bristol. There isn’t a sound at a Red Roses game quite like when the full-back Ellie Kildunne, who returned from injury, makes a break and at a sold-out Ashton Gate the cheers only encouraged her to make more metres. Her first effort was rumbled initially but on the second time of asking she ran half the pitch and dodged Kelly Arbey, who made a good run back to try to tackle her, to go under the posts. Some raised an eyebrow as they believed there was a knock-on in the buildup but it wasn’t picked up. Not only was it Kildunne’s third try of the tournament but it was England’s 100th of the calendar year.Quick GuideEngland 35-17 France teams and scorersShowEnglandKildunne; Dow, Jones, Heard (Aitchison 66), Breach (Rowland 68); Harrison, Hunt (L Packer 66); Botterman (Clifford 54), Cokayne (Atkin-Davies 54), Muir (Bern 54), Talling (Feaunati 66), Ward (Galligan 66), Aldcroft, Kabeya, Matthews.TriesKildunne 2, Cokayne, Ward, Jones.ConsHarrison 5.FranceBourgeois; Arbey (Boulard 71), Konde, Vernier, Ménager; Arbez (Tuy 71), Bourdon Sansus (Chambon 78); Brosseau (Deshaye 53), Gérin (Riffonneau 53), Bernadou (Khalfaoui 53), Fall Raclot (Maka 71), Ikahehegi (Okemba 53), Escudero, Champon, T Feleu.TriesKonde 2, Arbey.ConsBourgeois.RefereeMaggie Cogger-Orr (NZ).Attendance25,478.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Beautiful chaos ensued with possession being exchanged as thrilling attacks weren’t coming off for either side. Four impressive defensive sets from England came next, with patience throughout the team forcing France to knock on, two breakdown penalties from Jones and a penalty in a defensive maul. Those moments were a good stress test for England’s defence, who are not used to being put under pressure in every game, and they will be under an immense amount against Canada next week.Eventually the defensive dam burst and Nassira Konde went over, with France’s attack outnumbering England on the right. The Red Roses continued to absorb pressure and were let off the hook at one point with a Marine Ménager try ruled out because of a forward pass, leaving the half-time score 7-5.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The parents were unaware that Meta’s settings permitted it to do this. One mother said her account was set to private, but the posts were automatically cross-posting toThreadswhere they were visible. Another said she posted the picture to a public Instagram account. The posts of their children were highlighted to the stranger as “suggested threads”.The recipient told the Guardian the posts felt “deliberately provocative and ultimately exploitative of the children and families involved”.The father of a 13-year-old who appeared in one of the posts said it was “absolutely outrageous”. The images were all of schoolgirls in short skirts with either bare legs or stockings.“When I found out an image of her has been exploited in what felt like a sexualised way by a massive company like that to market their product it left me feeling quite disgusted,” he said.Meta, the $2tn (£1.5tn) company based in Menlo Park, California, said the images did not violate its policies. It said it recommended people to visit Threads by showing them publicly shared photos that comply with its community standards and recommendation guidelines. Its systems do not recommend Threads shared by teenagers, but these were posts made from adults’ accounts that were set to allow public viewing.The man who received the posts said that as he was only sent promotional posts of schoolgirls – there were no boys in school uniform, for example – there appeared to be “an aspect of sexualisation”.The mother of a 15-year-old whose picture was used in a promotional post that featured a large “Get Threads” button said: “For me it was a picture of my daughter going to school. I had no idea Instagram had picked it up and are using it as a promotion. It’s absolutely disgusting. She is a minor.”She said she would have refused consent and “not for any money in the world would I let them use a girl dressed in a school uniform to get people on to [its platform]”.With 267 followers, her Instagram account usually had modest reach but the post of her child attracted nearly 7,000 views, 90% from non-followers, half of whom were aged over 44 and 90% of whom were men.Another mother whose post of her 13-year-old was used in a promotional post said: “Meta did all of this on purpose, not informing us, as they want to generate content. It’s despicable. And who is responsible for creating that Threads ad using children’s photos to promote the platform for older men?”Meta said it called such posts “recommendation tools” and that public postscould be used for this purpose.A company spokesperson said: “The images shared do not violate our policies and are back-to-school photos posted publicly by parents. We have systems in place to help make sure we don’t recommend Threads shared by teens, or that go against our recommendation guidelines, and users can control whether Meta suggests their public posts on Instagram.”The 37-year-old Instagram user from London who received the posts and asked to remain anonymous said: “Over several days I was repeatedly served Meta adverts for Threads that exclusively featured parents’ images of their daughters in school uniform, some revealing their names. As a father, I find it deeply inappropriate for Meta to repurpose these posts in targeted promotion to adults.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the only reason that they could think it appropriate to send pictures of schoolgirls to a 37-year-old man – as bait – Meta is a wilfully careless company.”She called on the regulator Ofcom to consider if measures, introduced this summer to prevent unknown adults connecting to children, make clear that “companies cannot offer sexualised images of children as bait to unknown men”.Ofcom’s illegal harms codes intended to tackle online groomingrequire that“children’s profiles and locations – as well as friends and connections – should not be visible to other users”.Meta’s system means that if a Threads profile is public, posts on adult profiles may be suggested on Facebook or Instagram “so people can discover, follow, and interact with you”.

The contestants were scored on how well they predicted outcomes as of 1 September.“What Mantic has done is impressive,” said Deger Turan, the chief executive of Metaculus.Turan estimated that AI would be on a par or better than the best human forecasters by 2029, but said that in general “currently human forecasters are doing better than AI forecasters”.On complex forecasts that rely on predicting interrelated events, AI systems can still struggle to carry out logic verification checks when translating the knowledge into a final prediction, he said.Mantic breaks down a forecasting problem into different jobs and assigns them to a roster of machine-learning models including OpenAI, Google and DeepSeek, depending on their strengths.Toby Shevlane, the co-founder of Mantic, said its performance was a milestone for the AI community using large language models for forecasting.“Some say LLMs just regurgitate their training data, but you can’t predict the future like that,” he said. “It requires genuine reasoning. You could say our system’s predictions were more original than most human entrants, because people often cluster around the community average predictions. The AI system often strongly disagreed. So, AI forecasters could be an antidote to groupthink.”Mantic’s system deploys a variety of AI agents to assess what is happening now, carry out historical research, game out scenarios and then predict what is likely to happen next. A strength of AI forecasting is its ability to work hard persistently, which is crucial to effective forecasting.They can easily work on dozens of complex problems at once and revisit them daily to learn from changing information. Human forecasting also uses intuition, but Shindel is among the human forecasters who think this could emerge in AI.“Intuition is very important, but I don’t think it’s innately human,” he said.Leading human superforecasters still say they are best. Philip Tetlock, the co-author of the bestselling book Superforecasting, this yearpublished researchthat found that expert humans were on average still outperforming the top-performing bots.Turan said that on complex forecasts, which rely on predicting interrelated events, AI systems can still struggle to spot logical inconsistencies in their outputs and to carry out verification checks.Warren Hatch, the chief executive of Good Judgment, a forecasting company co-founded by Tetlock, said: “We expect AI will excel in certain categories of questions, like monthly inflation rates. For categories with sparse data that require more judgment, humans retain the edge. The main point for us is that the answer isn’t human or AI, but instead human and AI to get the best forecast possible as quickly as possible.”Or, as Lubos Saloky, a human forecaster who came third in the Metaculus Cup, put it: “I do not plan to retire. If you can’t beat them, merge with them.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingDeepMindnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Simon Kirwan/AlamyBeing a carmaker where ‘everything is connected’ has left JLR unable to isolate its plants or functions, forcing a shutdown of most systemsByJasper JollyandDan MilmoSat 20 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 03.50 EDTShareThe first external signs of the chaos about to hit JLR, Britain’s largest automotive employer, came on the quiet last Sunday of August. Managers at a factory in Halewood, Merseyside, told industry contacts there might have been a hack – although it was not clear then just how bad the situation was.That changed quickly on the Monday morning. JLR, the maker of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, quickly shut down systems afterrealising the severity of the cyber-attack. Three weeks later, the carmaker is still incapacitated, unable to produce at any of its factories across the UK, Slovakia, Brazil and India (although a Chinese joint venture is thought to be operating).The hack is likely to cost JLR hundreds of millions of pounds, and has caused turmoil across its sprawling supply chain – particularly in the West Midlands surrounding the company’s headquarters in Gaydon and the Solihull factory, where it makes its money-spinner Range Rovers. With little hope of an imminent restart, the UK government is facing increasing calls for financial support for suppliers that fear going bust if the sudden revenue drought continues.Officials at the Department for Business an Trade are understood to be speaking to JLR daily, while the National Cyber Security Centre has been working with the company since last Wednesday to provide support in relation to the incident.View image in fullscreenJaguar Land Rover’s chief executive, Adrian Mardell, pictured with Keir Starmer, has oversee a turnaround strategy called ‘reimagine’.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty ImagesMorale has – unsurprisingly – been badly hit across the workforce. Factory workers have been toldnot to return until at least Wednesday, but several people close to JLR believe the wait could be longer still. Managers may have access to emails, but computer-aided design, engineering software and product life-cycle software was down this week. However, the company has put in workarounds to make payments and ship cars to customers, and has focused on keeping existing customers happy with a flow of spare parts.The JLR chief executive, Adrian Mardell, had been planning a quiet few months before stepping down after three years at the top (and 35 years at the company). Instead, he and JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Group, have been plunged into weeks of scrambling to restart production. Mardell met the business and trade minister Chris Bryant last week to discuss the incident, and government officials are in daily contact for updates.The hack will cast a shadow over Mardell’s legacy. His task over three years in charge had been to oversee a turnaround strategy, called “reimagine”, that involved selling fewer cars but at much higher prices. That resulted in11 consecutive quarters of profits, despite Donald Trump’s tariffsand global instability prompted by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Mardell had alsodecided to wait for the right momentfor a new electric Range Rover and thenew Jaguar after a controversial rebrand– with further delays now possible.Outsourced cybersecurityJLR has beenowned since 2008by Tata Group. The carmaker is not the only part of the sprawling conglomerate to have questions to answer after the hack: in 2023 JLR outsourced a huge part of its computer systems to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). TCS is one of the biggest outsourcing companies in the world and makes the bulk of the dividends paid out to the Tata family’s holding company.TCS has been at the centre of the response to the hack that has crippled JLR, with a large number of employees scrambling to work out the source of the intrusion. TCS did not respond to requests for comment.Under the five-year, £800m contract agreed in 2023, TCS and JLR planned to “rapidly transform, simplify, and manage its digital and IT estate, supporting its broader strategic business transformation”. TCS runs large parts of JLR’s key computer systems, ranging from its networks to data connections, and, crucially, its cybersecurity.Part of the reimagine strategy required more flexible software to enable the luxury carmaker to produce Range Rovers in precisely the configuration demanded by the global rich paying £120,000 plus – all while retaining the efficiency of a high-volume factory.“I would argue that JLR’s software is probably more complex than Nasa putting a spacecraft into space,” said one supplier (with perhaps a touch of hyperbole). “When it works it’s a thing of wonder. This has exposed it.”One of TCS’s jobs was to manage the upgrade of JLR factory systems to the latest software from the German company SAP. That software was vital to managing production of vehicles and getting parts to the right place at the right time, as well as the “handshake” systems that link to other suppliers. SAP declined to comment.View image in fullscreenThe hack will raise questions for TCS, which runs large parts of JLR’s key computer systems.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyIn a video with JLR published on TCS’s website, the TCS president of manufacturing, Anupam Singhal, highlights “smart factories where everything is connected” to try to “remove waste” and use artificial intelligence to “avoid plant downtime”.The fact that “everything is connected” in JLR’s systems appears to have become a vulnerability. When it discovered the intrusion, the carmaker was unable to isolate factories or functions, forcing it to shut down most of its systems.The hack will raise questions for TCS, which alsoworks with Marks & Spencerandthe Co-op, two British retailers who suffered attacks this year. Reuters reported in May that TCS was the “means of access” for hackers to get into M&S’s systems over the Easter weekend. TCS said in a June statement that “no TCS systems or users were compromised”.The links with the JLR attack and the retail incidents have led to speculation that the hacks could have been carried out by the same group. The M&S and Co-op hacks have been blamed on an English-language speaking hacking community known as Scattered Spider. Four arrests have been made in the UK in relation to the M&S and Co-op hacks.Soon after the JLR incident achannel on the Telegram platformposted a screenshot of what appeared to be the carmaker’s internal IT systems, as well as a news article about the attack. The channel’s name was, pointedly, a combination of Scattered Spider and two other English-language-speaking, or western-based, hacking groups known as Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters.M&S was a ransomware attack, a form of hack that effectively locks up a target’s IT systems and is typically associated with groups based in former Soviet states. JLR has not confirmed the nature of the attack that has closed its factories.One piece of circumstantial evidence was a person on the Telegram channel called Rey, who shared the same pseudonym as a member of Hellcat, the English-language speaking ransomware gang that claimed to have extracted data from JLR earlier this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One law enforcement source advised caution against taking anything from the channel at face value.JLR declined to discuss details of the hack.Supply chain pressureJLR has access to about £6bn in cash, likely enough resources to cope with the crisis even without the help of its huge parent conglomerate, Tata.Jim Williamson of the bond rating agency CreditSights estimated that JLR could burn through as much as £900m of cash in September, with a £1.7bn decline in working capital – although it could probably recoup a big chunk of that through catchup sales. Williamson added that JLR had “plenty of options” if it needed short-term cash, including issuing new debt, borrowing from banks, or event the government’s UK Export Finance to save the day.But for some companies in the supply chain the problems may be existential.JLR has set up a help desk for suppliers. Yet some believe the government needs to step in. JLR has not asked for state support for itself, but is trying to share information on the extent of its supply chain, which may include more than 700 companies making the 30,000 parts that can make up a luxury car.View image in fullscreenJLR’s supply chain may include more than 700 companies making the 30,000 parts in a luxury car.Photograph: Matt Crossick/Alamy“It would be irresponsible if the government didn’t do something if they’re committed to the automotive sector,” said one supplier. “Government need to move quickly.”For supply chain workers,every day without production raises the threatto their jobs. The Aim-listed insulation supplier Autins Group and the German seat controls manufacturer Brose said workers would be paid for “banked” hours to be worked later on, while the axel maker Dana, the seat maker Lear Corporation and the sunroof maker Webasto were among the other companies where temporary or permanent workers’ jobs were at risk.The Unite union said the government needed to step in with a furlough scheme to pay wages of factory worker members unable to work, amid concern for the fate of the supply chain.The industry minister Chris McDonald said on Friday JLR was “taking the lead on support for their own supply chain”. A government source did not rule out some form of support – although a furlough scheme is thought to be unlikely. The government is focusing on working out if supplier collapses could hold up a restart.Meanwhile many people in JLR are still in “investigation mode”, according to one person close to the company – while others try to rebuild systems in parallel. Several people said the company genuinely did not know when it would be able to restart.Even when JLR manages to recover its computer systems, the restart will be complicated by more than a thousand cars on lines in various stages of build. JLR will either have to make individual plans for the parts needed for each vehicle on the production lines, or manually move the vehicles off the lines and then try to put them back into the system.“Does it feel like it’s going to be months?” a supplier said. “Maybe. Is it weeks? Absolutely.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Too many seem to offer overcomplicated solutions for problems that barely existed in the first place – making them little more than a gimmick you toss in your closet weeks after purchase.However, while many smart home gadgets aren’t the wisest investment, others can bring serious improvements to your home. From robot vacuums and smart bulbs to smart locks and video doorbells, here are five smart home devices that have made my life easier, and why you should consider adding them to your home, too.Smart home devices at a glanceFor automating all of your floor-cleaning chores:Roborock Saros 10$1,599.99 at AmazonFor mimicking the sunrise for an easy morning:Wyze Smart Bulb$26.26 at AmazonFor ensuring your never lose a key again:Yale Assure Lock 2$259.99 at YaleFor keeping your front door secure:Ring Video Doorbell$49.99 at RingFor maintaining a fresh-smelling home all day long:Aera Smart Diffuser$199 at AmazonAll prices current at time of publication.Roborock Saros 10 robot vacuum$1,599.99 at Roborock$1,599.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jon BitnerThe Roborock Saros 10 has virtually removed all floor-cleaning tasks frommy chore list. It not only vacuums and mops, it empties its own dustbin and self-cleans its mops after, so it can go weeks without any manual intervention. Tangle-free brushes, vibrating hot-water mops, and best-in-class suction ensure your floors are as clean as if you handled them yourself.Setting it up requires little more than plugging it in and syncing it to your phone. You’ll then let it roam around yourhometo map your floor plan, before letting it loose to vacuum and mop simultaneously (when traveling on carpet, it can either leave its mopping pads in the dock or automatically retract them).The only manual tasks you need to complete are filling up its clean water tank, emptying the dirty water tank, and replacing the huge dock dustbin that the bot’s bin empties into. Depending on the size of your home (and how dirty it is), you will typically deal with the water tanks on a weekly basis, while the dustbin can go months before needing a replacement.While it’s the most expensive item on this list, for anyone with a busy schedule, it is worth every penny.Wyze smart colored bulb$26.26 at Home Depot$26.26 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jon BitnerSmart bulbs offer an affordable way to dip your toes into the world of automation. TheWyze Bulb Coloris one of the best, thanks to a competitive price, reliable performance and support for millions of tunable colors.I use it to simulate the sunrise each morning, allowing the light to automatically turn on at a low level when it’s almost time to wake up, then slowly increase its brightness until it is glowing a brilliant white when my alarm rings.When I’m ready to go to sleep, I can turn off the lights from my phone so I don’t have to trek across a dark bedroom and risk tripping over an errant dog toy. My home theater is equipped with a Wyze bulb, too – which lets me dim the lights for a cozy movie night or turn them a spooky red for a horror flick.Yale Assure smart lock$203 at Home Depot$239 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jon BitnerYou might thinksmart locksare a gimmick, but after years of using one, I’m a faithful convert. My Yale Assure Lock 2 lets me come and go without a physical key – so when I go out for a run, I don’t need to worry about lugging one with me. Instead, I simply enter a passcode into the Assure Lock 2 keypad. You can also create temporary codes for visitors that expire once their stay is complete (ensuring your primary code remains secret).I used to forget whether I locked the door before heading out, but now I just check the status of my door remotely on the companion app. Not only can it tell me if my door is open or closed, but it will tell me if it’s locked or unlocked. There’s a door history section as well, so you can see exactly when the door was opened or closed, locked or unlocked.Several variants of the Yale Assure Lock 2 are available (including key-free models and one that supports Apple Wallet keys), making it easy to find one that fits your lifestyle. Make sure to spring for wifi if you want to be able to control it away from home.Ring Video Doorbell$49.99 at Ring$49.99 at Home DepotView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jon BitnerEverybody on the block seems to have a Ring video doorbell – and for good reason. They are remarkably helpful in ways you may not realize until you own one. Away from home and need to keep an eye on a package that was delivered? Have a guest show up while you’re walking the dog and need to talk to them? Trying to capture funny videos to go viral online? Ring doorbells can do it all.I personally use an older model (Wired Doorbell Plus) that has treated me well for four years, and newer models including the Wired Doorbell Pro seem even more impressive. All of them send motion alerts to your smartphone when movement is detected, let you know when your doorbell rings, and let you chat with visitors through a two-way speaker without having to open the door.The entry-levelVideo Doorbell Wiredis sufficient for most needs if you have existing doorbell wiring for power, but theBattery Doorbell ProandWired Doorbell Proadd wireless convenience and enhanced video quality, respectively.If the $5 monthly subscription for video storage puts you off, you could also consider a Eufy video doorbell such as theC210. These models store video locally on aseparate box, eliminating the need for a subscription.Just be careful not to succumb tovideo doorbell derangement syndromewith your newfound powers.Aera smart diffuser$199 at Aera$199 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jon BitnerThe Aera smart diffuser solves a very real problem – a smelly home. If you live in a cozy space like I do, where your kitchen, gym, bathroom and main living space are all in close proximity, you know the struggle.Unlike candles, which need to be closely monitored, constantly replaced, and often degrade indoor air quality, the Aera is hypoallergenic and largely runs itself. After slotting a fragrance capsule into the diffuser, you can create schedules that run the device automatically, ensuring your home smells great all day long. You can even toggle it remotely, so if you’re coming back from a road trip, you will return to a pleasant aroma.The upfront costs are a bit expensive (the diffuser is $199), but a $60 fragrance capsule can easily last for three months, so over time, it’s not much more expensive than buying premium candles. And because it solves a frustrating problem without much manual input, it is one of my favoritesmart homedevices.Jon Bitner is a writer covering travel, outdoors and technology for outlets including GameSpot, Digital Trends and Islands.

Again. Improbably, we are on the 17th iteration (give or take) of the product that single-handedly ruins our lives every day with incessant vibrations alerting us to some horrifying calamity, plus every song in the Bruce Springsteen back catalog. Coming up with new features for the never-ending information machines we all keep in our pockets isn’t easy, but this time, Apple managed to develop a big (or should I say small) one. There’s now a thinner iPhone Air, which is being marketed asthe thinnest iPhone ever. These gadgets have never exactly been gargantuan, so it’s kind of like identifying the tiniest grain of sand in the desert. Still, people around the world are fascinated by the sheer lack of phone here.Technology, design, and art are all trending toward a certain scarcity model, prepping us for a lack of bells and whistles, as though both your parents are unemployed and they want you to expect fewer trips to Disneyland. Life on Earth feels more and more like the experience of entering aSweetgreen– beige, spartan and unobtrusive. Sure, iPhones haven’t gotten cheaper, but they have certainly gotten … lesser. The iPhone Air is so small, I feel like I’ll sit on it and it will slide seamlessly up my rectum, never to be seen again. For some, I’m sure losing your device inside your bowels might be a feature, but I think it’s a rather uncomfortable bug.Technology used to be clunky and even a bit embarrassing, the domain of the lonely nerd. My family had a “computer room” for most of the 90s – the place we hid the gray, awkward Compaq PC that allowed me to access pornography, instant messaging apps, and Star Trek promo photos. Whatever dirty business needed to take place on that glowing screen was meant to be donein private. Computers were ugly, industrial machines for hard work or antisocial digital wandering. Then, Steve Jobs asked: “What if that dumb gray box was beautiful, simple and cruelly trapped you in a never-ending cycle of desire and self-hatred? Plus, the entire back catalog of Bruce Springsteen.” The first iPod and iPhone were descendants of the miraculous Macintosh computer, which revolutionized personal computing. But, for me, the height of Apple’s design success was thecolorful, translucent iMac desktop. Back in 1998, the iMac offered a computer that wasn’t drab, but candy-coated, maximalist and something you’d actually be able to stow in a place of honor in your home. It was true design and had more in common with the bold work of theMemphis Group design traditionthan the stuffed shirts at IBM. The iMac looked like it should have been in Pee-wee’s Playhouse rather than some dimly lit vestibule at my parents’.iPhones, on the other hand, value minimalism above all else. Yes, you can get them invarious muted, metallic colors, or customize yours with a case that celebrates your favorite sports team or boldly declares that you “Can’t Be Arsed”. But for the most part, Apple offers a clean brand of futurism where nothing about the object offends (exceptthe contentyou can access with it). This is the way of everything now –minimalist wardrobes, bland farmhouse living rooms, restaurantsso pared down that they barely register as more than a kitchen and some tables.While in London this summer, I saw thelatest revival of the musical Evita at the Palladium, directed by the king of minimalist theater, Jamie Lloyd. Lloyd is known for sparse set design, barely there staging, and bold technological innovations in productions like the Tony Award-winning Sunset Boulevard. Evita is a period piece about the Argentine celebrity and political figure Eva Perón. It takes place in the 1950s and was created in the 1970s. Historical context matters. It’s usually staged with sumptuous sets and period-appropriate costuming. What Lloyd chose to do is strip all of that down, place its characters on a dark, nearly empty stage, and offer next to no sense of place or time. Evita, then, is presented to the audience inside a black void, with scantily clad dancers flailing about in front of a large, lit-up sign that says, simply: “EVITA”, in case you forgot what you wandered into. The dystopian phantom zone where Evita takes place is a manifestation of how it feels to live in the perpetually wired digital age of 2025. Lloyd is also responsible for a new production of Waiting for Godot in New York, which similarly has almost nothing on the stage for the actors to interact with. At least there, it’s kind of warranted.I was one of the only people who walked out of Evita with a sour look on my face. The orgasmic rapture of the surrounding crowd made me feel like an old fool, desperate for ball gowns and flimsy plywood buildings. But what troubled me was the realization that this aesthetic isn’t an outlier, it’s the unquestioned norm. Less is considered more. Being “tacky” is seen as the greatest imaginable sin. Odd, considering who’s the president of the United States and whathe’s done to the White House, but maybe that’s the origin of all this cold minimalism. To be spare and quiet is to be the opposite of all that golden grotesquerie. Minimalism is the new status symbol of the upwardly mobile. Interior design is overrun withcold, Scandinavian influences. The art direction ofHBO’s Successionwas a window into the tactile expression of iciness that defines the modern-day uber-rich. It leaves me feeling hollow, and as alone as I was in my parents’ computer room.Minimalism is a means of control, a way to assert dominance over the physical space – rooms unsullied by thought, risk or humor. Minimalism’s iron grip on reality is not honest or articulate. It’s a manifestation of a world that is actually out of control. TheiPhonescreams chaos at us, but it looks clean and perfect. It’s the ideal delivery device for madness, because it seems so restrained on the outside.Evita is a bloody tale of revolution and propaganda and authoritarianism. Staging it like Elvis’s Las Vegas residency in the 1970s wipes all of that out. Without the culturally specific or historically significant aesthetic touches, it robs the story of anything that truly makes it a story at all. It’s like being trapped in an empty room with a flashmob or a roving band of Santacon drunks. Minimalism sells us the notion that we can be masters of our environment, but the truth is, we have never had less control over our destiny.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsDesignOpinioniPhoneAppleSmartphonesMobile phonescommentShareReuse this content"

Having spent considerable time analyzing the events of the past week, I’ve realized I should probably issue a public apology for some of my statements over the years. Here we go: I’m sorry for expressing radical and dangerous opinions like “women deserve equal rights and shouldn’t be treated like walking wombs”. I’m sorry for suggesting Palestinians shouldn’t be systematically exterminated while Donald Trump posts aboutbuilding a resort in Gaza. Going forward I will do better and ensure that I double-check all my opinions with the government. There isn’t an official Department of Thought Control yet, but no doubt we’ll get there soon.I wish I was joking about all this but, as you will have noticed, we are in a critical moment for free speech in the US. The killing of Charlie Kirk was a tragedy for his family, but theTrump administrationhas been ruthlessly using Kirk’s death to further a crackdown on dissent and erode first amendment protections.The day after Kirk was fatally shot, for example, the deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, urgedpeople to reportany “foreigners” to the state department who post on social media “praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event.” The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,later saidthat the state department has “most certainly been denying visas” to people celebratingKirk’s death. It’s obviously not in good taste to celebrate anyone’s murder, but the fact that calling out Kirk’s divisive andbigoted viewscould possibly be considered “rationalizing” his death and get you deported is chilling.It’s not just foreigners who are being told they should be wary about what they say. On Monday Vice-President JD Vance, who was guest-hosting an episode of the Charlie Kirk Show, encouraged people to report anyone celebrating the influencer’s death to that person’semployer. Presumably so said employer can fire them.There have, of course, already been numerous Kirk-related firings and suspensions. An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency wasreportedly placedon administrative leave over an Instagram post describing Kirk as “the literal racist homophobe misogynist.” MSNBC fired political analystMatthew Dowdafter he suggested Kirk’s “awful words” fueled “awful actions”. Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show wassuspended “indefinitely”after he noted “many in Maga Land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”. Washington Post columnistKaren Attiahhas also said she was fired over social media posts after Kirk’s killing.The weaponization of Kirk’s death is so alarming that even one of Trump’s former allies is rattled. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who was once one of theloudest voicesin the Magasphere, recently issued a stark warning about the way that the Trump administration appears to be leveraging Kirk’s murder to trample civil liberties.“You hope that a year from now, the turmoil we’re seeing in the aftermath of [Kirk’s] murder won’t be leveraged to bring hate speech laws to this country,”Carlson saidon Wednesday during an episode of his podcast. This was in reference to Attorney General Pam Bondi’s comments (which she has nowwalked back) that the Trump Department of Justice would “target” people disseminating “hate speech” following Kirk’s killing.“And trust me, if it is, if that does happen, there is never a more justified moment for civil disobedience than that, ever,” Carlson added. “Because if they can tell you what to say, they’re telling you what to think … There is nothing they can’t do to you because they don’t consider you human.”LikeMarjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman who has recently started speaking a limited amount of sense on certain topics, Carlson is no ally to progressives. Indeed Carlson’s hate-mongering, and his former public cheerleading for Trump, are a large part of why we are in such a mess. But the fact that even a far-right voice like Carlson is worried about the authoritarian direction in which the US isheadingshould chill you to the bones. Carlson appears to have realized that no one is safe in the dictatorship that Trump appears intent on building. Not even him.Nuns on the run in AustriaSister Regina, 86, Sister Rita, 81, and Sister Bernadette, 88, are doing it for themselves.

In the US, the calls for a crackdown have already begunSat 20 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 12.31 EDTShareOn the night of 27 February 1933, six days before national elections, the German Reichstag was set on fire. Firefighters and police discovered a Dutch communist named Marinus van der Lubbe at the scene, who confessed to being the arsonist. The Nazi Reichstag president, Hermann Göring, soon arrived, followed by the future propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and Adolf Hitler, who had been dining together.Two competing, still unresolved, conspiracy theories would circulate about the real culprit: the Nazis, with van der Lubbe as front; or a communist cabal. But the three men had no doubts. Göring pronounced the crime a communist plot. Hitler called it “a God-given signal”, adding: “If this fire, as I believe, is the work of the communists, then we must crush out this murderous pest with an iron fist.”On 10 September 2025, within minutes of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, before a suspect or a motive had been identified, acacophony of voices– from neo-Nazi influencers to Republican members of Congress – were blaming the left for the murder of the hugely effective far-right political organizer.Donald Trumpamplified the indictments. “Radical left … rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now,” he said, in atelevised addressfrom the Oval Office that night, pointedly omitting examples of violence against progressives or Democrats.IsKirk’s assassinationTrump’s Reichstag fire?There are major differences between Germany in 1933 and the US in 2025. Germany’s democracy was but 14 years old at the time. Created amid the privation of the postwar depression and attended by popular ressentiment at the country’s defeat, the Weimar Republic was unstable from the start. And simultaneously, out of those same conditions, the Nazi movement was born and gained strength.Hitler’s attempted coup d’etat of 1923 – the beer hall putsch – failed but brought him national attention. During what the Nazis called the “time of struggle”between 1925 and 1932, stormtroopers and assorted thugs committed nearly continual acts of terrorism and violence toward political foes. Jews, and other minorities. The conflagration of 27 February 1933 burst from tinder ready to combust.By contrast, US democracy is nearly a quarter of a millennium old. It has weathered division, corruption, and violence – and, in many instances, stood stronger, better governed, and more just in their aftermath. Today – despite attacks on the press, boldly partisan gerrymandering, police brutality against peaceful protests, and the rightward lurch of the judiciary – Americans still have civil liberties, however frayed and endangered. That is more than Germans had after the Reichstag fire. But it is becoming clearer that, without widespread popular resistance, it will not stay that way.Important differences notwithstanding, this moment in the US contains many parallels with what happened in Germany over 90 years ago. American history is full of injustice and repression – from the dispossession of Indigenous people’s lands to the permanently heightened surveillance of everyday life since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But the scale and scope of Trump’s assaults on democracy are unprecedented. We need to learn from the past to recognize how dangerous a moment we are in, and where we might be going.Within hours of the Reichstag fire, German president Paul von Hindenburg signed an emergency decree “for the protection of people and state” that snuffed out civil liberties, including the freedoms of speech, association, and the press and the rights of due process.A massive repressionensued, including thousands of arrests of communists and Social Democrats, trade unionists, and intellectuals on a list compiled by the paramilitary Sturmabteilung (stormtroopers or SA). The first night, 4,000 people were taken to SA barracks and tortured. The violence did not let up.On 23 March 1933, with almost all opposition members prevented from taking their seats, the Reichstag passed the statutory partner of the 28 February decree, theEnabling Act,which permanently suspended civil liberties and assigned all legislative power to Hitler and his ministers. Just weeks later, the first concentration camp, Dachau, opened. Accelerated by the blaze in Berlin, German democracy was reduced to ashes.Now theTrump administrationis using Kirk’s assassination, as the Nazis used the fire in Berlin, to instigate its own massive repression. Trump has not blocked Democrats from taking their seats in Congress nor arrested opposition members en masse yet. But he is using the instruments of government to bring to heel anyone who speaks the mildest ill of him or his friends.In just the last few days, the FCC chair threatened Disney, ABC and its affiliates with punitive action if they did not cancel Jimmy Kimmel Live after the host made a joke in which he implied that Kirk’s killer was one of the “Maga gang”. The companies caved and Kimmel’s show was indefinitely suspended. Autocrats are not known for gracefully taking a joke.Assigning blame for Kirk’s murder on the entire American political left came not just from extreme-right podcasters, influencers and militia leaders. Republican representatives, administration officials, and White House advisers loudly, almost triumphantly, joined the fray.“The Democrats own this,” congresswoman Nancy Mace, of South Carolina, toldNBC News, calling Kirk’s then-unknown killer a “raging left lunatic”.“EVERY DAMN ONE OF YOU WHO CALLED US FASCISTS DID THIS,” Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna posted onX. “You were too busy doping up kids, cutting off their genitals, inciting racial violence by supporting orgs that exploit minorities, protecting criminals … Your words caused this. Your hate caused this.”Laura Loomer, one of Trump’s closest allies,chimed in: “Prepare to have your whole future professional aspirations ruined if you are sick enough to celebrate his death,” she wrote. “I’m going to make you wish you never opened your mouth.”Of course, the bully at the bully pulpit spoke loudest. “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity & to other political violence,” Trump promised, “including the organizations who fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country.”Taking over as host on Kirk’s radio show Monday, JD Vancevowedto “go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence” – which he also called “left-wing lunatics”. Of these, he named the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundations, the latter run by George Soros, the progressive, pro-democracy philanthropist and Jewish Holocaust survivor, who has long been the subject of neo-Nazivitriol. Vance also threatened to investigate the non-profit status of the venerable leftwing publication the Nation.Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff , also on the show,added: “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, homeland security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these [radical left] networks and make America safe again for the American people.”On Tuesday, after Trump was confronted by protesters who chanted “Free DC! Free Palestine! Trump is the Hitler of our time!” in a Washington DC restaurant, deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said on CNN that hemight investigatethem as “part of an organized effort to inflict harm and terror and damage to the United States”.The presidentmore recentlytold reporters he conferred with US attorney general Pam Bondi about bringing federal racketeering charges against these “agitators” and wouldsupportdesignating “antifa” as terrorists.In many senses, the crackdown on dissent has been under way for months. Trump began his second term implementing the Heritage Foundation’sProject Esther, punishing professors, students, whole college departments, and anyone accused of “antisemitism”– defined as criticism of Israel – with names supplied by Zionistinformants. The witch-hunt is expanding.All of this, along with Trump’s earlier moves, recall senator Joseph McCarthy’s crusade against communists and other alleged subversives in the 1950s. McCarthy instituted loyalty oaths for government workers, and many states followed suit. Failure to sign meant resignation or firing. In June, a plan to test potential federal employees for fidelity to Trump’s mission wasdroppedafter criticism, but employees and higher officials have since then been regularly fired for failure to demonstrate it, or just for telling a truth inconvenient to the president. The FBI director, Kash Patel, published alist of traitorous “deep state” figuresand has alreadypunisheda third of them. He denies it is an “enemies list”, referring to the list McCarthy claimed to have.The president hastoyed with invokingthe Insurrection Act amid protests against immigrant roundups. He has declared a spectral“crime emergency”as apretextto send troops into Washington DC and other cities, andorderedthe formation of a federal “quick response force” for “quelling civil disturbances”. He has deputized Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to terrorize and brutalize brown, Spanish-speaking people its agents assume to be undocumented immigrants, a policy of racial profiling and a violation of the fourth amendment against illegal search and seizure, which the US supreme court has allowed.Before the National Socialists became Germany’s one, murderous ruling party, Nazism wasa popular movement. But movements and parties are not separate entities, and governments need to mobilize consent – or squash opposition – to survive. Our lawless government supports and is supported by a lawless movement. “It is shocking how day after day, naked acts of violence, breaches of the law, barbaric opinions appeal quite undisguised as official decree,” the German Jewish philologist and diarist Victor Klempererwroteon 17 March 1933. The same could describe the US under Trump.The criminal president has criminals at his back. One of the provisions of the Enabling Act was a grant of amnesty to anyone who had committed a crime “for the good of the Reich during the Weimar Republic”.“He who saves his country does not violate the law,” Trumpposted, quoting Napoleon a few weeks afterpardoningall the January 6 rioters, including those who had assaulted and killed police officers. “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,” he said in a 2016 presidential debate. He is now hinting that it’s time for them to act.The challenges are enormous. But in addition to the resilience and longevity of US democracy, there are reasons to hope that a resistance movement can survive and win this time around.Repression is quickly metastasizing. But the same social media that polarize opinion, spread disinformation, and abet government surveillance enable political organizing, foil censorship and substantiate truth, and link global networks to elude repressive laws, such as the feminist cells distributing abortion pills into red states.The country seems hopelessly divided. Yet the same federalism that gives the states the right to gerrymander and enact undemocratic legislation is useful to states that are intent on governing well, providing for their residents and sheltering them from the abuses of Washington.The Democrats in Washington are clueless, but local progressive candidates are winning elections. Law firms and major media companies are surrendering to Trump’s extortion without a fight. But the ACLU still exists, as do independent news outlets.And try as Trump may to erase America’s histories of oppression and of the liberation movements against it, they are not forgotten. We know what capitulation and passivity lead to and what the struggles for peace and justice can ultimately achieve. It is easy to feel defeated, but we cannot give up now.Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

It’s as if they don’t realise such discredited, antediluvian obscurantism has helped cost them two elections – each time by a greater margin.Next, they’ll be telling us the Earth is flat and Copernicus got the movement of the planets wrong.What is a climate target, and how does Australia’s new one for 2035 stack up against other countries?Read moreWhile her frontbench threatened to walk unless she dumped net zero by 2050, the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, touted the Coalition’s economic credentials in arecent speech.This is a befuddling contradiction.Ley says a key criterion of net zero is stable, reliable and affordable energy while her own Coalition continues to undermine the prospect of achieving those very things by destabilising investment in the energy transition.With nuclear too slow and expensive, ailing coal-fired power stations not worth fixing, and the cost of gas weighing on consumers, business certainty and clear policy settingsare criticalto enable investment in renewable energy.Yet the Coalition’s flip-flopping, which is underpinned by personal ambition by particular members of its front bench, is playing dangerous games with the Australian economy and with it the future prosperity of our nation.That’s you, your kids and your grandkids; their safety, their national security, their jobs, their quality of life, not forgetting the disruptive consequences for our immediate neighbourhood.That includes inundation of low-lying cities such as Bangkok and Jakarta and climate-related food shortages that could trigger instability across the region.The horrifying, delayed and entirely unsurprising national climate risk assessment released last week backs this up.Asreported here, “everything will be affected” – the economy, food systems and communities, health, national security, First Nations people, transport, energy and the natural environment.Are we going to be stupid, or are we going to be smart? And which leaders will reflect our choice?Well, duh. Anyone who has been affected by a flood, fire, storm or drought; had their insurance costs go up; experienced a transport delay, energy interruption or been unable to buy a banana due to a weather event knows this is already upon us. And that’s pretty much every Australian.So, are we going to be stupid? Or are we going to be smart? And which leaders will reflect our choice?Because it’s the cost of not doing it that we should be focused on.As theCSIRO saidin 2019: “Under a ‘slow decline’ scenario by 2060 where Australia fails to adequately address climate change and sustainability challenges, GDP is projected to grow at 0.7% less per year and real wages would be 50% lower than under an ‘outlook scenario’ where Australia meets climate change and sustainability challenges.”To be clear, a “slow decline” in which Australia fails to adequately address the challenges identified will lead to poorer outcomes across multiple dimensions.Treasury modelling released alongside the climate target range repeats this, estimating that a “disorderly transition” would result in an economy $1.2tn smaller.That means fewer jobs that are less well-paying, lower standards of living for our kids and grandkids and the social disruption and dislocation that goes with it. Oh, andhigherenergy prices.More “marches for Australia” anyone?Before the release of the target, last weekDeloitte modellingfor a coalition of 500 Australian businesses suggested that a 75% emissions-reduction target by 2035 versus 65% could yield $227bn in additional GDP over 10 years, growing to $490bn over 25 years. This is in part due to the market forces that a decisive target would drive.“In a competitive global environment, a 65% target is unlikely to drive the level of capital, innovation and jobs required for Australia to build new export industries.”Will a politically calibrated “range” of 62-70% do that?New research released a few weeks ago by the Investor Group on Climate Changeconfirmed“a significant gap between ambition and action” when it comes to corporate investment.“Australia has the opportunity to lead in the transition, but without clear policy signals and adequate capital deployment, we risk being left behind and missing out on huge economic opportunities,” Richard Proudlove, IGCC director of corporate engagement said.Neither the government nor the opposition are providing that clarity. Far from it.Let’s hope action overtakes ambition.Hope we can believe in.Zoe Daniel is a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and former independent member for GoldsteinExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionAustralian politicsBusinessEnergyGreenhouse gas emissionsRenewable energycommentShareReuse this content"

But would it hurt artists to take a stand?Elle HuntAt Wembley, Chris Martin exhorted the crowd to ‘send love anywhere you wanna send it’. But half-hearted word salad won’t stop the rise of hateSat 20 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 02.01 EDTShareIdon’t mind committing to record that I am a fan of Coldplay. A Rush of Blood to the Head, Parachutes andViva La Vida …are legitimately good albums. And Fix You remains a tearjerker despite decades of overuse in medical dramas.Yet, if your taste is better than mine, you may not know thatthey’re on tour. On my Instagram stories, at least, there has been a conspicuous absence of Coldplay posts, compared to the wall-to-wall coverage of the Oasis reunion shows (though I’m not convinced Oasis have more good songs in their catalogue).When I attended last week, the stalls were packed with perhaps the most diverse and global crowd I’ve ever seen. Even the haters – not that there were any present – would have to admitColdplayput on a dazzling show, with 3D special effects and guest performers, including Fela Kuti’s son Femi, Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna and an entire orchestra from Venezuela. In some ways it was a triumph of technology and globalisation, but as a platform, I couldn’t help feeling it was squandered.Such was Chris Martin’s eagerness to preach peace, love and tolerance from the stage that he overshot it a bit, entreating us to direct our good feeling “to Ukraine … and Russia, Palestine … and Israel” and everywhere else besides. Well – sure. People aren’t their governments, and there’s suffering everywhere. But in those conflicts, suffering is not evenly proportioned. Elyanna sang Coldplay’s single We Pray with palpable emotion. I wondered: what would she have said if she’d expressed herself more?Similarly, on Friday at Wembley, the closing night of the tour, Martin exhorted the crowd to “send love anywhere you wanna send it in the world”. He went on: “You can send it to Charlie Kirk’s family. You can send it to anybody’s family. You can send it to people you disagree with but you send them love anyway.” It is this lack of a definitive statement, along with the barely there acknowledgment of how genuinely divisive these issues and events are, that rendered his warm-fuzzy sentiments hollow even by stadium-rock standards, like a Christian music concert with zero mention of God.Perhaps this really is as deep as his engagement goes: you don’t get to 10 studio albums and more than 20 years of world-dominating success by being a firebrand. And, maybe controversially, I don’t believe artists are obliged to speak out about politics: it’s generally neither edifying nor productive for the cause when they weigh in half-heartedly with word salad.When the 1975’s Matty Healy paused theirotherwise brilliant headline set at Glastonburyto elaborate banally on their “conscious decision” to eschew politics in favour of “love and friendship”, it struck a bum note for me in the crowd. No fan of the 1975 needs or expects Healy’s hazy expansions – why stop the show to saynothing?Many artists, notably young women, do consistently address the conflict in Palestine and other struggles – Chappell Roan, Renée Rapp, Jade Thirlwall among them. Whether this reflects the higher standards placed on women in the public eye, the pressures of their politically engaged young fans or the fact that they are genuinely invested is up for debate; their frequent eloquence, and fearless references to genocide, suggests the last. But their powers of influence are limited: girls and young women are a formidable economic force, but less influential politically.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we must not rewrite his life | Moira DoneganRead moreColdplay, on the other hand, are middle Britain. I’m willing to bet that there will have been a far greater proportion of Tory – and no doubt Reform – voters at Wembley than the other gigs I’ve attended this year. Only by the most creative interpretations of peace, love and understanding can either party be said to stand for them (loving the St George flag, maybe?). What would it mean, I wondered, for Martin to say: “And, while we’re at it, don’t vote for Nigel Farage”?Maybe nothing. After all, Charli xcx’s “Kamala IS brat” and Swift’s “childless cat lady” endorsement didn’t get Harris over the line. And relative to many acts, Coldplay already do a lot of good – albeit for uncontroversial causes – as laid out on screens before the show:funding small music venues,cleaning up oceans, rewilding forests,generating clean energy. That’s not nothing – for their beneficiaries, it’s doubtless transformative. Though with the ongoing threat of the climate crisis, these appeals somewhat amount to an understatement of reality.Nobody should expect political salvation from pop stars – especially Coldplay. To give the Peep Show quote routinely parroted at Coldplay fans: “People like Coldplay and voted for the Nazis – you can’t trust people.” For now, the former group outnumbers the latter, but hatred is doubtless figuring more prominently in global political movements, and it is not placated or stalled by vague appeals to love. So perhaps it wouldn’t hurt for more artists to take a clear, well-defined stand, rather than aim for palatability and maximum consensus.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsColdplayOpinionPop and rockPalestinian territoriesThe 1975Middle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

The NGO is one of the most active and respected bodies working on the Middle East in the British parliament. It promotes conflict resolution, human rights and civil society.The purpose of my visit, alongside my parliamentary colleague Simon Opher, a doctor like me, was to begin to understand the state of healthcare for Palestinians in theWest Bank. Unfortunately, we never set foot in Israel, let alone visited any hospitals in the occupied territories.Instead, all I was permitted to see was the no man’s land of the Sheikh Hussein border crossing, the Jordan river reduced to a trickle. As I waited while the border officials made up their minds about me, I finished off the one thing I’d brought with me to eat – a small bag of KP nuts – and reflected on how lowIsraelhas been brought by its current government and how much it has changed, almost beyond recognition.It’s not the first time that Israel has denied British parliamentarians entry – a similar fate befell two of my colleaguesin April. I don’t defend their removal from Israel for a moment, but my removal is different.View image in fullscreenBritish MPs Peter Prinsley (left) and Simon Opher in Jordan earlier this week.Photograph: Peter PrinsleyIt represents the extent to which the Israeli governmenthas isolated itself. It saddens me to say that Israel today seems to be a world away from the inclusive, pluralistic, open and democratic principles on which it was founded in 1948.I am Jewish, one of just a dozen or so Jewish members of the House of Commons. I visited Israel for the first time as an idealistic medical student and have since returned for happy holidays, visiting family who live there. I am a member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and a committed supporter of my local synagogue.The official Israeli document denying my entry cited “public security or public safety or public order considerations”, without providing any explanation as to how I, a 67-year-old former ear, nose and throat surgeon from Suffolk, might pose any threat at all.I decided to join the delegation because it would have given me an opportunity to talk to doctors, patients and medical charities on the ground, and expand my knowledge of the horrendous events in the Middle East and how it is affectingmedical facilities, medics and the patients they treat. As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to be as informed as possible.We have had months of devastating images broadcast nightly on our TV screens as thehumanitarian catastrophein Gaza unfolds. Transparency is the only way we can work towards a peaceful solution to this devastating war. It is only through talking and understanding that we have a chance for peace. Only with openness and honesty can progress be made in good faith.Gaza has already been totally cut offto journalists, diplomats and human rights advocates.

Now, I know you can’t speak truth to power if power controls your wordsSat 20 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 20 Sep 2025 09.39 EDTShareThe BBC I joined on my first day of professional journalism – 40 years ago this week – is unrecognisable today. While, for most of its history, the corporation had largelydefended the status quo, under the director general at the time, Alasdair Milne, its journalists were sometimes allowed to stick it to power. This, I believe, is what journalism exists to do – and seldom does.As a student, I’d hammered on the doors of the BBC’s Natural History Unit, insisting there was a major gap in its coverage: investigative environmental reporting. If they took me on, I argued, I could help them fill it. The phone rang as I was leaving the house for one of my final exams. It was the head of the unit, saying: “You’re so fucking persistent you’ve got the job.”My immediate boss, the head of radio, instructed me to “get the bastards”. Investigative journalists were much freer then. It was easier to obtain permission to set up a fake company, pose as a buyer and penetrate criminal networks and unethical corporations.We broke some big stories. On one occasion, we amassed powerful evidence to suggest that a ship leaking oil on a sensitive coastline had been deliberately scuppered. That programme won a Sony award. On another, I had the head of customs in Abidjan, in Ivory Coast, offering to sell me chimpanzees for experiments. It was gripping and felt meaningful: we could see the difference we made. This was all I ever wanted to do, and I thought I was set up for life.On 29 January 1987, disaster struck. The BBC’s investigations had infuriated the Thatcher government, particularly theSecret Societyseries, which had exposed clandestine decision-making, and the Panorama programme Maggie’s Militant Tendency, alleging far-right views among senior Conservatives (which they denied). The BBC boardforced the resignationof Alasdair Milne. The following day, when my boss came into the office, he told me: “That’s it. No more investigative journalism.” How can you have journalism if it’s not investigative, I countered. “Don’t tellmethat. It’s come from the top.”It wasn’t just my career that hit the buffers: it was my worldview. I had naively believed that humanity’s problem was an information deficit. Shine a light and change would follow. Now, I began to see, while the pen might be mightier than the sword, the wallet is mightier than the pen.View image in fullscreenGeorge Monbiot being painted for a ceremony by Arara people in the Brazilian Amazon in the mid-1990s.Photograph: George MonbiotI was recruited at the tail end of the“great compression”: a period of radicallylower inequality. The two world wars had destroyed much of the politicalpower of capital, enabling high taxation of the very rich, the creation of a welfare state and a widening spectrum of politics and opinion. Since then, as the money and power of the very rich have multiplied once more, the governments they support have sought tocrush dissent. The process is accelerating, as thesuspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s showandexclusion of ABCfrom Trump’s press conference in the UK suggest.When Milne was sacked, I had been working on our biggest investigation yet: into the transmigration programme in Indonesia run by the Suharto dictatorship – and funded by the World Bank and, indirectly, the UK and US governments. The policy involved moving hundreds of thousands of people to the country’s outer islands, to displace and corral local populations. It was a brutal, ecocidal and, in West Papua, genocidal scheme. I sold the story to a publisher instead. But I felt unready, so I took a six-month job producing current affairs at the BBC World Service. It was an excellent schooling in global politics, but I realised I could never thrive in a newsroom. On a slow news day, we were debating the lead for our programme among several dull options. Ten minutes before transmission, the editor strode into the studio, clapped his hands and announced: “Great – 110 dead in Sri Lanka!”I spent the next six years working freelance in the tropics, investigating some extremely dangerous stories, scraping a living by writing books and making occasional radio programmes. When I returned, I found the BBC and other broadcasters had become furiously hostile to environmental programming. I decided to try print.I entertained another crazily naive belief: that I should work only for the rightwing press, reaching people who would otherwise never see such stories. I managed to place a couple of articles in the Telegraph, though they were severely trimmed and relegated to the back pages. I knew a sympathetic junior editor at the Daily Mail, who commissioned me, across three years, to write 21 articles. All but one were spiked by her seniors. Finally, I had one published, on the impacts of car pollution. Discussing my proposal, an editor had asked me: “So what’s the solution? More research?” No, I answered, “stronger regulation”. Reading the published article, I discovered that the solution was “more research”.I finally saw the bleeding obvious: you cannot speak truth to power if power controls your words. I was lucky to be taken on by the Guardian. It remains among the very few mainstream outlets, anywhere, in which you can freely criticise the real elite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was shocked to discover how far things have gone. The Telegraph columnist Tim Stanley “argued” that the media can’t be predominantly rightwing, because GB News says it has been “captured by the loony left”. The rightwinger Inaya Folarin Iman called the idea that billionaires influence the media they own a “grand conspiracy” and “false consciousness”. Such people are now so dominant that they no longer even have to make sense.Power is the rock on which truth founders. It will always find willing enforcers: no one ever lost money by telling billionaires what they want to hear. The mainstream media, with a few exceptions, is a single-issue lobby group, whose purpose is to assert the rights of capital.But perhaps the ground is shifting. Citizen journalism is flowering, through theBylines network,openDemocracy,Double Down News,Novara,DeclassifiedandDeSmog, and in particular at the local level. Most established local newspapers are a graveyard of good journalism. But they’re being pushed aside by innovative new outlets, such as theBristol Cable,Glasgow’s Bell,View Digitalin Belfast,Manchester’s Mill, theLeicester Gazette,West Country Voices,Birmingham’s Dispatch, theOxford Clarion, theHastings Independent, theWaltham Forest Echo,Inside Croydon, theSheffield Tribuneand theLiverpool Post.Something is stirring; something that could become very big – a citizens’ revolt against the propaganda of power.

He reveals the trauma and triumph that taught him why it’s more important to be a good man than a nice guySat 20 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShare“Simon!”Matthew McConaugheybarks. “How do, sir?!” Matthew McConaughey could not be more Matthew McConaughey if he tried. And he’s only said four words. Charming, sincere, intense, 100% Texan and 101% eccentric.Five years ago, the Oscar-winning actor wrote a memoir calledGreenlights. It wasn’t a conventional memoir, more a collection of life lessons, bullet-point anecdotes and gnomic philosophies. Now he has written a book of poetry calledPoems & Prayers. For McConaughey, the two are interchangeable. It’s another memoir of sorts – this time, a portrait of his faith and its impact on his everyday life. In it he addresses faith in the broadest sense. There’s plenty of talking to God as he searches for the divine in himself, loads of Amens, but it’s also about faith in himself, his family, his career, the world, the works.The gospel according to Matthew advocates a world of relentless positivity that rejects the concepts of hate or “can’t”; a world of conservative discipline and traditional family values. But of course, this being McConaughey, it’s also a creed in permanent tension with earthly delights and soiled realities, where he misses his own birthday party because he’s so stoned that he sits in his car listening to a Janet Jackson song 32 times in a row, where his God-fearing parents beat the living crap out of each other, and his dad shags himself to death one early morning at the age of 62. As a rounded philosophy, I can’t pretend to make sense of it all. I’m not sure that McConaughey does, but he has a good go.His earliest poems are written as an 18-year-old taking a gap year in Australia as a Rotary Club exchange student. Already, he says, he was pushing the existential envelope. “I was on my own and I didn’t have any of my friends to bounce stuff off. The conversations were all Socratic, with myself. I was a foreign man in a foreign land. Quite lonely. And I was trying to make sense of the world, trying to make sense of my home. Trying to make sense of Texas and life.”What was he struggling with? “I was asking similar questions then as I am now. What are we calling success? What are we rewarding people and ourselves for in this life? What are we chasing? What are we living for? Is it just money and fame? And this is before I had any money and fame. I was already questioning that. Character and integrity meant a lot to me then. I was calling out what I saw as the mendacities of the world.” At the heart of his personal battle is learning to distinguish between McConaughey the nice guy and McConaughey the good man. The nice guy is liked by everyone and conflict-averse; the good man is values-driven, takes a stance, and is going to piss some people off along the way.View image in fullscreenWith Rory Cochrane in Dazed and Confused, 1993.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyView image in fullscreenWith Kate Hudson in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, 2003.Photograph: The Kobal CollectionMcConaughey has had three distinct stages in his movie career. First, there was the indie kid in his early 20s who worked with directors such as Richard Linklater inDazed and Confusedand John Sayles inLone Star. It was in Dazed and Confused that he made his name as drawling stoner extraordinaire David Wooderson, a twentysomething perpetual adolescent who still hangs around with high-school students. His catchphrases: “Alright, alright, alright” (the first words he ever said in a movie) and “You just gotta keep livin’, man. L.I.V.I.N.” entered the indie movie lexicon and have been linked with McConaughey ever since.Surprisingly, he then became a conventional leading man in mainstream movies, playing lawyers in courtroom procedurals (A Time to Kill, Amistad) and smooth-chested, smooth-talking heart-throbs in romcoms (The Wedding Planner, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past).Then, in 2011, came the much celebrated third stage when McConaughey gave free rein to his quirkiness, inhabiting a series of memorable off-the-wall characters. In other hands, they might have been too far-fetched, but somehow he managed to make them utterly convincing. Every outlandish idiosyncrasy rang true – from homophobic rodeo cowboy turned Aids activist Ron Woodroof saving the lives of gay men inDallas Buyers Clubto unhinged hedonist stockbroker Mark Hanna inThe Wolf of Wall Streetand inscrutable nihilist Rust Cohle inTrue Detective. And then there were the physical transformations. In Dallas Buyers Club, for which he won the best actor Oscar in 2014, he lost about 45lb to play the Aids-emaciated Woodroof; inGoldhe gained about the same amount by guzzling cheeseburgers and beer to play corpulent prospector Kenny Wells; and forMagic Mikehe got rid of virtually all his body fat to play superbuff strip-club owner Dallas. This stage of his career became known as the McConaissance, and is ongoing.Today he is speaking via video link from his home in Austin, Texas. I’m warned by the publicist that we cannot show footage from the interview because McConaughey is not “camera ready”. Camera ready or not, he’s looking pretty good. Trim, clean-shaven, younger than his 55 years but not ridiculously so. He’s sipping from a huge bottle of honey-based kombucha.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Derek Shapton/The GuardianI believed I would have made a good monk. I revere dedication. But a friend who’s an abbot said: No. You  need to tell stories. That is your giftWhile studying for a degree in radio, television and film at the University of Texas at Austin, he was cast by Linklater in Dazed and Confused. It was meant to be a much smaller role, but the director was so taken by his ability to improvise he expanded the part. As for McConaughey, he never assumed acting would be more than a fun hobby. So what did he think he would do with his life at the point he started writing poetry in Australia? “I believed my calling was to become a monk.” Would he have made a good one? He pauses. “Yeasssss. I would have made a good monk. I revere dedication, a life that dedicates itself to God, that sees God in every natural thing, at all times.” But he says he thinks he would have missed out on too much stuff. I expect him to talk about sex and stimulants. But no. “I had long talks about it with a Benedictine monk friend of mine who’s now an abbot at a monastery, and he said: ‘Nononononononoonono,you’re a communicator, you’re a storyteller, do not go to live a hermetic life. You need to communicate and tell stories. That is a gift you have been given. Do not dampen that gift or put a blanket on that gift by becoming a monk or hermit.’” At times he sounds like God’s own cowboy; vowels elongating and contracting by the syllable, one word gliding into the next, gloriously unpunctuated, sentences flowing like a raging river.He started writing at a time he felt his Christian faith challenged. “I found myself looking at the world around me and not finding evidence of things I want to believe in. I didn’t want to quit believing, but I was looking at how we’re treating each other, the low barometer of trust, and there seemed to be a sense of win at any cost. It doesn’t matter how you did it, just win. I became a little cynical. And then I was like: ‘How dare you, youarrogant, entitled prick.’ That is a disease. Cynicism is, I believe, a disease.”McConaughey grew up in Texas with two older brothers to Methodist parents. His father, James, who struggled with alcoholism, made fortunes in the oil-pipe supply business and lost them. His mother, Kay, was a teacher. Both were tough disciplinarians, though they didn’t necessarily practise what they preached.I’ve read so many improbable stories about his parents that I assume they must be apocryphal. For example, that they both got married three times – to each other. “Yep.Yep. Married three times, divorced twice. They never married anyone else. As far as I know there was never anybody else besides the two of them. I just think they needed some breaks from each other.” Having said that, his mother told him recently that sheknewhis fellow actor and good friend Woody Harrelson’s father, a convicted contract killer, and that she befriended him in one of her breaks from McConaughey’s father. This has led to rumours (admittedly started by McConaughey and Harrelson) that they are half-brothers.View image in fullscreenWith his mother Kay earlier this month at Toronto film festival.Photograph: Chris Chew/UPI/ShutterstockFrom my mom and dad you got expectations. There was fear of disobeying and doing wrong. You couldn’t say ‘can’t’ or ‘hate’. They were like cuss words in our householdIt was only a few years ago that he learned about his parents’ triplicate marriage, he says. “I was around 13 the second time they got divorced. I thought Mom was having an extended vacation in Florida. Ha ha ha!” He rocks with laughter. “Dad and I were living in the trailer park.”Is it true that his mother broke three fingers attacking his father? “Noooooooo!” he says, outraged at the suggestion. “The same finger. The middle one each time. ‘Pop! Pop!! Pop!!! Pop!!!!’” He imitates her, poking his father’s head with maximum force. “‘Katie, stop!KATIE, STOP!’” Then he makes a crunching noise. “And her finger would go.” In Greenlights, he describes his mother going for his father with a 12in chef’s knife having already broken his nose, and him retaliating with a bottle of Heinz ketchup.And yet they adored each other. His father always said he’d like to die making love to Kay. And, sure enough, he got his wish. “When I got that call it was a Monday afternoon, and I was in Austin and they were in Houston. Mom said: ‘Your dad has moved on,’ but she didn’t tell me on the initial call how. When I got back she told me. They hauled him out on the gurney and they tried to cover him up, and my mom’s in the driveway, and she pulled the sheet off him. It was 7.30am. My understanding is that they made love that morning about 6.30am and as soon as they finished having sex he had a heart attack.” What’s the relevance of pulling the sheet back – did that make it obvious how he died? “It didn’t make it obvious. But my mom wasn’t into standing on ceremony. ‘That’s Big Jim, he’s gonna go out how he went. Don’t be trying to cover up how he went out. He’s in his birthday suit and he’s right there. Don’t be covering that man up!’”Big Jim and Kay were staunch Christians. “It wasn’t heavy-duty fire and brimstone. But consequences were a big thing. From my mom and dad you got expectations. There was fear of disobeying and doing wrong.” What kind of things? “Respect. Not talking back. Making an effort. You couldn’t say ‘can’t’ or ‘hate’. Hate and can’t were like cuss words in our household. You could say ‘cunt’ but you couldn’t say ‘can’t’.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Derek Shapton/The GuardianHe remembers the day he learned the word “hate” at school. “It sounded like a grownup word to me. Kind of edgy. And my older brother did something to me on my own birthday, I can’t remember what, and I said: ‘I hate you,’ and I remember my mom stopping the birthday party and grabbing me and saying: ‘Don’t you ever, ever say that word, especially about a family member.’” As for “can’t”, it simply wasn’t in Big Jim’s vocabulary. “If I said I can’t do something, he would always say: ‘Aren’t you just having trouble?’ My weekend chore was to do the lawn and one morning I’d been pulling on the lawnmower and the damn thing wouldn’t start. I went inside and said: ‘Dad, I can’t get the lawnmower started,’ and he looked up. He’d hear that word, and you’d see him start twitching. He didn’t say a word, walked with me out of the kitchen to the back. He tried to start the lawnmower, but it wouldn’t start. He went down, unhooked a couple of things and started it. He calmly got up, looked me in the eye and said: ‘You see, son, you were just having trouble!’ Beautiful thing.”If McConaughey was struggling with his faith when he went to Australia at 18, it’s not surprising. Greenlights is a manifesto for positivity as much as a memoir. At one point he describes some of the bad things he has experienced to make the point that ultimately they still didn’t dent his outlook on life. Two of the lowlights are shocking – he was blackmailed into having sex for the first time at the age of 15, and he was molested by a man when he was 18 while knocked unconscious in the back of a van. Both revelations are dealt with in bullet points and never referred to again.I tell him I want to discuss something serious from Greenlights, and begin to quote from the book. Before I complete the sentence he’s cackling. “Ha ha ha ha! I knew that was coming. Ha ha ha ha!” His response makes me feel parental. Well, Matthew McConaughey, I say, it’s easy to be glib about this, but I don’t believe the reality was anything like that. He stops laughing: “Well, that may be how you received it. There was never any intent to be glib. There was absolute intent,absolute intent, to be terse and concise because I know, and you know, that if I go into that story then or now that’s the headline. That’s why I won’t tell the details now, either.”I’m not interested in the details, I say, I’m interested in the impact the incidents had on you. “Well, OK, did it crush some innocence of mine, that my nice guy, young Matthew, believed in the innocence of the world and no one would try to do harm to me or anyone else unless I provoked it? Did it step on my innocence that the first intimacy would be beautiful and innocent and natural? Sure.” The assault in the van is beyond terrifying, I say. “Oh, yeah, and I got out relatively unscathed. It could have been worse is what I’m saying. Talk about divine intervention. I remember waking up [in the van], and it was right before it could have been worse. That idea of the dangers of the world that are out there, about being aware, where to be, where not to be, how not to get into dicey situations, being aware of your zone, yeah. I look back and go, there are things I could have done differently to not have ended up in that situation.” He whistles, to himself more than me. It’s a long, pained whistle of relief – a wordless acknowledgment that somehow he survived. “To be more aware and wise; good man, not nice guy.”We have to admit the evil and the doubt that’s in the world. We have to admit it’s out there, and it’s inside us. And then choose to believe in something better or notBoth incidents – perhaps the second in particular – jolted him into a recognition of the realities of the world. “We’re going to go from innocence to naivety to scepticism and we’re going to stop there because we’re not going to go to cynicism. OK, let’s be a little bit more sceptical.” And now he has become McConaughey the preacher man, delivering a turbo-charged, profoundly felt one-to-one sermon. “We have to admit the evil and the doubt that’s in the world. We have to admit it’s out there, and it’s inside us. And then choose to believe in something better or not; to make the choice, to say that I’m going to chase faith instead of lie down to doubt. I didn’t go: ‘Woe be me, the world is a bad place.’ There are bad agents, and I guess we’ve all got a bad agent in our suit. So let me shake hands with that, look in the mirror, but also choose – do my best to choose – a higher road. I’m going to pick something that’s more selfish. I think ultimately that is more selfish, especially if there is a heaven. If we believe that what we do here has to do with where we end up, and again I don’t know, wouldn’t that be the most selfish way to act? And if there’s not, Simon, I still believe it’s better for me, it’s improving my life while I’m here on Earth in this way.” In other words, acting nobly is truly selfish because it leads to a better outcome whether you have faith or not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve never felt as helpless as in that moment. I’ve never felt so vulnerable and unable to do anything about it. That was a nightmare.” I won’t ask about the details, I say, but how did you get away. “I escaped,” he says.It’s hard to know where to go after a conversation like that, so we return to the poems. Revel in the Post is a lovely sensual verse that concludes: “And even on a hot summer evening you can smell October / through the sweat where you left the windows open and forgot to shave.” It sounds like a memory, I say. He smiles. “It was a particular wonderful night with my wife.”View image in fullscreenWith his wife Camila Alves McConaughey and children (from left) Livingston, Vida and Levi, 2025Photograph: Rick Kern/FilmMagicSome of the poems are love letters to his wife, the model and entrepreneur Camila Alves, thinly disguised as daft instructional ditties. One goes: “Best thing you can do for your marriage. / One way to surely get ahead. / Is get rid of that king-size mattress. / And sleep in a queen-size bed.” Is that, by any chance, based on personal experience? He laughs. “You want success, it starts with the engineering. Just get a smaller bed. We have kids, right, and we saw this bed that this friend had, which was two king-size beds put next to each other, and all the kids were sleeping in it, and we were like: ‘Dude that’s great. So we did that, and it was great. The kids would come in, everyone had room to sleep, but then the kids quit sleeping in the bed, and I’m over here by my side table and 18ft over there is Camila with her side table and we’re like [he shouts], ‘Nighhhhhhht!’ And you wake up in the morning and you got, like, 20ft between you and this is not good for our marriage. So we got rid of it and got a queen-size bed and we’re snuggling up to each other. This was genius. Much better.”Alongside the poems are musings about modern life and mini polemics. At one point, he writes: “So many of us today are out to prove that the truth is just an outdated nostalgic notion, that honesty, along with being correct and right, is now a deluded currency in our cultural economy. With an epidemic of half-cocked logic and illusions being sold as sound conclusions, it’s more than hard to know what to believe in; it’s hard to believe. But I don’t want to quit believing, and I don’t want to stop believing in … humanity, you, myself, our potential.”View image in fullscreenSet designer: Caitlin Doherty. Styling: Sandra Amador. Makeip: Kara Bua. Hair: Marcus Francis.Photograph: Derek Shapton/The GuardianI assume you’re talking about Trump, I say. “In the name of progress are we going to throw out every tried-and-tested truth of the past?” he says elliptically. “I don’t think that’s real progress.” So is he referring to Trump? “Wellllll, there’s something inherently there for sure. I don’t know what to believe in those pep rallies that they hold. I’ve been around politics and politicians enough to see and hear that the score is not always what they say it is; that they don’t keep the score accurately.”The reason I’m not diving into politics presently is I want to do my best to get three kids out of the house. But I’m fascinated with itDoes Trump’s disregard for the truth concern him? “Well, sure it concerns me. But that’s nothing new, either. You can go back and there are many things to question over decades and centuries about what the truth was. Trump’s going about things in a different way than other politicians have. It’s direct. He’s cutting out the middle man.”But, McConaughey says, his comments about lost values are not simply directed at politicians. “It’s also about the parents I’m around. I talk to fathers and I think: ‘What are you teaching your children? You don’t know. Don’t do that! That’s not what your child needs now!’” What kind of things is he talking about? “I see parents becoming best mates with their child when they’re very young, so it’s very simpatico between them. It’s not about right or wrong. But that child is trying to learn from you, that child doesn’t understand the concept of character, and how to become a good young man or woman.”Now he’s on a roll. “Delayed gratification, I believe, is one of the most important things you can teach a child. I’m noticing that more and more adults are giving no value to delayed gratification or sacrifice. And if we do that we miss out on real value, real profit.” So many young people today, he says, lack a sense of shame. “I think you’ve got to have guilt. Please! Embarrassment. I wish people were a little bit more embarrassed these days. People aren’t embarrassed!” And his voice rises with anger, or disappointment, as he preaches from that imaginary pulpit. “‘You don’t mind that you half-assed that situation so poorly? This your best effort, really? I would be embarrassed.’ Guilt. You’ve gotta have some guilt. I think it’s a very healthy thing, to a certain extent.” Where does his sense of guilt come from? “Shoot! I don’t know. I’m Irish, if that’s anything to do with it.”In recent years, McConaughey has expressed an interest in going into politics. “It’s something I started thinking about six years ago. The reason I’m not diving into it presently is I want to do my best to get three kids out of the house. But I’m fascinated with politics.” What party would he be aligned to? “It could be an independent party.”So much of what he believes in goes back to that recurrent question in his poetry – what makes a good man as opposed to a nice guy? When he looks back at himself as a young man, he sees a nice guy who had to do some growing. He did some of it on solitary trips to the Amazon and Mali in the 1990s. “I put myself in these very monk-like situations to force myself to deal with myself.” But he still had plenty of growing to do. In 1999, he was arrested at 2.45am for playing bongos naked while under the influence of marijuana. The drug charges were dropped, but he was fined $50 for disturbing the peace.I’m imploding from the wacky weed and decide it’s a really good idea to listen to Janet Jackson’s That’s the Way Love Goes, 32 f-ing times in my car. I missed my own birthday partyAnd then there was the time in his 30s, before he got together with Camila, when he was so stoned that he missed his own birthday party. What happened? “I’d smoked the wrong weed. Well, not the wrong weed. The heavy stuff that weed has become. My friends had rented this place for dinner, and I’m imploding from the wacky weed and decide it’s a really good idea to listen to Janet Jackson’s That’s the Way Love Goes, 32 f-ing times in my car, and by the time I went in everyone was gone. I missed my own birthday party.” Did he smoke less after that? “Yeah, exactly. And I like that song, but I don’t need to listen to it 32 times.” Did Linklater cast him in Dazed and Confused because he was a top stoner then? “Nononononono, I was never a top stoner. I was a guy who would take a hit and go to the damn library for three hours.”Professionally, the crunch came when he turned his back on playing nice guys in romcoms despite earning an estimated $10m-$15m a film. His latest movie, The Lost Bus, is a survival drama about a struggling driver who has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through Butte County’s hellish inferno in 2018 (the deadliest wildfire in California history). In short, it is about a flawed nice guy learning to become a good man.As so often, with his immersive process, the part required extensive research. This time he had to learn to drive a bus. Or more specifically, to drive a bus through fire and alongside cliff edges. Even today, he has prepared for the interview by reading up on me. (At one point, he compares his mother to mine, whom I have written about.) I ask if he always does this. “I’d rather if I can. I like to have a little insight.” He says it makes talking to journalists less an interrogation and more an authentic conversation.McConaughey’s transformation from himbo to character actor was about challenging himself. He was hugely successful, but his reputation had taken a dip. He was now regarded as a Hollywood hack who never pushed himself. The challenge was not so much as an actor (he has always insisted that romcoms demanded as much skill as the more critically lauded films) but as a man. Was he prepared to snub the safe option and risk everything when he had a fabulously lucrative career (he was worth an estimated $160m in 2024)? After his final romcom, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, in 2009, he turned down every part he was offered for the best part of two years. Eventually, in 2011, the roles he was looking for came his way, starting with psychological thrillerKiller Joe. And that led to the McConaissance, with McConaughey now feted for the courage of his choices.When he quit romcoms, he had just become a father and was loving life, but his work left him unsatisfied. “I was good at something I wasn’t loving. I was never looking in the mirror going: ‘My life’s more vital than my work, oh I wish my work was as vital as my life.’ I remember going: ‘Well good luck, because if it’s got to be one way or the other, good on you that you feel your life’s more vital than your work and that it’s not the other way around.’ But I was like, ‘I want to go for it, I want to see if my work can be an experience for me that is so vital and alive that it challenges the vitality I’m having in my own life.’”He says that he and Camila took the decision as a team and were determined to stick with it, but others thought he’d lost the plot. “My brothers were like: ‘Little brother, what is your majormal-fucking-function? What are you thinking?’ And I was like: ‘No, this is clear to me and Camila, we’re going to do this. We’re not going to pull parachute. We’re gonna ride this.’ And 20 months later, the levee broke and the offers came in that I wanted.”Life, he says, continues to surprise him. Even today, he’s discovering things that shift perspectives on the past and help explain the present. As a young boy, he says his parents instilled him with such self-belief. His mother hung a framed photo of him as a gorgeous seven-year-old in a cowboy hat holding his Little Mr Texas trophy on the kitchen wall. “Every morning Mom was like: ‘Look at you, Little Mr Texas!’” It gave him confidence. A few years ago, he zoomed in on the photograph to read the engraving. He discovered it said “Little Mr Texas Runner-Up 1977”. When he asked his mother about it, she told him the technical winner was a wealthy boy who had cheated by wearing a fancy suit, so McConaughey was the true winner. The difference between believing you’re a winner or a runner-up can transform a life, he says. “Hell man, would I be sitting here right now if I’d thought I was just the runner-up?”Poems & Prayers is published by Headline; to support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Telling this story metes out another small dose of justiceRachel AroestiSat 20 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareEarly on in The Hack –AdolescencewriterJack Thorne’s new series about the News International phone hacking scandal – Guardian journalistNick Daviesappears on the Today programme to promote his 2008 book,Flat Earth News. It is an indictment of the contemporary British press; its sloppiness and corruption. “The logic of journalism has been overwhelmed by the logic of commercialism,” he tells the host and a glowering Stuart Kuttner, the managing editor of the News of the World. Nowadays, says Davies, so-called reporters are simply “passive processors of unchecked second-hand material”.My first thought is: OK, this is not your common-or-garden ITV drama. No hand-holding, no pandering, no schmaltz; we’re about to get a proper, grownup deep dive into the tabloid malfeasance – illegal surveillance, toxic power plays – that Davies began exposing in this newspaper in 2009. Bring on the machiavellian office politics, the labyrinthine narratives of your Successions, your Industrys, your Line of Dutys. (My next thought is: second-hand material? What, like yetanotherdramatisation of a recent major news story?)But The Hack (Wednesday 24 September, 9pm, ITV1) loses its nerve pretty quickly. This opening episode casts Davies (David Tennant at his chameleonic best in a frizzy grey wig and comfortingly 90s leather jacket and jeans combo) as our fourth-wall breaking guide, apparently determined to inject some zaniness into proceedings. We witness his attempts to begin his (real, brilliant) 2014 book Hack Attack, an account of the investigation that eventually helped destroy Kuttner’s paper and root out some of the rot at the heart of the British establishment. “Shit!” he groans to camera after struggling to formulate an opening sentence. Relatable content for all writers – even if it is immediately undermined by hisslightlyunconvincing second go: “My name is Nick Davies. I am a journalist.” (Useful exposition though!)Further surreal flourishes arrive. Tube adverts come to life, as do the posters on the wall of Davies’s study. Characters are given pseudonyms such as “Detective Buzz Aldrin”. When he meets his first source, Davies explains he must keep his identity secret – an eminently graspable fact that is nevertheless hammered home via a jarringly random parade of celebrity cameos.You suspect The Hack doesn’t fully trust viewers to stay interested in the subject matter. To wit: we’re also treated to a trite subplot about Davies’s home life involving his incredibly reasonable ex-wife and a bullied teenage son. Disappointing for lovers of quasi-intellectual drama, but understandable. The Hack has a lot in common with ITV’s colossal hit of last year,Mr Bates vs the Post Office– both prominently featureToby Jones(here he plays former Guardian editorAlan Rusbridger, despite being his physical inverse), cover a technology-based scandal and share a theme of maddening injustice in the UK – and is probably gunning for the same impact. Yet this is no easily digestible tale of brave, innocent civilians taking on The Man. Here, journalists are both the heroes and the villains – as are the police and politicians. It’s infuriating but not heart-rending. It doesn’t write itself.View image in fullscreenGuardian angle … Tennant with Toby Jones as Alan Rusbridger (left) and Nadia Albina as Gill Phillips in The Hack.Photograph: ITVThe crowd-pleasing pizzazz is justifiable, then. Besides, if you don’t like the silly stuff, wait for the second episode, which chronicles the investigation into the murder of Daniel Morgan by Met DCS Dave Cook (Robert Carlyle) in the manner of a more traditional hardboiled police procedural. (Having only seen the first two episodes, I do wonder what else is in store: Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson’s affair as a cheesy studio sitcom? The Leveson inquiry redone in the style of a musical?)Wherever The Hack goes next, I hope it manages to capture the significance of this sprawling, spectacular story – one that reveals the cold hard truth about how this country truly operates. Tennant has the ability to make anything sound exciting; he can carry this. Hopefully there’s more Steve Pemberton as Rupert Murdoch. As ever with these ripped-from-the-headlines shows, we know exactly how things pan out: some people who believed they could operate above the law got their comeuppance, of a kind. To air their dirty laundry again is to mete out another small dose of justice.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherPhone hackingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since ABC made the decision to indefinitelysuspend comedian Jimmy Kimmelfrom his late-night talkshow after on-air remarks about the killing of Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump has encouraged further action against other late-night hosts.Yet, such topical humor has been a feature of late-night TV since NBC launched the format in the mid-1950s. In fact, throughout modern history, presidents in particular have understood the cultural value of late night TV and dutifully played their part in this uniquely American symbiosis – from JFK to the present-day politicians.Steve Allen, the radio man who launched what would become the Tonight Show, regularly poked fun at political figures in his opening monologues – but in a measured, self-deprecating style that was typical of the era.Media giants accused of ‘cowering to threats’ as Trump tries to stamp out criticismRead moreIt wasn’t until comedian Johnny Carson took over in 1962 that the Tonight Show transformed into acultural institutionwhere politics was mined for nightly material. Carson resorted to impersonations and satire to highlight the human inconsistencies within politics, and borrowed from Abbott and Costello’sWho’s on First?sketch to parody Ronald Reagan’srhetorical double speak. Carson, oft-touted as “the king of late-night”, stuck to humor that called out the absurdities of politics without taking a particular side.As the Tonight Show mushroomed into one of the most popular shows on US television, attracting 17 million nightly viewers at its peak, Americans came to see Carson as a clearer lens on current events than straight news.A 2022 article in the journalSocial Science Researchfound that Carson’s daily mentions of Richard Nixon or Watergate in the early 1970s was a major contributor to the president’s approval rating crash, underscoring Carson’s tremendous influence on the bygone monoculture in his nearly 30 years on air. Before Carson, political figures really only sat down withDick Cavettand similarly tweedy late-night hosts; Cavett’s 1970 interview with Georgia lieutenant governorLester Maddox, which saw the segregationist storm off in response to Cavett’s pointed questioning, definitely wasn’t played for laughs.Nixon’sandJohn F Kennedy’sseparate Tonight Show appearances in the 1960s as presidential candidates broke ground; the office was thought to be above late-night larking. But then Reagan’s Tonight Show stops asgovernor of Californiaandhis clubby relationshipwith Carson firmly established late-night TV as an extension of the political arena and announced the former workaday actor as a true star.It wasn’t until the 1990s, when Carson was heading for retirement and the competition for his crown and ratings wasgrowing more intense, that you begin to see presidential hopefuls pursuing late-night appearances as part of a strategy to connect with younger voters keen for a more relatable stripe of politician.View image in fullscreenBill Clinton plays the saxophone as host Arsenio Hall stands by during a presidential campaign stop on the Arsenio Hall Show in Los Angeles on 3 June 1992.Photograph: Reed Saxon/APFamously, Bill Clinton’s inaugural presidential campaign was invigorated when he appeared on the Arsenio Hall Show – a younger, hipper and multi-racial rival to the Tonight Show at the time. Clinton accompanied the house band on the saxophone fora rendition of Heartbreak Hotel, earning himself a level of impassioned support from Black voters thatstill endures.In 2000, candidate George W Bush joined the Late Show with David Letterman in a reading of the comedian’s trademark top 1o list –this one, of “Changes I’ll Make to the White House”. (“Give Oval Office a heckuva scrubbing,” Bush said in a sly nod toLewinskygate.)In 2009, Barack Obama joined Carson successor Jay Leno on the Tonight Show, the first ever late-night TV appearance bya sitting US president, to sell his economic recovery plan.Even as the Clinton era gave rise to more pointed and partisan political skepticism from late-night shows such as the Daily Show and Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher (who waspulled off the air by ABCfor his 9/11 takes), presidents accepted the relentless punchlines as part of the job.But Trump is a different political animal. Unlike predecessors who became monologue fodderafterannouncing their campaigns, Trump pre-Oval Office persona would be shaped from late-night comedians riffing off his exhaustively documented divorces, business failings and rebound in reality TV.Trump was a well-established character by the time he appeared on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2016, the singular presidential hopeful who had already hosted SNLtwice. Infamously, Fallon mussed Trump’s hair – a gesture thatmedia observers arguenot only humanized Trump and his polarizing brand of politics, but also spoke to Fallon’s fundamental unseriousness. Fallon would later express regret for his role in helping to “normalize” Trump; Trump responded by calling out Fallon’s manhood.View image in fullscreenJimmy Fallon messes up Trumps famous hairdo on The Tonight Show in 2016.Photograph: The Tonight Show with Jimmy FallonThat was effectively the start of Trump’s late-night pivot from desperate guest to acid-tongued critic. He has been especially harsh on Kimmel – who has kept the Maga movement, its corrosive policies and polarizing rhetoric in crosshairs since candidate Trump backed out of a scheduled 2015 appearanceat the last minute. (Trump showed up two months later, and there were no signs of friction then.) Reportedly, the first Trump administrationput pressure on ABC and parent company Disneyto rein in Kimmel – and for years his request was just met with tougher jokes when Kimmel also hosted the Oscars. So Trump took to social media to air out his many grievances. Often while lamenting the quality of today’s late-night hosts, Trump has called on TV to “bring back Johnny”. Never mind the fact that Carson, who himselfcautionedagainst entertainers alienating audiences with their political views, has been dead for 20 years.Fast forward to July, when CBS made the decision to abruptlycancelthe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,an unrelenting Trump critic. While CBS and Paramount chiefs claimed it was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night”, the move was largely seen as a larger corporate effort to circumvent monopoly law to pave the way for parent company Paramount’s billion-dollar sale to Skydance Media and decried as a crackdown on free speech. This comes as Nexstar Media, a conservative-leaning TV station conglomerate with many ABC affiliates, is pushing the Trump administration to clear a path for its own potential monopoly through a merger with rival Tegna.But late-night comedy isn’t just under pressure from its politically obsequious corporate masters. It’s also fighting to remain a bellwether of truth at a time when US journalism institutions are being hollowed out, attacked and discredited by Trump and his many powerful allies in a polyculture where truth is no longer absolute.The 2008 book Strange Bedfellows: How Late-Night Comedy Turns Democracy into a Joke further underscores the “relay race” between newspaper coverage of Watergate and Carson’s monologue mentions. With fractured audiences having deeply eroded late night’s once healthy profit margins, late-night shows now risk losing more than just audience share by mocking the Trump administration or its designated mouthpieces.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators gather outside El Capitan Entertainment Centre, where Jimmy Kimmel Live! is filmed, to protest ABC’s decision to pull Kimmel off the air after his remarks about Charlie Kirk in Hollywood, California, on 18 September 2025.Photograph: JW Hendricks/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“When you go back and take a look, all they do is hit Trump,” the president said from aboard Air Force One while threateninganyone with an FCC broadcast licensewho spends too much time criticizing him, however he defines it. “They’re not allowed to do that!

Meanwhile, Kimmel’s surviving peer hosts looked to the state-run media of strongman-controlled regimes for their comedic cues.Fallon and the Daily Show’s Jon Stewart each kicked off their shows with satirical set pieces thatbowed to the presidentandpaid mock respect to himas an authoritarian. Colbert dusted off hisrightwing blowhard characterto get in a few subliminal digs at Trump.The jokecraft speaks to the seriousness of the times, and late-night’s determination to carry on serving as the country’s political lens – regardless of the ultimate cost.Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelDonald TrumpUS television industryCharlie Kirk shootingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The house would be rigged with hidden cameras and the child would be an actor of age, playing the role of an excitable pre- or young teen, maybe even suggesting they both drank alcohol as a further illicit act. But before things went the way that the guest expected they would, out came TV’s Chris Hansen, an award-winning broadcast journalist accompanied by a camera crew. Tears would be shed, apologies would be given and most often, the illusion of being “free to go” would be followed by an arrest carried out by gun-toting police officers.To Catch a Predator: exploring the uneasy legacy of the controversial TV seriesRead moreBetween the years of 2004 and 2007, Dateline’s To Catch a Predator was a prime-time ratings hit in the US, a cleanly packaged version of something undeniably dirty, a punchy reminder to parents that the ever-expanding online world was not to be trusted. It was “a strange mix of schadenfreude and horror,” says David Osit, an Emmy-winning documentary film-maker, whose latest film Predators looks back on the show and the controversy surrounding it. It’s one of a number of new documentaries revisiting a strange, exploitative era of television, one without the regulations and moral code we’re now more accustomed to mostly expect. Netflix has explored the problems withThe Jerry Springer Showand more recentlyThe Biggest Loserand will soon revisit the horrors ofAmerica’s Next Top Model, a series that’s since been accused of cruelly imposing impossible and uneasy beauty and body standards on vulnerable young women. The victims in To Catch a Predator are far harder to feel sorry for, paedophiles who were willing to do something indefensibly grotesque and impossible to empathise with, but the method of catching them remains deeply uncomfortable, cops working hand-in-hand with a TV crew, and the questions it asks about us and why we would want to play witness, are incredibly troubling.In the film, Mark de Rond, an ethnographer, narrates a montage of money shots, when the bad guy is caught, their faces grappling with the reality of a point of no return. “In that moment, time stops,” he says. “What you’re seeing is effectively someone’s life end and they realise it. The goal of the show was to educate people about the evils of the internet, the ‘stranger danger’ folk but it ended up shocking an entire nation.”Predators, which premiered at Sundance earlier this year, is not an easy film to watch and an even harder film to process after. Osit, whose previous documentary Mayor followed the day-to-day of a Palestinian politician dealing with Israeli oppression, managed to get his hands on a staggering amount of footage that takes us beyond the bombastic NBC edit and deeper into the moments we weren’t supposed to see. He found a lot of it via fan communities online and then through a series of Foia (Freedom of Information Act) requests, he found even more, including post-show interrogations with police. Much of it shows the men tearfully begging for help, eager for therapy or something to change (“To show these men as human beings, the show kind of breaks down,” De Rond says).“I remembered the show, and hadn’t watched the show in years,” he tells me over Zoom. “Then I’d watch the raw material and feel abject horror.” The feeling troubled him, as it did me when I watched it, being forced into extreme empathy for someone whose behaviour sickens me. “I remember thinking, wow, I’m having a very mysterious mix of feeling disgust for these men, antipathy for these men, and sadness for these men, depending on which order of raw material I watch first,” he says. “What if I could basically not only give that experience to an audience, but make that what the film’s about?”Alongside the previously unaired footage, Osit speaks to the young actors who played the decoys, many of them now parents themselves. They talk about “how taxing it was emotionally and mentally” to live with what they had been a part of (“There were a few, I wanted to just be like ‘go home,’” one of them says), acting as a key component of a criminal sting operation. He also speaks to Greg Stumbo, a former Kentucky attorney general, who partnered with NBC for three stings. After proudly showing off his official Dateline cap, Osit asks him if he ever wondered about how to fix the broader problem. “That’s not my job to rehabilitate them,” he says before dipping into a very Trump-like contradiction, mentioning these men didn’t have criminal records before the show while also calling them “hardened criminals”.Osit also shows us clips of how the show was received at the time, the bizarre place it held in pop culture. Jimmy Kimmel called it “the funniest comedy on television”, Oprah Winfrey praised Hansen and his “amazing work” while Jon Stewart told him “you should have your own channel of this show”. Hansen cameoed on both 30 Rock and The Simpsons.“We all, I think, have these sorts of calcified senses of what we think is right and what we think is wrong,” Osit tells me. “Regardless of whether you’re liberal or conservative, we can decide some people aren’t worth humanity. We’re seeing that with Gaza and the genocide. We’re seeing that throughout human history and throughout modern history.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: MTVBut it would be difficult to imagine even the most hardened viewer not finding some humanity in what happened next. In 2006, the show’s sting involved Bill Conradt, a Texas district attorney, someone who chose not to turn up to the rigged house for sex. Instead, the makers made the unusual choice of travelling to where he lived and a police ambush resulted in him shooting himself and dying in front of police. Watching it unfold is devastating, an act of recklessness made worse by the callous response of the officers on camera, one of whom is captured making jokes about it soon after. It led to a shift in the conversation, questions being finally asked about the role of the show and the blurry lines between a police investigation and entertainment, as well as a $105m lawsuit. It went away soon after.What’s then most shocking is finding out that Predators isn’t over. That was just the first chapter. Because while To Catch a Predator went away, the format just mutated and made the inevitable move to YouTube with copycats creating even less regulated and even more problematic new versions. “I was surprised at the popularity of the new formats where now you have predator hunter videos and each one gets more views than an episode of Saturday Night Live,” Osit says.Osit follows one in particular, known as Skeet Hansen, modelling himself after his hero as he goes about making his own shoddily assembled, yet grimly popular, rip-off. The videos can be violent and even harder to watch than the ones they’re trying to emulate, a team even less prepared for the challenges they’re faced with. There remains an awkward relationship between the team making it and the police and there was also awkwardness for Osit who suddenly started to question his role in events.“I felt like I wanted to, if nothing else, just make a film that was about how uncomfortable I am with what I do for a living sometimes,” he says. While filming with Skeet, he wanted to be “anywhere but here” and found it difficult to watch the footage he captured. “I’m watching it through the eyes of the person that we’re filming, who is this man whose identity I don’t know, who now hastwocamera crews filming him … Does he know that I’m different? No, I’m just another camera. I’m just another source of his embarrassment … Ultimately, I felt like I was looking in the mirror and I didn’t like what I saw and I felt uncomfortable with that.”After Osit received acclaim for Mayor, he told me he was offered a number of true crime projects. It’s a lucrative subgenre that makes him uneasy and Predators partly grew out of that feeling. In the last act, Osit also gets time with Hansen, who is now making a newer, trashier version of the show, the film somehow getting bleaker with each chapter. Hansen’s final target is an 18-year-old called Hunter, planning to meet a 15-year-old, an age difference that wouldn’t be illegal in certain states. They run with it anyway (“I hope we’re not ruining his life,” one of the producers says, offhand, during lunch) and we get to meet Hunter’s parents in the aftermath, a life ruined just before graduation. “I just don’t know how the worst day of my life could be something that people are getting snacks for,” his mother says.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: MTVHansen is an open and unrepentant interviewee yet Osit found some similarities with him.“He’s seen the film and we’ve talked about it,” he says. “And I think I have to strain a bit to see that there’s not a huge difference between him and I. We both believe in what we’re doing. We both are basically film-makers. We’re both trying to create material out of people’s experiences and people’s lives, trying to propagate the opinions and beliefs and worldviews that we have. The only difference really is that I just believe that what I’m doing is not harming anybody, but he also believes that too, or that there’s some people that it’s OK to harm to get to your goals.”Osit knows that, especially at this particular moment, Predators is not going to change or even simply challenge the minds of many.“There are plenty of people who cannot watch this material with two things in their head,” he said. “There are plenty of people who resort to a binary of this is good or this is bad. And that’s really what the show is trading in as well.” He adds: “In my personal experience, I feel like empathy shouldn’t be offered based on who someone is, it should be offered based on who we are.”Predators is out in US cinemas now and will be released in the UK on 14 November and Australia at a later dateExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about being longlisted again — and the immigration raids creating fear in her New York neighbourhoodSat 20 Sep 2025 04.01 EDTShareNot long after the novelist Kiran Desai published her second book,The Inheritance of Loss, which won the Booker prize in 2006, she began working on her third. The title,The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, came to her quickly, and she knew she wanted to write a “modern-day romance that wasn’t necessarily romantic”, one as much concerned with the forces that keep us apart – class, race, nationality, family history – as those that bind us. Writing the book itself took almost two decades.One problem with devoting so many years to one book is that people worry for your welfare, Desai says with a laugh. “People begin to wonder what’s wrong. Are you really working on something?” One neighbour – who observed how Desai would rise early each morning to write, eat her breakfast and lunch at her desk, take a short break to do her food shop or housework and then write until as late as she could manage in the evenings – attempted an intervention. “You need to come out of your house,” he told her. “You will go crazy writing a book! This is no way to live!” Her 90-year-old uncle observed, with affection, that she was starting to look “like a kind of derelict”, which she acknowledges was true. “It was becoming absurd!” And yet Desai says she loved living this way, in complete service to her writing.At times she sounds mystified by why the writing took so long. The book runs to almost 700 pages, “but then I also have to think there are authors who write books this long several times over. Look at Hilary Mantel or Dickens or Tolstoy.” Perhaps, she muses, “I was just writing this book over and over, and letting it take different forms.” By around 2013 her notes had swelled to 5,000 pages, and she puzzled over which strands she should extract and weave into a story. How far back in time should she travel, and how far forward? How far outwards should she expand from Sonia and Sunny to explore the lives of their friends and relatives?This feels like the big book of my life. I don’t have time to do it againEven when these questions felt unresolvable, she kept working. “It was just a stubbornness that I cannot explain,” she says. “I become very determined and very stubborn and not very nice if I am kept away from my writing.” She feels “lucky” that she was able to work with such intensity, because she does not have to fit her writing around children or family life. In the year or two after her Booker win she felt a sense of pressure, but over time “that self-consciousness fell away”, she says, “and I was just living in a very isolated way and working”. She phones her mother daily and visits her often in upstate New York, and she would see friends a few times a week.But mostly, for decades, she wrote alone at home in New York or on long trips to Mexico.“There have been times in my life when I have been very, very solitary,” she says. So solitary that her social identity appeared to dissolve. “I didn’t think of myself as a person, particularly. I didn’t think of myself as being from somewhere. I didn’t think of myself as a woman, particularly, because I was so alone and what does it mean, without context?”View image in fullscreen‘It’s ordinary life now’ … Kiran Desai.Photograph: Benedict EvansWe meet at her home on a quiet street in Queens, where she migrates daily from her kitchen table to an upstairs desk to catch the best light. Copies of the UK editions of her book have recently been delivered and remain in a box at her front door. Even now, she finds herself thinking: “I really could have done it this way, if I had just taken that out and put it somewhere else … ”Desai was 35 when she won the Booker – making her, at the time, the youngest woman to win – and now she is 54. She is slim, elegantly dressed in a pale pink linen tunic and dark pink trousers, a grey stripe running through her hair, and has a gentle, precise manner of speaking. To finish the book felt “anticlimactic”, she says, “because it’s ordinary life now, after living in a completely artistic world”. She doesn’t quite know what to do with herself.The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, like her previous novel,is an epic, multistranded, sometimes darkly humorous family saga that takes on big political and philosophical themes. Sonia and Sunny are both Indian writers who moved to the US as students and whose paths first cross when Sonia’s family send Sunny a marriage proposal. The proposal goes nowhere, because Sunny is dating an American woman and has no interest in old-fashioned customs. Sonia herself is in thrall to Ilan de Toorjen Foss, a needy, abusive, much older artist.View image in fullscreenDesai celebrates winning the Booker prize in 2006.Photograph: John D Mchugh/AFP/Getty ImagesMany of the “loving” relationships in this novel, whether romantic or familial, are destructive, uneven, constrictive. The characters turn to art as a salve and means of escape from their difficult or disappointing lives, but art is also another source of exploitation. Ilan is a thief and a parasite, who profits from the suffering of others. He, in turn, gives himself entirely over to his art. “If you are a good artist … you give more of your life to art, you begin to subtract your life so it becomes such an emptiness that you dare not look upon it,” he tells Sonia. Does Desai ever feel that way about herself? “I do feel that I made that exchange,” she says. “I don’t regret it but … it did displace my life. Or maybe I just filled it up.”Desai says she has always “lived in her head”, but growing up in Delhi, the youngest of four siblings, she was never alone. Her father worked for an oil company, and her mother was expected to support him, which meant putting on a beautiful silk sari every evening and either hosting or attending a party. Desai speaks with admiration of her mother’s resourcefulness, how she nonetheless found the time and confidence to write, and managed to fill the family bookshelves with hard‑to-find books.Anita Desaiwas nominated for the Booker three times, but the children understood her fame “sort of backwards”, only when their mother’s glamorous foreign-language translators began coming to stay. “It opened up the door to the world and eventually she stepped through it and left, and took me with her,” Desai says. When she was a teenager, her mother was offered a fellowship at Cambridge and Desai, the only child still at home, went to the UK with her.“It was scary to me, because I had never left India,” Desai recalls. She found it “startling” to witness the vast power divide between the two nations, something for which her voracious reading of British children’s classics did not prepare her. “I could not put it together with Paddington Bear and The Wind in the Willows and all kinds of other books I read early on that were so strange,” she says. In the end, the book that best helped her understand her immigrant experience was VS Naipaul’sThe Enigma of Arrival.When fear enters a nation it’s almost the end of itA year after moving to Cambridge, she and her mother emigrated to Amherst, Massachusetts, and Desai enrolled in a US high school. “I have to say that in comparison to India the American system of education seemed so unbelievably easy, you just got smiley faces and encouragement,” she jokes.She went on to Bennington, a liberal arts college in Vermont, where she took her first creative writing class. “I remember just being so happy, the first story I wrote,” she says. It was called Hair Oil, about a man obsessed with his hair; the next was about a snooty civil servant sent to rural India. “Very odd,” she says, laughing. “I don’t know why I was writing those stories.” She also began working on her first book,Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard, which was published in 1998, a satire about a young man who goes to live in a guava tree and is mistaken for a holy man.Shortly after, Desai completed an MFA at Columbia University in New York. She found that one downside to studying creative writing is that when your work is regularly read by a group it “makes you very, very self-conscious – and you need to lose that to be able to write well”. Afterwards she did not join writers’ groups and she wrote The Inheritance of Lossthe “old-fashioned way”, alone, over seven years. Her mother is always her first reader, because she understands instinctively what her daughter is trying to achieve. “She knows the landscape I’m working from, so she understands what I am trying to do, even though it’s not yet on the page,” she says.In Desai’s new novel, Sonia is working on a story that sounds very similar to Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard,and she shows it to Ilan, who tells her to stop writing “orientalist nonsense” and to keep away from magical realism or subjects such as arranged marriages. “He’s uttering something that a lot of people say, and is a legitimate thing to say,” Desai explains. Like Sonia, she has grappled with the question of how India should be represented to a western readership, and she ultimately includes several arranged marriage plots and an element of magical realism in the novel.As Sonia learns, there are no simple answers. In the novel, Sonia changes one of her stories so that the character eats an apple rather than a guava, rendering it less “exotic” to western readers but also less true, because apples are more expensive and less plentiful in India. “Most marriages in India are arranged, that is the truth of the matter. But should you not write about it because of the audience it’s going to be sold to? I think a lot of it comes down to: are you a good or a bad writer?”Desai has been a New Yorker for more than 25 years, but until her father’s death in 2008 she visited India every year. Now that the family home has been sold (her parents were separated after she and her mother moved to the US), she visits less frequently, and she felt this novel might be her last chance to write about India. She wanted to take a snapshot of the country around the turn of the millennium, when Hindu nationalism began rising and dinner party conversations shifted in ways that alarmed Desai. “You would be in the living room with friends and suddenly something else was acceptable,” she remembers. When she visited India last winter, she was struck by the fear expressed by friends from religious minorities. “I did learn the lesson that when fear enters a nation that’s almost the end of it. And I never thought it would happen in the United States as well,” she says, but now she sees similar fear in her multicultural neighbourhood of Jackson Heights. “Underneath the subway tracks, before Trump was elected, it was very lively. People were selling arepas and tacos and skewers of food and religious charms and breads, and actually a lot of women soliciting prostitution,” she says. But now many of these enterprises have been shut down. “People are very scared,” she says, because of immigration raids.View image in fullscreen‘My mother knows the landscape I’m working from – she understands what I am trying to do’ … Desai with her mother, Anita Desai.Photograph: Graziano Arici/eyevineDesai loves living in this diverse community, and at a healthy remove from the New York literary scene. She lives next to families from Ireland and Tibet, and until his recent death she used to often visit her nonagenarian Egyptian neighbour to drink coffee under his fig tree and hear stories of his upbringing in Alexandria – “so I wasn’t entirely solitary”, she concedes. We take a walk along a row of South American restaurants and grocery stores and phone shops and money exchanges until suddenly she stops and says, delighted: “Can you smell that? Curry!” Within one block, the culture of the street has shifted, completely, from South America to the Indian subcontinent. She points out the best kebab shops and we stop to admire the opulent, gem-encrusted, 24-carat gold wedding jewellery. A man hands us each a business card promoting a “World Famous Indian Astrologer” and Desai notices, amused, that as well as reuniting lovers and securing promotions, this man purports to solve the ambiguous “kids mistake” (sic). She shows me the tucked-away Tibetan dumpling shop that Sunny visits in the book, and the bank he frequents.At 4.30pm, her mother phones, as is their tradition. Anita Desai is 88 and has had a few falls recently, and Desai, who of the four siblings lives closest and is her first port of call, was very worried about leaving her mother to go on book tours. She had inadvertently added to her anxiety by reading several books set in old people’s homes, includingMrs Palfrey at the Claremontby Elizabeth Taylor and Elizabeth Strout’sOlive, Again– the latter passed to her by her mother, who said: “You should read this, it’s terrifying!” Despite this, her mother, who is “thrilled” Desai’s novel is finished, has been urging her not to hold back on any travel plans.The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny has already been longlisted for theBooker prize, which Desai says feels like remarkable recognition. “I feel relieved, as if I have averted some nebulous disaster, and very lucky,” she says. She is not yet ready or able to start a new project but already knows that whatever comes next for her, it cannot be quite as ambitious in scope. “I could never do it again, it would not be strategically smart,” she says. “This feels like the big book of my life in that way. I don’t have time to do it again.”The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny by Kiran Desai will be published by Hamish Hamilton on 25 September.

He died on Friday in Glasgow’s Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, his DJ partner Jonnie Wilkes (AKA JG Wilkes)announced.“In a 28 year partnership he changed my life immeasurably and together we took our work in directions and to places few people are lucky enough to explore,” Wilkes said. “I am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend.”McIvor grew up in Edinburgh in a family who “had the most middle of the road, blandest music taste imaginable”, he later said, but after moving to Glasgow to go to university in 1986 he became involved in club culture across both cities.He began DJing electro and EBM (electronic body music) at a club night in Edinburgh, graduating to house and techno as those styles reached the UK and the acid house era began. The night was shut down by police after a brawl between football hooligans, but McIvor began a new night called Pure with the blessing of the authorities by making it a members only event. “It gave us the chance to start again from scratch and do a club 100% on our own terms,” he said. “Out went anything to do with all the awful Madchester-related music and in came a completely different crowd.”Pure became a core event in the Scottish house and techno scene, but McIvor – who grew to find DJ culture “all pretty boring” – began another event in 1997 that gave voice to the breadth of his catholic taste. Taking its name from the track Optimo by New York punk-funk band Liquid Liquid – which McIvor would go on to remix – the Sunday night event at Glasgow’s Sub Club alongside DJ partner JG Wilkes (Jonnie Wilkes) ran every week until 2010.View image in fullscreenJD Twitch and JG Wilkes, AKA Optimo.Photograph: Sam Kovak/AlamyMcIvor said the pair were not “aligned to any one particular musical movement” – championing electroclash, punk, new wave, soft rock and a range of other styles alongside dance tracks, and hosting bands such as LCD Soundsystem and TV On the Radio as well as guest DJs. Optimo pre-empted the open-mindedness of the internet age, and became lauded as one of the most significant events in global dance culture. Thereafter McIvor and Wilkes continued to DJ internationally under the Optimo name.McIvor was also a producer, and as Optimo’s star rose he was sought after as a remixer for the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Róisín Murphy, Manic Street Preachers, Florence + the Machine and more (“Discogs tells me I did 108 remixes, though it’s probably a few more,” he said in 2023). McIvor also founded the label Optimo Music (plus spin-offs such as the Brazil-focused Selva Discos), and Optimo created acclaimed compilation albums such as How to Kill the DJ (Part Two). McIvor also curated the soundtrack to Beats, a 2019 film set in the 90s rave scene inScotland, and put out music under the alias Tomorrow the Rain Will Fall Upwards.McIvor announced his illness in July 2025, saying: “My symptoms weren’t immediately diagnosed, and my health declined very rapidly over just a few weeks … I am currently trying to process this news and prioritising spending precious time with the people I love.”Wilkes added in his tribute to McIvor: “I am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend. Keith’s intensity and passion for life, for music, for creativity and for positive change simply never let up. He was formidable. His belief in people and the idea that standing together, that our collective strength is powerful was unwavering. I loved him for that.”After thanking hospice staff and others, he added: “Keith left us far too soon. He will go now to travel those space-ways but I know his energy remains in every one of us who had the privilege of knowing him. I love you forever Keith.”Explore more on these topicsDance musicClub cultureElectronic musicScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, having been walled up and lain silent for decades, it is being brought back to life through a multimillion-pound investment that will turn it into a landmark site for rock’n’roll, jazz and blues, the Guardian has learned.Much of the original walls, floor tiles and recording equipment have been preserved from a studio that Pete Townshend, The Who’s guitarist and songwriter, once described as “a massive chunk of rock music history”.An archive of memorabilia has been unearthed and historic items will be shown in exhibitions at the site on Denmark Street, nicknamed Tin Pan Alley as a historic hub for music publishers, instrument shops and songwriters since the early 20th century.Exhibits will include T-Bone Walker’s fabled 1949 Gibson guitar – the instrument that kickstarted the music revolution of the 1950s, inspiring countless artists from Chuck Berry and BB King to Keith Richards.The Regent Sounds guitar shop, within the same 18th-century building, has been extended, quadrupling its previous space and offering soundproof booths for the public to try out instruments.While the shop will reopen on Thursday, after an overall investment of almost £6m, work on the studio is yet to begin but is likely to be completed within a year.View image in fullscreenThe guitar shop on Denmark Street in 2011.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesIt was at Regent Sounds where in 1967 the Beatles recorded Fixing a Hole, a key track on Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.Paul McCartney once recalled that a man claiming to be Jesus Christ turned up at the door. “I said: ‘Well, you’d better come in then.’ I thought, well, it probably isn’t. But if he is, I’m not going to be the one to turn him away … So I said: ‘If you promise to be very quiet and just sit in a corner, you can come.’ I introduced him to the guys. They said: ‘Who’s this?’ I said: ‘He’s Jesus Christ.’ We had a bit of a giggle.”The Rolling Stones recorded their first big hit, Not Fade Away, at Regent Sounds. Keith Richards once recalled: “We did our early records on a two-track Revox in a room insulated with egg cartons.”The Kinks, Genesis and the Eagles were among other bands whose sessions there helped to shape the sound of a generation.Patrick Racz, a co-owner of Regent Sounds, said this well-known part of the capital’s musical heritage was “hallowed ground”. “You’re standing in the footsteps of giants,” he said. “This is where Hendrix stood when he recorded. This is where the Rolling Stones were andDavid Bowie.”He is investing in Regent Sounds having made his money as an inventor. He developed the triflow tap to deliver hot, cold and purified water, the world’s first three-way tap, as well as the technology behind the SmartFlash system for secure online downloading, payment and distribution of content.His investment in Regent Sounds includes a collaboration with Nikon, developing technology for authenticating instruments that Racz describes as “revolutionary”. It can scan instruments in unsurpassed detail.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

T-Bone Walker and the Guitar That Started It All. Bacon said he could imagine Regent Sounds becoming a mecca for rock’n’roll fans.“It’s quite a fabulous place,” he said. “Without T-Bone Walker’s genius and virtuosity, it’s unlikely we would have had the proliferation of rock’n’roll from artists like the Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix, whose footsteps make Regent Sounds such sacred ground for music fans.”Racz said: “Typically, on any given day you have at least 30 to 50 groups of people taking their photographs outside the shop. People come from all over the world. It’s like a rite of passage.”Crispin Weir, another co-owner of Regent Sounds, said of the studio: “It was cheap but it had a really good sound. Most studios you had to pay at least three or four times the price.”Recalling that numerous studios closed down when digital recording took off, allowing musicians to record at home for a fraction of the price, Weir said: “Now people like the novelty of being able to go to a studio.”He said Regent Sounds would once again be an analogue studio, using the original equipment used by Hendrix and others – apart from the egg cartons that once lined the ceiling. “You get a certain chemistry playing together that is difficult to get when you record everything individually.”Explore more on these topicsMusicHeritageLondonJimi HendrixThe Rolling StonesDavid BowieThe BeatlesnewsShareReuse this content"

But their escape becomes an increasingly fable-like meander through a pastoral idyll of woods and wheatfields (and bomb craters), punctuated by tragicomic scenes of death.

Instead, it traces their perilous journey through Turkey towards the Syrian border, during which they lose their passport and money, stay in a bus station clerk’s family home, survive a police chase, and hitchhike their way out of the city.View image in fullscreenNadia Fall drew on her past experience of working with young people, including in pupil referral units and mental health settings.Photograph: Courtesy of Neon Films/Rosamont“It’s fictionalised, but we shaped our story according to real life acts,” Fall said. “We shot at the real bus station in Turkey where Shamima Begum and her friends waited. Even the social media stuff about kittens and ‘halal Haribo’ is real.”Fall said she was inspired by “the greatest road movie of all time”, Thelma and Louise, as well as other films about young women such as Never Rarely Sometimes Always. She drew on her past experience of working with young people, including in pupil referral units and mental health settings. The teenage brain, she said, had always fascinated her.“As teenagers, we’re hardwired to take risk and make impulsive decisions. When people say, ‘Why do people make this journey?’, there’s no one size fits all. Our research showed there were so many different reasons.”There is little discussion or analysis of terrorism in Brides. You never actually see the girls in Syria, and the word Isis is never used. For Fall, this was intentional: she wanted to focus on the intensity of adolescent friendships.“It’s a love letter to teenage girls. There’s all sorts of incredible documentaries about Syria. We’ve watched the news, we know exactly what it was like on the other side of that border. For us it wasn’t about that, it was about the journey. What if they could have the freedom that they find on the journey and choose another path?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ‘unite the kingdom’ march was packed. People are being radicalised. They believe these narcissists in power who say: ‘that person is taking things away from you’. It’s divisive, it’s cynical, and it’s horrific.”If Brides makes a plea, it is for empathy. “We go to the gym for our health, we eat well for our health, and similarly, we need to regularly practice the art of empathy. If we do it in communion with strangers at a cinema or a theatre, all the better.”View image in fullscreenEbada Hassan and Safiyya Ingar in Brides.Photograph: Courtesy of Neon Films/RosamontFall herself grew up in Southwark and the Middle East, the daughter of south Asian parents. After training as a director, she became an associate at the National Theatre, then ran Stratford East, formerly known as Theatre Royal Stratford East, before taking over at the Young Vic. This month marks her first full season at the helm, and she is determined to start off bold.The season opens with Fall directing Joe Orton’s cult queer classic Entertaining Mr Sloane. Also on the bill is Rajiv Joseph’s Pulitzer and Tony-nominated Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, directed by Omar Elerian; and Arthur Miller’s rarely performed Broken Glass, revived by Jordan Fein.The latter, written in response to the rise of fascism in Europe, centres on a Jewish woman in 1930s Brooklyn who becomes paralysed after reading about pogroms in Germany. “It asks: when terrible things happen in the world, what do you do? Ignore it, or stare right at it?” Fall said. Other plays explore austerity Britain and systemic injustices in British institutions.View image in fullscreenThe film focuses on the intensity of adolescent friendships – ‘a love letter to teenage girls’.Photograph: Courtesy of Neon Films/RosamontThe director said there was “something mischievous” about the new season, which was important at a time when “everything’s become a bit homogeneous”. She said funding cuts meant theatres were increasingly scared to take risks, “but that’s where the exciting stuff happens.”She added: “It’s tough across the sector. Our buildings are falling apart. We need to pay staff. I wish that our government seemed more interested. Why don’t they extend the tax relief scheme? Why don’t they forgo the Covid loans?”Fall also said that low pay and the rising costs of tickets could result in less diversity across the industry. “Would I celebrate a world where my theatre was packed, but each ticket was £300, which is what’s happening on Broadway? This is where the maths could lead us: theatre as a pastime for the elite.”Explore more on these topicsFilmIslamic StateYoung VicSundance film festivalShamima BegumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The men sway in a circle, singing plaintively. The women surround an elderly lady who smokes tobacco rolled in writing paper. And I settle into swapping stories with the girls. Alina and her younger cousins Miching and Blinka may be draped in the silks and heavy jewellery of the Indigenous Aath Pahariya Rai community, but they’re as keen to talk love and travel as any young women. “I’m too independent to get married until I’m very old,” declares 21-year-old Alina. “When I graduate, I want to go to Paris – and then come home to Sipting. Life’s peaceful here and the air is clear.”View image in fullscreenI’m in the little-visited Dhankuta region of eastern Nepal on a trip hosted byCommunity Homestay Network(CHN). This social enterprise is working with governmental organisations and non-profits such asHuman and Social Development Centre (Husadec)to support women – including Alina’s mother, Prem Maya – to open their homes to travellers. Since launching with just one homestay in Panauti, south-east of Kathmandu, in 2012, CHN has grown to more than 362 families across 40 communities. This is the first in the country’s rural east.View image in fullscreenThe writer stayed with Prem and her daughter AlinaAs rising temperatures, seasonal flooding and erratic monsoons force droves of Dhankuta’s subsistence farmers over the border into India, this remote region is turning to international tourism for the first time. Empowering women to earn without having to leave their villages, and working on sustainable rainwater-harvesting solutions, is central to this vision.While tourism contributed about $2.2bn (£1.64bn) to Nepal’s GDP in 2024, it remains concentrated around Khatmandu, trekking routes such as Everest and the Annapurna Circuit, the second city Pokhara and Chitwan national park. The result is overloaded infrastructure, traffic jams at key viewpoints and the economic benefits of the industry concentrated into just a few hands. Schemes such as CHN hope to spread the tourist dollar and offer visitors a memorable experience away from the crowds.View image in fullscreenThe orange-painted buildings of DhankutaAfter a 40-minute flight from Kathmandu and a two-hour-plus bus journey along a road that winds upwards like a series of sickle moons, our first stop is the town of Dhankuta. It served as the region’s administrative hub until the 1960s, when it sank into a slumber. At first, it appears the government’s new tourism policy might not have registered with local residents. As I wander past the orange-painted buildings, the sewing machine in a tailor’s shop stills as its owner looks up at me in astonishment; a shopper wearing a shirt emblazoned with the words “Mama’s little man” drops his bags to stare; and a woman freezes in her doorway, oblivious to the dal dripping from the wooden spoon she’s holding.“In the last few decades this neighbourhood was so empty that jackals roamed the streets,” explains our guide, Kalpana Bhattarai. “Locals painted it to celebrate their history as orange growers before climate change – and in the hope of appealing to visitors. It seems they’re a little surprised to see it actually working.” She flashes a winning smile, and they all beam back.View image in fullscreenA view on the hike through the hill forest to KhambelaBringing as many local people as possible into the tourism supply chain is central to CHN’s ethos, which is why it also runs programmes to train youngsters as guides. After a night in the comfortableHotel Murchunga Internationalin Dhankuta we meet one of the programme’s first two graduates, Nabin Rai of the Aath Pahariya Rai community. This morning, he’ll be leading the 7½-mile forest hike to his home village of Khambela for the first time and, given my incessant questions, I suspect this is a baptism of fire.‘When I come to the forest, it feels like my own house,’ Nabin Rai says, leading the wayAs we walk, he talks about his life as the only young man remaining in the village – staying behind partly to care for his disabled father and partly out of love for this place. “When I come to the forest, it feels like my own house,” he says, leading the way along a path studded with silver silica particles that gleam like the Tamor River below. “You can feel the gods here.”As we enter Khambela through trees woven with jasmine, Nabin points out the rainwater storage tanks installed by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), which help to supplement the unreliable supply from the government pipeline two hours away by foot.View image in fullscreenOne of the village elders in KhambelaThe hike ends with vegetable curry in a courtyard owned by a woman in her 60s who tells us to call herDidi(big sister), and observes our fascination with her home with quiet amusement. As we prepare to leave, she presses a veena into my hand: a hand-carved instrument that hums grudgingly when I blow through it and tug its string with clumsy enthusiasm.After another night at our hotel, we wander round Dhankuta’shaat(bazaar), where Rais, Magars, Limbus and people from several Hindu castes haggle for everything from buffalo-skin stools to cucumbers as fat as a child’s leg. Then we take the bus to Sipting to meet the Aath Pahariya Rai family, our hosts for the next few days.Prem leads the way up a dirt staircase hewn from the mountain to her home, the highest in the village. From its squat toilet to three bedrooms haunted by a kitten called Nimki, it’s impeccably clean and has arresting views over the valley’s forested floor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A towel folded in the shape of a butterfly and the light left on – a gesture that always reminds me of my parents – suggest that this couldn’t be more true.Over the next few days, I adjust to the rhythms of life in Prem’s house: the scent of cow dung and woodsmoke as I learn to fold large leaves that will be used as dishes; the way the valley appears almost flat beneath the midday heat, and becomes soft and deep in the afternoons; Alina recalling that when she was little and her father, Ram, carried her to bed, she fancied the stars were walking with them.“I can’t read or write beyond my name and have never earned my own money before. Now I’m a businesswoman,” says Prem, watching with approval as I demolish a millet pancake bursting with potato curry.The road winds through rhododendron forests and  villages where I sense that we are the first westerners local people have ever seenBy day, Kalpana leads us on intriguing outings. At Dhoje Dada, we climb through a mogul cemetery in a cloud that echoes with the calls of cuckoos, only for it to clear in rapid, smoke-like wisps to reveal the sunrise. As darkness swallows the mountains at Kachide, we harvest sour tree tomatoes and learn local recipes from a woman who is using the income to fund her daughters’ university educations.The road winds through dripping rhododendron forests and mountain villages where I sense that we are the first westerners local people have ever seen.Himalayan highs … and lows: trekking in NepalRead moreAt Cholung Park, most visitors seem more interested in watching me receive a blessing from a Mundhum samba (a figure in charge of rituals for the Limbu people, who flicks a leaf on to my throat that clings like a damp butterfly’s wing) than browsing the museum’s collection of sacred Limbu artefacts. Given the queues that now form at the peak of Everest and on Annapurna’s trails, getting such an unfiltered glimpse of Nepali life feels like an enormous privilege.For my final breakfast in Sipting, Ram watches through the window while Alina and Prem fill my pockets with freshly picked passion fruit and tuck a sprig of mugwort behind my ear to ward off evil spirits on the road to Janakpur. Prem patiently attempts to braid alacha dori(a colourful thread adorned with beads) of Alina’s into my slippery bob. “We’re so sad to see you leave,” she says. “Come back whenever you like – this is your home now.”The trip was provided byCommunity Homestay Network;itseight-dayEastern Nepal: The Road Less Takenadventure blends nature,Indigenous culture, homestays and hikesand costs US$2,359 for a single traveller, $2,657 for two or $3,597 for a group of four, including a local guide, ground transport, accommodation and most meals.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.‘Kor-nee-CHO-nay,” my friend Matt Comley exclaims, and repeats several times as he pads out some pizza dough with his fingers and palm to make what is known in Naples as thecornicione. That is, the perfect puffy outer edge of a pizza.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Matt is the co-founder ofSchool of Dough, a wonderful initiative that teaches children in some of Cornwall’s least prosperous communities how to cook; he also runs a stall calledSalt Yard Pizzaat the Boathouse on Newquay harbour. His pizza is some of the best in the country, not just because he’s mastered traditional techniques, but because he grows his own tomatoes and basil, and even rears his ownmangalitzapigs to turn into charcuterie.I love making pizza in my portable pizza oven, but it does involve a fair amount of work, from the preparation of the dough to the pressure of cooking several pizzas in quick succession. Even so, I can’t remember the last time I bought a supermarket pizza, and my only real memories of them are of those ultra-processed cardboard discs from the 1980s. Sadly, as a result of this tasting, I’ve discovered that those still exist (I don’t know what that says about British food culture), but I’m also happy to report that there are now some genuinely delicious options out there, too, with a few real standouts of near restaurant quality.I focused on lower- to mid-range margheritas, and excluded premium pizzas that stray from the classic bread-tomato-cheese formula by adding extras such as sun-blushed tomatoes. To test each product fairly, I cooked each pizza according to the manufacturer’s instructions, then tasted it with my family. The worst examples felt like 80s industrial “food” throwbacks, all bland and joyless, save for the hit of salt, sugar and fat.For such a processed-looking product, however, most supermarket margheritas actually contain relatively few ultra-processed ingredients. The main recurring additives were calcium carbonate (a flour improver and calcium fortifier) and niacin (vitamin B3), both of which are harmless in small amounts and are more often found in the lowest-quality pizzas with dense, flavourless bases. Ultra-processed foods, however, aren’t defined purely by additives. According to theNova classification, which links levels of food processing with health outcomes, ready-to-eat convenience foods such as pizza still sit firmly in the ultra-processed category.Although the best pizzas I tried were made with better, more chewy dough, really good cheese and plenty of well-balanced tomato sauce, it’s worth remembering that even the most basic oven pizza can be transformed with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt, a sprinkle of dried herbs and a few choice fresh toppings.The best supermarket margherita pizzasBest all-rounder:Doughboys classic margherita pizzaView image in fullscreen£4.95 for 340g at Ocado (£1.46/100g)★★★★☆A large, classic Italian-style pizza with a nicely puffedcornicione(crust) and just the right amount of cheese. The delicious base is topped with a balanced tomato sauce that’s sweet and acidic. The texture isreallygood, and very close to fresh pizza. Hand-stretched and stone baked in Italy, made with 100% Emilia Romagna tomato pulp. This independent British brand creates professional-standard pizzas with minimal processing. Disappointingly little information online about their sustainability practices, however.Best bargain:Tesco Finest margherita wood-fired pizzaView image in fullscreen£4.75 for 410g at Tesco (£1.16/100g)★★★☆☆A really nice-looking, Neapolitan-style pizza with a puffy crust, balls of mozzarella and fresh basil. The mix of cheese gives this a satisfying, gooey, varied topping, and the basil is wonderful. Slightly disappointing texture to the dough, though, especially considering how good it looks before baking; a higher baking temperature might improve this. Contains niacin, among other additives, but very good value.And the rest …Crosta Mollica margherita pizzaView image in fullscreen£5.75 for 403g a Tesco (£1.43/100g)£6 for 403g at Waitrose (£1.49/100g)★★★★☆In my top three, made on sourdough with a neat, slightly puffed crust. The traditional tomato sauce and mozzarella with PDO parmesan bring great flavour. It didn’t quite make best all-rounder, though, because it could really do with a touch more cheese.Picard margherita pizzaView image in fullscreen£5.25 for 420g at Ocado (£1.25/100g)★★★★☆My daughter’s favourite, and a close second for best all-rounder. An interesting style with mostly precooked grated cheese, plus some mozzarella balls. Thin, crunchy crust with a lovely, generous amount of tomato sauce that packs heaps of flavour. One of the saltiest and fattiest, which is probably why it’s one of the tastiest.Goodfella’s margherita stone baked thinView image in fullscreen£2.88 for 334g at Asda (86p/100g)£3 for 334g at Tesco (90p/100g)★★☆☆☆skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Thanks to this pizza, you can have both. This recipe is written in memory of the beloved pizza of my youth:​ a vegetarian delight ​t​hat I ate on the regular with my cousins​ at one of the many Indian-Italian restaurants on Leicester’s Belgrave Road (AKA the Golden Mile) circa 1990, right before washing it down withRubicon mango juiceand doing handbrake turns in a nearby car park.Golden mile pizzaThis recipe was published in my book,Dinner, last year.​ The dough comes together in ​f​ive minutes in a food processor and proves overnight in the fridge. You’ll need to start the day before, but it can be kept in the fridge for up to four days. You’ll need two large containers or bowls to prove the dough​ in, a 30​cm x 40cm tray ​for the pizza, and some chaat masala, which you can ​g​et from any Indian supermarket​ or online.Prep15 minRest/prove1 day +Cook40 minMakes2 large pizzas, to feed 4For the dough3 tbsp rapeseed oil, plus extra for greasing750g strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting1 tbsp caster sugar2 tspfine salt7g (2 tsp) instant yeastFor the sauce1 tbsp rapeseed oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed400g tinchopped tomatoes½ tsp kashmiri chilli powder2 tbsp tomato ketchup½ tsp fine sea saltFor the toppings200ggrated mozzarella300g cherry tomatoes, halved100g sweetcorn kernels, fresh or frozen and defrosted1 green pepper, stalk, pith and seeds discarded, flesh cut into 1cm-thick slices (100g net)½ large red onion(100g), peeled and cut into ¾cm-thick slices2125g ballsfresh mozzarella, drained and tornFor the chaat masala oil2 green finger chillies, very finely chopped1 tbsp chaat masala4 tbsp rapeseed oilGrease the two tubs or bowls that you’re going to use to store the dough in the fridge. In a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar, salt and yeast a few times, until well mixed. Add the rapeseed oil and 500ml lukewarm water, pulse again until the dough comes together into a ball, then continue to mix for another 20 seconds.Pop the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead for five minutes, until you have a smooth ball. Divide the dough in two, roll into balls and pop one in each greased container. Cover with a lid or clingfilm, then chill in the fridge for at least a day, and up to four.To make the tomato sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan on a medium heat. When it’s hot, add the garlic and sweat, stirring, for up to a minute, until it turns sticky. Add the tomatoes and kashmiri chilli, leave to bubble away for 10 minutes, then stir in the ketchup and salt, and take off the heat.On the day you want to make your pizzas, take the dough out of the fridge at least an hour before baking. Fifteen minutes before you want to cook them, heat the oven to its hottest setting – ideally about 280C (260C fan)/535F/gas 10 – and move an oven rack to the centre of the oven. Have ready all the toppings in front of you in small bowls. In another small bowl, mix the finely chopped chillies, chaat masala and oil.Grease two oven trays and your hands with oil. Gently push and stretch one ball of dough into one tray, until it’s an even thickness and reaches right into the corners; be careful not to push out all the air bubbles in the dough, especially at the edges.Spoon half the tomato sauce on to the pizza base and spread it out evenly with the back of a large spoon. Scatter half the toppings over the top, starting with the grated mozzarella, then the cherry tomatoes, followed by the sweetcorn, green pepper, onion and, finally, the torn fresh mozzarella. Bake for 15 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and browning, then remove and drizzle the chaat masala chilli oil over the top. Slice into eight wedges and tuck in. Repeat with the remaining pizza dough and toppings.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodIndian food and drinkItalian food and drinkPizzarecipesShareReuse this content"
