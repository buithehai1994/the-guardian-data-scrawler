Thoughts and prayers welcome. The Tory party leader just can’t help herself. Every time you think that, just maybe, she is beginning to get the hang of the job, she comes up with something so deranged, so batshit that you can only sit back and admire the self-destruction. Almost as if she can’t bear any idea of success. Bewilderingly, sabotaging herself seems to be her default coping mechanism. Someone who can only find satisfaction in annihilating her own party. Sometimes you even wonder if she has ever been a Tory.Like so much of Kemi’s behaviour, this was all totally avoidable. There was no need for her to do or say anything. With Keir Starmer away in China, this was a week off for her from prime minister’s questions. A slot she would delegate to the even more useless Andrew Griffith. Clearly Badenoch does not welcome any competition so Griffith might get the deputy leader job for good.But Kemi wanted, no, needed attention. Couldn’t let a day go by without some me time on TV. So she couldn’t resist the opportunity to give a speech on the future prospects of the Conservative party. The good news would be that it was understandably short.Her basic message was that there was no future. No hope. Weirdly the 40 or so Tory MPs in the room – they would, wouldn’t they? – and the 150 or so party activists loved being told they were effectively irrelevant. They could just have been the last Tories in the country. Certainly the last of Kemi’s Tories. Better to die now than face a thousand deaths.This was a rejection of the one nation, centre-right Tories. They were toast. They could all sod off. Pinko lefties. The only people who were welcome in the party were people who were as hostile to immigration as Kemi. It was, by any standards, insane. It might have made some sense if Kemi were polling well. Then you could make a case for expelling all moderates. But she isn’t. She has taken the Tories from the high 20s to the mid-teens. Kemi won’t be happy until she has completely destroyed her party’s credibility.We need an end to the psychodrama. PSYCHODRAMA had been spelled out in capitals in the advance briefing. Clearly, one that had been written by a keen student of Donald Trump’s media team. Enough was enough. Starmer was in his own leadership crisis, Reform were just doing stunts to distract from the brilliance of the Tories.Only Kemi was showing the country a way forward. Except she really wasn’t. The Tories are implicated in the psychodrama of British politics every bit as much as the others. She claimed many MPs were only interested in their egos. Desperate for attention. Kemi is not blessed with much personal insight. Half the Tories are on defection watch to Reform. And after today, the other half will be on defection watch to the Lib Dems. It was hard to take anything she said seriously.The Torieswere on a relentless march to the right, Kemi insisted. Anyone who didn’t like the direction of travel could fuck off now. It was her way or the highway. She alone dictated policy. Shadow ministers such as Chris Philp and Mel Stride were just her useful idiots. She got that bit right, I suppose.In the trail, it had been promised Kemi would say that every day she had been leader of the opposition, the Tories had lurched further to the right. She had meant that as a promise. Dreams can come true. No matter that most people would take this as a threat. If she keeps this up, who knows where the Tories might end up in two or three months. How much further right can they go? At what point does Kemi get a call from Viktor Orbán and Donald Trump saying she has really gone too far this time?There would be no return to the Tory party of 2006. It’s a view. Though the Tory party of 2006 had just about recovered its reputation after 10 years in opposition and was ahead in the polls. But who wants that kind of success? Winning elections is for losers. Now she took aim at Andy Street and Ruth Davidson who had launched their centre-right movement, Prosper UK, on Monday. They could sod off. There was no place for sedition in Kemi’s Tories. Any criticism of Brexit was punishable by the death penalty.“The Tory party looks like Mark Francois,” she said. Francois blushed even more than usual. Either out of pleasure or guilt. He’s been widely tipped to join Reform. “The economy looks like Mel Stride.” Really? Surely now was not the time to put a downer on proceedings. Everyone knows that Mel is a decent enough bloke but a halfwit as shadow chancellor. I wouldn’t trust him with his own finances, let alone the country’s.There was no sense of repentance. No sign of shame. Yes, the Tories had made one or two minor mistakes, but not anything to worry about. They might have nearly broken Britain but had left the country on life support. So rather than harassing the Tories over their record in government, people should start to show a little gratitude. Labour and Reform were parties of the extreme left. How she could say this with a straight face was beyond most people in the room. Only the Tories could be trusted to go far further to the right than the rest of the country. Onwards and downwards. Defeat is victory.There was just time for a few questions from almost exclusively rightwing media outlets. “We are a united party,” Kemi repeated, having just told roughly half her MPs they were no longer welcome. She couldn’t even bring herself to totally denounceMatt Goodwin’s views on race. A bit of racism is now allowed. What the country wants. Come the end, 20 or so Tory MPs – mainly men – posed awkwardly for photos. How many of them would be in the party in three months’ time was unclear.Still, it was all a lot more entertaining than deputy PMQs. Having messed up so badly last time, David Lammy decided to try not answering the questions and instead just reading out rehearsed gags. Though even this was far too much for Griffith. He had nothing to offer and gave Labour their biggest laugh for weeks. And the way things have been going lately, they dearly needed it.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

So he and some friends reclaimed this statistic – which they thought was ludicrous – as an identity. “We became the 1 in 12 Club,” he says.Initially it was a nomadic club, putting on gigs and leftwing political meetings in the upstairs rooms of pubs. Unemployed people could see bands such as New Model Army cheaply, form camaraderie and support the club’s anarchist principles of self-management, co-operation and mutual aid. The club was built around the words liberty, equality and solidarity, and 45 years on, they remain painted on a mural on the building it has called home since 1988 – a space that took two years of voluntary work to convert.You’d have sweaty black water dripping on you on stage –  but the atmosphere was great!Alice Nutter, ChumbawambaAs part ofBradford’s year as the 2025 UK City of Culture, and in collaboration with cultural history organisation Home of Metal, a new book and three-part podcast tell 1 in 12’s story, with contributions from members and bands including Lankum, Chumbawamba, Therapy? and Neurosis. “Some gigs were so hot and ridiculous, with eight of us on that tiny stage,” Chumbawamba’s Alice Nutter tells me. “You’d have sweaty black water dripping on you but the atmosphere was great.”View image in fullscreen‘A place where there is always someone to have a pint with’  … inside the 1 in 12.Photograph: Ila Desai/Courtesy the 1 in 12E, a trustee, has been coming to the club for the last 15 years, since he was a young teen. “I’d never seen a space like this before,” he recalls of his first visit. “I remember a bunch of teenagers – along with punks, hippies, all sorts – all spilling outside into the street. I’m from a Traveller background but nobody looked at you wrong or assumed anything about you. It quickly became a home from home and I wanted to put back into a place that had always given me a space.”Over its three floors – each plastered with leftist stickers and posters – it has a cafe, members’ bar, games room and extensive library. Its 90-capacity gig room has welcomed countless shows and booming raves, with everyone from Pulp to Bikini Kill playing there over the years.1 in 12 battled enemies in the early days when the National Front was prominent. “We were always fighting fascists,” says Cavanagh. “We were threatened but we always took on those people.” Politics are not forced on people at the club, however. “We aren’t a summer school for Marxists,” Cavanagh adds. “We’re not browbeating people with political dogma. We just encourage people to think for themselves.” E says that “not everyone here would define themselves as an anarchist”, and he would simply describe it as “an intersectional or leftist space – just somewhere you can go to be yourself”.We aren’t a summer school for Marxists. We just encourage people to think for themselvesGary Cavanagh, co-founding memberInclusivity and egalitarianism are key to the club’s ethos but it has also responded playfully to outsiders. When the Canadian post-hardcore band Fucked Up arrived to play at the club in 2008 with the NME in tow, members came out with a giant cardboard box structure of a Trojan horse that had “NME Out of Our Scene” written on it. They then smashed it to bits.View image in fullscreen‘There would be punks, hippies, all sorts – all spilling outside into the street.’Photograph: Sherman Rabbit1 in 12 is entirely independent and volunteer-led, with the income from the bar – along with the odd grant – keeping the wheels in motion, and it has numerous collectives within it. “It’s always been more than a venue,” says Nutter, who as well as having been in Chumbawamba is alsoa TV writer and playwright. “I’ve been part of reading groups there, the peasant collective [which provides free communal meals with food from the club’s allotments] and my partner used to play on the football team. The bar is great too – it’s a place where there is always someone to have a pint with who isn’t a wanker.”‘We never had much fun – we were angry’: Eve Libertine on life with anarcho-punk pioneers CrassRead moreNutter’s first play was performed there. “There was always an opportunity to use the space,” she says. “If you have the creativity, they will facilitate it. No one said no. If you were willing to put the work in, you could use the building – they would give you the keys.” She soon understood how much of a “special place” it was as her writing career evolved into traditional theatres: “I realised it costs thousands to put a play on. The first one we did, everyone did it for nowt.”Despite the celebratory milestone, book and podcast, it has also been a sad time, as the club recently lost “vital” and “instrumental” founding member, Tony Grogan. Cavanagh, the sole remaining founder, is still going and attending gigs, and his daughter is now a member. “Part of the longevity is that there’s still a need for us,” he says, as the St George’s flag-waving far right becomes emboldened once more in the city. “It upsets me that we’re still fighting the same battles, but we’ve got a strong cultural resistance in Bradford and we’re part of that. Liberty, equality, solidarity. That’s what we started with and that’s what we’re still trying to do.”The 1 in 12 Club book and podcast series are out now viaHome of MetalExplore more on these topicsMusicPunkExperimental musicBradfordWest YorkshireYorkshireUK city of culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Is your wardrobe cringe? Does it make you look out-of-touch and cause younger and cooler people to look upon you with pity? Do you really want me to answer that? Never mind, I’m going to anyway, so buckle up. Brutal honesty is very January, so I will give it to you straight. But before we get down to dissecting your wardrobe, two quick questions for you. Do you put full stops in text messages? Were you baffled byLabubus? If the answer to those two questions is yes, then I’m afraid the signs are that your wardrobe is almost certainly cringe.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Being cringe is essentially being old-fashioned, but worse. Being old-fashioned is what happens when you grow older with grace and dignity. Cringe is when you lose your touch while convincing yourself you are still down with the kids.What does a cringe wardrobe look like? French-tucking your shirt, the height of sophistication a decade ago, is now cringe. A crossbody bag, which seemed such a novel and youthful thing not long ago, is now on the wrong side of the generational divide.If your leather jacket looks like one the controller of your local minicab office used to wear, you are on the right trackAnd then there is wearing your clothes too tight. Do I hear a sigh of relief at the back? Not me, you’re thinking, my clothes aren’t too tight at all, they fit like a glove! Well, I hate to break it to you, but the glove-analogy is exactly the problem here. If you are generation X, then you probably think that the size that fits you best is the smallest one you can get into easily. But if you are generation Z, then you think that the size that fits you best is one that hangs off you. There is no real reason why the younger generation should have the last say here, except that is how pop culture works and we didn’t complain about it when we were young and cool, did we, so we can’t start making a fuss about it now. The fact is that fitted clothes are ageing. Also: sorry to be disloyal to my peers, but trousers or jeans that grip the knee actually make me feel a bit ill.The cringe factor of close-fitting clothes is not just about the size in the label, it is about what styles you wear. Leggings, for example, are no longer fashionable streetwear. If you want something you can wear to the gym that looks cool out in the wild, then switch to a tracksuit bottom or a flared workout pant. And while I’ve got you, a word about leather jackets. Leather jackets are a major trend this winter. But if I say the words “leather jacket”, what springs to mind? Because your leather jacket needs to be big and blowsy. If it looks like the jacket the controller of your local minicab office used to wear in the days before Ubers, then you are on the right track. But if it is a close-fitting biker style, it will do your cred more harm than good.View image in fullscreenKendall Jenner models sturdy socks.Photograph: Gotham/GC ImagesJess Cartner-Morley on fashion: like a superhero cloak, a white shirt gives you formidable powerRead moreNext up, ankles are cringe. For some reason, gen Z are positively Victorian in their horror of ankles. Trainer socks have been deemed a fashion crime, and ankles should be concealed under a sturdy sock. Your ankles will also be covered by your trousers, since the correct length is no longer a hem at the ankle bone, which is the silhouette many of us are accustomed to. Long enough to pool on the top of your shoe is what looks right now, according to the whippersnappers. This is a challenge for us oldies to get our heads around. I don’t want the bottom inch of my trousers dragging on the pavement – so unhygienic, since you’ll be wearing them in your home, and also it bothers me that the fabric will fray and wear out, but apparently that just shows my age.I am cringe. I have made my peace with this. Being cringe is the price that millennials and generation X pay for refusing to accept they are getting older. Like many of my contemporaries, I am enjoyably deluded about my age. I am convinced I’m still young – in the right lighting – and have no intention of being disabused of this belief. So I invite you to consider this a wake-up nudge. The kids will keep reinventing fashion, and we’ll keep embarrassing ourselves trying to keep up. But if being called cringe is the cost of feeling alive, I call that a bargain.Model: Orla at Milk. Styling assistant: Charlotte Gornall.

But for a country shaped by booze, it does pose questions about what comes nextWed 28 Jan 2026 10.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 13.35 ESTShareIt’s November 2024 and my puritanical American children are attending their first autumn fair at their new English primary school. There’s a laser show and hotdogs and a raffle. There’s also a bar for the parents, which makes my two pull up short. Newcomers to this country experience many cultural differences but perhaps none as striking as this: “Is that alcohol?” says my child, scowling up at me like a tiny member of the Taliban. “At a school thing?” I’m two Baileys hot chocolates in at this point and give her a smile 10% broader than necessary. Yes, my darlings; welcome to Britain.Or at least, welcome, possibly, to the last vestiges of how Britain once was. For a while now we’ve known anecdotally that people in this country are drinking less than they were. My own generation X is deep into middle age and many of us – save for the odd life-saver at a school event and the biggest occasions – have given it up. Where the anomalies fall more glaringly is in the generations below us, among young people whose behaviour differs from our own at their age. This week, official confirmation came in the form of a survey of 10,000 people commissioned by the NHS that found almost a quarter (24%) of adults in England hadnot drunk alcoholin 2024, an increase from just under a fifth (19%) in 2022.The top line, of course, is that this is a good thing. Not for the drinks industry, obviously, but for theNHS, and also for people trying to maximise their life expectancy, which is all of us. Rigorous self-optimisation via application to the data is how we spend our leisure time these days, on the strength of which, after reading a piece about cancer-reducing foods this morning, I bought a “wheatberry, lentil and green vegetable salad” that I’m almost certainly not going to eat. What even is a wheatberry? Nobody knows. The point is we’re trying.If I sound sarcastic, I don’t mean to. I love not drinking. And it’s important not to join the ranks of those people in the generation above mine who, in the 1990s, whensmoking banstook hold across the US, wrote long pieces arguing that cigarettes represented the buccaneer spirit of the country and, as a result, smokers were more interesting than people who drank “green juice”. These were, objectively, the worst people in the world and, while no one likes a teetotaller, it’s important to resist turning into them.My interest is more in what youth culture will look like without alcohol. The new survey results, which were commissioned as part of the Health Survey for England, found that women are slightly less likely to drink than men and that across the age groups young people are the most abstemious. In the2022 NHS survey, gen Z reportedly contained the lowest proportion of people who drank frequently (10%), compared with 34% among 55 to 64-year-olds and 37% of 65 to 74-year-olds. Some of this is cost-of-living related, but most of it is likely to be cultural. It’s just not cool to be wasted.Why are saunas suddenly everywhere? I think it’s to do with booze | Zoe WilliamsRead moreIn my own case, the calculation to cut back had less to do with cultural trends and more to do with the sudden, sad collapse of my metabolism, plus the fact I changed primary-care physicians. During the intake interview a few years ago, my new doctor made a note of what everyone in my family going back three generations had died of, before giving me a very stern look. “If I were you I wouldn’t drink,” she said. “At all.” This was harsh, but she was right.And yet, still my imagination falters. I look at my two and wonder what, when they’re 25, a Saturday night out will look like if it doesn’t terminate in them lying half off the sofa crying to Elaine Paige doing the big ballad from Chess. Where will their war stories come from? (Actual war, probably, but let’s not think about that.) What will they reminisce about when they are my age?There’s nothing funny about my friend who threw up into a heating vent and, for the rest of her tenancy, couldn’t expunge the smell of sick from her flat. Standing, swaying gently, in the middle of a busy A-road trying to work out a strategy for getting to the other side that didn’t involve putting one foot in front of the other isn’t funny, either. I told my children this story and they were horrified. “You could’ve DIED,” they said, which was precisely the teachable moment I was after.Meanwhile, the new findings aren’t anything to grow complacent about, since, even with these reduced numbers, we’re still sufficiently a nation of alcoholics to cost the NHS in England£4.9bn a yearin alcohol-related illness. In the spirit of which: I’m actually quite looking forward to eating my salad. I’m going to put an egg in it because, while not drinking is extremely good for you, as everyone knows it’s actually protein that will save us.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAlcoholOpinionNHSHealthYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

That wasn’t the case for John Bishop, anyway. He took up comedy to avoid paying a bar’s cover charge and to escape his failing marriage – a story that inspired Bradley Cooper’s new film,Is This Thing On?And Bishop is not the only comic with an unusual origin story. From impressing girlfriends to losing their voices, brain tumours to bad bosses – or not wanting to lose a £5 bet – British comics told us the reasons they became standup comedians and the lengths to which they went to get on stage for the first time.Aarian Mehrabani: ‘Facing surgery for a brain tumour, I wanted to be remembered for my work’View image in fullscreen‘I decided I’d go into standup as soon as I came out of hospital’ … Aarian Mehrabani performs It’s a Motherf**king Pleasure by FlawBored during A Bit of a Do Festival, produced by Drunken Chorus.Photograph: Paul FullerThe first time I had an inkling I wanted to be a standup was at 14, in the school canteen, when my friend Tom and I were talking about what we thought we’d be when we grew up. Entirely out of the blue, he said: “You would make a good standup comedian.” It stuck with me.After I graduated from drama school in 2020, I formed a disabled-led theatre company called FlawBored with Sam Brewer and Chloe Palmer. We wrote and performed our debut theatre show,It’s a Motherf**king Pleasure, a multi-award-winning, scathing satire on the monetisation of identity politics. The show was a hit: in 2023, it won the Untapped award at the Edinburgh fringe and went on to tour the UK and internationally.Then, in 2024, my life completely changed. At the start of the year, we took our show to New York for a three-week off-Broadway run. Four days after we got back, I became very ill. I was bed-bound, throwing up three or four times a day. Long story short, it turned out I had brain cancer.The doctors said the tumour was 8cm and there was a very high chance I wouldn’t survive. I was meant to have one brain operation; I ended up having five in five days. Before the surgery, the only thing I cared about was my legacy. I wanted to be remembered for my work. My theatre show was a success, but was that enough? Had I made enough of an impact? Had I said what I wanted to say? I decided, right then: “As soon as I get out of hospital, as soon as I’m able to, I’m going into standup comedy!” That will mean, whether I live or die, that I will have done something that is just me, that I’ve given my all to, that somebody might remember.Obviously, I didn’t die. After surgery, I had six weeks of daily proton beam therapy, followed by six months of chemotherapy. By October 2024, before my treatment was due to finish, I received a development commission from the Lowry theatre. I was going to make my first standup show, which would premiere at the Edinburgh fringe in 2026.A month later, I did my first gig in between my chemo sessions in London. It was bringer night – when comedy promoters ask you to bring someone, helping to create a cheap and easy audience – and my friends Hannah and Jim came along for support. Before I went on, I had never been more scared of anything in my life. I’d done big theatre stages and major auditions, but I felt these sudden nerves for only 50 people in the back of a pub.I went on stage utterly terrified. Then I got my first laugh, and suddenly I was loving every moment. I sat down afterwards and thought: This is what I am meant to do. I love this. I love this feeling. At the end of the show, they do a “clap off” of the funniest comic – whoever gets the biggest clap wins. I got the biggest clap and received a mini plastic trophy. I left that gig thinking it was the best feeling ever. Since then, I have been on a high with comedy, even when I have shit gigs. Oh, and I’ve finished my treatment. My prognosis is good, so Edinburgh fringe, here I come.Lee Ridley, AKA Lost Voice Guy: ‘A friend made me believe I could be funny even though I can’t speak’View image in fullscreen‘I genuinely didn’t know how people would react to a bloke with an iPad on stage’ … Lee Ridley.Photograph: Steve UllathorneStandup comedy didn’t feel like an option, so it never really occurred to me to try. Then a friend suggested I give it a go. He basically said: “You’re funny, you should try standup,” as if the fact that I literally couldn’t speak was a minor technical detail. From my point of view, standup comedy was built around quick talking and crowd interaction – things I assumed automatically ruled me out. He didn’t argue with me. He just planted the idea and left it there, which somehow made it harder to dismiss. What stuck with me wasn’t anything profound he had said, but the fact that he didn’t treat my disability as the main issue. He talked about comedy as if it were something I might enjoy, not something I should be protected from.My first gig was in Sunderland. I was very nervous beforehand because I didn’t know how it would go. I type the material into my iPad before a show, then play it on stage through the automated voice. I was worried people wouldn’t understand me, and I’d be standing there telling jokes to myself via an iPad. But once my first few jokes were out of the way, I began to relax and enjoy myself. By the time I walked off stage, I didn’t want it to end. I was on a massive high for the rest of the night. I didn’t get any sleep because I was still so excited. I couldn’t wait to get up on stage again.I genuinely didn’t know how people would react to a bloke with an iPad on stage, and that uncertainty shaped my approach from the beginning. I decided the best thing was to acknowledge the awkwardness immediately and take control of it, rather than let it hang in the room. That’s where the name Lost Voice Guy came from. The fact that I had to write and program every word in advance didn’t feel like a limitation; it felt like my version of the job.For most of my life, I’ve been spoken for, spoken about or spoken over. Being on stage flips that completely. Suddenly, I’m the one setting the pace, deciding when the room goes quiet and when it erupts. That sense of being truly listened to is something I don’t take for granted. In a very real way, standup gave me a voice for the first time.Amanda Hursy: ‘I did it to prove my boss wrong’View image in fullscreen‘As a working-class person, sometimes humour is the only thing you can trade on’ …  Amanda Hursy on stage at her first headline gig.Photograph: Jimi LongmuirI grew up working class in Glasgow, in the areas of Easterhouse and “Crazy Ruchazie”. It was notorious for gang fights, addiction and deprivation but, despite that, it was a nice place to live as everyone looked out for each other. I wanted to do drama, but because of my background it never seemed like an option. I wanted to escape the council estate and was fortunate to get a sports scholarship at Glasgow School of Sport. That led me to university, where I studied politics and psychology. The whole comedy thing never entered my head.I ended up in corporate sales for a big soft-drinks firm based in Scotland. I went for a promotion, but the person who got the job over me was a relative of someone on the board. I’m great with people and can chat to anyone, but, obviously, my manager had to give me some sort of feedback. He said I needed to improve my presentation skills.So, in true Glaswegian style, I thought: “Is that fucking right?” I saw an advert for a comedy course called UltraComedy, the proceeds of which go to Cancer Research UK and you do a gig at the end. The course was taught by the incredible Viv Gee – a legend of the Scottish comedy scene.I was so scared before I picked up the mic, but once I got going, the nerves went away. All I was doing was talking about what I’d done at the weekend. It must have gone well because a comedy promoter was in and he offered me a paid professional gig. I couldn’t believe somebody was willing to pay me £25 for a 10-minute set. I had to go away and write the other five minutes of material.It all happened really quickly. A year after my first gig, I was standing on stage at Glasgow’s Armadillo arena, in front of 3,000 people, telling my jokes. Coming from where I do forces you to appreciate laughter. Humour’s the only thing you’ve got and, as a working-class person, sometimes it’s the only thing you can trade on.My comedy career was born from proving my boss wrong. The course was meant to be a one-off gig to get back at my boss, but it backfired. It’s essentially a joke that’s gone too far.Lydia Cashman: ‘My mate bet me a fiver’View image in fullscreen‘I was standing, taking serious career advice from seasoned comics at the famous Comedy Store, dressed as a sexy clown’ … Lydia Cashman.Photograph: Martyn JonesIn 2022, my friend and I made a short film together on the Isle of Wight. When filming wrapped, we had a couple of drinks and both decided we wanted to do standup. We made a pact, betting each other a fiver that we’d each do a standup gig by the end of the year.I immediately signed up for a comedy course. After finishing it I suggested we all sign up for The Gong Show at the Comedy Store in London. A gong show is a live standup event at which comedians perform for five minutes but risk being cut short by a large gong if they fail to impress the audience or a panel of judges. They’re brutal events, but I didn’t know this.My gig was on Halloween. The venue said there was a fancy-dress competition and a prize for the best dressed. I went dressed as a “sexy” clown, consisting of a big stripy ruffled top with a leather miniskirt and my face painted like Stephen King’s It.I arrived and hadn’t realised how absolutely massive the Comedy Store is. I met the promoter, and he popped me in the first section. I stood at the edge of the stage, surprised to see more than 30 comics all with five minutes of jokes each. The show must be really long, I thought naively. I got chatting to a really nice comic, Ian Murphy. I told him it was my first gig. I’ve never seen someone’s jaw drop so quickly. He explained the format of the night – which essentially is, you go on, try to be funny, and if they don’t like you, they raise a card. If you get three cards, you’re off the stage. Then I watched the other comics perform – I was horrified. Really talented and experienced comedians were getting “gonged” off in seconds.I went on stage and immediately decided to do the opposite of what I’d planned, but I panicked and started talking too fast. I steamrolled through it. I heard one person laugh in the front row, which kept me going, but at 46 seconds, I got my three little cards and had to plod off stage. I watched the second half, and Ian, who had given me advice backstage, was on. A few audience members were being really awful, and he absolutely annihilated them. He was amazing andlasted more than three minutes.Afterwards, he introduced me to the other standups, and they were so lovely and supportive. However, I had completely forgotten I was standing, taking serious career advice from seasoned comics at the famous Comedy Store, dressed as a sexy clown. Only one other comic had dressed up. She was dressed as a dinosaur, but somehow no one won the best-dressed prize.I realised nothing could be worse than that Gong Show. Afterwards, I got straight back on that horse and have been gigging since. Meanwhile, my mate still hasn’t done a standup gig or paid me the fiver.Richard Stott: ‘I did it to impress a girl’View image in fullscreen‘I agreed to a full Edinburgh fringe run of a show I hadn’t written’ … Richard Stott.Photograph: Andy HeathcoteI never thought I’d do standup comedy, which is strange because I once ran a venue for a comedy festival in Manchester. I looked at the comics, and I thought, well, that’s not in my skill set.In 2017, I was in a relationship with a standup comedian. She was going to perform at the Edinburgh fringe. She was complaining that she couldn’t afford the rent at the fringe on her own and then asked: “Well, you’re an actor, why don’t you do a one-person show?”In hindsight, it was more about finding someone to share rent with than believing in my ability. But I liked her and wanted her to like me, so I agreed to a full Edinburgh fringe run of a show I hadn’t written.I booked my first gig in London, a five-minute set at a popular comedy night, Comedy Virgins. It’s packed out at night, and the set went well, and I got a little plastic trophy for the funniest comedian. It felt more satisfying than anything I’ve achieved in my acting career. I loved it instantly. The energy when the room is going to erupt at the next big punchline, and you have to hide your excitement. Or anytime you have a perfect idea and it works instantly.The Edinburgh fringe didn’t go so well. I had a terrible venue (literally a cave) and a worse time slot – 12.45pm, and I had no real experience except for my little trophy, which I have now lost. I had to cancel shows because there was no audience. Sometimes, the people who came sat through it and appeared to enjoy it, but otherwise it was a slog. It was completely naive to do a full Edinburgh run with a 45-minute show with no gigs under my belt. I don’t look back and think that I was so brave; I think, given my lack of experience, it was stupid.At a relatively low point, I was wandering around Edinburgh, and bumped into an old friend, a poet called Matt Panesh. He asked how my run was going. I told him I was really down about it. Matt has done the fringe every year for about 15 years, so he gave me an excellent pep talk. He put things in perspective and helped me realise that I’m not the only person who has had a hard time there and snapped me out of my funk. In 2019, I was back at the fringe doing a full hour standup show at the Gilded Balloon. I went up to the Loft Bar, and Matt was there. I just had a bunch of four-star reviews. Without even skipping a beat, he said: “It turned out all right then!”I went to the fringe to impress a girl. Ultimately, the relationship didn’t work out, but starting comedy for the wrong reasons has led to what I argue is a career.Noor Sobka: ‘I said I’d do it if my friend dumped her awful boyfriend’View image in fullscreen‘It beats bowels’ … Noor Sobka.Photograph: Becky PayneI was at university studying biomedicine and planned to become a scientist. My placement was in gastroenterology. I really care about people’s bowels, but I wasn’t enjoying it and was having a career crisis.My way of coping was to terrorise my fellow students in the library with pranks and jokes. My best friend had a big following on Instagram, and I would be the performing monkey for her stories. She suggested I try standup comedy. At the same time, she had this awful boyfriend. I kept telling her to cut ties, but she kept going back to him, which was straining our friendship.After an intense chat, we decided to sort out our lives. She agreed to dump her boyfriend if I would try standup. So, a year later, I booked a comedy workshop at which you work on your best jokes. I am fascinated by dictators and had a great story about my uncle, who was briefly Colonel Gaddafi’s ear, nose and throat doctor. I got good feedback, which was enough to boost my ego and book my first gig, at the Frog & Bucket in Manchester. I was on the train, and I felt like a cow being led to the slaughter. I kept thinking: “Why am I doing this to myself? Please drown me in a puddle.” I arrived, and the crowd was huge – about 100 people. I went straight to the bathroom, locked myself in a cubicle and practised my jokes.I was third in the lineup. I couldn’t concentrate on the other comics, because I was so nervous that I could only think about my set. I started with my best dictator jokes that I knew really well, and I got my first big laugh. Immediately, I was so happy that everyone was enjoying it, and I just let the laughs go in. Afterwards, I was excited to do more and decided I needed to get a full hour of standup sorted right away.Is This Thing On? review – Bradley Cooper’s comedy of comedians is a charmerRead moreMy process for gigs is still the same.

It will continue to demand parliamentary action until it is resolved,” he told the Guardian.Falconer said he hoped there would be a change of approach in the Lords to allow it to move to a vote in the upper house.Ian McEwan calls for assisted dying rights to extend to dementia sufferersRead moreHe said: “That is what should happen and that continues to be my aim. However, because the Lords is a self-regulating chamber there is no mechanism to prevent a small minority of peers frustrating the will of the majority who want to see the bill progress through all its stages.“Together with Kim Leadbeater MP, who introduced the bill in the Commons, I have sought advice on the possible ways forward and it is clear to me that while we would strongly urge the Lords to come to a conclusion while there is still time, the Parliament Act is an option.”The Parliament Act allows theHouse of Commonsto reintroduce a bill and force legislation through if the Lords repeatedly block it. Since 1949, when it was revised, it has been used for just a handful of bills to enact laws that have not had the consent of the Lords, including decriminalising homosexuality and banning foxhunting.After the session of parliament ends, a bill must be reintroduced and passed again in the new session to trigger the act’s override mechanism. It must be exactly the same version of the bill as passed by the Commons.There are two ways to invoke the Parliament Act: by a supporter adopting it at the next private member’s bill ballot or for the government to give time to the bill for it to return to the Commons.They would not have to formally adopt the bill and could remain neutral, according to constitutional experts. But for No 10 to give even limited time in the next session to the bill would likely provoke an outcry from opposing MPs – as well as from cabinet ministers such as Wes Streeting and Shabana Mahmood who are high-profile opponents.MPs are expected to begin putting pressure on party leaders, including Keir Starmer, to take this approach, warning that if they allow the bill to fall, they would face a large public backlash and risk looking impotent if the bill fell due to theactions of unelected peers.But invoking the Parliament Act is likely to spark fury among the bill’s opponents who will say it is a tacit admission that Starmer was never neutral because of his previous support for reforming the law.On Friday, peers will begin their 10th day of debate on the bill with hundreds of amendments still to consider out of more than 1,200 that have been laid. Of the 59 clauses in the bill, peers have not yet concluded debate on clause 1.According to analysis by the Hansard Society, the bill is likely to need at least 16 more sitting days to even reach the end of committee stage, but has less than half of that time available.Last week MPs and peers who support the bill angrily accused a handful ofConservative and cross-bench peersof deliberately filibustering with repetitive speeches and pointless amendments.Its critics say the bill is deeply flawed and unsafe anddoes not have the support of any of the royal colleges– and say that ministers and its sponsors are not able to answer even some basic questions about it at the dispatch box, contributing to the delay.A source close to Leadbeater said they were confident the Parliament Act would apply if the bill was taken through a second time and there are precedents for the government to give time to the bill for conscience issues.Though Starmer himself is a longtime supporter ofchangesto the assisted dying law, there has been scepticism about the bill among strategists in Downing Street, some of whom see it as an unnecessary distraction and a risky electoral issue.Starmer has shown himself unwilling to personally intervene or adopt the bill, stressing the government’s neutrality thus far, though he has voted twice in favour of its passing.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEnglandWalesHouse of CommonsHouse of LordsHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

Since early 2018, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has visited China three times while German leaders have visited four times.The PM’s visit has attracted fierce criticism from his political opponents in the UK, particularly after the government gave the green light for aChinese mega-embassy near Tower Bridge in London.After a speech in London, the Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said she would not visit China “at this time” if she were in charge.“We should be talking more to those countries who are aligned with our interests, not the country that is doing everything it can to undermine our economy,” Badenoch said.Starmer will be hoping to develop a personal bond with Xi, which government insiders have said could help in future negotiations – for example if seeking China’s support in bringing an end to the conflict in Ukraine.His gift for the president, who is a Manchester United fan, was the football used during last week’s match when Xi’s team beat Arsenal, which the prime minister supports.Since taking office, Starmer has pursued a policy towards China which has been more open to engagement, while also cautious. He has met Xi before, withthe pair holding talksat the G20 summit in Rio in late 2024.Among deals expected to be agreed during the trip is the issue surrounding asylum seekers arriving in the UK in small boats from France.Downing Street said the planned agreement would seek to tackle the supply of boat parts which are manufactured in China, with 60% of the engines used last year being Chinese.The deal, to be signed after the talks with Xi and Li, will see UK law enforcement agencies work with Chinese authorities to share intelligence over the illicit export of boat parts, and to engage with manufacturers of the engines.It is also intended to deepen cooperation over serious and organised crime, such as the trafficking of powerful synthetic opioids, which have been responsible for more than 750 deaths in the UK.The agenda for the much of the talkswill focus on how to balance the need for commercial and diplomatic engagement with China while limiting its direct influence over UK infrastructure, and maintaining pressure on human rights, including the Uyghur population of Xinjiang, as well as people in Hong Kong.Asked about the implications of Mingyang, China’s biggest offshore wind company,potentially being allowedto supply turbines for windfarms in the UK, Starmer refused to add further comment.No decision has been made in relation to Mingyang,” he said. “There’s no decision on that yet, one way or another, but obviously uppermost in our minds is the national security of the United Kingdom.”Starmer dismissedapparent US concerns about the UK’s deal to hand sovereignty of the Chagos islands to Mauritius, saying US intelligence agencies disagree with Trump’s newly found opposition to the plan.Downing Street sources said the agreement is a “done deal” and will not be scuppered by the US.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerXi JinpingChinaTrade policyCybercrimeGlobal economyHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

The post also reflects a remarkable shift in the White House’s stated rationale for sending a carrier strike group to the region, moving away from outrage over the death of protesters to the fate of Tehran’s nuclear programme.Trump urged Iranians to keep protesting earlier this month, telling them “help is on its way”, but he later backtracked on the grounds that “the killing has stopped”.There is speculation that he actually held back because he did not have enough military assets in the area, Gulf States had urged restraint and Israel had counselled it needed more time to prepare for likely reprisals from Iran.Activists say more than 30,000 people were killed during the recent unrest. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, told the Senate on Wednesday that thousands had been killed and said the Iranian government was “probably weaker than it has ever been” since the 1979 revolution.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio testifying before the Senate foreign relations committee.Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPAIranian missiles and drones could still pose a threat to US personnel in the region though, he added.About 30,000US militarypersonnel were “within the reach of an array of thousands of Iranian one-way UAVs and Iranian short-range ballistic missiles that threaten our troop presence,” Rubio said. “We have to have enough personnel in the region … to defend against that possibility.”Trump would also maintain the “preemptive defensive option” of striking Iran if there were indications that it was planning an attack on US troops, he said. “They certainly have the capability because they’ve amassed thousands and thousands of ballistic missiles that they’ve built.”European diplomats had been expectinga crisis to developover the weekend and detected signs of Israeli nervousness about the scale of possible Iranian reprisals.In a social media post written in Hebrew, Ali Shamkani, a senior adviser to the Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said: “Any military action by America, from any source and at any level, will be considered the beginning of a war, and the response will be immediate, comprehensive and unprecedented, directed at the aggressor, at the heart of Tel Aviv and at all its supporters.”The Gulf States and Turkey have been speaking to both sides, trying to find common ground between Iran and the US, but Tehran has said it will not negotiate under duress or with preconditions.Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that a deal with Iran ought to happen. He told CNBC: “Obviously, the deal has to do with missiles. It has to do with enrichment. It has to do with non-state actor proxies. It has to do with [Iran’s stockpile of nuclear] material.”It has become clear in recent days that Trump is interested in curbing not just the remains of Iran’s already shattered nuclear programme but also its ability to fire long-range missiles, always seen as the centrepiece of Iranian military projection. In recent weeks Trump has also suggested Khamenei must leave the world stage, a demand Iran will reject.Asked by Senator John Cornyn about the potential for a change of regime in Iran, Rubio said: “You’re talking about a regime that’s been in place for a very long time … So that’s going to require a lot of careful thinking, if that eventuality ever presents itself. I don’t think anyone can give you a simple answer to what happens next in Iran if the supreme leader and the regime were to fall.”Some will see the sudden escalation of the threat as a useful piece of distraction at a time when Trump is under domestic political pressure over the violence administered by homeland security officers in Minnesota.The Iranian mission at the UN in New York said: “The last time the US blundered into the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it wasted $7tn, and over 7,000 American lives were lost. Iran stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respects and interests but if pushed it will defend itself and respond like never before.”Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he was not prepared to negotiate under threats but he was willing to talk without preconditions, terms he had relayed via numerous intermediaries to Witkoff.“Our brave Armed Forces are prepared – with their fingers on the trigger – to immediately and powerfully respond to ANY aggression against our beloved land, air, and sea,” he posted on X on Wednesday night.“At the same time, Iran has always welcomed a mutually beneficial, fair and equitable NUCLEAR DEAL – on equal footing, and free from coercion, threats, and intimidation – which ensures Iran’s rights to PEACEFUL nuclear technology, and guarantees NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.”View image in fullscreenAbbas Araghchi speaking in Tehran this month.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAIn the last 24 hours, Araghchi and the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, have between them spoken to diplomats from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.All three Arab states will be feverishly exploring ways to reopen talks without Iran having to accept a preconditioned result. They were critical in persuading Trump to hold back from mounting an attack three weeks ago, but Trump now has greater flexibility of military options and seems more focused on a nuclear deal rather than punishing Iran for the bloody suppression of street protests.There is deep suspicion in Tehran about talking to the US since the two sides were in the middle of talks last June when Israel was given clearance by the US to mount an attack on Iran designed to decapitate its leadership and destroy its civil nuclear sites.Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister, urged the US to detach its wider demands about Iran’s missile programme and support for militia in the region from the nuclear file. He said he thought that if Witkoff insisted on putting all items on to the table at once, Iran would not respond.Trump has insisted that Iran abandon its domestic nuclear enrichment programme, permit UN nuclear inspectors to return and hand its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to a third party, most likely Russia. Iran has always held out against abandoning its domestic capacity to enrich uranium but has been willing to set rigid limits on its stockpile.Since the last round of negotiations ended with an Israeli and US attack killing 1,000 people and severely damaging its key nuclear sites, Iran has been weakened further by a plunging currency and rampant inflation.With the nuclear sites already damaged, the key targets in any attack would likely be Iran’s leadership. June’s attack revealed Israel had near total dominance of the skies above Iran.Almost all the Gulf states, fearful of Iranian reprisals, have said they are not willing to allow the US to use their airspace or bases to mount an attack on Iran.Iranian officials said: “We will target the same base and the same point from which air operations against us are launched, and we will not attack countries because we do not consider them to be enemy countries. We will increase our level of defence readiness against the US military buildup to the highest level. If the Americans want negotiations without pre-determined outcomes, Iran will accept it.”Explore more on these topicsIranTrump administrationUS foreign policyIran's nuclear programmeUS politicsDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We wish Roberto a swift and full recovery.”View image in fullscreenRoberto Alagna became ill after the second act and as the role of Calàf is specialised, there was no cover.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe writer Kenan Malik wrote on X: “Drama at the opera tonight. During Turandot at Covent Garden, Roberto Alagna, playing Calaf, took ill and couldn’t come out for act III. So, Richard Hetherington, ROH’s head of music, but not a trained opera singer, gamely stepped in, to sing from the side.“But he couldn’t sing the main arias or duets. So, they began act III after Nessun Dorma. And ended before the final scenes, finishing at the point where Liu takes her life rather than reveal Calaf’s name.“So, disappointing, dramatic and a strangely appropriate ending all at the same time. And hugely brave and impressive of Hetherington to step in.”Hetherington, who is listed as the conductor for the schools’ matinee performance of Turandot on 4 February, has performed the title role in the British premiere of Henze’s Pollicino, Yniold in Pelléas et Mélisande and First Boy in Die Zauberflöte, before making his conducting debut with La sonnambula in 2011.This is the 19th revival of Turandot which tackles the themes of love, fear, devotion, power, loyalty, life and death in a fantastical, fairytale version of imperial China.As the role of Calàf is specialised, major opera houses will not typically have a cover standing by for every performance.In the current revival, the role of Turandot has been shared between Anna Netrebko, Maida Hundeling and Anna Pirozzi while Calàf, the unknown prince is sung by Yusif Eyvazov, Arsen Soghomonyan and Alagna.Turandot was Puccini’s 12th and final opera. The composer died aged 65 in 1924, leaving Turandot unfinished.He had written much of the third act, up to the death of Liù, but there were only sketches as to his thoughts on how the work should end.His student, Franco Alfano, wrote a completion that reprised the famous Nessun Dorma aria.Explore more on these topicsOperaGiacomo PucciniRoyal Opera HousenewsShareReuse this content"

They lined the streets in their thousands, waving flags and marvelling at the grand royal procession weaving past their newly built homes.It was 27 May 1960 and the recently crowned queen was officially opening the town of Newton Aycliffe on her first provincial tour after the birth of her third child, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, three months earlier. A16-page commemorative pamphlet, priced at two shillings and sixpence, records the local Light Infantry buglers playing to the giddy crowd.The message was clear: Newton Aycliffe, a town built from scratch from the rubble of the second world war, heralded a new postwar Great Britain, a country that would give its people a modern, prosperous quality of life, free from the squalor of its bomb-scarred cities.View image in fullscreenThe queen in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, May 1960.Photograph: Mirrorpix/AlamySix miles north of Darlington, this industrial wasteland was chosen by William Beveridge for his pioneering new town in the late 1940s. Beveridge, the architect of the welfare state, personally oversaw its creation on the site of a former explosives shed used for experiments in the war.It would, he said, be a town of “hopes and dreams” and a “paradise for housewives”, which would be centred on a high street he named Beveridge Way.Nearly 80 years later, this single shopping precinct helps tell a different story.Of the 45 shops on Beveridge Way today, 23 are empty – a vacancy rate nearly four times thenational average. Those that are left include a Ladbrokes, Greggs, four charity shops, four discount stores and a pawnbroker.The banks are long gone – the closest now a 90-minute round trip to Darlington by bus – and the faded signs record an exodus of household names: Wilko, Select, Peacocks.Beveridge Way,Newton AycliffeThe high street where half the shops are shutVACANT1out of45shops\n        is vacant(2%)Out of0 openshops:0serve hot food & drink0are charity shops0are gambling/pawnbroker shopsOut of1 closedshop*:0were banks0were clothing stores0were hardware / general purpose stores*(where previous owner is known)“In the 60s it was a fabulous place to live,” said Ian Gaul, 67, over a pint in Phoenix working men’s club next to Beveridge Way. “The town centre was absolutely beautiful. You couldn’t wish for a better place to live.”And now? “You would be ashamed to bring someone here now. It’s unrecognisable.”Families moved from acrossEnglandto this new-build utopia in the 60s and 70s, drawn by reliable jobs in manufacturing and chemical factories.View image in fullscreenBeveridge Way in the early 1960s.Photograph: The Francis Frith Collection“I remember everyone talking about the queen’s visit – it was huge; people talked about it for years after,” said Colin Whitehead, 70, who moved to the town in 1969.But since the early 2000s, the high street has “only ever gone backwards”, said Whitehead, who worked in a local laminate factory before retiring. Tesco opened an enormous superstore next to the town centre, which one politician claimed “sucked £1m a week out of the local economy”. “There was all sorts before that, then one by one over the years it all vanished. Now it’s disgraceful,” he said.The story of Newton Aycliffe’s faded town centre is in many ways not an unusual one.But the decline of British high streets – whether due to underinvestment, changing consumer habits, or high business rates – has been felt keenly. For many, they are a barometer of local pride: those with busy shopping precincts are more likely to feel their area is prospering; those with rows of steel shutters, vape shops and takeaways feel the opposite.Less-affluent areas have higher vacancy rates because shoppers have less money to spend. Towns in the vortex of this decline are often those that have traditionally voted Labour, many in the Midlands and north of England, presenting a clear political risk forKeir Starmer. Studies show a direct link between feelings about local high streets and support for Reform UK.County Durham was one of 10 English local authorities and two regional bodies won by Nigel Farage’s party in last year’s local elections – a victory he celebrated in a working men’s club in Newton Aycliffe the next day. Starmer and Farage know that the path to No 10 runs directly through high streets like Beveridge Way.Newton Aycliffe has suffered a similar decline to other British high streets as shoppers moved online and the economy hit the buffers.View image in fullscreenLike many high streets, Beveridge Way has declined as more shopping is done online.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBut one peculiar aspect is that its town centre is wholly owned by a London-based multibillionaire who is wealthier than Richard Branson.Benzion Freshwater, 77, may be the biggest property tycoon most Britons have never heard of.The London-based multibillionaire heads one of the UK’s richest families, worth £2.6bn, according to the latest Sunday Times rich list. His empire includes prime property in New York, Florida and London, including the capital’s Grade II-listed Africa House.Since 1990, his company, Daejan Holdings, has also owned the entirety of Newton Aycliffe town centre.What attracted this global property empire to a remote corner of County Durham? And why have they stayed on despite decades of decline and growing local anger? The Freshwater family have scarcely ever been pictured in public, let alone spoken to the media.The attraction to Newton Aycliffe was, at first, pretty obvious. In the 90s, British high streets were enjoying a golden era, filled with big beasts such as Woolworths and BHS. Tim Berners-Lee had yet to publish the first webpage and Amazon, now the world’s fifth most valuable company, was a niche bookseller for the few homes with dial-up internet.View image in fullscreenTony Blair visits the computer learning centre in Newton Aycliffe in 1999.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyBack then, County Durham was on the world stage as Tony Blair, the town’s MP, became prime minister and hosted leaders including the then US president, George W Bush, in nearby Sedgefield.But by 2009, Blair, Woolworths and other big names were gone. Daejan Holdings stayed on, however, swallowing losses as the high street emptied.Company accounts show it made a £4m loss in the town over the past two years. Yet this is just a dot in its transatlantic empire: its £3.2m worth of property on Beveridge Way accounts for just 0.12% of its global holdings. “It’s just a line on a spreadsheet,” said one local government expert.Anger about the state of Newton Aycliffe town centre has dominated local politics for more than two decades, but those in charge have little power to intervene.A group ofLabourMPs is calling for local authorities to be allowed to compel absentee landlords to make empty shop units available temporarily to charities, community groups and small businesses. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England, has also called for stronger powers.Yet at a time when local leaders are taking an axe to already threadbare budgets, it is difficult to see many pumping resources into empty buildings. In Newton Aycliffe, it pits one of Britain’s richest families against a council with debts of more than £434m.Daejan Holdings once claimed to be London’s biggest private commercial landlord but the firm is shrouded in secrecy.In 2020, Freshwater and his 75-year-old brother, Solomon Freshwater, took the firm private after they were rebuked by the government for being the only FTSE 350 company without a woman on the board.The company declined to answer questions for this article. A spokesperson said: “As a general rule, we do not give interviews on topics of this nature.”However, several people who have dealt with the firm expressed unhappiness and frustration at their monopoly in the town.Shopkeepers complain that little has been done to attract new businesses as the high street has emptied. They say vacant units are left to rot instead of being offered at discounted rates, or let on a short-term basis to good causes. Others point to electrical faults going unfixed and leaky, decaying buildings.View image in fullscreenClosed shops on Beveridge Way, which is owned by Daejan Holdings, based in London.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFew local politicians were willing to go on the record to criticise the company. One said privately the situation was “totally unacceptable” and that the town was being failed by an “absentee landlord and absentee council”.That characterisation is rejected by Durham county council, whose officials said they hold near-quarterly meetings with the firm, which is based more than 250 miles away on London’s Shaftesbury Avenue.The council said the vacancy rate last year for the town centre was 26% – still nearly double the national average – however, this relates to an area much wider than Beveridge Way, including two large supermarkets, a library and leisure centre and a 1980s shopping mall, Thames House.Graham Wood, the council’s economic development manager, said Daejan had always engaged with the local authority regularly and that this year it will publish a new strategic plan for the town.“Much like other town centres across the country, Newton Aycliffe is facing challenges due to the changing shopping habits of residents and the continued pressure from online retail,” he said.“However, there is a lot of hard work going on behind the scenes by us and our partner Daejan, which has managed the centre for more than 20 years, to respond to these challenges.”Along Beveridge Way, there is no visible sign of super-wealthy overlords. A sparse community noticeboard seeks recruits for local sports clubs, along with a handwritten note asking for a wheelchair and mobility scooter in “any condition”.A town centre manager, employed by Daejan via a consultancy firm, works from a small unbranded office overlooking the quiet high street.Shoppers on Beveridge Way talk in conspiratorial tones about who owns their once-famous shopping centre. “It’s owned by London and they’re charging London rents – it’s shocking,” said Daniel Robertson, 52, a teaching assistant. A drinker in the Phoenix reckoned “there’s places on Oxford Street [in London] paying less rent than here!”When he learned that the Freshwater brothers paid themselvesnearly £2.5m eachlast year – 67 times the annual salary of the average Newton Aycliffe resident – Whitehead shook his head. “It’s the haves and the have-nots,” he said, gesturing to his fellow drinkers.The only store doing a brisk trade on Beveridge Way when the Guardian visited last month was Youngs newsagent. Posters in its window advertise exotically flavoured vapes while its sub-post office serves a reliable stream of retirees.View image in fullscreenDiane Young in her newsagent, one of the few businesses doing well on the high street.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianDiane Young, the co-owner, is trying to sell up, potentially leaving the town centre without its key amenity: “The reason we’re selling up isn’t because the town centre is dead – it’s because we’re retiring,” she said.The closure of Woolworths in 2009 was the start of the decline, she said. “We used to have a weekly market – the town centre was heaving on Tuesdays, market day. You couldn’t move for people. It’s massively gone downhill.”Two separate buyers pulled out earlier this year and Young is adamant they will not stay on when their £37,000-a-year tenancy expires in 2028. Leaving the town centre without a newsagent and post office would be “heartbreaking,” she said. “If we go there would be nothing to come into the town for.”At Thames grocers, customers are ordering £20 hampers of Christmas Day vegetables. Janice Mills, 74, blames the London-based owners of the town centre for its demise. “Because they don’t live here, they don’t see it,” she said. “None of them live like we live.”View image in fullscreen‘None of them live like we live’ … Janice Mills.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianLocal people rhapsodise at length at the variety of shops that once filled Beveridge Way. “Now you can’t even get a decent pair of shoes here,” said Mills, who still works as a housekeeper in a local hotel. “To get anything decent you have to go to a retail park and if you don’t have a car you’re done for. I just hate this town centre – it’s absolutely useless.”Sandra Seal, 78, minding the till at Thames for her son, its owner Matthew Seal, said she could not even get Daejan’s town centre manager to change their faulty lights. And don’t get her started on the town’s Christmas decorations: “I told her [the town centre manager] they should be ashamed of them,” she said.A 77ft clock tower, originally constructed in the late 1950s, is also a source of discontent. On Remembrance Day in November, its hourly strike was turned off because it could not be relied on to chime on time for the minute’s silence.“There is potential in this town,” said Nadine Nesbitt, the co-owner of the baby clothes shop Petite Boutique. “But you hear people saying all the time there’s nothing here and there actually isn’t.”Nesbitt, 44, opened her store on Beveridge Way a decade ago and its customers travel from miles around. Her £720 monthly rent to the Freshwater family has not increased for years, she said, but added other retailers had left because of “arguments over rent”. “They’re making it awkward for people to stay,” she said. “Every time we get a new town centre manager we put it forward to them and they just get arsey with us.”She added: “It’s like they’re hanging on to what’s left and that’s it – they’re not bothered if shops go.”Across Britain, Labour MPs are growing increasingly worried about the state of their local high streets.In a fieryCommons debatein November, the Labour minister Miatta Fahnbulleh accused the Conservatives of “decimating” town centres over “14 years of decline”.“Our town and city centres are part of our identity and our sense of belonging,” she said. “When they do not meet expectations – when shops are shut and footfall is down – that can dent pride in place, hold back the economy and leave our communities divided. Put simply, they are part of the nation’s barometer of whether we – all of us in this house – are doing a good job.”View image in fullscreenSandra Seal says the owner’s town centre manager won’t even fix faulty lights in her son’s shop.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianMultiple studies show it is one of the main issues driving voters towards Reform.The thinktankPower To Changeidentified the 100 places in Britain with the most derelict high streets and found that, in the general election, Reform soared to second place in 24% of them compared with 14% across the rest of England.Researchers at the University of Warwick in 2024found a “robust relationship”between high-street decline and support for Reform’s precursor, Ukip. A town’s visible economic decay “significantly influences populist sentiment”, they concluded after analysing vacancy rates in 197 towns in 93 local authorities across England and Wales.It is no accident that Farage and Richard Tice, the Reform MP for Boston and Skegness, talk endlessly about the rise of Turkish barbers and vape shops. In a TikTok video watched 3m times last year, Farage mocks the “absolute racket” of cash-only barbers that have “a Lamborghini out the back” but no customers.Dan Jarvis, the security minister, has talked of “dodgy shops as fronts for serious organised crime, money laundering and illegal working” and police are turning their gaze to the high street. Late last year, the National Crime Agencylaunched a month-long series of raidson 2,734 high-street shops, seizing more than £10.7m in suspected criminal proceeds. Premises that once housed names such as Debenhams or Topshop were now being used “as cover for a wide range of criminality”, a senior officer said.One explanation for the transformation of the British high street is simple: they are becoming places to buy what cannot be ordered online – a haircut, for example, or a coffee. Nearlyone in three retail salesin the UK are now online, compared with about 5% in 2008. As traditional retailers have vanished, others have stepped in.Since the Covid pandemic, barbers and vape shops have been two of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy. There were 10,000 more hairdressers and beauty salons last year than in 2007, according toofficial statistics, while the number of vape shops across England hasrisen 1,200%in the past decade.View image in fullscreenShopkeepers on Beveridge Way say little has been done to attract new businesses to the high street.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe result, then, is a high street that looks markedly different from one at the turn of the millennium. And many people don’t like it.A poll by Ipsos last year showed thedecline of the high streetwas the second biggest issue for people about their local area, after high prices in shops. Nearly 80% said it worried them, compared with 84% concerned about prices. Nearly 70% of respondents said there were too many vape shops, while 58% decried the number of barbers.The areas with the sorriest-looking high streets are mostly in Labour’s traditional heartlands, many in the Midlands and north-east of England. Inevitably, Labour gets the blame for their demise.In September,Starmer announced a 10-year schemeto hand £20m each to 250 struggling parts of the UK. Named “Pride in Place”, the programme will allow communities to seize boarded-up shops and buy beloved local assets such as libraries and cinemas. With an eye on Farage, the prime minister hailed it as a plan for “unity over division” and “backing the true patriots”. Like levelling up, wrapped in the union jack.“We’ve been under Labour, Tories, the lot – nobody does anything about it,” said Whitehead.Alan Strickland, Newton Aycliffe’s Labour MP, is desperate for action. His family were among those drawn to the town decades ago and his political future now hangs on its revival. Reform came second in his newly created constituency in 2024, nearly 9,000 votes behind Labour.The high street had “lacked attention for too long”, he said. “We need strong leadership from the landlord and the county council to bring forward ambitious plans for its future.“The Labour government’s showing national leadership by investing heavily in high streets and it’s incredibly important that the same leadership is shown at the local level.”"

Burner phones, for example, are routinely used by No 10 on some trips abroad – at G20 the summits in Brazil in 2024 and South Africa in 2025, for example – though not on visits to allied nations or Five Eyes intelligence partners.For visits to China these precautions have been standard for at least a decade, such is the expectation that Beijing will eavesdrop and monitor.When she was prime minister, Theresa May was warned ahead of her trip to Beijing in 2018 to get dressed under the duvet to ensure that spy cameras would not film her without any clothes on. It was advice that was passed on generally by officials to all those travelling on the trip eight years ago.View image in fullscreenTheresa and Philip May with Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at a tea ceremony in Beijing in 2018.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/EPAConcerns about peeping tom surveillance are particularly relevant to those in the official entourage or business and press delegations staying in hotels. “There was a well-worn routine in places like Shenzhen that foreigners from the west would be assigned the same rooms so they wouldn’t have to move the equipment,” a former senior British intelligence official said. Those with time on their hands would try to find the concealed bugging devices for fun.The Guardian view on Keir Starmer in China: engagement is necessary, caution is vital | EditorialRead moreWhen Gordon Brown visited China in 2008, an aide was victim of a honey trap. The male aide met a Chinese woman at a lively hotel disco in Shanghai and left with her. The next day, he reported that his BlackBerry phone was missing. He was reprimanded, though No 10 said there had been no security compromise.Part of the standard security guidance given to ministers and their aides reflects this incident. “The rest of the advice,” the senior security official said, “was warning middle-aged men that if an attractive young Chinese woman appeared interested in you, she probably wasn’t”.Michael Gove, writing in the Mail last year, recalled being given similar warnings before being dispatched on a ministerial trip in 2010: “I was also told that if anyone from the opposite sex who approached me was out of my league they had only one thing on their mind – and it wasn’t comparing notes on Confucian philosophy.”View image in fullscreenMichael Gove, Vince Cable, George Osborne and David Cameron at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during a two-day trip in 2010.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PADavid Cameron visited Beijingas prime minister in December 2013. A former aide recalled that China insisted on supplying a personal protection officer “over six-and-a-half-foot tall” to follow the British prime minister and his team as closely as reasonably possible.The practice, again, is relatively standard, but it offered an obvious possibility for low level information gathering. “At the end of the trip after pretending he couldn’t speak or understand, at the plane he said goodbye and safe travels in perfect English,” they recalled, presumably as a reminder they were being watched.General guidance, according to one British official who visited Beijing, “is that everything is bugged” and the only area for sensitive or secret conversations and debriefs is the secure compartment in the British embassy.Similar considerations apply when meeting Chinese leaders or officials – at international summits – or when visiting the country’s diplomatic premises in London or elsewhere.When James Cleverly was foreign secretary, a former adviser recalled that during the UN general assembly in New York, he and his team refused to take their mobiles into the Chinese consulate. The handsets were all stored in a lead-lined bag in the hands of officials who did not go inside the diplomatic building.One of the consequences of this abundance of caution is that ministers are out of ordinary contact in China, meaning their families cannot easily get in contact, having instead to communicate via a private secretary or other close aide.It can also cause other political issues, as happened to Vince Cable in 2014. The Lib Dem, who was then business secretary, was visiting China and did not have his mobile phone with him. Back in the UK, an old ally, Matthew Oakeshott, launched a coup attempt against the then party leader, Nick Clegg – but the plot struggled for momentum and quickly collapsed with Cable uncontactable.“I wasn’t part of this plot. It all broke in the middle of the night in China and not surprisingly we were not rushing to the phone,” Cable said.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerChinaAsia PacificInternational tradeTrade policyEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

It was 2024, and the physical therapist was in the midst ofmiscarryinga much-wanted pregnancy. But because her fetus still had a heartbeat, hospital officials said Arkansas’s near-totalabortionban blocked them from taking steps to induce labor and end her pregnancy.Instead, Waldorf had to wait and hope that she didn’t develop a deadly infection.Waldorf’s sister, Elizabeth, called the office of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the Republican governor ofArkansas, to ask for help. “What do you expect the governor to do?” a male official from Sanders’s office asked. Waldorf, the official said, should “find a lawyer”.Waldorf took the advice, as a sweeping new lawsuit shows. On Wednesday, Waldorf, an OB-GYN and three other Arkansas women who say they were also blocked from getting abortions sued the state in an attempt to strike down its near-total abortion ban.Two of the women say that, like Waldorf, they were denied abortions even though their pregnancies had effectively ended. One of the women says that she was unable to get an abortion after getting pregnant through a sexual assault, because Arkansas doesn’t permit abortions in cases of rape.View image in fullscreenSarah Huckabee Sanders at CPAC in Maryland in February last year.Photograph: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images“Arkansas’s abortion bans are vague, confusing, and worse, extremely dangerous,” the lawsuit alleges. “How are pregnant Arkansans supposed to access comprehensive obstetric care when leaving Arkansas means traveling through some of the most remote parts of the state, and when Arkansas is surrounded by other states with their own abortion bans?”Since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, unleashing a wave of state-level abortion bans,dozensofwomenhavecome forwardto say they were denied medically necessary abortions. Many of these women have alsojoined lawsuitsthat aimed to clarify the exceptions in abortion bans, which are supposed to allow people to get abortions in emergencies. Doctors across the country have said that the exceptions are worded so vaguely as to be unworkable in practice.The lawsuit is the first to be filed by Amplify Legal, the litigation arm of Abortion in America, a reproductive rights group that focuses on sharing the stories of abortion patients and was co-founded bythe late Cecile Richards, one of the foremost abortion rights activists of the 21st century.‘I didn’t know what I was supposed to do’: US women who miscarry are in dangerous legal limbo post-RoeRead moreIt argues that the laws banning abortion in Arkansas – there are two virtually identical laws on the books – must be struck down because they violate the state constitution and its guarantee that people have the right to equality, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These anti-abortion laws, the lawsuit alleges, not only infringe on people’s right to choose how to build their families, but also threaten their lives, fertility and economic wellbeing.They are also unconstitutionally vague, according to the lawsuit.Waldorf’s account of her ordeal and her sister’s conversation with a Sanders official are part of the lawsuit’s allegations. In response to questions about Waldorf’s allegations and the lawsuit, Sam Dubke, director of communications for Sanders’ office, said in an email: “Arkansas was named the most pro-life state in the country for the sixth year in a row not just because the Sanders administration offers complete protection for the unborn but also because Governor Sanders has made needed investments in foster care and adoption, maternal health, and childhood wellbeing. Governor Sanders looks forward to defending Arkansas’s pro-life laws in court.”Ultimately, according to the lawsuit, hospital officials agreed to transport Waldorf in an ambulance to another hospital in Kansas, which permits abortions. That hospital induced Waldorf, who was about 17 weeks into her pregnancy. Waldorf gave birth to a baby who died shortly after birth. Waldorf, who is now 40, named her Bee.‘She felt she had no choice’Chelsea Stovall, another plaintiff, is a 35-year-old mother of two. In late 2022, she learned that the fetus she carried had a congenital anomaly that doomed the pregnancy. Stovall and her husband emptied their bank account and their savings to travel to Illinois for an abortion, according to the lawsuit.At the Illinois clinic, an anti-abortion protester threw a bloody Maxi pad at their car, the lawsuit alleges.A third plaintiff, 30-year-old Theresa Van, got pregnant in 2023 but soon learned she did not have enough amniotic fluid to allow her fetus to develop, according to the lawsuit. However, because her fetus still had a heartbeat, she could not get an abortion. She continued her pregnancy for several weeks, at growing risk to herself, until the fetal heartbeat vanished and she gave birth to a stillborn daughter.View image in fullscreenTheresa Van holds an ultrasound.Photograph: HardpinThe lawsuit alleges Van feared criminal prosecution if she tried to leave the state for an abortion. “In addition, the financial strain of traveling for abortion care was too intense. She felt she had no choice but to continue her pregnancy until her daughter passed,” the lawsuit says.The fourth woman suing Arkansas, Allison Howland got pregnant in 2024, according to the lawsuit, after being sexually assaulted at a hotel in 2024. Rather than immediately traveling out of state for an abortion, she continued the pregnancy for weeks in the hopes that police might be able to use DNA from the pregnancy to prove her allegations against the assaulter, the lawsuit says.However, police concluded that there was little they could do, since the alleged assailant maintained that the encounter was consensual. One detective allegedly told Howland that the assailant “seemed like a really nice guy”. When Howland informed the police that she planned to get an abortion in Illinois and asked if she needed to preserve the remains of the pregnancy, a detective told her “not to bother”, as the lawsuit put it, as the police were unable to take proper care of the potential evidence.“I do not want to keep the product of this assault,” the lawsuit quoted Howland as saying. “Call that selfish but I stand by it. I was violated and put into extreme danger and living in a state like Arkansas – I was royally fucked.”Explore more on these topicsAbortionArkansasReproductive rightsRoe v WadeHealthWomennewsShareReuse this content"

But did she get too cosy with the worlds of fashion and advertising?Philip OltermannWed 28 Jan 2026 11.36 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 12.26 ESTShare‘Idon’t know what you want to know,” says Anne Imhof, three-quarters of the way into our interview. Her cautious smile, between curtains of jet black hair, changes into a sceptical pout. I have just quoted a headline at Imhof, one of Germany’s most important contemporary artists, that described her 2025 New York show as“a bad Balenciaga ad”.Just a few years ago, Imhof was the hottest ticket on the international art circuit: a Golden Lion winner at the 2017 Venice Biennale, whose transformation of the German pavilion into a sinister, S&M-flavoured “catwalk show from hell” had masses scrambling to join the queue. Imhof was a cultural polymath whose shows combined etchings, paintings, dance, live music and film; a muse to fashion designers whose sporty goth aesthetic – Adidas tracksuit bottoms, chunky trainers, black leather – beseiged the clubs of Berlin and beyond.‘I built a fence around the house the Nazis built – and let dogs piss on its steps’But her last sprawling mega-show, at the Park Avenue Armory in New York, was met with mixed reviews in US broadsheets and proper drubbings in hipster online journals such as Hyperallergic and Spike. Suddenly the next generation seemed all too eager to cancel her membership of the cool club. Still, I had expected she would rise to me bringing it up. Instead, the shutters come down. The arms she enthusiastically waved across the screen minutes earlier are now locked across her chest. My questions become longer, her answers shorter. “Do you want to say I’m dated as an artist?” she asks when I say that the music she has just released for herdebut albumreminds me of 1990s grunge. “Actually, this is getting quite exhausting,” she says and soon after ends our call (though she later agrees to continue the interview via email).View image in fullscreenCritical moment … last year’s Doom: House of Hope, which was called ‘a bad Balenciaga ad’.Photograph: George Etheredge/New York Times/Redux/eyevineWhat most likely caused the annoyance wasn’t the criticism as such, more the fact that it wasn’t direct enough. Because open conflict is something Imhof, now 48, always seemed to thrive on. Educated at private schools in Germany and Britain, she was suspended from a boarding school in Bath on the grounds –in her telling– that she had an “evil eye” and was bewitching other girls. While studying art in Offenbach and Frankfurt, she moonlit as a bouncer at the Robert Johnson nightclub. The first entry in hercatalogue raisonnéis a performance she put on at a red-light bar, where two boxers had to fight each other until a band in the other corner played their last note.Later, in her 30s, Imhof was commissioned to fill the German pavilion at Venice, a building re-designed by the Nazis in 1938. “I decided to make things visible that are obviously problematic in my country,” she explained at the start of our interview. “I built a fence around the house that the Nazis built, and I let dogs piss on the staircase leading up to it.”Called Faust, the work did not just showcase Imhof’s taste for conflict, but also her gift for conjuring up images that obliquely capture the spirit of our age. Once visitors got past the menacing dobermans patrolling outside, they found themselves walking across a raised glass floor that spanned the building and unsettled its occupants. The feeling was exacerbated by a crew of dead-eyed performers in black sportswear, who roamed among and below the crowd, playing thrash metal or sulkily hovering over their phones.In front of my eyes, Faust became something the audience createdAll the cultural preoccupations of the 2010s were there: the militarisation of physical borders on land, the melting away of barriers in the digital sphere, tech surveillance and Apple Store aesthetics. Imhof says she was living in Frankfurt at the time, home to the European Central Bank, which played a key role in the decades of sovereign debt crises. “Their buildings are mostly made of glass,” says Imhhof. “That transparency is supposed to unite the inside and the outside. But glass creates separation as much as it does visibility.”Faust was also one of the first major art shows that seemed to be specially designed for Instagram. “It was the height of social media becoming a new way of communicating,” says Imhof. “In front of my eyes, Faust turned from something I created into something the audience created. They were coming up with their own edits, their own iconography.”The trouble with art that captures the zeitgeist, of course, is that the zeitgeist moves on, relentlessly. Entitled Doom: House of Hope and performed underneath a giant ticking doomsday clock, Imhof’s three-hour New York show swapped out some cultural signifiers – out went the Germanic guard dogs, in came high-school jocks, cheerleaders and grunge kids. But it featured many of the same performers as the Venice show and reprised a feeling of existential exhaustion: “We’re fucked, we’re doomed, we’re dead / I think I made you up inside my head.” That was one of the choruses chanted by Imhof’s roving cast. Hyperallergic’s critic called it “excessively pessimistic about the future” and “comically apolitical”.View image in fullscreenIn at the deep end … the pool from Fun is a Steel Bath.Photograph: João MorgadoHer dalliances with the world of fashion, too, have invited a backlash, which might explain her bristling at the “Balenciaga ad” dig. After years of serving as a semi-official muse for Balenciaga’s former creative director Demna, she designed a moody show for Burberry during lockdown in 2020. Last year, she put on a “battle of the bands” performance sponsored by Nike, including a special-edition football top with “Imhof” written on the back.This winter, she and her new partner, US ballet dancer Devon Teuscher, were photographed in a hotel bed dressed in Valentino, for the Italian fashion brand’s new campaign. German newspaper Welt said her career was starting to resemble a cautionary tale of what happens to artists who get into bed with the fashion industry: “One front-row appearance is one too many.”How has Imhof bounced back from this? Does she now feel pressure to be more politically explicit? “I think I have a responsibility towards my work,” she says, “but also towards the people I work with, not to make political statements just to make pieces more desirable. It’s not that I think art isn’t political – on the contrary. It’s about creating a space you share, in which you show moments of love and care, as extremely skilled people give everything. My goal is not to politicise my art, or to justify it in that context, to monetise or profit on that. Revolutions don’t happen inside a museum space.”I don’t think the future of art lies in making it into some elite bubbleThe title of Imhof’s latest exhibition, Fun ist ein Stahlbad, or Fun is a Steel Bath, could be read as her answering her critics on the politics point. Showing at the Serralves Foundation in Porto, it cites the philosopher Theodor Adorno, for whom naive hope has no place in modern art: at best, artists can create works that expose how deeply damaged our world has become.While previous Imhof shows were emphatically immersive, this one is filled with sculptures designed to be uninviting: in the courtyard, Imhof has built an empty swimming pool out of black metal, the literal steel bath of the title. Elsewhere, there is a grid of crowd-control barriers. “The viewer confronts a sculpture that already embodies control rather than being guided through it,” she says. “The body becomes a site of thought, movement a form of intelligence – that is inherently political.”In another corner, a four-channel film overlays footage of the New York show with a passage from Australian science-fiction writer Greg Egan’s novel Diaspora, about a dystopian, proto-fascist future in which software births genderless beings without parents. Pessimism, she seems to be saying, can be political too.“A lot of things have changed since I made Faust in 2017, when maybe we were at the height of social media,” she says. “Perhaps now it is not about the presence of bodies, or about being seen. It’s more about sheltering a certain artistic autonomy and having to mimic something to be not taken in by it.”View image in fullscreenZebra crossing … a still from a video work for Wish You Were Gay.Photograph: Anne ImhofDoes it all add up? Adorno was a firm believer that artistic autonomy could only be sheltered in high-modernist art, and that all entertainment was essentially a form of cultural coercion. But Imhof makes art that wants to be autonomous and popular, pulling in anything from painting to graffiti, from rock to rap, from modern dance to classical ballet. This debut album WYWG (short for “Wish You Were Gay”) contains songs she mostly wrote in the early noughties, bearing the influence of hard-to-digest acts like Genesis P-Orridge and Black Flag. Yet some songs, Brand New Gods for instance, also bring to mind the Velvet Underground: austere but surprisingly catchy. “I think there is a need or a desire of mine to make my work accessible,” she says. “I don’t think the future of art lies in making it into some elite bubble.”Artists who design football shirts may be breaking out of the art world bubble, but if they make that shirt for Nike, are they still “mimicking something in order not to be taken in by it”? Or are they just making lifestyle consumer products, pure and simple?“When I talk about mimicry, I mean a strategy for staying alert within powerful systems, including social structures, as a means of survival,” she says. “Fashion and art are not separate moral systems. They both involve labour, production, and circulation that aren’t fully transparent. For me, the question is more about agency: who makes decisions, who is involved, and whether the work can maintain its critical position while moving through these systems.”Adorno might be the patron saint of her Porto show, but would he have approved of her work for Nike? “My interest is not in claiming moral purity, but in remaining aware of the conditions of production – who is involved, how labour is treated, and what choices I make as an artist. Collaborating with fashion or popular culture doesn’t surrender autonomy.”Fun ist ein Stahlbad is atFundação de Serralves, Porto,until 19 April;WYWGis out on Pan RecordsExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPerformance artSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I, like, removed myself from everybody. What I didn’t have was anything rational or grounded.” Antiheroine finds Love writing music again after two unsuccessful albums and more than a decade away from the spotlight, grappling with ageing, her volatile past in the spotlight and her abrasive reputation – “I didn’t think about likability ever,” she says in voiceover at the start of the film. “Likability was not a factor.”But Love magnetized fans with “an unfiltered, insanely honest aspect”, says the REM frontman Michael Stipe, a close friend of Love’s who appears in the film along with musicians Melissa Auf der Maur, Eric Erlandson, Billie Joe Armstrong, Patty Schemel and Butch Walker.View image in fullscreenCourtney Love in 2003.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty ImagesIn Antiheroine, that reputation comes in for a reckoning. “Everyone has a Courtney Love story,” she says ruefully while welcoming the film-makers to her London apartment. (As of March 2025, Love wasin the processof obtaining UK citizenship, as things were “scary” in the US.) The new album, which would be her first in 15 years, represented “a way to take back my story”, she says. “No one can tell my story but me.”Within footage of Love’s emotional return to the studio and musings on her personal archive – including journal entries, song lyrics and home video – Antiheroine retraces Love’s pioneering and polarizing career as a rock frontwoman. By her own admission, her itinerant and unstable youth forged an intense desire for fame. Born Courtney Michelle Harrison in 1964 to a “countercultural family” in San Francisco, Love developed a “rhino skin” at an early age. She claims her father, Hank Harrison, gave her LSD when she was four, and subsequently lost custody of her. She had her first drink at age 10, claiming that her stepfather, David, “got me very drunk”, leaving her “physically ill for a week”. Her mother, Linda Carroll, according to Love, scapegoated her young daughter for her problems. “When you have a narcissistic parent, you’ll never be good enough,” Love says.After her mother moved overseas, a rebellious Love spent time in foster care and juvenile hall. She credits Patti Smith with saving her life, by showing her what a woman in rock could be. Determined to become a rock star, she moved to Liverpool, England, to infiltrate the city’s punk scene, though she insists she was not a groupie. “I didn’t want to fuck those guys, I wanted tobethose guys,” she recalls.Liverpool led to Los Angeles, where she worked as a stripper and performed as the lead singer of an otherwise all-male punk band, whose members, she says, turned on her. Love then placed an ad in the paper for female musicians. (Erlandson, Hole’s longtime guitarist, answered anyway.) She recalls her naked ambition trying to make it in the LA music scene of the 1980s – sharing a studio with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, dieting, limiting herself to heroin twice a month, developing her signature scream, practising six to seven days a week, turning a terrifying experience in which she was handcuffed and nearly raped into the song Retard Girl. With Hole, she says, “I had a place for my too much-ness.”“I never doubted that I would be famous,” Love says, “I just thought it would solve everything.”Antiheroine also delves into her much-publicized and tumultuous romance with the Nirvana frontmanKurt Cobain, to whom she was immediately attracted. “He was so beautiful,” she recalls, re-examining notes and lyrics they wrote together in bed. “He had a really weird sense of humor. We were two designated scapegoats, rejected by our mothers and our fathers. We found each other and we were home. It was really instant. That honeymoon phase of it went on for what felt like a really long time because it was so rich.”Love and Cobain married in 1992, and welcomed daughter Frances Bean Cobain in August of that year. (Frances does not participate in the film.) Antiheroine recalls the media brouhaha around their relationship and particularly a Vanity Fair article that suggested she used heroin while pregnant with her daughter, a charge Love still vigorously denies. Heroin figures prominently in the film, as does intense media backlash, particularly after Cobain’s suicide in April 1994. The same week Cobain died, Hole’s acclaimed second album Live Through This was released, and the band went on tour. “The grieving process was live,” recalls Erlandson. The film includes numerous clips of fans and pundits speculating that Love was responsible for Cobain’s death; at one Hole concert, an attender placed shotgun shells on the stage in front of her, precipitating a public breakdown.View image in fullscreenCourtney Love and Kurt Cobain in 1993.Photograph: Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images“She’s been pilloried again and again,” Stipe says in the film. While some was deserved – Love could be abrasive – “quite often, it was not”. Thirty years later, Love still appears emotional over both her bond with Cobain, even singing someNirvanakaraoke, and the inescapable tumult that followed his death. “Kurt Cobain walks into the fucking room before Courtney does,” she says in the film. “That’s just going to be my life.”After a pivot to film, including a critically acclaimed performance in Miloš Forman’s The People vs Larry Flynt, Love released, with Hole, the 1999 album Celebrity Skin, which pivoted toward a mainstream sound. But the success was short-lived, as the demons caught up with her. Love disbanded Hole in the middle of a tour. Her actions became more erratic, and her drug use escalated. “If you want to nuke your life, do crack,” a now sober Love quips. As a teenager, Frances Bean sought legal emancipation from her mother. “I certainly was not the easiest mother, that’s the truth,” Love concedes. “I couldn’t focus on her at all.”Love remains mum on the state of their relationship in the present, though by film’s end she’s off to visit her grandson, whom Frances Bean shares with husband Riley Hawk, in Los Angeles. The final song she composed for her forthcoming new album is about Frances.That album still does not have a release date or a title but, according to the film, will feature collaboration from erstwhile bandmate Auf der Maur and Stipe. “I think it’s a lesson of ‘don’t do it until you’re called’,” she says of her new work. “You can call it ‘the recovery record’ or ‘the fucking almost died record’ or ‘the got granted a lease on life record’. I got to remain alive.”Throughout Antiheroine, Love returns, again and again, to music – as a release valve, an escape, a balm. “The more I write these songs, the more I get further and further away from the shit,” she says. “One song can change everything. If I can’t believe in that then I don’t believe in anything.”Antiheroine is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026Courtney LoveKurt CobainDocumentary filmsSundance film festivalPop and rockNirvanafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sure, there was more than a hint of rebuke in Michael Moore’s 2004 documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 unexpectedly becoming the biggest-grossing non-music-or-nature documentary of all time (and highest full stop in North America) while taking re-election-year shots at George W Bush (who went on to squeak out another victory anyway). But that movie was also sold on Moore himself, a recent Oscar winner and fixture in both film and television by that point. Bush was excoriated, but he wasn’t exactly getting top billing. The unambiguous star of this weekend’s Trump-approved documentary is right there in the title: Melania. It’s coming to 1,500 theaters this weekend from Amazon/MGM.Black cakes and branded buckets: welcome to the White House premiere for Brett Ratner’s Melania movieRead moreRelatively few documentaries receive a wide release (though Melania is going out in about half as many theaters as last weekend’s Amazon release, the Chris Pratt vehicle Mercy), so comparison points are relatively few. Box office predictions generally place the movie well under Moore’s unlikely high-water mark for the form. Some are guessing the opening weekend will pull in about $1m, which would comfortably keep it off the list of theworst wide openings of all time(the record low for a new release in around 1,500 theaters is about $330,000) but would nonetheless qualify it as a bomb. Others estimate that it will go as high as $5m, putting it in line with rightwing docs like Am I Racist?, the highest-grossing documentary of 2024, which ended its run with $12m. As theHollywood Reporter points out, technically inching ahead of Am I Racist? and the recent faith-based After Death would boast the biggest non-music launch for a documentary of the past decade.But no one paid $40m to acquire Am I Racist? – or an additional $35m to market it. That’s how much Amazon has poured into Melania – remarkably, the most the deep-pocketed company has ever paid to secure distribution of a single film. This is seemingly the result of a post-election bidding war when corporate panic over matching a seeming rightward turn in the populace was at its peak.Technically, paying the president-elect’s wife this much money – Melania reportedly pocketed nearly $30m of Amazon’s initial $40m outlay – was legal, because the first lady isn’t part of the government. She’s just a private citizen who happens to be married to the president and happened to receive a multimillion-dollar check from a company with many government contracts through its web services and other divisions. Healthy democratic stuff!This has also led to the grim spectacle of a president taking time out from endorsing extrajudicial killing of private citizens to also plug a movie, which he claims is selling out theaters, and fast, ahead of its opening weekend. Amazon, only somewhat less hyperbolically, claims its willingness to invest $75m in a single doc (a format that has produced all of five movies that made at least $75m in North America; again, mostly music and nature, with that one Moore outlier) simply reflects perceived audience interest in a Melania documentary, not a desire to hastily curry favor with the current administration.That hastiness means that Amazon also bought the project sight unseen – because when they ponied up the $40m, the movie, shot in the run-up to Trump’s second-term inauguration, didn’t really exist yet. But it did have a director, and technically one with a decent box office track record: to lend this project a veneer of real Hollywood glamour while still careful to endorse accused sex pests, Trump World recruited the disgraced film-maker Brett Ratner. He’s best-known for the Rush Hour trilogy; he also made an X-Men sequel and other big-name projects (including Tower Heist, initially conceived as a movie about robbing Trump Tower), before being accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women in 2017 (which he has denied). Melania is his first feature in 12 years. Ratner seemingly made up for lost time with a hurried, chaotic shoot employing three different camera crews to follow the once-and-future first lady around. According toRolling Stone, this also left a literal “trail of detritus” in the wake of Ratner, cited by crew members as leaving orange peels and gum wrappers behind him (and bringing food into an area where crew had been denied meal breaks, devouring it in front of them).View image in fullscreenPhotograph: APNaturally, the film was withheld from critics – can you imagine explaining the concept of a free promotional or press screening to the Trump family? Maybe that’s why some advance sales – visible on the website for the AMC theater chain, among others – have been surprisingly decent-looking in blue-state strongholds like Manhattan, at least at some theaters; anyone who wants to review or write about the film directly will have to pay to get in.At the AMC Lincoln Square, typically one of the highest-grossing theaters in the nation, the primary evening showing on Friday is on its way to selling out (or close to it), which would align it with theaters in deep-red Dallas. Meanwhile, a couple of miles south at the AMC Empire, the Times Square megaplex that routinely packs in audiences for titles big and small, the 7.15pm Friday-night Melania showing has sold nine tickets as of Wednesday morning. Three apparent superfans (or writers on deadline) have snapped up tickets to the very first showing of the day. (Not every movie makes most of its sales days ahead of time; then again, it’s hard to imagine a casual moviegoer turning up at a multiplex to see what’s playing and debating between, say, Rachel McAdams in Send Help, Chris Pratt in Mercy, or Melania Trump in Melania.) Anecdotally,Puck’s Matthew Bellonireported some booing of the Melania trailer disseminated on social media (and defacement of some print ads); I can confirm that at a recent commercial screening of Mercy, the ad for its Amazon stablemate did receive scattered boos in an Imax auditorium.Obviously, Trump will declare Melania a smash success regardless of the result. (Advance online ticketing would also make it easy enough to goose sales, as has sometimes been the case withcertain rightwing bestsellers.) For Melania herself, the box office is probably immaterial. She was already paid, and though Ratner has apparently continued to cozy up to the Trump family and film Melania, no one’s livelihood rests on the possibility of Melania II: The Quickening. The movie seemingly exists beyond its quick-grift payday as a shared delusion between Trump and his acolytes that he is, essentially, married to a glamorous and powerful movie star. Trump stans love to think of Melania as a return to “class” in the White House, a barely coded way of saying she’s a white woman with no discernible job or opinions apart from being pro-Melania. (Maybe the documentary will serve as an unboxing video for her having a thought about something not directly related to Trump.) But stardom can be punishingly difficult to maintain in this era, never mind buying it outright. Melania may not be the next big thing in cinemas, but she has figured out one major tenet of Hollywood: make sure someone else is footing the bill.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsMelania TrumpAmazonAmazon Prime VideoJeff BezosfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps you hold the position that the novel is a text so sacred that any adaptation whatsoever is equivalent to sacrilege. Or maybe you are excited to see what a noted iconoclast such as Fennell will do with something as fusty as a 179-year-old book.Either way, it is likely that your key takeaway from the Wuthering Heights press tour so far is that it’s getting a bit much. It has now been revealed thatMargot Robbieand Jacob Elordi have matching rings decorated with two hugging skeletons and the phrase “Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same”.It’s all getting a bit Wicked, isn’t it? Do we really need to form parasocial relationships with actors to enjoy their films?Maybe if that was the extent of it, this would be fine. But it has come at the thin end of a campaign during which Elordi and Robbie have both tried really, really hard to make everyone think they are besotted lovers and not professional colleagues with a product to sell.View image in fullscreenWuther rings … the gifts exchanged by Robbie and Elordi.Photograph: Cece JewelleryThere was the interview in January in which Robbie revealed that, during filming, Elordi would always make sure he was closely watching her on set, even when he was not required, and that even his occasional absence would result in her feeling “lost, like a kid without their blanket or something.” Or the time when Elordi claimed they had a “mutual obsession”. Orwhen Robbie revealedthat Elordi filled her room with roses on Valentine’s day, prompting her to think “Oh, he’s probably a very good boyfriend”.It all sounds highly romantic and very sexy … at least until you remember that Margot Robbie is married to Tom Ackerley, with whom she has a child who was four months old at the time of the Valentine’s Day roses, that she and Ackerley are co-producers of Wuthering Heights, and that this campaign is probably the product of a high-level discussion between them and the Warner Bros publicity department during which everybody agreed on the precise degree to which Robbie would pretend to be gooey-eyed about her co-star.It’s all getting a bit Wicked, isn’t it? That had a press cycle so overcooked that, in order to enjoy the film, you had to divorce yourself from the image of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo clinging to each other during every interview and sobbing like they’d just watched their childhood houses burn down.Is this approach becoming the norm? Is this how stupid we’ve become? Obviously film campaigns have had to change with the times, because the old way of magazine profiles and formal sit-down interviews has given way to nebulous social media buzz. But to watch Robbie and Elordi go moony-eyed over each other – knowing full well they’ll drop the artifice like a stone when they each get something new to promote – is to realise that something has gone badly wrong.Do we really need to form parasocial relationships with the people we see in films, tailored specifically to the tone of the project, in order to enjoy them? Wasn’t there a time when we just innately understood that an actor’s performance began with the opening credits and ended when the lights went up?It makes you worry for the future. For instance, Greta Gerwig’s new Narnia film is due to be released this year, and Emma Mackey is playing the witch. Does this mean that, a few months before its release, Mackey will start pretending that her family are virulently anti-Christmas? Is she going to do TikToks in which she growls at children? Will she do a press junket next to a real life lion that she will be contractually obliged to slag off at every opportunity?‘It’s no romcom’: why the real Wuthering Heights is too extreme for the screenRead moreThe hope has to be that all these shenanigans will help Wuthering Heights cross over and become a Barbie-style phenomenon. But it’s coming at the expense of our brain cells. We’re all adults here. We should be able to tell the difference between an actor and the character they play, or else we’re surely doomed.Hopefully this is the high watermark of the Wuthering Heights campaign, with any luck this element of the promotion will recede, and the final fortnight will be about the film itself and not the extent to which the leads are willing to pretend to be in love. That is, unless Margot Robbie andJacob Elordiwant to adopt a child before its release, and agree to raise it to adulthood. That really would be a level of commitment we could all get behind.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsFilm industryMargot RobbieJacob ElordiEmerald FennellFilm adaptationscommentShareReuse this content"

To stop it the left must change tooWed 28 Jan 2026 12.51 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 12.54 ESTShareMatt Goodwin has beenselected as the Reform UK candidatein the upcoming Gorton and Denton byelection – a contest he has a very good chance of winning. I suppose I miss the days when watching the toxic right was more of a cod-psychoanalytical pastime: when you could watch the Goodwin of 2024, preaching the superiority of Hungary in openly anti-migrant terms, compare him to the Goodwin of the mid-2010s, when he was an adviser to the coalition government ontacklinganti-Muslim hatred, and say, “wow, this guy’s been on a journey”. What were the waypoints of his slide from “just asking the questions”, throughdog-whistle racism, to brazen ethno-nationalism? What could have been the trigger events? Which bad crowd has he fallen in with?The author James Bloodworth, whomapped Goodwin’s journey rigorouslylast summer, considers him the intellectual mascot of the politics of resentment. He quoted Goodwin thus: “I just spent four days in Hungary, a conservative country criticised by elites across the west. I saw no crime. No homeless people. No riots. No unrest. No drugs. No mass immigration. No broken borders. No self-loathing. No chaos. And now I’ve just landed back in the UK.” These talking points are all commonplace on the hard and far right; migration is situated asa wellspring of social ills, from crime and disunity, through drug use and housing crises, and it is stated with so much confidence, so little evidence or logic, that it’s really more of a muster point than an opinion held in good faith.Yet if you were talking to the Goodwin of 2014, the young academic in a hurry, who wrote densely researched books on the BNP and Ukip, you would have a few follow-up questions, like: how exactly does one measure self-loathing at a national level? Some kind of poll, I would guess, but it’s unclear how you’d pose the question (“do you, considering yourself a part of Hungary, hate that self and by extension, hate Hungary? No? Great news!”). You’d want to know this wasn’t bare assertion, you’d want to know its methodology.Even as recently as last year, there was a trace of relief and exhilaration, when the intellectuals of the hard right said the quiet part out loud, whether it was Goodwin, orDouglas Carswell’s skin-crawling“from Epping to the sea, let’s make England Abdul free”. At least you knew you weren’t imagining it, and other people could hear it too. The Goodwin of 2025 blamed the Huntingdon train stabbings on “mass uncontrolled immigration” and, confronted with the fact that the suspected perpetrator was British, went on to opine “So were all of the 7/7 bombers. It takes more than a piece of paper to make somebody ‘British’.” Again, there was time when you’d have been itching to go back in time a decade, and ask the same Goodwin what he thought Britishness was, if not being born and raised here: was it colour coded? What the hell other kind of code did he have in mind?To borrow the phrase du jour, the time for talk is over. There is absolutely no ambiguity about Goodwin’s views. He makes no attempt to hide or resile from them. And that ethno-nationalist outlook aligns with Nigel Farage’swould-be policy platform: abolish indefinite leave to remain; deport hundreds of thousands of people.In announcing Goodwin’s candidacy, Reform has turned this byelection into a battle about race and belonging. Inevitably, many will find comfort in poll-watching, minutely tracking the data and persuading themselves and one another that Manchester is too diverse, too unified, too sophisticated for a twin-track politics in which citizens’ legitimacy is contingent upon on their skin colour. But the other parties in this fight cannot afford to lull themselves into this kind of security, and have to start thinking beyond the parameters of their own advantage and victory; any move they make in this byelection will signal how serious they are about fighting toxicity in politics.Predictably, Keir Starmer has already urged voters to unite around the Labour candidate, billing this person, as yet unannounced, as the only one who can beat Reform.The lesson of Caerphilly, only three months ago, is that voters will figure out for themselves who the only realistic victor is, and will not have it dictated to them. In that case, it was Plaid Cymru, whose swing was less pronounced than Reform’s (19 points v 34), but who ultimately lifted more of Labour’s disaffected voters and won the seat. Labour has also put out itsfirst attack video, and predictably, it’s not against Reform. It’s against the Greens.The Greens, also in the middle of choosing a candidate, have gone in hard onwhat they call Goodwin’s anti-Muslim record, and emphasised their own politics of unity and hope. Even while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives were nowhere in this seat in 2024 (4% and 8% respectively), the Greens will need to borrow votes from everywhere to be in contention, and choosing prejudice as their enemy is broad but might work.One other party has announced: George Galloway’s Workers party is fielding Shahbaz Sarwar, a local councillor. Funnily enough, Galloway’s obnoxiously masculinist, strong-man positioning probably means this party is pitching at the same voters Reform is, for all their differences on Islamophobia.The spectacle might be depressing, but it’s not familiar; the hard right has evolved. Any strategy from its opponents that doesn’t recognise that will fail.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Could occasionally, like most of us in our gang, get a bit boisterous on a night out, but otherwise had a heart of gold. Reconnected with him recently and the boisterousness seems to have dissipated while the heart of gold still beats. I met his dad once, too; he was nice as well. All good for my own personal sense of Brand Runcorn.Also in the last century, I got talking to the bloke sitting next to me on a train out of Euston. I was squashed up next to him and his suitcases. He had a lot of luggage, so wherever he was going it looked as if he would be staying there a while. He turned out to be American, and a Mormon. I had, not long before, been to Salt Lake City, so we had a nice chat about that. When I asked him where he was heading, he said Runcorn. This led me to ask why. He replied: “Because that’s where the Lord has sent me.” There’s no answer to that, or at least not one I could think of as we rattled our way north. A shroud of mystery now settled over my idea of Runcorn.Thirty years on, this week fate, if not the Lord, brought me to Runcorn. Its station had presented itself as the most convenient place to drop my daughters to catch their evening train to London. There had been a bit of grumbling from them, questioning the logic of this plan – my daughters have scant appreciation of what goes into my decision-making. There is near algorithmic complexity involved in weighing up such a range of factors – road conditions, routes, traffic, weather, train timetables, even football fixtures (Everton v Leeds Utd that evening, so potential for nonsense around Liverpool Lime Street station). I fed all this information into the dad-computer and this was what came out. We were Runcorn bound.View image in fullscreenRuncorn’s station cat.Photograph: Courtesy of Adrian ChilesI had an idea that the journey would at some stage entail going under or over the Mersey and/or the Manchester ship canal. A sign detailing toll charges presented itself, but before I could start stressing about what to pay, to whom and how, a magnificent bridge rose up before us, similar to the one over Sydney harbour. OK, smaller, but no less impressive. And all beautifully lit, in red. And then, as we crossed, it changed colour, to green I think. And soon it changed again. “Wow,” said my older daughter, “Runcorn is groovy.”I don’t know the history of the Silver Jubilee Bridge lighting scheme. I expect there has been the odd moan questioning the cost, or the point, of the exercise. But things like this are important, saying something about a place’s sense of itself. And sparking a sense of wonder in anyone on a rainy Monday night in January is no small thing.There was more evidence of Runcorn’s grooviness to come. Having successfully executed the drop-off, and even been commended for my clever planning, a photo was pinged to me of the station cat. Yes,Runcorn station has a cat, which has been provided with a little home next to the information desk.Runcorn, what a place. I almost never want to pay a proper visit lest the magic be dispelled.My only quibble was that I found the Merseyflow website a bit confusing and fear I’ve paid the £2.40 toll twice. I’ll let that pass, though. For such joy, £4.80 is a small price indeed.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ofgem needs to toughen upNils PratleyWith almost one in five firms breaching targets, the watchdog’s new get-tough approach on capital levels seems to be anything butWed 28 Jan 2026 14.16 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 14.59 ESTShareWhen half the nation’s retail energy suppliers, includingBulbwith 1.7 million customers, failed during the gas crisis of 2021-22, the embarrassed regulator, Ofgem, decided it should probably pay more attention to companies’ balance sheets. Better late than never.The cost of mopping up the corporate calamities added up to £2.7bn, or £94 on every household’s energy bill,calculated the National Audit Office.The result was a new regime from March last year in whichOfgemset “capital targets” for each supplier to ensure financial resilience. And the secondary effect was an entertaining quarrel between Octopus Energy, which confessed to being one of three suppliers below its capital target, and British Gas-owning Centrica, whose chief executive argued it was “criminal” that the regulator was not applying its ultimate sanction of barring under-target firms from taking on new customers.So what’s today’s state of financial resilience? The question is timely because wholesale gas prices are again behaving wildly. The volatility is not to the same degree as in 2021-22, but cold weather in North America has affected the European market, the type of event that can upset UK suppliers’ hedging arrangements.SSE is a winner in the great grid upgrade. Who is looking out for consumers and small businesses? | Nils PratleyRead moreThe answer, found deep withinan Ofgem reportthis week, is that even more suppliers failed to meet their capital targets at the latest measurement date. From three last June, the tally was five at the end of September. There were only 23 suppliers at the time, so slightly more than a fifth of the supplier base was out of line. That is not a small proportion.“Where suppliers are below the target, we work proactively with them on their plan to meet this target in the shortest reasonable time,” says Ofgem’s report.But that’s about all it reveals. The regulator doesn’t name the under-target firms (Octopus andOvovolunteered their status last year) or say how far short they fell from the aim of having adjusted net assets of £115 per dual fuel equivalent customer.What is Ofgem’s definition of “the shortest reasonable time”. Are we talking six months, a year or longer? It is impossible to say because there is no statutory timeline and Ofgem treats each capital-improving plan as unique. And what does “working proactively” mean? Ofgem deems its measures too commercially sensitive to talk about.This is a strange version of a supposedly get-tough regime. Over in banking-land, the Bank of England publishes its stress tests for each bank and the results are pored over by the City. Banks know the consequences would be severe even if they fell only close to regulatory minimums.The stakes are lower in the retail energy market, and the setup is newer. But the levels of transparency are poles apart.“Where a supplier is not meeting the Capital Target but has a credible and agreed plan in place they remain in compliance with our rules,” says Ofgem, reserving the right not to explain what it regards as credible.One does not have to be in Centrica’s “ban ’em from accepting new customers immediately” camp to think the regulatory approach is far too weak.How much extra time will laggards – now increased in number – be given? Ofgem should be able to answer. The new rules are there for a reason.Explore more on these topicsOfgemNils Pratley on financeRegulatorsEnergy industrycommentShareReuse this content"

What is the appropriate response here? Decry and sue? Shrug and move on? I ponder the question as I stroll through my local supermarket, where the mackerel fillets are wreathed in metal security chains and the dishwasher tabs have to be requested from the storeroom like an illicit little treat.On the way home, I screenshot and crop a news article and share it to one of my WhatsApp groups. In another group, a family member has posted an AI-generated video (“forwarded many times”) of Donald Trump getting his head shaved by Xi Jinping while Joe Biden laughs in the background. I watch the mindless slop on my phone as I walk along the main road, instinctively gripping my phone a little tighter as I do so.Increasingly, by small and imperceptible degrees, we seem to live in a world defined by petty theft; petty not in its scale or volume but by its sense of entitlement and impunity. A joke, a phone, an article, theisland of Greenland, the entire canon of published literature, a bag of dishwasher tablets: everything, it seems, is fair game. How did we get to this point, and where does it lead us?Perhaps we should start on the internet, where technology has essentially legitimised and embedded stealing into our shared digital culture. Aggregator websites, viral meme accounts, screenshots, copy and paste, the abundance and ubiquity of the feed: all these serve to blur the relationship between the creator and creation, sweeping up our ideas, thoughts and pictures into a common buffet. It feels frictionless, victimless, even empowering. The rewards for virality are high and the penalties almost nonexistent.And so when the first generative AI models started training themselves on billions of items of scraped content – copyrighted writing, music and art – in a sense they were simply following in an established tradition. There was, writes Karen Hao in her book Empire of AI, “a culture among developers to view anything and everything as data to be captured and consumed”. John Phelan of the International Confederation of Music Publishersdescribes itas “the largest intellectual property theft in human history”.But there are no police on the scene, no screaming sirens, no bounties and “wanted” posters. If big tech wants your stuff, and governments around the worldwant to let them have it, there is no emergency number to call, just a fog of obfuscations and plaintive wailing about the viability of the business model. Please, my family is starving. My family loves to eat private photos and personal data. Also, my family is allergic to copyright law.But, of course, the internet did not invent all of this. Theft itself is as old as time, perhaps one of the oldest human behaviours of all: a strategy of adaptation and learned imitation driven above all by asymmetries of power, wealth and opportunity. Often it gets justified in the same terms. Inequality creates thieves on both sides, not just one. It cements thievery as one of the defining principles upon which society is run. The street thief and the colonial empire-builder are thus bound by a common understanding of the rules of play, a kind of anti-honour code, in which acquisition is rebranded as a form of victorious conquest.Perhaps it is no surprise that this culture is defined most strongly by a US president who boasts of his ability to grab whatever he wants, from a Venezuelan oil tanker, to classified documents, to a frozen Atlantic island, to a woman’s private parts. Donald Trump represents the doctrine of coercive acquisition as a kind of founding principle. His plan for the Vegas-style reconstruction of Gaza, unveiled by Jared Kushnerat Davos last weekand rich in AI imagery, reads like a kind of kleptomaniac wet dream.Naturally he has been abetted by the fact that on a global level, the taboo over naked territorial land grabs – from Crimea to the West Bank – has largely been eroded. In a world of heightened securitisation, the theft of land can simply be spun as a tool of survival. For Trump and many of his fellow autocrats, the new age of neocolonial expansionism is simply an extension of natural law, the spoils of being strong in a world of the weak.In these small learned increments, a world is remade along stolen lines. And on a deeper level the age of theft seems to express something vital about how we see others as fellow members of a species, about how we regard rules and conventions when our leaders appear to find them less relevant than ever. When entire countries are built on stolen labour, when entire peoples are forced from their land so it can be turned into something resembling a casino, suddenly watching Everton v Leeds United on a pirated stream feels like a comparatively innocuous crime.In some of my more idle dystopian daydreams I used to wonder what might happen ifGoogleor WhatsApp simply decided one morning to take all your emails and messages hostage, and demand a life-altering ransom for their release. Does this seem so dystopian now? If personal boundaries are now a chimera and ownership is simply hard power by another name, at what point does mass theft begin to resemble an unanswerable business case?“[A] great embarrassing fact [that] haunts all attempts to represent the market as the highest form of human freedom: that historically, impersonal, commercial markets originate in theft.” A great line, albeit one stolen from David Graeber, whom I like to think would have appreciated the irony. In the meantime, all we can really do is grip our phones a little tighter, put watermarks and firewalls around our creative output, vote for parties that will address inequality rather than aggravate it. And in a small polite voice, ask the shop assistant if they wouldn’t mind unlocking the mackerel fillets when they have a moment.Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIntellectual propertyOpinionAI (artificial intelligence)InternetGooglecommentShareReuse this content"

It has its work cut out for it. Trump didn’t pull the triggers that killedRenee GoodandAlex Pretti, but he bears political responsibility for having greenlighted the agents’ regularly lawless conduct.Good and Pretti should not have been killed. As far as can be seen in the ample video evidence that has emerged, neither posed a threat to the agents at the scene or anyone else. Their sole “offense” was to take a stand against the deportation raids. Yet trigger-happy agents needlessly shot them – Good as she was turning her carawayfrom the agents, Pretti while he wasrestrainedby agents on the ground. There was no plausible self-defense to justify these killings.Masked government thugs snuffed out Alex Pretti’s life in broad daylight | Moira DoneganRead moreYet the Trump administration has been reflexively defending deportation agents whenever they use lethal force. In each of the 16 times since July that they have fired shots, either while detaining people or at protesters, Trump officials have declared their actionsjustifiedwithout waiting for investigations to be completed, sometimes in blatantcontradictionof video evidence.The killing of Pretti is illustrative. Stephen Miller, the deputy national security adviser who is directing the deportation sweeps from the White House, pronounced Pretti a “domestic terrorist”. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary who oversees the raids, said Pretti was responsible for “domestic terrorism”. Yet video analysisshowsthat Pretti posed no danger to the officers who killed him. These senior Trump officials blamed the victim for his death.Sensing public hostility, Trump has nowremovedGregory Bovino, the border patrol commander who had been directing the deportation operations in Minneapolis. But Trump still has not repudiated the statements of Miller and Noem. He should fire them both for encouraging such lawlessness by defending the indefensible.The signal from senior Trump officials is that even the unjustified use of lethal force will be treated with kid glovesTrump himself has been no better. His initial response to the killing of Pretti was to castigate Democrats for creating “chaos” by refusing to cooperate with the deportation sweeps. Yet the video evidenceshowsthat it was federal agents who needlessly escalated the situation, “shoving bystanders”, “showering them with pepper spray at close range”, giving “muddled” directives and passing up opportunities to de-escalate, as the New York Times reported.To make matters worse, the Trump administration has avoided initiating a criminal investigation. So far, it isconductingonly a “use of force” “review” of Pretti’s killing rather than a criminal investigation into whether he was murdered. Similarly, the FBI supervisor in Minneapolis who tried to investigate the killing of Goodresignedafter her superiors in Washington pressed her to discontinue the inquiry. Again, the signal from senior Trump officials is that even the unjustified use of lethal force will be treated with kid gloves.Trump’s supporters have been no better. Fox NewsblamedPretti for his own death because if he hadn’t shown up to protest, he wouldn’t have been killed. “He should not have been there,”saidFox & Friends co-host Charlie Hurt on the network’s flagship show. So much for the first amendment right to protest!Othershave noted that Pretti waslawfullycarrying a gun, as if that might justify his killing, even though the video evidenceshowshe never drew it or removed it from his holster, and it appears to show agents taking it from him before shooting him as he lay restrained and helpless on the cold ground. This blame-the-victim argument has even outraged Trump’s second amendmentsupporters. Since when does lawfully carrying a gun – never brandishing it, never using it in a threatening manner – permit federal agents to summarily shoot you?The real “weapon” that Pretti held that seemed to outrage Trump’s agents – the same tool being used by Good’s wife at the time of her killing – was a mobile phone camera. Opponents of Trump’s raids have regularly used their phones, as the first amendmentpermits, to film agents in action to document any misconduct. That is largely how we know that Trump officials’ cover stories for the killings of Good and Pretti were fictitious.We will never know precisely what went through the minds of the federal agents who needlessly shot Good and Pretti to death, but it is hard to discount the role of their frustration at thevideo recordingsthat stood between their apparent tough-guy instincts and their quest for impunity.Back when he still lived in Trump Tower in New York City, Trump liked tosaythat his supporters were so loyal that he could descend to Fifth Avenue and shoot someone without losing any votes. There has been a disturbing degree of truth to that observation, because so many of his supporters seem to admire his willingness to buck the system, even when that involves crossing legal lines.But most Americans don’t like a police state, which is what Trump seems to be trying to impose on Democratic-run cities. The raids are bad enough. But if Trump’s deportation agents can kill with impunity, if the instincts of Trump and his senior officials are to exculpate lawlessness rather than to hold officials to the law, then Trump deserves theplummetingpolls that now face him. Let’s hope that for the safety of US city dwellers, his notorious quest for public approval leads to a change of direction.Kenneth Roth is a Guardian US columnist and visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs, and former executive director of Human Rights Watch.

Unspoken being one of the most importantReadmore petty gripesWed 28 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 18.27 ESTShareMost people don’t relish being locked in a confined space, in close proximity to strangers, travelling at speed. And yet, so many people do nothing to elevate the experience for others.I am floored at the enthusiasm of people who stand at the crack of elevator doors waiting for them to open, as if it were 9am at the Black Friday sales. When the doors open, they recoil in surprise – presumably they were expecting to be the first passengers on the maiden voyage of this metal tube sliding up and down the building’s shaft.My petty gripe: a large flat white is an oxymoron – a bastardisation of the drink Australia gave the worldRead moreShould you need to get out as these elevator enthusiasts are entering, they appear positively annoyed, and rather than stepping out of the way, stay rooted in position, turning their body sideways, providing you with a sliver of a fleshy human funnel to squeeze through. This brings methe only pleasure I can derive from being in a packed elevator – seeing the faces of these people when they realise no one is getting out and they have to wait for the next one. However, such delight quickly morphs into discomfort at having to silently, awkwardly blink through the long three-to-eight seconds that the doors hang open.By the way, jabbing the close button repeatedly has zero impact.Once in the elevator, there are numerous unspoken rules – unspoken being one of the most important. Whenyou enter with a stranger, all talking must stop. Even if you enter with your work bestie who has tea to spill (hot liquids should also be avoided), pause the conversation. Wait until you get out. On the phone? Tell them you’ll call them back. Tempted to strike up a conversation with the stranger in the elevator? Please don’t.But what really pushes my buttons is people who stand at the front of the elevator, in the way of others. Surely they know one must go stand against the wall, starting at the back, facing the door until all the wall space is full? Should you be one of the last people to enter the torture chamber, your punishment is to enter the nucleus and be non-sexuallytouched by strangers on all sides.After a brief glance of acknowledgment at other passengers, have the courtesy to avoid eye contact. Either cast your eyes down or watch the numbers slowly tick past as you pass each floor.If demand is high and there are loads of people in line to get on, lift your game and make space for others. Put your phone away. Take your backpack off. Unless, of course, it’s strategically hanging over the head of a small child and you’re playing a game of human Tetris.But above all, please, when the doors close on a crammed elevator, do not be the person to say “apparently this space is meant to hold 25 people” because while your captive audience will smile and laugh politely, you will not end up with a Netflix standup special.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestylePetty gripescommentShareReuse this content"

The formidable task now for Dame Sarah will be to provide the leadership to make it happen.As astate-educatedformer NHS worker who rose to become England’s chief nursing officer, the 106th occupant of St Augustine’s chair is a very different proposition to Justin Welby, her Old Etonian predecessor. But many of the challenges she confronts remain the same. Her immediate priority must be to end the cycle of failure in dealing with historical abuse in the church, which has led to a collapse of trust in parishes and ultimately forced Mr Welby’sresignation.After years of prevarication, a general synod next month will discussproposalsto finally outsource safeguarding to an independent body. Reform must not be delayed any longer. At the same meeting, Dame Sarah will need to reassure LGBTQ+ Anglicans that the path to same-sex marriage in the church has not been permanentlycloseddown after bitter opposition from traditionalists. In the years ahead, progress may spell trouble for its relations with conservative members of the worldwide communion. Ultimately, however, unity without true inclusion is a hollow concept.Beleaguered and short-staffed local parishes have also felt neglected and undervalued, as the Anglican hierarchy has resisted calls to boost clergy numbers on the ground. But it is in the public square that Dame Sarah may face the defining test of her period in office. Hearteningly, it is already clear that she willuseher platform and experience to highlight the crisis in social care – a national scandal that Westminster has abjectly failed to address. But she also enters Lambeth Palace at a time when new challenges are emerging for the established church.As pews have steadily emptied over the decades, secularisation was always the fundamental challenge facing any incoming archbishop. Co-option rather than marginalisation is the urgent issue now: the rise of Christian nationalism is threatening to misrepresent the faith in the name of an aggressive nativism.September’s “Unite the Kingdom”marchled by Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (AKA Tommy Robinson), in which far-right activists carried crosses and chanted “Christ is king”, has provoked a long bout of episcopal soul-searching. Though some bishops, including the Rt Rev Arun Arora,spoke outagainst a distortion of Christian values, there has been a notable lack of coherent direction from the top. For her part, Dame Sarah hassuggestedthat in a divided society “people are frightened for lots of reasons, and often that then presents in ways that, for other people, may feel threatening”.Between now and a general election that could deliver power to xenophobic forces claiming to protect Christian culture, a more robust approach than that will be required from the new archbishop. As the first woman to become the spiritual leader of the Anglican communion, Dame Sarah embodies a message of diversity and inclusion to be celebrated. In a politically febrile period, those values will also need to be stoutly defended, both inside and outside the church.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Donald Trump’s marauding behaviour as president of the first-placed superpower makes those challenges more acute. In the past, the UK’s relationship with Beijing has been anchored, andsometimes dictated, by the alliance with Washington. Mr Trump’s contempt for former allies, expressed as sabotage of Nato and a scattergun imposition of tariffs, scrambles the old strategic calculus.This is an ominous backdrop for Sir Keir Starmer’s visit to Beijing. The prime minister is trying to perform a difficult balancing act, looking for commercial opportunity in agrowing powerhousewhile protecting national security from an authoritarian behemoth.China accounts for just under a fifth ofglobal gross domestic product. Itsmanufacturing outputis greater than all G7 nations combined. It has a formidable AI sector, the only one in the world that competes with the US. It leads the world in green energy technology – a field the current climate-sceptic White House administration is happy to neglect.It would be irrational to refuse to have a functional dialogue with such a country. Sir Keir is right when he observes that Britain has become an outlier in Europe in this respect and that the eight-year interval since the last trip by a prime minister to Beijing was too long. Kemi Badenoch’s claim that, in Sir Keir’s place, she would not go, demonstrates only that she has not thought seriously about what the top job involves.Conservatives who accuse Sir Keir of performing a “kowtow” to Xi Jinping are quicker to enumerate all the things they dislike about Chinese Communist party rule than to describe a better alternative policy to cautious engagement.There are good reasons to be cautious, and points of profound disagreement must not be brushed aside in pursuit of investment: the dismantling of civil rights in Hong Kong; the imprisonment ofJimmy Lai, a pro-democracy businessman and British citizen; the repression of theUyghur minoritythatsome Labour MPswere prepared to call genocide when in opposition; Beijing’s support for Vladimir Putin, enabling his war on Ukraine; aggressive espionage, described by a former MI6 chief as a “full press”; intimidation of dissidents in Britain’s Chinese diaspora. The list goes on.Sir Keir haspledgedto “raise what needs to be raised” with President Xi – a standard diplomatic euphemism allowing for cursory mention of delicate topics. In a moresubstantial expositionof his foreign policy approach last year, the prime minister also insisted that engagement with China would never lead him to “trade off security in one area, for a bit more economic access somewhere else”.That is a fine ambition. In practice, the drive for greater commercial intimacy and the requirement for strategic wariness will inevitably create tensions with Beijing. Sir Keir has form when it comes to denying the existence of such conflicts of interest. Herefuses to accept, for example, that his courtship of President Trump and his reset of relations with the EU pull Britain in different directions.The contradiction between upholding values of democracy and befriending President Xi is even more stark. That is not a reason to refuse engagement, but it will take more than pre-summit assurances from the prime minister to prove that he can get the balance right.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I began my studies in 1999, part of the New Labour push to widen access to university. Had I known then that I would still be repaying this “loan” for the rest of my working life, I might have thought twice.The original premise was that student loans were a small, manageable contribution, easily cleared once you entered work. At the time, it was routine for more privileged families to take the low-interest loan even if it wasn’t needed, park it in savings and repay it later in a lump sum. For those of us who relied on the loan simply to live, that option never existed.Like many friends from working-class backgrounds, it took years to earn consistently above the repayment threshold. Some are now in their 40s and have still never reached it. Unlike later student loans, there is no write-off after 20 or 30 years. For those who entered university between 1998 and 2006, the debt remains until age 65, while interest has more than doubled the original amount.This has created a forgotten cohort, encouraged into higher education in the name of social mobility yet left with a lifelong financial burden if we lack family wealth or early access to opportunity. While later cohorts have a fixed write-off date, working-class graduates are still penalised when secure work comes later, paying for longer and carrying the psychological burden of debt through the years when life is most expensive.If the government is serious about supporting working-class people, it must confront how student finance across all cohorts penalises delayed access to opportunity rather than lack of effort.Gina TsangLiverpoolRupert Jones well describes the inequities in the student loan system, but it is even worse than he reveals. The student loan debt is a part of the national debt. The interest accruing to a graduate’s debt therefore increases the national debt on which the Treasury then pays interest. So the interest paid by graduates is a mirage.The solution is a zero-interest regime. This would remove the inter-cohort inequities that arise as loan schemes change, and would mean that debts are paid off more quickly, to the benefit of both graduates and the national debt. Write-offs would be drastically reduced, another saving to the public purse.A further inequity of the current scheme is that because repayments are a surcharge on earnings, high earners pay off loans more quickly than lower earners, who pay more because of accrued interest. With zero interest, high earners pay off even more quickly, to the benefit of public finances. And lower earners take more time but do not have to pay more. So everybody is paying the same for the same product. As a byproduct, such a simplified system would dramatically reduce the costs of the Student Loans Company.Norman GowarEmeritus professor, University of LondonIt was so good to read a feature on student loans and the spiralling debt many young people face – my 26-year-old twin daughters included. The system is horrendous, with so many young people facing a lifetime of debt under a contract over which they have no control.Moreover, many of these young people used their maintenance loans to pay rent to private landlords, whose mortgages are therefore effectively being paid by the taxpayer. Any increase in equity is enjoyed almost risk-free by these landlords, while the debt is shouldered by the young, many of whom will struggle to ever buy their own home. Am I alone in considering this very unfair? Why not tax some of this increase in equity to reduce the debt burden for young people and taxpayers alike?Debbie BalderstonKingswinford, West MidlandsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The outgoing director general is right: the threat to BBC universality within the next charter period is very real. But that threat in part is coming from the corporation itself.The BBC is proposing to switch off digital terrestrial television (DTT, or Freeview) in 2034. This would force all UK homes to take out a high-speed broadband subscription or lose access to BBC services. For the first time, you’d need a subscription to watch “free-to-air” UK TV.Switching off DTT would push the entry cost for access to UK television to more than £500 per annum. That’s a conservative estimate of the cost of theBBC licence feeplus a decent fixed broadband subscription. By 2034, the combined cost is likely to be much higher.This approach would hit the poorest and the oldest in our society hardest. Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable households could lose access to TV altogether. The era ofBBCuniversality would be at an end.The BBC’s response to this challenge is to make it someone else’s problem. The pensioners and poorer homes impacted would just have to find the money somewhere – or perhaps might qualify for a new public subsidy yet to be invented, let alone funded.The alternative to such wishful thinking is simple: maintain Freeview – and BBC universality – into the 2040s. No new public funding would be needed. There would be zero risk to those vulnerable homes still dependent on DTT. And the cost would be equivalent to just 1% or 2% of BBC revenue. Ultimately, as Davie says, preserving BBC universality should be a “societal choice”. That choice should not be prejudged by an ill-considered and premature Freeview switch-off.Christy SwordsFormer ITV executive and former chairman of ITN; adviser to the DTT infrastructure provider ArqivaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

No other large tropical ecosystem on Earth has been so well protected, and its value to the science of ecology is correspondingly immense.It is not species richness or abundance that singles the Chagos out: it is the ecosystem’s near-natural functioning. Mauritian plans for fishing and other exploitation are not compatible with protection of the last great tropical wilderness area – which is currently teaching us how to repair and protect others.If politicians could vote to save the dodo, one hopes they would.

These schemes are colonial-like from a global analytical perspective, and local residents have long subverted and refuted their terms because they represent “poverty porn”. They also reify the community in ways that don’t work for those who sign up for them.Research inTanzaniashowed that local staff were uneasy with the core premise. But pressures came from further up the chain, and it was often a pragmatic choice to retain a key source of unrestricted funding (for other fantastic advocacy work that project-based NGOs can’t always do).Nevertheless, relations between NGO staff and families who had a sponsored child could be fraught, and it was often up to an unsalaried community volunteer to manage these difficult tensions – thankless and endless work.Recent approaches, like that of GiveDirectly, innovate less colonial-like models whereby money is given so that people can invest in their futures without conditions or agendas, or being forced to exchange letters or photographs with donors. Such schemes are not without their issues, but mark a considerable improvement.Kathy DodworthResearch fellow, King’s College LondonAs a longstanding ActionAid supporter, I was astonished to read the vituperative coverage of the change of emphasis in this charity’s work and its sudden pejorative dismissal of its longstanding child sponsorship programme and the motives of its supporters.Through its scheme, I have proudly sponsored community development, children and women’s education, and their welfare and livelihood skills development, including women’s empowerment, equality and justice training, all shaped by community needs and voices. Or so I believed. I have never been asked by the charity to “choose” a child from a photograph.The researcher Themrise Khan, quoted in your article, says that governments should fund education, state welfare systems and healthcare, but the truth of the matter is that they do not.Is it now so politically incorrect to try to improve the lives of all children and women everywhere because this is “paternalistic” and “transactional”, as Taahra Ghazi, ActionAid’s co-chief executive, states? If so, heaven help all females, but bring on the debate.Perhaps ActionAid’s new co-chief executives need to pause and consider if they are actually guilty of the paternalism of which they accuse their supporters. A little bit of communication, information and participatory engagement by the charity with its own community of supporters and fewer attacks may well do less to alienate those of us who, with real commitment, have raised funds and donated to support women and children.As for community “sisterhoods” of support for ActionAid?

All over the place during a wretched first half, an inspired comeback hadChelseacelebrating at full time. They had looked to Palmer for inspiration and, although the attacker was kept in reserve until the second half, he did enough during his time on the pitch to show why Chelsea have responded to suggestions that their main man is pining for a return to Manchester by branding him untouchable.It was a cutting cameo from the player whose virtuoso brilliance downed Paris Saint-Germainin the Club World Cup finallast summer. Introduced with Chelsea 2-1 down against Napoli and staring at the prospect of a two-leg playoff to reach the last 16 of the Champions League, Palmer was minimalistic but impactful. The 23-year-old’s presence alone was enough to restore order and, even if he is still not in peak condition, his first assists of a season disrupted by an array of niggles were a reminder of what Chelsea have been missing while their best player has been recovering from nagging groin and thigh complaints.‘A great marker’: Rosenior lauds young Chelsea side for comeback win at NapoliRead morePalmer’s cameo was notable for its poise, calm and accuracy. He was involved when Chelsea pulled it back to 2-2, drifting in from the right to tee up João Pedro for a ­barnstorming equaliser.Napoli, who needed a win to avoid a humiliating early exit, were stung. They left themselves open as they chased a third goal and were caught out again when Palmer slid a beautiful pass through to João Pedro, whose second goal of the night ensured that Chelsea finished the league phase in sixth place.It was not straightforward. For Antonio Conte, though, Napoli’s elimination was a continuation of his dreadful European record. The Italian champions tired in the second half and Conte, the last manager to lead Chelsea to the Premier League title, had no way of responding when Rosenior made a series of smart alterations.Quick GuideChampions League: draw dates and playoff pathsShowPlayoff roundThe teams ranked 9th-24th will contest the playoff round, with Friday's draw determining which team from each pair below will go into which path.

He matched Conte’s 3-4-2-1 system and explained that he wanted to go man for man but Chelsea were confused before half-time. Wesley Fofana was the only recognised centre-back in the team – a curious decision given that Rosenior had four defenders on the bench – there was plenty of space behind Chelsea’s wing-backs during the first half.Pedro Neto and Malo Gusto struggled. Behind when Juan Jesus handled a Reece James free-kick and Enzo Fernández put Chelsea in front from the spot in the 19th ­minute, Napoli responded in style. They swept forward and equalised through a fine solo goal from Antonio ­Vergara, who held off a challenge from Moisés Caicedo and turned beyond Fofana before driving a low shot past Robert Sánchez.View image in fullscreenAntonio Vergara (second right) scored a superb solo goal to equaliser for Napoli.Photograph: Ciro De Luca/ReutersIt was Napoli’s first goal from open play in the competition this season. Conte had said they were in a state of emergency because of their injury problems. They have lacked creativity without Kevin De Bruyne, absent since October with a torn hamstring, but they repeatedly picked Chelsea apart. Scott McTominay was dominant in midfield and was not the only former Manchester United player who caught the eye. Rasmus Højlund was also in the mood and put Napoli in front when he darted beyond Fofana to turn Mathias ­Olivera’s cross in from close range.Chelsea were arguing among themselves when the first half ended. Rosenior responded by replacing Neto with Palmer. Napoli sat back in an attempt to protect their lead. There was a lot of possession for Chelsea at the start of the second half but the challenge was making it count in the final third.There was no sign of an improvement from the visitors as the hour approached. It felt as if Rosenior was owning up to a tactical error when he removed Gusto for Trevoh Chalobah, who moved alongside Fofana in ­central defence. Jamie Gittens was also introduced on the left. Andrey Santos, the young Brazilian, made way in midfield. The setup felt more conventional. Estêvão moved to No 10, ­Fernández dropped next to Caicedo in midfield and Chelsea found their flow. Palmer stirred. His flick found João Pedro and the ­forward drew Chelsea level by ripping an ­outrageous shot past Alex Meret from 25 yards.Mohamed Salah back among the goals as Liverpool thrash QarabagRead moreThe goal meant Napoli were on their way out. They had to push again. Romelu Lukaku, just back from a long-term injury, came on to face his old side. Yet Chelsea would not be haunted by their past.They waited for Napoli to commit players forward. Their patience was rewarded when Palmer released João Pedro, who raced away, swerved right and ­finished emphatically.Sánchez denied Lukaku a late equaliser. Napoli were beaten at home for the first time since December 2024.Chelsea, with their first away win at this level since October 2022, had silenced some of the noise about their inexperience.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal819242Bayern Munich814213Liverpool812184Tottenham Hotspur810175Barcelona88166Chelsea87167Sporting86168Man City86169Real Madrid891510Inter Milan881511PSG8101412Newcastle8101413Juventus841314Atletico Madrid821315Atalanta801316Bayer Leverkusen8-11217Borussia Dortmund821118Olympiacos8-41119Club Brugge8-21020Galatasaray8-21021Monaco8-61022Qarabag FK8-81023Bodo/Glimt8-1924Benfica8-2925Marseille8-3926AE Pafos8-3927Union Saint Gilloise8-9928PSV80829Athletic Bilbao8-5830Napoli8-6831Copenhagen8-9832Ajax8-13633Eintracht Frankfurt8-11434Slavia Prague8-14335Villarreal8-13136FC Kairat8-151Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNapoliChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

To extend the mixologist’s analogy, his team are enjoying life with a few margaritas in theChampions League.Slot’s side cruised into the last 16 for the second successive season with a demolition of Qarabag at Anfield. Mohamed Salah was among the goalscorers for the first time since accusingLiverpoolof throwing him under the bus, while Alexis Mac Allister, Florian Wirtz, the potent Hugo Ekitiké and substitute Federico Chiesa were also on the scoresheet.João Pedro’s double dumps out Napoli as Chelsea avoid playoff with late winRead moreThe biggest victory of his Liverpool reign plus a clean sheet were the perfect tonic for Slot following defeat at Bournemouth. Avoiding next month’s two-legged playoff is an added bonus given his mounting injury problems. Six wins out of eight in the Champions League group, including against both Madrid clubs and Inter, serve as a reminder of the pedigree that Liverpool possess but have failed to show consistently in their troubled title defence.“We’re happy to be going straight into the last 16, especially as only two years ago we were playing in the Europa League and went out in the quarter-finals to Atalanta,” said Slot, whose team will play either Juventus, Atlético Madrid, Galatasaray or Club Brugge in the last 16. “Now we are two seasons running in the top eight of the Champions League and we are hungry for more this season.”Slot’s night did not get off to the best start. Already shorn of defensive options and needing Ryan Gravenberch to deputise for Ibrahima Konaté in central defence, Liverpool lost Jeremie Frimpong to injury in the second minute. The full-back pulled up while pursuing aQarabagclearance down his right flank. Credit to the visiting captain, Abdellah Zoubir, for putting the ball out of play immediately for the full-back to receive treatment. Frimpong has previously sustained two hamstring injuries during his debut season at Anfield and was distraught when limping off. Slot could only confirm this was a muscle injury.View image in fullscreenAlexis Mac Allister scores his second goal of the evening.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe thought went to Slot’s pre-match press conference, when he defended withdrawing Frimpong against Bournemouth on the basis the Netherlands international was tired and his workload needed managing carefully. “If people knew the struggles we and I are facing, they would be more understanding of the decisions I make,” the head coach had said.Frimpong’s exit and Wataru Endo’s arrival left Liverpool with a back four comprising two defenders and two midfielders. Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson and Milos Kerkez were the only fit, recognised defenders available to Slot although he is hopeful Konaté will return from compassionate leave against Newcastle on Saturday. Joe Gomez could also be back from a hip problem.Quick GuideChampions League: draw dates and playoff pathsShowPlayoff roundThe teams ranked 9th-24th will contest the playoff round, with Friday's draw determining which team from each pair below will go into which path.

Slot’s team took the lead from a set piece, much to his delight. Dominik Szoboszlai’s corner flicked off the defender Kevin Medina and was met at the back post by Van Dijk. His header bounced up for Mac Allister to nod over the line before Mateusz Kochalski could claw clear.It was soon two when Ekitiké held up Robertson’s ball and spun away from two Qarabag players before squaring inside to Wirtz. A chasm opened up in the middle of the visitors’ defence, giving the Germany international time and space to pick his spot in the bottom corner.Brave Newcastle fall short but Willock leveller sends PSG to playoffs tooRead moreThere was no let-up for Qarabag after the interval. In a role reversal of their free-kick routine at Bournemouth, Szoboszlai back-heeled the ball for Salah to sweep a similarly emphatic finish into the top corner. It was the Egypt international’s 49th goal in the Champions League, his first in any competition for Liverpool since 1 November and, notably, his first sincethatinterview at Leeds. Salah pointedly marked the moment by facing the Kop and thumping the Liver bird on his chest.Ekitiké got the goal his performance deserved when beating one Qarabag central defender after the other to a long clearance out of the Liverpool penalty area. Having sprinted away from both Bahlul Mustafazade and Medina, the striker swept a clinical finish past their goalkeeper.The visitors’ display was by now disintegrating and Mac Allister claimed his second goal of the night when Matheus Silva sliced a Szoboszlai pass into the path of the Argentina midfielder. Mac Allister duly waltzed around Kochalski and tapped into an empty net. Chiesa completed the rout when Van Dijk surged out of defence and found the Italian striker in space inside the area.“If we improve in both boxes it is going to be very hard for any team to play against us,” Slot said. “But one game is not enough. We have to do it more often.”PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal819242Bayern Munich814213Liverpool812184Tottenham Hotspur810175Barcelona88166Chelsea87167Sporting86168Man City86169Real Madrid891510Inter Milan881511PSG8101412Newcastle8101413Juventus841314Atletico Madrid821315Atalanta801316Bayer Leverkusen8-11217Borussia Dortmund821118Olympiacos8-41119Club Brugge8-21020Galatasaray8-21021Monaco8-61022Qarabag FK8-81023Bodo/Glimt8-1924Benfica8-2925Marseille8-3926AE Pafos8-3927Union Saint Gilloise8-9928PSV80829Athletic Bilbao8-5830Napoli8-6831Copenhagen8-9832Ajax8-13633Eintracht Frankfurt8-11434Slavia Prague8-14335Villarreal8-13136FC Kairat8-151Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueLiverpoolQarabagmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We are very together at the moment. We’re connected on the pitch. We’re doing things with a lot of discipline.”Corinthians’ 1-0 defeat of Gotham FCin the first Champions Cup semi-final earlier in the day had provided an upset at Brentford’s Gtech stadium but there was no risk of Africa’s Champions League winners doing the same to their European counterparts – the developmental gulf is just too big.This was the first time an African women’s club had met a European club in a competitive official match and the Moroccan side were worthy representatives, their qualification for the Champions Cup thanks to a steady development that has led to them winning two Champions League titles in four years.“Compliments to the opposition,” said Slegers. “Of course, it was a hard game for them tonight, but I think the way they presented themselves and the way they represented football in Morocco and as the champions of Africa, it was very inspirational.“What they’re doing is inspiring so many people, hopefully so many young girls see the opportunities to play football and that this is possible.”This was the next step and, regardless of a run of five wins in a row prior to the meeting with England’s most decorated side, they set up accordingly, a back five and four in the ­middle with Sanaa Mssoudy their lone target up front.View image in fullscreenMariona Caldentey (No 8) with her teammates after scoring Arsenal’s third.Photograph: Alastair Grant/APDespite that defensive shape, they were quickly undone by their opponents, who opened the scoring in the eighth minute when Blackstenius nodded the ball over the line before it was hooked clear by Aziza Rabbah and goalline technology confirmed it had crossed.Four minutes later Arsenal had a second via Maanum who converted as she spun round to face goal, the club’s much-changed but still potent and experienced starting XI delivering the efficient performance needed before the final on Sunday and then an important Women’s Super League game against the leaders Manchester City next week.Ultimately, this is a tournament Arsenal could have done without, at this stage of the season at least, with the pressure about to ramp up when Champions League football restarts in two weeks’ time, but a trophy is a trophy and with a chunk of a £1.7m prize pot available the incentive to take it seriously was there.The third goal arrived courtesy of a Zineb Redouani handball in the box, picked up by the video assistant referee, and Caldentey converted from the spot before Olivia Smith provided the fourth. Russo entered the fray at the hour mark and two goals within 10 minutes followed soon after.“Now we’ve earned the right to play in the final, that’s one step closer to being history-makers and that’s what we want to be,” said Slegers. “Full respect to Corinthians and what they did against Gotham, that was very impressive, so it’s going to be a tough game.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Champions CupArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As for PSG, the rest of Europe will look at the reigning champions with a little less fear. Vitinha remains a wonderful midfield controller, but the furious full-court press that marked last season’s post-Christmas run was absent here. Newcastle were compact, quick in the transitions, and really could have won this game in the second half.Paris had been a lovely deep languid grey all afternoon, the only city that looks better in drab, sad January light. By kick-off the Parc des Princes was the usual inferno of choreographed noise. But this was a confusingly poised final group phase game at the start, neither fully alive nor fully dead.Quick GuideChampions League: draw dates and playoff pathsShowPlayoff roundThe teams ranked 9th-24th will contest the playoff round, with Friday's draw determining which team from each pair below will go into which path.

There are so many referred problems when you mess with the robustness of a format, and once again this rejigged first phase had been a meander towards a wildly convoluted final night. Straight-line jeopardy is too much to expect. But it should at least be possible to understand what’s going on before the whole thing falls on your head in the final wash-up like the contents of an over-stuffed cupboard.Howe made five changes here fromSunday’s defeat against Aston Villa, the net effect of which was a switch to a back three. And PSG swarmed all over Newcastle from the start. With 45 seconds gone they were awarded a penalty. Lewis Miley chased Bradley Barcola back towards goal. The ball bobbled up and hit Barcola’s elbow before brushing Miley’s hand. This was deemed a penalty after a screen check. Ousmane Dembélé’s kick was well saved by Nick Pope. It felt right. The penalty was a very soft call.With seven minutes gone it was 1-0 all the same. The goal was made by a thrust down the right from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who danced Dan Burn around a little before easing a pass inside to Vitinha, who had time to ease to his left, gently sit Lewis Hall down, then curl a shot into the corner.View image in fullscreenNick Pope saved Ousmane Dembélé’s early penalty.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPADembélé might have added a second four minutes later as Newcastle’s backline was repeatedly picked apart by some fine-point passing. For a while they looked horribly porous on the right, where Barcola and the roving Dembélé presented a nightmarish prospect for Miley in a try-it-and-see wing-back role.With 20 minutes gone Newcastle had settled. Nick Woltemade had a first real chance on 40 minutes but failed to make contact with a header after a long throw (meet: the Premier League). And it was a similar aerial route that led to Newcastle’s equaliser just before half-time. The ball was pumped into the box by Sandro Tonali, headed up in the air awkwardly by Marquinhos, flicked back by Burn and nodded in neatly by Joe Willock.Newcastle looked the more dangerous team at the start of the second half. Miley showed huge resilience to settle and find his angles on the right. PSG seemed to stall a little. Without the full three-man midfield press they lack a little fury and craft. Barcola did his Barcola thing, dancing, gliding, pirouetting through the Newcastle defence, then spanking a shovel-footed shot towards the upper tiers.Howe sent on Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes with 22 minutes to go and Newcastle standing ninth in the mega-table on current scorelines, PSG still just inside the magic eight. Howe’s front five pressed really high at times. Woltemade dropped deep between Barnes and Gordon and showed his best qualities as a gangling link-man, beanpole playmaker, No 10 manque.Luis Enrique had spoken before the game about Newcastle’s physicality, but only in terms of how this makes it even more vital to control the game, take the ball away, meet muscle with craft. Here though Newcastle were compact and smart on the break as this half-alive final game began to throb with late-breaking vigour.Towards the end PSG found themselves fumbling for the throttle again as news seeped through of late goals for Inter that dropped them into the playoff spots. Vitinha spanked the ball just over the bar. Overall PSG had 25 shots to Newcastle’s seven. But they left the pitch to whistles from the home crowd, and with a notable case of aura-depletion in the air.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal819242Bayern Munich814213Liverpool812184Tottenham Hotspur810175Barcelona88166Chelsea87167Sporting86168Man City86169Real Madrid891510Inter Milan881511PSG8101412Newcastle8101413Juventus841314Atletico Madrid821315Atalanta801316Bayer Leverkusen8-11217Borussia Dortmund821118Olympiacos8-41119Club Brugge8-21020Galatasaray8-21021Monaco8-61022Qarabag FK8-81023Bodo/Glimt8-1924Benfica8-2925Marseille8-3926AE Pafos8-3927Union Saint Gilloise8-9928PSV80829Athletic Bilbao8-5830Napoli8-6831Copenhagen8-9832Ajax8-13633Eintracht Frankfurt8-11434Slavia Prague8-14335Villarreal8-13136FC Kairat8-151Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations team has long worked the Super Bowl and other major sporting events, largely focused on preventing human trafficking and stopping the sale of counterfeit goods, but immigration operations would be unusual.“We have heard from the administration that they intend to have ICE at the Super Bowl. I don’t know how much of that is rhetoric,” Matt Mahan, the San Jose mayor, toldKTVU.‘Fascism is here now’: the US athletes pushing back on Trump’s AmericaRead moreThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to confirm reports about operations around Levi’s Stadium on 8 February, writing in a statement that the agency does “not disclose future operations or discuss personnel”.“DHS is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure theSuper Bowlis safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the World Cup,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin, adding that security for the event would include a response “conducted in-line with the US constitution”.“Those who are here legally and are not breaking other laws have nothing to fear.”The move, which comes as the administration faces mounting criticism over its immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota and the killings of two US citizens by federal agents, has caused concern in the community, particularly for vulnerable families.“It’s going to increase the level of tension and fear in our area,” Peter Ortiz of the San Jose city council told theSan José Spotlight. “We’re already seeing that they are scared to go out to eat, scared to go to the local corner store, scared to send their kids to school.”Corey Lewandowski, an adviser to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, announced last fall that agents would conduct operations during the Super Bowl.“There is nowhere that you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally, not the Super Bowl, and nowhere else,” Lewandowski said on the Benny Johnson podcast. “We will find you, we will apprehend you, we will put you in a detention facility and we will deport you.”Noem also confirmed ICE operations at the game during aninterviewwith that same podcaster.“We’ll be all over that place,” she said. “We’re gonna enforce the law so I think people should not be coming to the Super Bowl unless they are law-abiding Americans who love this country.”The agency has collaborated with theNFLfor two decades, according to a DHS statement, and sent nearly 700 employees to New Orleans last year to aid in security for the event, and “intellectual property enforcement”.But Trump administration officials have derided the NFL as “woke” and criticized the decision to have Bad Bunny perform at this year’s half-time show. The Puerto Rican artist, who will perform along with Green Day,opted not to includeUS stops on his latest tour over concerns his fans could face ICE raids.Donald Trump described the half-time show entertainment this year as a “terrible choice” and said he will not attend the game.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationSuper BowlNFLnewsShareReuse this content"

Reed will spend his immediate time on the DP World Tour, where he won the Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday. Reed tees up in Bahrain from Thursday.It would now be only natural for LIV to be anxious about talent drain which once ran in their favour.Rory McIlroy backs Muirfield for Open return despite ‘lowest point’ in 2013Read moreAt Reed’s post-tournament media conference in Dubai he surprisingly revealed he had not yet committed to LIV for this year. He joined the Saudi Arabian‑backed tour in 2022 in a deal worth tens of millions of dollars. In a statement posted on Wednesday, the 2018 Masters winner explained his switch.“After careful thought and consideration, my family and I have decided that I will no longer compete on the LIV Golf Tour,” Reed said. “I am excited to announce that I am returning to thePGA Touras a past champion member for the 2027 season and am eligible to begin competing in PGA Tour events later this year.“I will continue to compete and play as an honorary lifetime ­member on the DP World Tour, which is ­something that I am truly honored and excited to do. I’m a traditionalist at heart, and I was born to play on the PGA Tour.”In its own statement, the PGA Tour said: “Patrick Reed has informed the PGA Tour of his desire to return. A nine-time PGA Tour ­winner, he is seeking reinstatement of his PGA Tour membership for the 2027 season, playing out of the past ­champion category.“As a result of resigning his membership in 2022 prior to violating any PGA Tour regulations, Patrick is ­eligible to compete on the PGA Tour as a non-member beginning on 25 August 2026. He may also pursue improved PGA Tour status via the DP World Tour.”The top 10 players on the DP World Tour’s order of merit, not already exempt, earn PGA Tour cards this year. Koepka was reinstated immediately on the PGA Tour via criteria which applied to major winners from 2022 onwards.The exits of Koepka and Reed leave Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Smith as the most significant ­players on LIV. Attention will turn naturally towards if or when that trio seek to beat a path back towards the PGA Tour.Explore more on these topicsLIV Golf SeriesPGA TourGolfEuropean TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was here that he began his stratospheric run against the red ball, adouble hundred at Galle in 2021the first of 24 Test tons in the next five years. Go back to 2014, his first visit to the country with England, and there’s an unbeaten 50-over century in Pallekele, a trick he repeated on Tuesday in Colombo.As Root and Brook sat on the Premadasa outfield afterEngland’s 53-run win in the deciding one-day international, it was the former’s shirt that one supporter repeatedly pleaded for from the stands, never mind what the captain had just done. Local admiration is expected when the 35-year-old has never left a tour of Sri Lanka without at least one match winning knock.Brook’s ‘Stone Cold’ celebration in England series win as Root praises ‘great leader’Read more“I’ve found a good method to manage these surfaces,” Root said in his understated closing remarks for the series, having finished with 247 runs in three innings. The reverse sweeps were a standout in the third one-dayer, his general timing the clincher in the second when even Brook struggled for clean contact. A collapse followed his dismissal for 61 in the first. Chuck in a couple of wickets with his off-breaks, even if they were tailenders at the death, and the numbers get prettier.But that’s it for the winter. As has been the case for nearly seven years now, Root is not part of England T20 team, out of the reckoning as they begin a three-match series in Pallekele on Friday before moving to India next week for the World Cup. Was he ever under consideration for the tournament? “Probably not, no,” Brook said on Tuesday evening. “He’s obviously such a phenomenal player, in all conditions, he’s done it everywhere. Unfortunately he wasn’t quite in the mix.”Minutes later, Root added: “I’m quite aware of where I probably sit within the international team in that format. I don’t think I’ll give that up, but I know I’m a long way off it. That’s part and parcel of the game. Those guys fully deserve to be ahead of me, they’re an incredible group of players.”He is right on that last count. It’s a batting lineup possessing three of the top five that played in the victorious 2022 final against Pakistan. There’s strong experience in India – Phil Salt and Jos Buttler have been particularly brilliant in recent IPL seasons – and the achievement of breaching 300 against South Africa last summer.But there’s always room for nuance in a major tournament, and power is not everything. Men’sT20 World Cupfinals are not range-hitting contests; no side has ever reached 180. When England defeated Pakistan in Melbourne a little over three years ago, they were grateful for Ben Stokes’s 49-ball 52, keeping his nerve to see things through.Quick GuideStokes joins England Lions coaching teamShowTest captain Ben Stokes will join the England Lions coaching team in the United Arab Emirates next month. Stokes is currently recovering from an adductor injury suffered in the fifth Ashes Test in Australia earlier this month.But the 34-year-old will be part of Andrew Flintoff's coaching staff for T20 and 50-over white-ball series against Pakistan Shaheens and continue his rehabilitation work in the UAE.The coaching team - which will attend either all or part of the tour - also includes Neil McKenzie, Sarah Taylor, Neil Killeen, Moeen Ali and Amar Rashid, while it will be Troy Cooley's first tour since returning to the England and Wales Cricket Board as men's elite national pace bowling lead.Spinner Moeen joins the Lions for the first time as a coach, while Jordan Cox and Dan Mousley will captain the respective T20 and 50-over squads.The Lions will play a three-match T20 series and five 50-over matches, their first away white-ball series since visiting Sri Lanka in 2022.Lions T20 squad:J Cox (Essex, capt), S Baker (Hampshire), L Benkenstein (Essex), J Coles (Sussex), S Cook (Essex), S Currie (Hampshire), C Harrison (Northamptonshire), E Jack (Hampshire), S Mahmood (Lancashire), B McKinney (Durham), T Moores (Nottinghamshire), D Mousley (Warwickshire), M Revis (Yorkshire), W Smeed (Somerset), N Sowter (Durham), M Stanley (Lancashire), A Tribe (Glamorgan).Lions 50-over squad:D Mousley (Warwickshire, capt), S Baker (Hampshire), L Benkenstein (Essex), S Cook (Essex), J Coles (Sussex), S Currie (Hampshire), C Harrison (Northamptonshire), E Jack (Hampshire), B McKinney (Durham), L Patterson-White (Nottinghamshire), M Potts (Durham), M Revis (Yorkshire), J Rew (Somerset), M Stanley (Lancashire), A Tribe (Glamorgan), J Wharton (Yorkshire).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Root knows the situation well. His 33-ball half-century threatened to be the winning knock of the 2016 final against West Indies in Kolkata until Carlos Brathwaite intervened in the final moments. Even as limits continue to expand in the 20-over game, there is space for an anchor when everything is on the line. Root fits the part, there as the nerveless nurdler for the backend of the tournament and the 150-something chase.Perhaps he could have been brought out from the cold in a similar way to Stokes in 2022, when the all-rounder hadn’t played any T20 cricket in over a year. Instead, Root will watch on with plenty of admiration, the World Cup group having been selected before the Sri Lanka series. “I look at that squad of players, it’s a hell of a team,” he added.His tour is over, ending a fascinating season abroad. Twenty-nine runs in three ODIs against New Zealand were followed by just eight more in the Ashes opener. Pat Cummins, his great nemesis, nicked him off twice in the quick’s only appearance of the series, and the overall story did not change as Root left his fourth Ashes tour still waiting for collective glory.But he ended the noise over that missing Test hundred in Australia, turning one into two, and at least shared a victorious hug with Stokes at the MCG. If there was any lingering misery, he masterfully put it aside in Colombo to end England’s dreadful recent run in ODIs away from home, sweating his way to a series average of 123.5.Throw in that hundred at Sydney and he finds himself in serious touch again. It seems a waste that England will not have him for the final act.Explore more on these topicsJoe RootEngland cricket teamT20 World CupCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Last Friday, Mia Brookes, 19, soared to X Games gold in thesnowboard slopestyle in Aspen. Zoe Atkin, 23, followed suit in thefreeski superpipeand before the weekend was throughKirsty Muir, 21, added a third gold in the freeski slopestyle, along with a big air silver.All told it was a hugely successful time for GB Snowsport, with Charlotte Bankes winning her first World Cup snowboard cross event since breaking her collarbone in April in China the previous week. Little wonder, then, that Atkin is bullish about the British skiers’ and snowboarders’ chances in Italy.From scrums to the slopes: how rugby’s life lessons have helped hone Team GB’s Winter OlympiansRead more“We have a really strong team,” she says. “We have so many amazing snowsport athletes, like Mia, Kirsty and Charlotte, and we’re finding our stride at the perfect time.”That belief is shared by UK Sport, which forecastsTeam GBcould win up to eight medals, eclipsing the record five achieved in Sochi and Pyeongchang. If they do, strong performances from Atkins, Brookes, Muir and Bankes, along with the curlers and sliders, will be key.Four years ago, GB Snowsport expected to win a couple of medals at the Winter Games in Beijing, but left empty-handed. Soon afterwards they had their funding for the Milano-Cortina cycle cut by UK Sport, from £9.53m to £7.27m.The decision felt harsh, given Covid restrictions and Brexit meant British athletes had less time to prepare on the snow than many others. Beijing during lockdown was no picnic either.View image in fullscreenSnowboarder Mia Brookes shows off her slopestyle gold medal in Aspen.Photograph: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesVicky Gosling, the chief executive of GB Snowsport, says: “Having been in austere environments with my military background, I can tell you it felt hostile and austere when we arrived there. Everybody was in hazmat suits, wheeling us off the plane. You were tested for Covid every day. And it was -26c.”It didn’t help either that during a test event a Team GB coach was whisked off for 24 hours to a hospital, where doctors took blood from him. “Some of the things that happened in Beijing, you couldn’t have planned for at all,” says Gosling. “After all, a Norwegiancross-country skier’s penis froze.”We’ve gone from a mentality of being grateful for being at the start line to one where we want to win.So how did the GB’s Big Tricks and Adrenaline Dept get its mojo back? Part of it is down to a young team being four years older, better and more experienced. Muir, who finished fifth and eighth in her two events in Beijing, says: “Seventeen-year-old Kirsty was just a bit shy and nervous all the time. Now I have more confidence. I am really happy in my skiing and I’m feeling really good.”GB Snowsport, which will supply 20 of Team GB’s 53 athletes for Milano-Cortina, believe it has introduced a range of measures, big and small, that have made a major difference. In sports where speed is the major factor, say, special tech skinsuits have been introduced to reduce drag in competition, allowing athletes to go faster.The Joy of Six: unlikely Winter Olympics starsRead moreTo help athletes mentally prepare, there has not only been more investment in sport psychologists, but also more innovative thinking. Last year, Muir and the freeski park & pipe team went through a free-diving programme during the off season in order to develop techniques that would help them mentally during high-stress competition.More of the team’s summer training has been pushed to the southern hemisphere to avoid the challenges of lost summer glacier conditions in Europe. Gosling cites the team’s culture – and the recruitment of coaches from France, Canada, Norway and Australia, as well as Britain – as another factor. “The way we operate is by getting world-class coaches and empowering them to be decisive on the hill,” she says.“It’s like a military model: hub and spoke. We are decentralised. We’re a tiny little central team. But we give our athletes and coaches all the tools – whether it is strength and conditioning, equipment or physio support – they need.“We’ve gone from a mentality of being grateful for being at the start line to one where we want to win. That’s the difference.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte Bankes on her way to winning the World Cup snowboard cross event in China.Photograph: Action Press/ShutterstockIt hasn’t always been easy. The UK Sport cuts left Gosling scrambling around to find sponsors to make up the deficit. On one occasion, she and the GB Snowsport head coach, Pat Sharples, slept in a car in Verbier when their cheap hotel shut for the night and they felt they could not justify paying for another one.It is clear Gosling is immensely proud of the team, many of whom defy the stereotypes of coming from privileged backgrounds, and what they have accomplished. The slalom skier Dave Ryding started at the age of six on the 50m Pendle dry slope in Lancashire. Muir began skiing aged three in Aberdeen. Brookes’s parents, a mechanic and a hairdresser, combined their jobs with their love of snowboarding by driving around the continent in a camper van.“Our athletes do not come from high wealth, but what they are is Brits with grit,” says Gosling.The hope is that the team’s excellent results since 2023 will get their just rewards at theWinter Olympics. While there is the usual caveat – skiing and snowboarding are high-risk, high-reward sports and thus more subject to variance – Atkin is confident everything that could have been done has been.“We get so much support from the team, which has been huge,” she says. “I think this Olympics is going to be a good one for Team GB.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBSnowboardingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This should have never happened,” he continued.Trump has long targeted Omar, who arrived in the US as a refugee as a child and has been a citizen for more than 25 years. His xenophobic attacks on her have ramped up in recent weeks as he has targeted Minnesota’s Somali community. He recently called for her to be “sent back to Somalia” in a post on Truth Social.After the attack, lawmakers have directly blamed Trump’s rhetoric.Jasmine Crockett, the Democratic representative from Texas, said in a social media post that she was “disgusted” and “outraged”. “Let’s be clear: nonstop hate and dangerous rhetoric from Trump and his allies has fueled this type of violence.”The Minnesota representative Angie Craig said she was “relieved that my colleague Ilhan is safe”.“The rise in political violence in our state must stop,” she posted on X. “We are better than this Minnesota.”Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic senator of Maryland, said he was “relieved” that Omar was not injured. “But Trump’s response was shameful – & Republicans should say so. His baseless & racist attacks against her have no doubt endangered her. His inability to condemn the attack is appalling,” he wrote on X.Greg Landsman, a Democratic representative from Ohio, said “the rhetoric against a sitting member of Congress is un-American” and leads to more violence. “Everyone, regardless of political affiliation, should approach this moment with humility and grace. That’s how we break this cycle of division and hate.”Republicans have also spoken out against the apparent act of political violence. The South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace wrote that she was “deeply disturbed” to learn that Omar was attacked at the town hall.“Regardless of how vehemently I disagree with her rhetoric – and I do – no elected official should face physical attacks. This is not who we are.”Don Bacon, a representative of Nebraska, said on social media: “Political violence is always wrong. We always have the right to free speech and to petition the government, but political violence must be dealt with sternly.”He added that the attacker “needs to spend sometime [sic] behind bars”.Omar is the second lawmaker of color to be physically attacked in the last week. The Florida representative Maxwell Frost said he waspunched in the faceon Friday at the Sundance film festival in Utah by a man who said Trump would deport him.Explore more on these topicsIlhan OmarUS politicsDonald TrumpMinneapolisMinnesotaHakeem JeffriesnewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s also drastically obvious that it’s not a two-hander,” Tarantino told Ellis. “[Dano] is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister. [Day-Lewis] is eating him [alive]. Austin Butler would have been wonderful in that role. [Dano] is just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. Daniel Day-Lewis shows that he doesn’t need a strong foil. The movie needs it. He doesn’t need anything. It’s supposed to be a two-hander and it’s not! … you put him with the weakest fucking actor in SAG? The limpest dick in the world?“I am not saying he is giving a terrible performance, I am saying he’s giving a non-entity performance … I don’t care for him,” Tarantino concluded, also criticising the acting of Owen Wilson and Matthew Lillard.Many of Dano’s peers responded.A representative for Day-Lewis told the Guardianhe agreed with the sentiment that Dano was among “the best and most talented actors of his generation”.Reese Witherspoon, who starred in Anderson’s 2014 film Inherent Vice with Dano,wrote on social media: “Paul Dano is an incredibly gifted, versatile actor. More importantly, he is a gentleman.”Film-maker Matt Reeves, who directed Dano in The Batman, wrote on social media: “Paul Dano is an incredible actor, and an incredible person.”A stiff dose of ‘weak sauce’: Paul Dano’s best films – ranked!Read moreBen Stiller described Dano as “fucking brilliant”, while Alec Baldwinshared a video statement to say: “I love Paul Dano. And if you don’t love Paul Dano, shhh.”And during an award ceremony earlier in January, George Clooney used his speech to sayhe would be “honoured” to work with Dano, Wilson and Lillard, saying: “I don’t enjoy watching people be cruel. We are living in a time of cruelty. We don’t need to be adding to it.”On Wednesday, ahead of a 20th anniversary screening of Little Miss Sunshine at the Sundance film festival, Dano’s co-star Toni Collette also weighed in, saying of Tarantino: “Fuck that guy! He must’ve been high … it was just confusing. Who does that?”Little Miss Sunshine co-director Jonathan Dayton said Tarantino’s remarks were an “embarrassment”, adding: “I can only think that [Dano’s] rawness of his performance made Tarantino uncomfortable. He couldn’t be easily filed.”Lillard has also responded to Tarantino’s criticism, saying: “It hurts your feelings. It fucking sucks. And you wouldn’t say that to Tom Cruise. You wouldn’t say that to somebody who’s a top-line actor in Hollywood.”Explore more on these topicsPaul DanoQuentin TarantinonewsShareReuse this content"

Offensive tweets posted by contestant Levi Hodgetts-Hague from a decade ago have been unearthed since filming, prompting theBBCto urge the show’s production company to carry out stricter background checks on contestants.View image in fullscreenLevi Hodgetts-Hague described Muslims as ‘dirty’ and women as ‘slags’ and ‘dogs’.Photograph: Ray Burminston/PAThe posts described Muslims as “dirty”, women as “slags” and “dogs”, police officers as “pigs”, and expressed support for British far-right activist Tommy Robinson while urging British people to take a stand against Islam.A BBC spokesperson said it was “completely unaware” that the contestant had made “such abhorrent comments”. The independent production company has been asked to fully review the social media checks undertaken “given the process has clearly failed in this instance”.“The views presented are totally unacceptable and we are taking this extremely seriously,” the BBC said.Yet this is far from the first time that the Lord Sugar-fronted show – which pitches 20 candidates who pride themselves on their ruthlessness against each other to compete for £250,000 – has provoked controversy for itschoice of contestants.In January, a separate former contestant from the season which aired in 2024, Dr Asif Munaf, was struck off the medical register after a tribunal found he posted 36 antisemitic, racist and sexist posts on social media.It also emerged after filming that season 13’s Tom Bunday had been jailed for violent assault, while in 2006, rightwing commentator Katie Hopkins caused outrage for her controversial comments.Julian Henry, a celebrity PR, said the production company, Naked, carried “ultimate responsibility for any dodgy talent expressing inappropriate views, past or present”, and not the BBC.Noting that Naked is owned by a large media group, and has a very experienced chief executive, he said: “The BBC are right to complain about their vetting process; checking the background of any members of the public is time intensive and costly so there’s an obvious temptation to cut corners by the casting teams.”Jamie Medhurst, professor of film and media at Aberystwyth University, said that the combination with theMasterChef host scandallast year suggests there is “some kind of lack of oversight here again”.“It may be that the corporation needs to review the way it commissions or works with independent production companies,” he said.“The posts were made over 10 years ago and so it’s possible that the person responsible for casting, selecting and researching the competitors didn’t go back far enough.”But he noted that there could be a pressure to cast “interesting” characters who will create drama, tension and character development over the series.“That wouldn’t work if all competitors were completely ‘safe’. I’m not suggesting that the producers knew the full extent of the character’s background, but adding people like Hopkins into the mix makes for more engaging viewing if you think of the drama that might ensue.”Alex Segal, managing director of InterTalent agency, said that many people do not realise that reality TV shows such as the Apprentice and Traitors are ensemble casts, meaning that “every person on that show has to fit a certain role”, reflecting a mix of ideas, ages, backgrounds, ethnicities and extroversion, and that many are approached rather than apply.“When you have a mix it creates drama, because people think differently to other people, and that creates drama, tension and humour – all the things that make a great TV show,” he said. “The Apprentice is fantastic at that – people are friends one minute and throw them under the bus the next.”Casting agents will use people or AI do a deep dive into social media to pick up “rude words or extreme views”, or outsource this to companies, but he noted that this was “not bulletproof”, since it can be difficult to pick up offensive views if they do not use the specific language being searched for.“If Hodgetts-Hague’s comments had been picked up, he wouldn’t have made the show I suspect,” Segal said.“Clearly it slipped the net. In this particular [case] they’ll all be very disappointed, it’s not the way they want to start a new series. It doesn’t matter how good he might be on the show or in the interview process, that is inconsequential compared to what he’s said.”All Apprentice candidates are DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checked, have their social media history investigated by a third-party provider and receive social media training including guidance on inclusive language and respectful behaviour.A spokesperson for Naked said: “We are fully committed to our duty of care and compliance responsibilities and have robust casting processes in place across the show.“Compliance is taken extremely seriously, and our procedures are kept under continual review.”Explore more on these topicsThe ApprenticeTelevisionAlan SugarSocial mediaReality TVBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

If there were quick-fix solutions, honestly, we would have found them.”The issue will come to a head when MPs meet to debate the Lords’ amendments to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill, including the Nash amendment.View image in fullscreenMolly Russell, who took her own life in 2017.Photograph: Family handout/PAMore than 60 Labour MPsrecently signed a letterto the prime minister calling for a ban, though that was before the government announced its consultation.In recent days, some of those MPs have suggested they would be happy to let the consultation finish, though they remain committed to a ban at some point.Fred Thomas, the MP who organised the letter, said last week: “I would welcome a government amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill enabling the UK to remove access to social media for under-16s through secondary legislation, based on consultation.”Explore more on these topicsSocial media banChildrenYoung peopleMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

A course I set and I wasn’t going to be diverted from.”He hopes Finding Harmony: A King’s Vision, filmed over seven months in four continents and exploring the importance of living in balance with nature, will act as a call to action after five decades of his campaigning on the climate crisis.“On the fight to save the planet: it’s rapidly going backwards. I’ve said that for the last 40 years but anyway, there we are. So, that’s why I get a bit, anyway … I can only do what I can do, which is not very much,” he says in the film, which is available on Amazon Prime from 6 February.He concludes: “Maybe, by the time I shuffle off this mortal coil, there might be a little more awareness … of the need to bring things back together again.”The global premiere of the film in the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening is thought to be the first time a film will have premiered at a royal residence.It captures five decades of Charles’s environmental missionary zeal, and while not capital P political, it is an unprecedented project for a British sovereign, although not for Charles as Prince of Wales. Summing up its message, the king says in the film: “It all boils down to the fact that we are nature ourselves. We are a part of it, not apart from it.”The film, narrated by actor Kate Winslet, reveals the 1986 documentary which disclosed that Charlestalked to plants, had “haunted him ever since”. He was “really upset” by the ensuing criticism, Ian Skelly, co-author of the king’s 2010 Harmony book, says.Charles is seen collecting eggs from “Cluckingham Palace” – his hen house for rare breed hens at Highgrove, the Gloucestershire home he has turned into a test bed for his radical ideas about “Harmony”.When he first announced his plan for organic farming at Home Farm, Highgrove, he says, “all this was considered completely bonkers, to say the least”.He laments: “When I first came 45 years ago … I mean, I used to hear cuckoos, which you never hear a single cuckoo …. And there used to be grasshoppers and, you know, the place used to hum. And that wonderful sound, you don’t get much of that, even though I’ve done my utmost to, you know, make sure.”The lavish production includes “Harmony”-inspired projects from beekeeping at HMP Bristol to the rainforests of Guyana, the deserts of Rajasthan, India, and Kabul in Afghanistan. The concepts of connectedness with nature, of “sacred geometry” and “natural mathematics”, are explored.Produced in partnership with The King’s Foundation, the nature and sustainability charity based at Dumfries House in Scotland and founded by Charles in 1990 as Prince of Wales, the film presents an unchallenged view of the philosophy. It will be available in 240 countries and territories.A spokesperson for the king said it was not a “conventional royal documentary” but a “deeply personal exploration of ideas that have shaped his majesty’s life and work: the interconnectedness of all things, the wisdom of traditional knowledges, and the belief that we can build a future that works in partnership with nature rather than against it”.A cast of stars joined the king and queen at the film’s Windsor Castle premiere on Wednesday evening.Actors including Kate Winslet, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench and Stanley Tucci were among 222 guests, as well as musicians Rod Stewart and Jools Holland. The Duchess of Edinburgh and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester were also in the audience.Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIMonarchyClimate crisisAmazon Prime VideonewsShareReuse this content"

Although the court rejected the complaints by individuals, it did admit Greenpeace’s claim as an organisation.“They really listened to us,” said Jackie Bernabela, one of the original claimants, whospokeat the court’s October hearing about how climate change was already affecting her life. “Not only us, but all the other Caribbean islands in the world – if we join as one unity we can make things happen.”View image in fullscreen‘They really listened to us,’ said Jackie Bernabela, one of the original claimants in the case.Photograph: Laurens van Putten/EPAThe court ruled that the government was breaching articles 8 and 14 of the European convention on human rights, which protect the right to respect for private and family life and prohibit discrimination.Bonaire, a Dutch special municipality since 2010 – though theNetherlandshas been present on the island for about 400 years – is particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, extreme heat and other climate-related impacts, and its local authorities do not have enough people, resources or specialist knowledge to tackle them fully. These risks had been clear for decades, the court ruled, but there was still no coherent plan to address them.Furthermore, the court ruled that the Netherlands was not doing its fair share to cut national greenhouse gas emissions.The Dutch government was ordered to put in place a concrete adaptation plan. And it was given six months to set a national carbon budget that expressed a fair share of the remaining global carbon budget in line with a threshold of 1.5C global heating above preindustrial levels, which must be done in a transparent way. It must also set legally binding interim targets to cut emissions, the court said.The Netherlands has acknowledged that Bonaire is at risk from climate change. But in court, the government’s legal team said the nation was already doing more to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions than many other countries. The court did not agree, noting that, under international climate agreements, countries are expected to contribute according to their capacity to pay and taking into account their historical emissions.“This is an incredible victory for the people in Bonaire,” said Eefje de Kroon, a climate justice expert at Greenpeace Nederlands. “Not only has the court established that people from Bonaire are being discriminated against because of the climate crisis but also the Dutch government needs to do much more to protect them.”View image in fullscreenThe Netherlands has acknowledged that Bonaire is at risk from climate change.Photograph: Michel Porro/GettyBernabela was particularly moved by the court’s statement that Bonaire citizens were being discriminated against. “The Netherlands are engineers number one in the world, especially in water management – but they have no plan for us,” she said. “So we feel already – and not only with climate change – that we are second-class citizens.”Just over a decade ago, the same Hague courtmade history by ordering the Dutch governmentto cut its emissions by at least 25% within five years – a landmark ruling that wasupheld by the country’s top judges in 2019. That judgment inspired awave of climate litigation across the world.As well as previous domestic rulings, Greenpeace’s legal team relied on recent advisory opinions on climate change by theInternational Court of Justiceand theInter-American Court of Human Rights, both of which said states had clear legal duties to address climate change and to help communities adapt.In a statement, Sophie Hermans, the Dutch minister for climate policy and green growth, said the court had delivered a “ruling of significance for the residents of Bonaire and the European Netherlands”. She said she and colleagues from the ministry of infrastructure and water management and the ministry of the interior and kingdom relations would now carefully review it.The ruling can be appealed against.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCaribbeanNetherlandsGreenhouse gas emissionsHuman rightsSea levelColonialismnewsShareReuse this content"

The initial symptoms of the virus are often high fever, nausea, vomiting and respiratory problems, which can then develop into pneumonia. In severe cases it causes a dangerous swelling of the brain that can lead to neurological symptoms such as drowsiness and seizures.It is highly contagious between humans and seen by the World Health Organization as a high risk for epidemics because there is no vaccine. It has a high fatality rate of 40% to 75%, far deadlier than Covid-19.When were previous outbreaks?The disease was first identified in 1998 among pig farmers in Malaysia, when it killed more than 100 people. It was named after the village where it was discovered.Since then, outbreaks have been detected almost every year across Asia in countries including India, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. It has routinely emerged inBangladeshand the first case in India was in 2001 in West Bengal, which borders Bangladesh.It has been linked to the harvesting of raw date sap in Bangladesh, as fruit bats often live in date palms.In 2018, at least 17 people died from Nipah virus in the Indian state of Kerala, and two more died in 2023.How are the authorities handling the latest outbreak?The latest outbreak is significant as these are the first cases detected in West Bengal since 2007.The Indian health authorities said: “Enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, and field investigations were undertaken … which ensured timely containment of the cases.”So far, no more than two cases have been detected since December. “The situation is under constant monitoring and all necessary public health measures are in place,” the Indian health ministry said.However, other countries have stepped up precautionary screening measures at airports and borders. Thailand,Vietnamand Indonesia have introduced additional screening, including temperature checks and health declarations of passengers arriving from India. Myanmar advised against nonessential travel to West Bengal and China has strengthened disease prevention measures in its border areas.India said reports of a surge in cases were “speculative and incorrect”.Explore more on these topicsSouth and central AsiaIndiaBangladeshThailandVietnamNepalAsia PacificexplainersShareReuse this content"

The Labour government last year rejected an amendment to make the bricks mandatory for new buildings, instead introducing them into planning guidance, meaning there is no legal obligation on developers or planning authorities to provide them.View image in fullscreenCampaigners say the bricks are a small but essential measure for swifts and other birds.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianWelcoming the decision to make swift bricks mandatory during the Holyrood debate, minister Gillian Martin said: “This iconic species was once a very common sight across Scotland, particularly in urban areas, but they are under threat, declining by 60% since 1995, which has led to them being on the red list of birds of conservation concern. I welcome suggestions of practical ways to help protect this important species and improve biodiversity.”Ruskell said: “Swiftsjoin our communities every summer, but they are becoming rarer everywhere. I’m looking forward to seeing every new building in Scotland host a family of swifts in the future and I hope the legislation here will inspire lawmakers across the UK to get on with it and give swifts a home.“It’s been frustrating watching Westminster take years to consider something so simple yet so important. The conversation on this has been good at Holyrood and while there were some challenges to getting this in place the government listened and we found a way through pretty quickly.”Hannah Bourne-Taylor, who has campaigned for swift bricks nationally for four years, said: “Scotland has stood united for birds. What a landmark victory! To save Britain’s swifts, with fewer than 40,000 pairs remaining and the increasing loss of natural nesting habitat thanks to countless renovations and the massive government-funded insulation schemes that have no mitigation, England, Wales and Northern Ireland must follow Scotland’s lead.View image in fullscreenHannah Bourne-Taylor: ‘Scotland has stood united for birds.’Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian“Come on Labour – you can’t offer some toothless guidance that won’t be followed to the scale needed, telling us it’s not possible to mandate swift bricks when Scotland’s just passed the law straight away.”Although the national planning guidance now specifies that new developments should incorporate swift bricks unless there are “compelling technical reasons” that prevent their use or make them ineffective, thisdoes not oblige developersor planning authorities to install the bricks. Even when swift boxes are required by planners, a University of Sheffield study found that75% of bird and bat boxesdemanded as a condition of planning permission for new housing had not been installed when the houses were finished.Lord Goldsmith, who has tabled amendments in the House of Lords for mandatory swift bricks, said: “It’s only taken Scotland one month to decide to mandate swift bricks, proving how easy it would be for England to finally mandate too, after four years of asking, and upgrade the non-statutory guidance to ensure all new builds have swift bricks. Swifts need the rest of the UK to follow.”The bricks will be introduced in Scotland after a 12-month consultation to ensure there is an appropriate building standard for the bricks, which, as well as providing nesting places for swifts, help other endangered cavity-nesting birds including sparrows, starlings and house martins.The Welsh governmentrejected swift bricks last year, arguing that developers could use the bricks to argue they were meeting “net benefit for biodiversity” requirements without providing other nature-positive measures.But wildlife campaigners say the bricks are a small but essential measure for swifts and other birds, which have lost access to millions of house roofs for nesting, thanks to renovations and modern insulation.In Gibraltar, an important point on the swifts’ seasonal flyway between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, swift bricks have helped populations recover.Prof John Cortes, the environment minister of Gibraltar, said: “Scotland’s decision on swift bricks is a significant step in ensuring the survival of this species, which has come to depend so much on us. On the ‘Rock’ we have had this policy for several decades and we have seen a declining population of swifts first stabilise and then increase.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsAnimalsWildlifeConstruction industryScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Some jobs will go.”In a speech on government plans to handle the impact of AI on the British economy,Liz Kendalldeclined to say how many redundancies the technology might cause but said: “We know people are worried about graduate entry jobs in places like law and finance.”She said: “Others will be created in their place”.While some forecasts have suggested the fast-developing technology could create a net increase in employment, Kendall said: “I’m not complacent about that.”Earlier this month the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said that without action to useAI“as a superpower for positive transformation and creation”, it could become “a weapon of mass destruction of jobs”.Speaking to an audience of tech and business leaders at the Bloomberg headquarters in London, Kendall, the former work and pensions secretary, pledged Labour “won’t leave people to struggle on their own”.UK ministers accept $1m from Meta amid social media ban consultationRead moreShe announced plans to train up to 10 million British workers in the most basic AI skills by 2030 – including members of the cabinet – signalling a focus on helping workers adapt to the coming shifts in the labour markets, rather than resisting them.She said the government’s goal was to “make Britain the fastest AI adoption country in the G7” and said jobs will be created around the government’s four AI growth zones.“We are on the cusp of great change – an industrial revolution [taking place] in a decade,” she said. “We have barely begun to see how this technology will transform all our lives – I believe for the better.”The rollout of online AI training for millions of workers – to involve Multiverse, a company founded by Euan Blair, plus a new programme to support women to move into entry level tech roles – would together be “the biggest single plan to upskill the nation since Harold Wilson’s Open University”, she said.A new “future of work unit” is also being established in the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) with involvement from trades unions and business leaders.Ministers have faced criticism they are relying too heavily on US AI companies, whose models could soon be competing with British white collar workers for jobs. It was announced that a$1m (£750,000) donation from Mark Zuckerberg’s Metawas being spent on a government initiative to build AI systems for defence, national security and transport.Meanwhile, Anthropic, a US AI startup valued at $350bn, has been chosen to build and pilot a dedicated assistant tool for public services on gov.uk, starting with a model that will give jobseekers career advice. It is providing the services for free.

The lords’ authorities are intending to suspend him from the upper chamber for two weeks.His misconduct occurred just three months after returning to the Lords from a nine-month suspension for lobbying for a commercial company that he was working for. It was one of the biggest punishments ever imposed on a peer.‘Government pays!’: hereditary peer faces questions over expenses claim for business tripRead moreCampaigners atSpotlight on Corruptionsaid his conduct showed “a deeply worrying disregard for the rules” and that there needed to be real consequences for those who repeatedly offend.The House of Lords investigated the peer, whose full name is Charles Henry John Benedict Crofton Chetwynd Chetwynd-Talbot, after the Guardianrevealed he had claimed, from public funds, travel expensesthat he had not incurred.Shrewsbury, 73, used a publicly funded first-class rail ticket to attend a board meeting of a company of which he was a non-executive director. In a leaked email he wrote to fellow directors that the “government pays” for his travel to the meeting.He is the fifth peer who the House of Lordshas concluded have broken its rulesfollowing the Guardian’smonths-long investigationexamining the commercial interests of peers.In his report, Martin Jelley, the House of Lords standards commissioner, decided that the peer, who has been in the Lords since 1981, had wrongly used a first-class rail pass that should only have funded his parliamentary work.The peer had used the ticket to travel part of his journey from London to Liverpool to attend a board meeting of a property development firm, Cheshire Land, in January 2024. He gave differing accounts to the standards commissioner.The peer had also claimed for four car journeys that he could not have made. Jelley said: “His approach to his mileage claims was unacceptably casual.”The House of Lords committee in charge of policing peers’ conduct accepted: “The sums involved in this case were small (just under £200), and Lord Shrewsbury was quick to acknowledge his wrongdoing, offer a full apology, and reimburse the house. There was no evidence of deliberate dishonesty.”The conduct committee said a “short period of suspension” was merited, adding: “Although the previous breach had nothing to do with allowances, a common feature of both cases was Lord Shrewsbury’s failure to maintain a clear distinction between his parliamentary and business activities.”Shrewsbury had been banned from the Lords for nine months in 2023 after he was paid £57,000 to lobby ministers and officials by a healthcare company in what wasjudged by the Lords’ watchdog to be a “lucrative relationship”.The House of Lords’ conduct committee had judged on that occasionthat his misconduct was “extremely serious”and had damaged the reputation of the upper chamber.Kamila Kingstone, senior campaigner at Spotlight on Corruption, said: “This case shows a deeply worrying disregard for the rules that protect public money.“Intentionally using parliamentary resources for private business, then being ‘unacceptably casual’ about false mileage claims, damages trust in the House of Lords and reinforces the perception that some peers believe the rules do not apply to them.“Coming so soon after a previous suspension, this breach underlines the need for tougher enforcement and real consequences when standards are repeatedly ignored.”Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

It will mean millions of renters, including children, trapped living in poor-quality homes with nowhere to turn.”The campaign group had pushed for a deadline of 2030 for implementation of the new standard, which was promised as part of the Renters’ Rights Act.Paula Barker, the Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, said the decision was a “disgrace”, adding: “This means families, individuals and children will remain stuck in dangerous, substandard housing, that very well may be having long-term impacts on their health, for close to another decade. This decision is shameful and completely unacceptable.”The English Housing Survey in 2020-21 found that 21% of privately rented homesdid not meet the DHS, with 12% having a category 1 hazard, meaning they posed a significant safety risk.According to the Health Foundation, one in five private rented homes are classed as “non-decent”, meaning they contain a hazard or immediate threat to health, are in a state of disrepair, or are not effectively insulated or heated.In the social rented sector, a DHS was introduced in 2001 with an enforcement deadline of 2010, although some councils applied for extensions. As of 2023, 10% of social rented homes failed to meet the DHS, which has not been updated since 2006 and ministers argue it is out of date.Pennycook previously said a 2035 timeline for the new DHS “broadly aligns with the nine-year implementation period that accompanied the original introduction of the DHS in the social rented sector”.The new DHS will force landlords to ensure homes are in a reasonable state of repair, free of hazards, damp and mould, and equipped with facilities including noise insulation and child-resistant window restrictors.Sarah Elliott, the chief executive of Shelter, said: “Renters simply can’t wait this long for decent homes. It is outrageous that millions of renters are stuck paying hand over fist for often shoddy homes that pose a real danger to their health. Now, to add insult to injury, renters are being asked to wait almost an entire decade for the basic protection of a decent home,” she said.“The government must ensure renters’ homes are safe to live in now, not in 2035, while supporting councils to bring rule-breakers to book by properly funding local authority enforcement teams.”Paul Shanks, from the Renters’ Reform Coalition, said the government’s “lack of urgency gives landlords the green light to continue profiting from rotten homes, and will have real consequences for the health and wellbeing of millions of tenants”.“We’re asking the government to bring the timeline forward – renters cannot afford to wait a decade for these basic protections,” he said.Gavin Smart, the chief executive of the Chartered Institute ofHousing, the professional body for the housing profession in the UK, welcomed the new DHS, saying it would “update minimum standards for the first time in 20 years” and would be “crucial to improving quality of life and reducing living costs for tenants”.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Landlords must continue to fix problems where they exist while the new decent homes’ standard is being implemented.“Some measures, such as the minimum energy efficient standard, will also be implemented sooner and the changes announced today will lead to cheaper energy bills and warmer homes for tenants, while ensuring landlords have time to meet the new standard.”Explore more on these topicsRenting propertyHousingPropertyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Talfan Davies will then take over.However, he will join theBBCboard from the start of February as an executive director, as he prepares to step up and take on Davie’s responsibilities.Talfan Davies had been widely regarded as the likely caretaker for the corporation, as the process to replace Davie was expected to be lengthy.Davie’s permanent successor will have the huge task of heading talks with the government over the future of the corporation’s charter, including its future funding.It is understood Davie has been working on that process and has contributed his own ideas on how the BBC’s licence fee should be reformed and its remit widened, with media viewing habits changing fast and audiences heading to digital platforms such as YouTube.Speaking to the Guardian, Davie said this week that theBBCwould face“profound jeopardy” over its futureunless it embraced significant changes to its funding. He also signalled an overhaul of when someone needed to pay the licence fee.In a note sent to staff, the BBC’s chair, Samir Shah, said Talfan Davies was “an outstanding leader who brings deep editorial experience and a passionate commitment to the power of public service broadcasting to reach and represent audiences across all parts of the UK.“I know you will give him your support,” he said. “There will be a time to celebrate Tim and thank him for his extraordinary contribution to the BBC nearer his departure date. Until then, Tim continues to lead the corporation through this critical period as we prepare our response to the government’s consultation on its green paper on the future of the BBC charter.”The government’s recent green paper included looking at whether the BBC should be funded by adverts or subscriptions – something Shah and Davie have opposed.As director of nations, Talfan Davies has been in charge of investing in BBC programming and journalism outside London, ensuring it serves audiences across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Bectu, a major union at the BBC, welcomed the clarity. However, it warned against any big decisions to restructure the corporation while the search for Davie’s successor continued. The Guardian revealed last year that theBBC was looking at outsourcing plans.Explore more on these topicsBBCTim DavienewsShareReuse this content"

France’s last newspaper hawker celebrated with prestigious awardAli Akbar, 73, honoured by Emmanuel Macron with National Order of Merit for dedication he pours into workAshifa KassamEuropean Community affairs correspondentWed 28 Jan 2026 14.28 ESTFirst published on Wed 28 Jan 2026 14.25 ESTShareFor more than five decades he’s pounded the pavements ofParis, becoming part of the city’s cultural fabric as he strikes up conversations, greets longtime friends and offers parodies of daily news headlines.On Wednesday, the efforts of the man believed to be France’s last newspaper hawker were recognised, as Ali Akbar, a 73-year-old originally from Pakistan, received one of France’s most prestigious honours.In a ceremony at the Élysée Palace, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, described Akbar as the “most French of the French” as he made him a knight of the National Order of Merit in recognition of his distinguished service to France.“You are the accent of the sixth arrondissement, the voice of the French press on Sunday mornings. And every other day of the week, for that matter,” said Macron. “A warm voice that, every day for more than 50 years, has boomed across the terraces of Saint-Germain, making its way between restaurant tables.”Speaking to Reuters in August, Akbar highlighted the delight he got from walking through Paris each day. “It’s love,” Akbar said as he crisscrossed the cobbled streets of Saint Germain-des-Prés. “If it was for the money, I could do something else. But I have a great time with these people.”View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron celebrates Ali Akbar in a ceremony at the Élysée Palace in Paris.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/EPABorn in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Akbar said he stumbled across his calling after arriving in Paris in 1973. When visa issues stymied his first attempt to carve out a life inEurope, he was determined to find a job that would allow him to support his parents and seven siblings back home.With the help of an Argentinian student who was selling satirical magazines, Akbar joined the ranks of the few dozen newspaper sellers in the city. His ready smile, sense of humour and readiness to walk miles a day proved a hit, allowing him to make a modest living.By day he sold newspapers to France’s powerbrokers, such as the former president François Mitterrand, and to Sciences Po students who would later join their ranks, such as Macron and the former prime minister Édouard Philippe. At night, in his early years,he slept rough under bridgesand in squalid rooms as he scrambled to send as much money as he could to Pakistan.As the decades passed, Akbar became a familiar face in the restaurants and bars of the Left Bank. “Ali is an institution,” said Marie-Laure Carrière, a lawyer. “If Ali didn’t exist, St-Germain-des-Prés wouldn’t be St-Germain-des-Prés.”Slowly and steadily, he built a life in Paris, getting married and raising five children, even as the newspaper industry began to wilt. While once it had been easy to sell as many as 200 newspapers a day, those days were a distant memory, Akbar said. “I sell about 20 copies of Le Monde in eight hours,” he said. “Everything is digital. People just don’t buy newspapers.”Still, he persisted. “I have a certain way of selling newspapers. I try to make jokes, so people laugh. I try to be positive and I create an atmosphere … I try and get into people’s hearts, not their pockets,” he said.When news of the order of merit came, it felt like a tribute of sorts to a way of life that is rapidly disappearing, particularly in a district once frequented by philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. “People used to do their shopping in small shops. It was a village, there were small markets everywhere, butchers and fish shops. Everyone was local, everyone knew each other,” said Akbar. “Nowadays its different. Every day there’s a new face.”‘I have Yes tattooed on my foot!’ Zoey Deutch on playing Jean Seberg in a joyous celebration of Godard classic BreathlessRead moreOn Wednesday, Macron ​praised the journey that had landed Akbar at the Élyséé Palace. “Before becoming an icon of Parisian life, you grew up in Pakistan, on the streets of Rawalpindi. As a child, you had to face the worst: poverty, forced labour, violence. You dream of only one thing: leaving. Escaping poverty, getting an education​. Earning enough money to buy your m​other a beautiful house​,” said Macron. ​ “You cross Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Greece. You experienced a clandestine life, destitution and constant fear. But you persevere.​”In the lead up to the ceremony, Akbar said it was an honour to receive the distinction. He told the broadcasterFranceinfoit was a balm for the many wounds he had racked up in his lifetime.Even so, he said he had no plans to give up selling newspapers, insisting he would continue zigzagging the city’s streets and cafes as long as he had the energy. “Retirement will have to wait until the cemetery,” he joked.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He is serving sentences for corruption and leaking state secrets, which he has claimed are part of a state-sponsored campaign to keep him out of power.Khan has largely been kept in solitary confinement, according to his lawyers and party leaders, who said they have been denied access to him for the past three months.According to a statement by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Khan’s party, their fears for his health worsened after reports the former prime minister had been diagnosed with a dangerous blockage in the retinal vein in his right eye, known as a central retinal vein occlusion.If left untreated, the condition can cause permanent damage to eyesight.View image in fullscreenImran Khan speaking to Reuters in March 2023.Photograph: Akhtar Soomro/Reuters“According to medical experts who reportedly checked him in jail, this is an extremely sensitive and serious medical condition which, if not treated promptly and properly, carries a high risk of permanent damage to his eyesight,” the PTI said.Khan reportedly already has blurred vision because of the condition. The party said the prison authorities had not allowed his personal doctor to examine him for months, which they said was “reckless” and putting Khan’s health in “grave danger”.Three men charged after ‘highly targeted attacks’ against Pakistani dissidentsRead moreFor the past three months, lawyers and senior party figures as well as Khan’s sisters, have been protesting over their lack of access to Khan in Adiala prison. Their demonstrations have been met with teargas and water cannon.A court order stated Khan should be allowed visits by family and lawyers twice a week. However, he last met his lawyers 100 days ago and a legal petition by his party leaders to get access to him in prison was rejected this week.Gohar Ali Khan, a barrister and PTI chair, said the party had significant concerns about Khan’s health and his conditions in prison.“Despite the court orders, we could not meet Khan,” he said. “He is incommunicado and in solitary confinement, which is against his fundamental rights. After the reports on Khan’s health, we and his physicians should be given immediate access.”After concerns over his condition late last year, Khan was allowed to briefly meet his sisters in early December, who reported that his health was fine. “Presently, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” said his sister Uzma Khanum, speaking on Wednesday as she took part in a sit-in outside the jail to demand access to her brother.Khan served as prime minister between 2018 and 2022 before he was toppled in a vote of no confidence after he fell out with the powerful military establishment.He was arrested in August 2023 on more than 100 charges he claimed were made up by the military and government in order to disqualify him from politics.Khan was first sentenced to three years for“selling state gifts”, and in January 2025 was sentenced to a further14 years in prisonon corruption charges. His wife, Bushra Bib, was sentenced to seven years in the same case and remains in jail.Explore more on these topicsPakistanSouth and central AsiaImran KhanHuman rightsShareReuse this content"

The earnings report described Tesla’s chaotic year as a “transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company”.The high hopes and grand possibilities Musk has outlined helped Tesla beat Wall Street expectations, even as the company reported its first-ever decline in total revenue – losing 3% year-over-year. Tesla reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.50 after the market close on Wednesday, exceeding the $0.45 that Wall Street expected. Its reported revenue was $24.9bn, beating analyst estimates of $24.79bn.The company’s total automotive revenues dropped 11% year-over-year in 2025. Earlier this month, Tesla reported its fourth quarter vehicle delivery numbers, which measure buyers’ receipt of their cars rather than dealership sales, revealinga 16% declineyear-over-year, hurt especially by cratering interest in Europe. The company’s stock rose as high as 4% in after-hours trading, before tapering off its gains.At Davos, tech CEOs laid out their vision for AI’s world dominationRead moreAs Tesla’s vehicle sales have fallen over the past year, Musk and the company have emphasized a shift towards AI-driven projects such as Optimus consumer robots and self-driving Robotaxis. All of these technologies remain unproven and not widely available to the public, let alone profitable, but they have allowed Musk to claim the company will see unparalleled future growth without much to show for it today.Musk has stated that Optimus would be the “biggest product of all time” and said that the robots, along with autonomous vehicles, would usher in “a world where there is no poverty”. Tesla plans to start production of Optimus before the end of 2026, according to the earnings report. Musk has said the company willsell the robot to the publicin 2027. Tesla also revealed that earlier this month it agreed to invest $2bn into xAI, Musk’s artificial intelligence company.Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, stated on the earnings call that the company’s capital expenditure would be $20bn, an immense amount that is vastly more than what many analysts estimated.Although Tesla’s stock price plummeted during Musk’s tumultuous time in government last year, it rebounded to its highest price ever in December amid ongoing market frenzy for AI investments and Musk’s promise of building a “robot army”. The previous month, Tesla shareholdersalso approved a pay packagefor Musk that could award him up to a trillion dollars in compensation if the company meets a series of financial milestones.While Tesla has touted its upcoming projects as evidence of upcoming success, some of its formerly futuristic products have struggled. The company’s Cybertruck, which Musk said earlier this month was “the best vehicle Tesla has ever made”, saw a drastic 48% decline in sales last year, according toKelley Blue Book reports.Tesla has faced increasing competition from other electric vehicles companies, primarily China’s BYD, whichovertook Tesla last yearas the world’s largest electric carmaker. BYD’s sales grew by 28% in 2025, as it offered consumers in a number of marketsless expensive alternativesto Tesla’s models.Explore more on these topicsTeslaQuarterly resultsElon MuskAI (artificial intelligence)RobotsnewsShareReuse this content"

Earnings came in at $4.14 per share against expectations of $3.92.“We are only at the beginning phases of AI diffusion, and already Microsoft has built an AI business that is larger than some of our biggest franchises,” said the company’s CEO, Satya Nadella. “We are pushing the frontier across our entire AI stack to drive new value for our customers and partners.”Microsoftshares fell 4% in extended trading on Wednesday after the software maker posted slowing cloud growth.Microsoft has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom, but investor confidence in it has slipped of late. Six months ago, the company hit the vaunted level of a $4tn market capitalization. Three months ago, it beat analysts’ revenue expectations by 2.9%, reporting revenues up 18.4% year on year.The four largest AI spenders – Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta – are expected to spend $505bn on AI infrastructure this year alone, up from roughly $366bn in 2025.But shares in the company have slumped 11% since as investors’ anxieties over the billions being pumped into AI without corresponding returns have increased. Despite those fears, Microsoft has exceeded Wall Street’s expectations in every quarter over the past two years.In its last earning report, Microsoft said orders booked by its Azure cloud-computing business, which incorporates AI, “significantly” exceeded capacity. Revenue to that unit was that projected to rise 38% from a year earlier.On Wednesday, Microsoft said Azure revenues grew 39%, compared with 40% growth in the fiscal first quarter.“Microsoft Cloud revenue crossed $50bn this quarter, reflecting the strong demand for our portfolio of services,” said Amy Hood, executive vice-president and chief financial officer of Microsoft. “We exceeded expectations across revenue, operating income and earnings per share.”Asked about return of investment from Azure, Hood said it was better to think about it as “an allocated capacity guide about what we can deliver in terms of Azure revenue”.As Microsoft spends massive capital on computing capacity, she said, “we’re really making long-term decisions”, pointing to increased sales and usage across its AI products. “Then we make sure we’re investing in the long-term nature of R&D and product innovation”.But Microsoft’s 365 Copilot AI unit is facing increased competition, including from Anthropic’s Claude Cowork, a desktop AI tool meant to act as a more accessible version of Claude Code.Wedbush’s Dan Ives said this week he viewed Microsoft “as the clear front-runner on the enterprise hyper-scale AI front despite increasing competition from Amazon and Google”.The most recent US productivity report showed strong gains without increased work- hours, suggesting that the gains could be attributed to AI.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftQuarterly resultsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Rates currently sit at a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.TheTrump administrationhas put unprecedented pressure on the Fed chair,Jerome Powell, to cut rates, withDonald Trumplaunching personal attacks on Powell and the justice department opening acriminal investigationinto his handling of the refurbishment of the central bank’s offices.The FOMC has 12 voting members and meets just eight times a year to set interest rates. The stakes of each meeting have been high during Trump’s second term. Though economists say that the Fed’s independence, as the US central bank, is key for economic stability, the president has unabashedly tried to bend the Fed to his economic agenda.Chart showing interest rate changes over timeCutting interest rates can spur short-term economic activity, though at the risk of pushing up prices in the long term. But Trump has claimed that the Fed not lowering interest rates costs theUS economy“hundreds of billions of dollars”.Fed officials have resisted these calls. In December, at the last FOMC meeting, Powellimpliedthe Fed would be pausing cuts for the time being. “We’re well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here,” he said. After the Fed meeting, Trump called Powell “stiff” and said that the rate drop “could have been doubled”.The full extent of Trump’s anger would not be seen until 11 January, when Powell – whose term as chair is up in May – announced he was undercriminal investigation.The investigation is focused on congressional testimony that Powell gave last summer on renovations at the Fed headquarters, which has gone over budget. Trump alleges Powell committed fraud, though the Fed chair has said that the renovations were necessary safety upgrades to decades-old buildings.In arecorded statement, what many said was aremarkable defianceof Trump’s bullying, Powell called the investigation a “pretext”.“The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of theFederal Reservesetting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” Powell said. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions – or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”The investigation remains ongoing, despite swift backlash frombusiness leadersand some Republicanlawmakers.Despite these ongoing threats, Powell on Wednesday said a majority of Fed policymakers believe interest rates are at a neutral level, suggesting that further rate cuts will not be coming any time soon.“I think, and many of my colleagues think, it’s hard to look at the incoming data and say that policy is significantly restrictive at this time,” Powell said.The Fed chair declined to answer multiple questions on the investigation, including whether the Fed responded to the justice department’s subpoena. He also declined to comment on whether he will remain on the Fed’s board after he steps down as chair. Powell’s term on the board is set to expire in 2028.But Powell made it clear that he remains a staunch believer of Fed independence and expressed the importance of the Fed retaining its credibility.“Monetary policy can be used through an election cycle to affect the economy in a way that’s politically worthwhile,” Powell said. Having an independent central bank is a “good practice”, and if that’s lost, “it would be hard to restore the credibility of the institution”, he cautioned.“If people lose the faith that we are making decisions only on the basic assessment of what is best for everyone – for the wider public, rather than trying to benefit one group or another – if you lose that, it’s going to be hard to retain it,” Powell said. “And we haven’t lost it. I don’t believe we will. I certainly hope we won’t.”When asked if he is confident the Fed can maintain independence at this point, Powell said: “Yes – I mean, I am strongly committed to that, and so are my colleagues.”Asked for his advice for his successor Fed chair, Powell was willing to provide an answer. “Stay out of elected politics, don’t get pulled into elected politics. Don’t do it,” he said. “It’s easy to criticize government institutions in so many ways. I will tell whoever it is: you are about to meet the most qualified group of people you not only have ever worked with, [but that] you will ever work with.“When you meet Fed staff – and not everybody is perfect – but there isn’t a better cadre of professionals more dedicated to the public well-being than [those] working at the Fed.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS interest ratesJerome PowellDonald TrumpUS economyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Approaching 40 years on, a rebellion is brewing among himself and a community of like-minded activists and developers.“We can fix the internet … It’s not too late,” he writes, describing his mission as a “battle for the soul of the web”.Technology isn’t neutralBerners-Lee traces the first corruption of the web to the commercialisation of the domain name system, which he believes would have served web users better had it been managed by a nonprofit in the public interest. Instead, he says, in the 1990s the .com space was pounced on by “charlatans”.“The Americans were very keen about commercialising the internet … crossing the boundary from being an academic thing to being a commercial thing,” he tells Guardian Australia from Brisbane.The pursuit of profit soon became a driving force in how the internet was designed. But it wasn’t until 2016 – the same year he won the Turing award – that the US elections showed Berners-Lee just how toxic the web could be. Two years later, he told Vanity Fair he was “devastated” by the abuses of the web.View image in fullscreenBerners-Lee hopes to change the way data is held on the web. It’s a project rooted in people power – not unlike the first years of the web.Photograph: Elise Amendola/APFor 35 years, Berners-Lee has written what he considers to be the world’s first blog. One post, published in June 2024, is dominated by a crowded map of “everything on the internet”. It is a reminder of the web’s overall beneficence – from email and Zoom to health, podcasts, collaboration, creativity and digital sovereignty, the diagram shows the web is, for the most part, good.But to the left of the diagram is a cluster of red, including X, Snapchat, YouTube, “feed manipulation for engagement”, addiction, polarisation, disinformation and mental illness. This corner of the web, its creator says, has been “optimised for nastiness”. It is extractive and surveillance-heavy.“It’s only a small part of the whole internet … but the problem is that people spend a lot of time on [social media websites] because they’re addictive,” he says.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailGiven it was always supposed to be human-like in its sprawling connectivity, perhaps its darker sides were inevitable.“Yes and no,” Berners-Lee says. “There used to be a sort of mantra that technology was neutral and people are good and bad. But actually, that’s not true of things on the web.“The way you design a website, like Reddit or Pinterest or Snapchat, can be explicitly good.” Or, designed with engagement as a priority, its algorithm can be explicitly bad.Collaboration and compassionCompounding the problem is monopolisation. Facebook and Google’s dominance is bad for innovation and bad for the web, he says, because monopolies get in the way of building systems that are truly pro-human. How many companies, after all, hold your (identical) data in non-transparent and incompatible systems?Since Berners-Lee’s disappointment a decade ago, he’s thrown everything at a project that completely shifts the way data is held on the web, known as the Solid (social linked data) protocol. It’s activism that is rooted in people power – not unlike the first years of the web.This version of the internet would turbocharge personal sovereignty and give control back to users.“When people are excited, they get a twinkle in their eye and they start coding just because of what they can imagine,” he says of developers who “get” the concept.View image in fullscreenBerners-Lee is not convinced social media bans for under-16s can fix the internet’s problems.Photograph: Rick Friedman/The GuardianHe likens Solid “pods” to backpacks of data that are securely held by each individual, allowing them to choose what to share with certain people, businesses and organisations. Department of Education data could be shared with an AI tutor; medical data with a cousin, doctor and nutritionist. The Flanders government in Belgium treats data as a national utility and is already using Solid pods for its citizens.The Facebooks and Xs of the world need not join in– the new systems will be so empowering, collaborative and compassionate, he believes, that parts of today’s web will become obsolescent.“The existing systems will fade to a certain extent, because people will get more excited in new systems,” he says.“Being able to collaborate across the world with friends and family and colleagues will be something that they end up getting addicted to – a much better form of addiction.”He’s not the only person wanting to fix these problems.Australia’s world-first social media ban– which blocks under-16s from using a host of sites including Snapchat, X, Facebook and YouTube – is one attempt at a solution. Although Berners-Lee is not convinced.“I’m interested to see how it goes down in Australia, becausethere are people in the UK who are proposing itin a similar way, and others may follow on,” he says.“The first question is whether kids should be using those particular social media sites. I think you have to recognise that things like messaging services are useful.”Instead, he’s in favour of smartphones that are especially designed for children, blocking access to harmful sites. He points to the Other phone, designed in collaboration with Mumsnet users, as an alternative to devices that allow unfettered access to social media.The AI ‘horse is bolting’It’s on the subject of artificial intelligence that his optimism plummets.Berners-Lee has long seen AI – which exists only because of the web and its data – as having the potential to transform society far beyond the boundaries of self-interested companies. But now is the time, he says, to put guardrails in place so that AI remains a force for good – and he’s afraid the chance may pass humankind by.“The horse is bolting,” he says of reining in AI’s unchecked development and growing intelligence.View image in fullscreen‘I would like to see a Cern for AI … where the scientific community gets to look at the AI and to decide whether it is safe or not.’Photograph: Renee Dominguez/SXSW/Getty ImagesBerners-Lee created the web, HTML and HTTP atCern, the home of the Large Hadron Collider, on the outskirts of Geneva. Cern’s scientific, non-commercial approach was key to the way the technology was shared.“I would like to see a Cern for AI, where all the top scientists come together and see whether they can make a super intelligence. And, if they can, they contain it into a system where it can’t just go out and persuade people to let it run the world.”Right now, though, given the division sown in part by that red corner of the web, we are “very, very far from a Cern for AI”, he says.“We have got AI being done in these huge companies, but also in these huge silos. They’re not looking over each other’s shoulder. They’re just sitting there, inside their own company, looking at their own system, trying to make it smarter.“I don’t see a way that we can get to a point where the scientific community gets to look at the AI and to decide whether it is safe or not.”Sir Tim Berners-Lee will be speaking at theBrisbane Powerhouseon Thursday 29 January and theSydney Opera Houseon Friday 30 JanuaryThe headline on this story was amended on 29 January 2026 to clarify that Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web, the service that runs on the internet infrastructure, not the internet itself.Explore more on these topicsInternetTim Berners-LeeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Grisa now lived there alone with his 120 ducks and other animals. The two other remaining residents were murdered by a farmer from a neighbouring village’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 28 Jan 2026 10.09 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 12.26 ESTShareThis was taken in a village in rural Moldova that no longer exists. Thirty years ago, Dobrușa had a population of 200, and was typical of settlements found across the country after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. When this man Grisa moved there in 2000 to start a sheep farm, the population had declined to 70. When this was taken, in July 2019, he was the sole resident of the village. He was 65.A few months before I took it, the only other remaining residents – a couple in their 40s – were murdered by a farmer from a neighbouring village. Their half-naked bodies were found on the ground. They’d been beaten to death. It was a very dark story and, after this terrible incident, Grisa told me he no longer felt safe living alone there. He was thinking about moving to a bigger village.He presented me with a glass of wine, which was how he started his dayHe had a lot of animals so was not completely alone: turkeys, geese, chickens, pigeons, bees and 120 ducks, many of them in the picture. His day began at 4am. When I went to photograph him for an assignment on the rural areas of Moldova for the New York Times, I wanted to start the day as he did, at sunrise. He offered me a cup of coffee when I arrived – then he presented me with a glass of wine, which was how he started his day. He would then tend to his animals, pick his vegetables and collect his honey, which he sold at a local market. Later, he would go back to make food for himself. He lived a very simple life. He showed me pictures of when he was a soldier in the Soviet army.I don’t know what it’s like to live like this, but in my photographs, I try to bridge the gap between different places or cultures. I see photography as a way to connect people, despite their differences in culture, upbringing or social class. I photograph intimate moments that offer a glimpse into scenes we all recognise: a mother waking her child, a couple having a walk in silence, a family dinner or birthday celebration. These very ordinary moments reveal something extraordinary about our shared humanity, its unique beauty. Next month, at my solo show Tribute to Odesa, I will present the work I made on assignment during the conflict in Ukraine that shows an unseen side to the war.Grisa said loneliness kills you slowly – but he also found deep joy in solitude and quiet. He enjoyed reading books, he had friends who still came to visit. Grisa had little income – he was living with almost nothing – but there was still beauty in this place. He called it a little heaven. He loved walking on his land and spending time with his animals, in the peace and the quiet. So this is a tribute to what one man can do, to the magical place he created.This was taken at the end of the day, at sundown. It captures that reflective, charged moment, when you pause and look back and realise what you’ve achieved and feel content. I could imagine the same moment. I think everyone has these feelings at the end of the day or the year. Grisa’s little heaven was revealed in that moment.Tribute to Odesa is atOxo gallery, London, 11-18 February;vanconlaetitia.comView image in fullscreenLaetitia Vançon.Laetitia Vançon’s CVBorn:France, 1979High point:“My Prix Pictet nomination in 2025 for work made in Ukraine – all the hard work for so many years being recognised and acknowledged.”Top tip:“Be curious.

The film-maker first attended the indie festival along with his brother, Mark, in 2003, with a self-proclaimed “$3 film”, then went on to premiere three projects – The Puffy Chair, Baghead and Cyrus – that epitomized the much-debated, very indie mumblecore movement of yore. For the Duplass brothers, the festival was, as it has been for many a small-budget artist trying to break out, the difference between a career and another $3 film. Without Sundance, he recentlyjoked: “I’d probably be a psychologist right now.”The Only Living Pickpocket in New York review – John Turturro steals this simple, charming taleRead morePsychologist sympathies peek through See You When I See You, Duplass’s feature film return to the festival after 16 years largely focused on acting and directing episodic television, notably for Togetherness, Search Party and the criminally underseen Somebody, Somewhere. An earnest adaptation of comedian Adam Cayton-Holland’s memoir, Tragedy Plus Time, the 102-minute film is both a straightforward tribute to psychotherapy and a tightrope walk of tone, attempting to balance profound grief with breezy comedy for a family reeling from a shocking loss.That See You When I See You often stumbles is occasionally frustrating but mostly forgivable, given the highly personal material and the sincere handling of trauma that would end me; like Cayton-Holland, who also wrote the script, Aaron Whistler, played by former Sundance darling Cooper Raiff, lost his younger sister to suicide. In fact, he was the one to find Leah (Kaitlyn Dever), revealed in flashbacks to be his best friend and vital co-conspirator, at her Denver home.There is no single or right way to handle grief, of course, though I must admit that I initially tripped over the borderline jaunty tone of the Whistler family’s banter in the near-immediate aftermath, cracking light jokes at a forced rhythm within a debate about whether or not to hold a funeral. (An often sprightly, upbeat score by Jordan Seigel contributes to the confusion.) Still, everyone is coping in their own way: mother Paige (Hope Davis) is throwing herself into her conservation work. Father Robert (David Duchovny), a civil rights attorney, is compulsively telling everyone about what happened. That horrifies older sister Emily (Lucy Boynton), Robert’s law partner, who prefers to hyper-fixate on logistics and a funeral, so she can be done with it all.Though the film feints at significant subplots for each of them – Davis conveys a world of feeling in one glance; after discovering a lump in her breast, you know she doesn’t have it in her to see a doctor – this is ultimately, for better and worse, Cayton-Holland’s story, and Aaron’s rom-dramedy. He is clearly spiraling – listless at work, getting a DUI and, in one realistically relayed text exchange (finally!), hitting up the girl he abruptly ghosted two months ago. See You When I See You (a seemingly odd title that eventually makes sense) awkwardly swerves between underplaying Aaron’s struggles – such as playing his stalking of said girl, Camila (How To Blow Up a Pipeline’s Ariela Barer), for laughs – and literalizing his grief, in flashbacks that morph into confrontations with Leah that end with her somewhat over-dramatically disappearing into the void.Those scenes, meant to convey the intrusive thoughts and tainted memories ripping through Aaron’s life, are still effective, mostly because Dever conveys both spiky vibrancy and unreachability in a handful of minutes. Raiff, on the other hand, feels opaque; in memory purgatory, both he and the character seem out of their depths. A Duplass protege whose filmCha Cha Real Smoothwas one of the biggest-selling films of Sundance 2022, he fares much better in the familiar lane of talky comedy, speaking in his usual offbeat bursts and self-deprecating his way to the girl (that would be Camila, who seems rightfully exhausted by a clumsily shoehorned rom-com plot). That may grate for some, but I found Raiff’s usual schtick endearing when applied to a character with a very good reason for feeling singularly disconnected and adrift in the world.He finds recourse through eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EDMR) therapy for PTSD, in which Dr Anya (Poorna Jagannathan) and handheld pulsators help Aaron relive and rewire the memories from the worst night of his life. Duplass plays these scenes completely straight, from the stated intent – to put the traumatic memory into the right file and gain agency over his mind – to the literal process of returning, again and again, to Leah’s bathroom door. There’s something noble, even ambitious, in depicting such a clinical process, though I’m not sure how Duplass figured out how to do so cinematically; what should, I think, have taken us to the emotional brink, finally opening the door on the immense pain, left me with but a lump in my throat.To be fair, I simply cannot fathom facing what Aaron has to, and resist attempts to think about it in the same way I resisted some of the film’s perkier comic deflections. Perhaps that’s a failure of my imagination, and those forced to endure the unthinkable will find something comforting and validating here. But for a film so sincerely intent on bringing us into the process of sibling grief, I still left a stranger.See You When I See You is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewDavid DuchovnySundance film festivalFestivalsComedy filmsDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But maybe there is, in fact, nothing behind the scenes; judging by this, the scenes are all there is: Insta-exhibitionism, empty phrases and show.Hilton’s second album no doubt has its admirers and detractors, and her fans are perfectly happy with it. But this film, for which she is executive producer, is an indiscriminate non-curation of narcissism and torpid self-importance that seems to go on and on and on for ever; the longest two hours of anyone’s life, finally signing off with a splodge of uninteresting and unedited concert footage.Hilton has certainly been the victim of duplicitous and misogynist media coverage, with tabloid paparazzi using and abusing her for profit, and the film’s one interesting move is to interviewSarah Ditum, the author of Toxic: Women, Fame and the Noughtieson this very subject. But the analytical note is soon abandoned, and the reality of her enormously wealthy family background is coyly omitted. (It was more prominent in her previous film, 2020’s This Is Paris, part of the reality-TV persona that she now considers herself to have outgrown.)Like that earlier film, Infinite Icon touches on the emotional and sexual abuse Hilton suffered as a wayward teen at the notorious youth psychiatric facility, Provo Canyon School in Utah. Then there is her ADHD; in one of the film’s semi-unguarded moments, she yells at someone trying to interrupt her: “I have ADHD, don’t tell me to pause!” But all these issues, all the allyship and advocacy, look like yet more brand accessories.Infinite Icon: A Visual Memoir is in cinemas from 30 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsParis HiltonPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here is Richard Linklater’s impeccably submissive, tastefully cinephile period drama about the making of Godard’s debut 1960 classic À Bout de Souffle, that starred Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo as the star-crossed lovers in Paris. Linklater’s homage has credits in French and is beautifully shot in monochrome, as opposed to the boring old colour of real life in which the events were actually happening; he even cutely fabricates cue marks in the corner of the screen, those things that once told projectionists when to changeover the reels. But Linklater smoothly avoids any disruptive jump-cuts.It’s a good-natured, intelligent effort for which Godard himself, were he still alive, would undoubtedly have ripped Linklater a new one. (WhenMichel Hazanavicius made Redoubtable in 2017about Godard’s making of his 1967 film La Chinoise, the man himself called that “a stupid, stupid idea”; Hazanavicius wasn’t even making a film about Godard’s first and biggest hit.)Yet Linklater is unconsciously creating a stylistic homage – not to Godard, however, but to his much more emollient, accessible and Hollywood-friendly collaborator François Truffaut. Truffaut wrote the basic story for Breathless and thereby gave Godard his commercial success; it was based on a sensational true-crime story about a tough guy who shoots a cop and gets an American girlfriend on the run, grabbing at love and romance while he can, existentially aware that a cop-killer’s days are numbered.The real-life characters of the Breathless story, from the most famous to the most obscure (this latter category being treated with rigorous superfan respect) are introduced with static portrait shots, gazing at the camera with their names flashed up on screen; even in the action itself, these people are often addressed by their full name with an awestruck sentence about their importance so we know where we are.Godard himself, a Cahiers du Cinéma gunslinger-critic yearning to graduate to film-making, is played by newcomer Guillaume Marbeck, incessantly dropping epigrams and wisecracks and shruggingly dismissive pouts on the subject of cinema – and perhaps Godard was like this, at least some of the time. Linklater mischievously allows the audience to wonder if Godard will ever remove his sunglasses and get a “beautiful librarian” moment, or at least a moment to confess that you shouldn’t watch movies through dark glasses. Aubry Dillon plays Belmondo and Zoey Deutch is Seberg, forever breaking into fluent and Ohio-accented French. Adrien Rouyard is Truffaut, Matthieu Penchinat is the brilliant cinematographer Raoul Coutard whose news background in covering wars made him an inspired choice for Godard’s guerrilla film-making adventures, Benjamin Clery is Godard’s first assistant director Pierre Rissient and Bruno Dreyfürst is Godard’s longsuffering producer George “Beau Beau” Beauregard – whose disagreements with Godard over money lead to an undignified physical scuffle in aPariscafe.‘I have Yes tattooed on my foot!’ Zoey Deutch on playing Jean Seberg in a joyous celebration of Godard classic BreathlessRead moreThe shoot begins, extended by Godard’s haughtily capricious delays to accommodate authentic inspiration, as the actors amusingly say whatever they like to each other and the tyrannical director while the camera is turning, because everything is to be dubbed later in the studio. Continuity supervisor Suzon Faye (Pauline Belle) crossly tells Godard that his cavalier disregard for matching the eyelines in successive shots mean a problem in the edit; a hint of the imminent revolution in film grammar, perhaps, though Linklater’s Godard has the humility to say he didn’t invent jump-cuts.By the end, Linklater’s Godard is as opaque and essentially imperturbable as he was in the beginning, seething with competitive anguish at the success of Truffaut’s The 400 Blows in Cannes and struggling to get into parties and film sets; and again, none of this is inaccurate. But it’s all very smooth: a slick Steadicam ride through a historic, tumultuous moment.Nouvelle Vague screened at theCannes film festival2025 and is out in Australian cinemas now and in UK and Irish cinemas from 30 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekRichard LinklaterDrama filmsComedy filmsBreathless (A Bout de Souffle)ParisCannes film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Is this innovation, sacrilege, or just another way to repackage cinema history?Wed 28 Jan 2026 03.13 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 11.27 ESTShare‘Some films are slices of life, mine are slices of cake,” saidAlfred Hitchcock. Who knew that anyone would take the knife to one of his most beloved silent films, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), and turn it into a vertical microdrama?The Tattle TV app has announced that it will be streaming serial killer drama The Lodger on its phone-friendly vertical platform, telling Deadline that it is “one of the first known instances of a classic feature film being fully reframed for vertical, mobile-first consumption”. So will it set a trend? And if so, how can we stop it?I’m only joking, of course. There will always be those who see archive cinema as just so much more content to be re-appropriated in new formats. And there will always be old-guard purists – who, me? – who wince at the thought. Still, Tattle TV, you have my attention, so let’s talk about it.We won’t be getting this mini-Hitch in the UK, or the EU for that matter, due to rights, but lucky US viewers will be able to watch the film that Hitchcock considered “the first time I exercised my style” in a format that largely disregards that style. The Lodger will be presented with its squarish 4:3 image either extended or cut down to fill a vertical phone screen. So there will often be parts of the image missing, which is a problem.The opening shot of The Lodger is a chilling closeup of a woman screaming, her head tilted so that her entire face fills the frame, lit from behind to emphasise her blond hair. Hitchcock told Truffaut that in The Lodger, he presented “ideas in purely visual terms”. This closeup represents the terror spreading across London as a ripper targets young, golden-haired women. Is the idea intact, even if the image isn’t? Hitchcock, a well-known stickler for carefully composed frames, may well disagree. I would.View image in fullscreenHitchcock understood that a new technology required new techniques … June Tripp in The Lodger, 1927.Photograph: Everett Collection /AlamyIn “microdrama” form, The Lodger’s 90-minute running time is split into chapters (the first couple are free, but to watch the whole movie, you have to pay). Hitchcock maintained that the ideal length of a feature film was “directly related to the endurance of the human bladder”, and most people can sit still for an hour and a half, especially in the hands of the master of suspense. People complain about three-hour runtimes, but Hollywood has long been trying to make short-form drama happen, with only limited success. RememberQuibi?It is true that there are always compromises to be made in film-making, as Hitchcock well knew. As The Lodger’s leading man was Ivor Novello, probably the biggest star in British cinema at the time, Hitchcock was forced to make his ending neater, and less ambiguous than he would have preferred.It is also true that Hitchcock happily adapted to new formats. He shot Britain’s first talkie, Blackmail (1929), and he embraced television. But if you look at the differences between the silent and sound versions of Blackmail, for example, you’ll see that Hitchcock understood that a new technology required new techniques. Maybe he would have made incredible microdramas, but as he isn’t around to do that, the format is best left to film-makers making original vertical content in the here and now.“By repurposing British classics like The Lodger, Tattle TV aims to introduce iconic cinema to a whole new generation of viewers, bridging the gap between film history and contemporary mobile audiences,” Deadline reports. Laudable, although a cynical soul might say it’s an eye-catching announcement that will ragebait the aforementioned old-guard purists into slapping their keyboards in anger and thereby promoting the app. Oops.But if you really want to bridge that gap, maybe remake, not simply reframe, some of the classics of early British cinema, such as the deathless trick film of combustion and dismemberment, Mary Jane’s Mishap (GA Smith, 1903), or The Big Swallow, which were at least designed to play for just a few minutes at a time, and as part of a mixed bill. Continuous performance was the original doomscrolling – possibly.What strikes me as odd, really, is that there is no shortage of ways to watch The Lodger: on disc, or online, at a variety of prices and qualities. For American viewers, I would recommend the Criterion Collection Blu-ray, with Neil Brand’s score. We used to put up with pan-and-scan images on DVD, for example, because there was no other way to see the films at home, but that’s no longer the case. The Lodger is a repertory favourite, which plays on the big screen regularly, so you can actually watch it at the cinema, with live accompaniment, as it was intended to be seen.Tattle’s Lodger announcement arrives after research from the University of Sussex found that scrolling social media is “the activity that brings us least joy”. And another study from the British Council discovered young people rate film and TV as far more influential than digital content. In fact, social media may perversely be thanked for encouraging gen Z back to the big screen – many credit thereviews platform Letterboxdwith kickstarting a youthful cinema-going habit.Now Tattle has given The Lodger a dose of digital Ozempic and slimmed it down to the size of a TikTok, perhaps it will provoke a few more of us to turn off our phones and see a cinematic masterpiece in full – on a screen big enough to handle it.Explore more on these topicsFilmOpinionAlfred HitchcockcommentShareReuse this content"

But the favouritism is justified in this strong field.The record of the year winners tend to be those who combine huge commercial success with the more nebulous sense of having defined the year in pop. Despite being popular, none of Carpenter, Eilish, Gaga or Roan’s songs truly dominated the zeitgeist. Manchild was huge, but still no Espresso.After teeing herself up withthe best live performance of last year’s ceremony, Doechii got her true commercial breakthrough with Anxiety and is up for five awards this year – though for all its huge virality, it heavily samples, and so rather sits in the shadow of, the 2013 winner in this category: Gotye and Kimbra’s Somebody That I Used to Know.APT. has a big chance, as a globe-dominating multi-billion streamer that sent nursery schools, cocktail bars and wedding dancefloors into equal levels of pandemonium thanks to its multiple earworms (even if it’s basically theTing Tings’ That’s Not My Namewith a Hollywood budget).But Luther spent 13 weeks at US No 1, making it one of the most commercially successful R&B and hip-hop songs ever, and – with a typically keeningSZAchorus melody – a demonstration of the artistic chemistry between two all-time American greats.Will winKendrick Lamar & SZAShould winKendrick Lamar & SZAView image in fullscreenSZA and Kendrick Lamar perform during the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show.Photograph: George Walker IV/APAlbum of the yearBad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosJustin Bieber – SwagSabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendClipse – Let God Sort ‘Em OutLady Gaga – MayhemKendrick Lamar – GNXLeon Thomas – MuttTyler, the Creator– ChromakopiaShorn of the type of bloodless Grammy-bait that has pockmarked this category in recent years – where musicianship seems to be prized over songwriting rigour, eg Jacob Collier or Jon Batiste – there isn’t a truly duff album here. The weakest are Tyler, the Creator’sChromakopia, eclipsed by his much more nimble Don’t Tap the Glass last year, andJustin Bieber’s Swag, which contains a handful of his best ever songs (the minimalist marvel Yukon deserves to win best R&B performance) but features some cringeworthy skits and lyrics. Rap devotees will split their votes between the equally good Kendrick and Clipse, and again, Gaga’s and Carpenter’s albums didn’t feel as culture-defining as earlier ones.Instead, the year has very much been defined byBad Bunnyand his outrageously accomplished sixth album. Weaving between reggaeton, salsa, plena and myriad other Latin styles, it is a torrent of pure musicality, and while DTMF may not be big enough on its own to win in song categories, he could triumph here.The closest this category has to Grammy catnip is rising funk and soul star Leon Thomas, who could create an upset: his success has been built on classic songcraft and old-school touring, and his self-deprecating songs about being ruled by his own desires will appeal to Recording Academy members who remember Curtis Mayfield and James Brown as much as those who love neo-soul and hip-hop.Will winBad BunnyShould winBad BunnySong of the yearBad Bunny – DTMFSabrina Carpenter – ManchildDoechii – AnxietyBillie Eilish– WildflowerHuntr/x – GoldenKendrick Lamar & SZA – LutherLady Gaga – AbracadabraRosé & Bruno Mars – APT.Given that casual observers often wonder what the difference between record and song of the year is – and the Grammys themselves make it vague, calling the latter merely “a songwriter(s) award” – it feels especially redundant that this list replicates the record of the year nominees, except with Golden by the fictional band fromKPop Demon Huntersswapped in for Chappell Roan.As a fantastically executed pop-cultural phenomenon, Golden has a good chance despite its hackneyed lyrics. Golden or APT. would be a first bilingual winner in the category – and Bad Bunny’s Spanish-language DTMF would be the first non-English one. His lyrics about absent friends who have emigrated from their Puerto Rico home are affecting and magnificently musical, but could easily lose out to APT.: absolute fluff nonetheless bolstered by solid construction, plusBruno Marshas won this award in previous years for the knowingly silly That’s What I Like and Leave the Door Open.But don’t discount Lamar and SZA, nor indeed Eilish, who has been nominated in this category in six of the last seven years, winning twice. Wildflower was released in May 2024 but theGrammysjustify their Eilish obsession (nine wins, 34 nods) by claiming it “came to prominence” in the eligibility period, as if it weren’t prominent enough being on her huge hit album, Hit Me Hard and Soft. No matter.

The timing is perfect for Dean, who is now enjoying a huge upswing of popularity, enough to edge out Leon Thomas (who will surely pick up at least one R&B category win), with her album The Art of Loving likely to feature heavily in 2027’s nominations.Also in the running are “global girl group” Katseye, and Addison Rae, who may not be a commercial juggernaut but as the favourite of pop musos will have fans in the Academy. Perhaps Sombr has an outside chance: his well-turned tales of miserable yearning, sung from between pop’s sharpest cheekbones, have rightly generated hundreds of millions of streams, though he was surprisingly shut out of the pop categories.Will winOlivia DeanShould winOlivia DeanBest pop solo performanceJustin Bieber – DaisiesSabrina Carpenter – ManchildLady Gaga – DiseaseChappell Roan – The SubwayLola Young – MessyCarpenter deservedly won in this category last year for Espresso, and while Manchild isn’t in the same songwriting league, Carpenter has an unmatched ability to sell a song. Her grip on pop may secure her a win, though you could say the same forChappell Roan, whose vocals on The Subway – half Elizabeth Fraser, half Broadway belle – pack more power.Bieber tends to go home empty-handed from the Grammys, even in the pop fields – only two wins from his 23 nominations prior to this year – and Daisies isn’t distinctive enough in this company. Gaga is in magnificently hammy form on Disease, though it’s not seen as A-grade Gaga material by most listeners.The best performance, and the biggest hit on streaming, is Lola Young with Messy, which achieves the near impossible feat of expressing the emotionally disorientating rhythm of a domestic argument while still being a perfect pop song – but she is a relative outsider in this company.Will winChappell RoanShould winLola YoungBest rock performanceAmyl and the Sniffers – U Should Not Be Doing ThatLinkin Park– The Emptiness MachineTurnstile – Never EnoughHayley Williams – MirtazapineYungblud – Changes (Live from Villa Park, Back to the Beginning)This is the category’s most impressive lineup since 2021, when all the nominees were women or female-fronted. In terms of pure performance, there is a clear winner:Yungblud’s takeon Ozzy Osbourne’s Changes, performed at Black Sabbath’s final concert (backed by members of Anthrax and Sleep Token, and with a splendid Nuno Bettencourt guitar solo). It is a masterclass in rock singing: pure and corrupted all at once.His greatest contenders are Linkin Park, who overcame the death of frontman Chester Bennington to release one of the most successful rock singles in years. The Emptiness Machine is exhilaratingly exacting, peeling back the skin of a rotten relationship. It’s also a terrific performance, especially by new vocalist Emily Armstrong, who points the song’s loathing inward and outward all at once.Will winLinkin ParkShould winYungbludView image in fullscreenMalice (left) and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreBest rap performanceCardi B – OutsideClipse – Chains & Whips (ft Kendrick Lamar and Pharrell Williams)Doechii – AnxietyKendrick Lamar – TV Off (ft Lefty Gunplay)Tyler, the Creator – Darling, I (ft Teezo Touchdown)Lamar has won in seven of the last 11 years in this category, and with two mentions here, could well win again – although TV Off may pale next to last year’s awards-sweeping Drake diss song Not Like Us, excellent though it is. As usual Cardi B provides pure entertainment and mic mastery on Outside but her second album was long delayed, stalling momentum: this just doesn’t feel like her year.Tyler’s track feels rather stuck in his 80s-funk comfort zone. Doechii lost out in 2025 with Nissan Altima – arguably the most technically astounding track in this field for years – but Anxiety is a bigger hit and a more rounded song. And yet Clipse will probably triumph. Not only is Lamar involved, but the story ofthe returning prodigal sonsis irresistible, and Chains & Whips has it all: a tangy hook, and verses filled with Clipse’s trademark amused malevolence, as if they’re wandering around a foe who is being dangled upside down.Will winClipseShould winClipseBest country solo performanceTyler Childers – Nose on the GrindstoneShaboozey – Good NewsChris Stapleton– Bad As I Used to BeZach Top – I Never LieLainey Wilson – Somewhere Over LaredoAnother one where Grammy voters have clear favourites: Stapleton has won five of the six times he’s been nominated in the flagship country category, including the last two years, so he’s the obvious winner. But while Bad As I Used to Be has an engaging tune, Stapleton is more at home singing of his flaws and foibles, and just doesn’t have the necessary danger for outlaw country like this. Shaboozey couldn’t beat him last year despite having one of country’s biggest ever hits in A Bar Song (Tipsy), so the pale stomp-clap of its follow-up Good News won’t be enough in the rematch. Childers’ Nose on the Grindstone is excellent – his Snipe Hunter will surely win best contemporary country album – but is possibly too moody and pared back for a win in a category where traditionalism reigns. Lainey Wilson’s sumptuous punning ballad has a good chance but Zach Top could clinch this: I Never Lie was a big hit and as well as being old school down to the pedal steel, his performance, wryly affecting not to be bothered about his ex’s new man, is pure charm.Will winZach TopShould winZach TopExplore more on these topicsGrammysPop and rockRapCountryK-popAwards and prizesBad BunnyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It also misses the point: rather than being one of the last avatars of a liberal order that has crumbled around our ears, Bowie prophesied the mayhem that has replaced it.In his later years, he thought that we had entered a zone of chaos and fragmentation. This is what allowed him to be so prescient about the internet – not its promise, but its menace. There is no plan and no order. There is just disaster and social collapse. Those looking for reassurance should not listen to Bowie (please listen to something, anything, else). His world, from Space Oddity through to the background violence ofThe Next DayandBlackstar, was always drowned or destroyed or incinerated: “This ain’t rock’n’roll, this is genocide” as he exclaims at the beginning of Diamond Dogs.Bowie prefigured Trumpworld in countless ways. Just listen to Under the God on the much-maligned Tin Machine in 1989: “Washington heads in the toilet bowl / Don’t see the supremacist hate / Rightwing dicks in their boiler suits / Picking out who to annihilate.” The only detail Bowie got wrong were the boiler suits. We live in a world of heathens, as Bowie hinted in the title of hisbrilliant 2002 album. Bowie did not want to lead a heathen existence.Whatever meaning God and religion might have now has to be measured against this vision of collapse. Strangely perhaps, this is exactly how Bowie saw it. Rather than running scared like a jittery liberal, he saw something else “at the centre of it all”, as he says repeatedly on Blackstar. This is what he called “a formidable mystery”: the mystery of transience, of the fact that we are dying, indeed, as he puts it in Diamond Dogs,we are the dead.Which brings me to Ormerod’s book. I was wrong about it. Because I have loved Bowie with an unwaning passion for 54 years, I’ve read too much about him and grown rather blase about his biography. Thus, when I began reading, it all felt a tad familiar. Ormerod tells the story of Bowie’s life and music through the lens of religion, which is absolutely terrific as a central theme, as Bowie was essentiallya religious artist.Ormerod deals with Bowie as text; as the occasion for close reading, which is what his work, like all good art, deservesBeginning with the Anglicanism of St Mary’s Church in Bromley, where Bowie sang in the choir, continuing with his immersion in Tibetan Buddhism in the late 1960s and on to the occultism of Aleister Crowley, Ormerod unpacks the religious preoccupations of Bowie’s art in compelling prose. But still, it all seems rather straightforward and the little stabs at philosophy (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and so on) feel a tiny bit Wiki.But the book takes on a growing velocity when analysing Bowie’s later work, particularly in the chapter on Heathen (I’ve not read anything as good on that album). This momentum develops into fine, detailed discussions of The Next Day and Blackstar, and also Lazarus, his stunning final experiment with musical theatre. What makes these sections so good is that Ormerod deals with Bowie astext;as the occasion for close reading, which I think is what his work, like all good art, deserves.By the end Ormerod had me singing in the choir with him. The book closes with the compelling argument that what drives Bowie’s work – and Ormerod is very good on the centrality of the concept of drive – flows from two essential sources: life and love. When asked whether he had a devotional practice, Bowie answered, “Life. I love life very much indeed”.For much of that life, his work was counterpointed, indeed contradicted, by a certain incapacity to love. This was expressed in his music as an incredibly painful yearning and the experience of isolation which is perhaps the most common theme of his work. Happily, he found love both in the simplicity of family life and in the distension of existence that can, if you are lucky, coincide with ageing and dying.As Ormerod points out, there is an apophaticism to Bowie’s art – that is, a persistent tendency to negate any proposition (not this, not that, and not that either). This can be heard all over his work, but listen to his final song, the last track on Blackstar, I Can’t Give Everything Away, which is subtly devastating in its merging of deep emotion with refusal: “Saying no but meaning yes / This is all I ever meant / That’s the message that I sent.” This tendency to negation, to what Simone Weil called “decreation”, puts him in the company of medieval Christian mystics, like Marguerite Porete.And there is an odd neo-medievalism to Bowie fandom. He was not some messiah rock god (although he played that role in the persona of Ziggy). But he did function as a kind of saint, and it is irresistibly tempting to see his extraordinary archiveat the V&A Eastas a vast reliquary that inspires that most medieval of practices: pilgrimage. Ormerod, like me, is a convert (1996 for him, 1972 for me) and listening to Bowie is church. Religion does not just influence Bowie’s music. It is the music. It is its moving essence. It is at the centre of it all.Simon Critchley is a philosopher and author of On Bowie. David Bowie and the Search for Life, Death and God is published by Bloomsbury Continuum (£20).

After finding this seam of gold, miner Michael dreams that his son will be able to go to school, rather than join the other children who work in the mine, like “blind, bald rodents unearthing themselves in search of scraps of candlelight”. In the novel, which won the 2023 Betty Trask prize, everything closes in on Michael: lungs clog, tunnels collapse, horse-drawn narrowboats are attacked by robbers in the sooty dusk. It’s a vivid reminder of the cost, in bodily suffering, of resource extraction.The Puma, Wiles’s second novel, is also a serious and intense historical novel about a father with limited resources who attempts to break a cycle of violence. In the early 1950s Bernardo, a more morally ambiguous figure than Michael, has brought his young son James across the Atlantic from England to the house in the Patagonian woods where he himself grew up. James chatters blithely about becoming a footballer, but Bernardo is distracted. He thinks he sees “shadows of his family walking in and out”, reminding him of a childhood in which “his eyes were wide and hurt by the twilight and he was barefooted and emptyhearted”.From here, the plot presents a challenge to a reviewer. It’s difficult to summarise the subtle movement between present and past, between Patagonia, Liverpool and France, that gradually reveals the violence Bernardo fled and the violence – as a civilian in the blitz and a British army medic in Normandy – that he walked into. In the present storyline, a sudden tragedy splits the slim book, replacing Bernardo’s search for an idea of home with a search for revenge.The displacement of hurt on to landscape can feel like a powerful critique of 20th-century masculinityIn the first part, makeshift father-son domesticity is recounted with enough tension to make the reader twitchy with anticipation. The second part, in which Bernardo hunts an elusive puma, I found less gripping. There are pages of brush and bramble, rocks and mountain ridges, smells and scrapes on tree bark, blood and pus and shivers, and the making of fires. Bernardo measures out his life in dwindling bullets. “The Puma had become his sole possession in this world and his sole purpose. It sustained him in body and mind.” The obsession takes on a life of its own.It’s clear that the nonhuman world is a victim of Bernardo’s inability to deal with his difficult human feelings. The displacement of hurt on to the landscape can feel like a powerful critique of 20th-century masculinity, as when the novel draws imagistic parallels between a man shot through the eye on a French battlefield and an innocent puma cub seen through a rifle sighting. For a brief while, Bernardo is accompanied on his mission by a Mapuche man. The Mapuche resisted Spanish colonisation in Chile, and the passage establishes a contrast between capitalist destruction and more sustainable indigenous livelihoods. To spell out the point, Bernardo comes across other hunters and is outraged by their outlook: “Those cruel bastards. They do not kill the Huemul [deer] to survive, they are only money to them.”But sometimes the book itself strays close to an escapist fantasy of retreat from the complications of society into the elemental “wilderness”. Bernardo is described as transforming into “a new person, all that had come before stripped away by what was. His eyes like globes red with desire.” At this point I was reminded, uncomfortably, of the hormonal imagery of an advert for men’s fragrance.The voice of The Puma is more uneven and free-floating than the compelling Black Country dialect of Mercia’s Take. The prose here is stylishly elliptical: “The massive stretch of metamorphic rock, old and scarred and capped a thin white like flashes of bone amongst skin.” This composite of scientific precision and elegant simile is the dialect of literary fiction rather than of an individual character in a particular time and place. The Puma is less distinctive than Mercia’s Take. But it extends Wiles’s sincere ambition to explore marginalised histories with viscerally affecting storytelling.The Puma by Daniel Wiles is published by Swift (£14.99).

Launching a new game is an artform in itself – do you go for months of slowly building hype or a sudden shock reveal, simultaneously announcing and releasing a new project in one fell swoop? The latter worked incredibly well for online shooterApex Legends, which remains one of the genre’s stalwarts six years after its surprise launch on 4 February 2019. What you don’t do with a new release, is something that falls awkwardly between those two approaches. Enter Highguard.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This new online multiplayer title from newcomer Wildlight Entertainment has an excellent pedigree. The studio was formed by ex-Respawn Entertainment staff, most of whom previously worked on Titanfall, Call of Duty and the aforementioned Apex Legends. They know what they’re doing. But the launch has been … troubled.The game was revealed via a rather oblique trailer that closed last December’s lavish Game Awards event. Most viewers were expecting the ceremony to end with something huge – a major new announcement from Hideo Kojima, perhaps, or maybe a GTA 6 song and dance number. What they got was a short look at a fantasy-themed online shooter that no one had heard of – andit didn’t go down well.It turns out that Wildlight hadn’t planned to reveal the game before its 26 January launch – they were going to pull another Apex Legends shadow drop – but Game Awards organiser Geoff Keighley played the game, liked it and offered them a free slot at his show. The team couldn’t turn it down. Although perhaps, with hindsight, they should have.View image in fullscreenChoose your hero … Highguard.Photograph: Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.Now it’s out in the open and it’s actually pretty interesting. Combining elements of an online shooter and a Moba (multiplayer online battle arena game), players get into two teams of three, select from a group of differently skilled hero characters and then try to destroy the other side’s base before their own is destroyed. The action comes in phases – first you fortify your castle, then you explore the landscape for loot and power-ups, then the fighting begins. Each part sort of feels like a different game and as I played the first few rounds, I was constantly thinking “ooh, that’s a bit like Rainbow Six Siege” and “ooh, this bit’s like Fortnite”. But the game does have an identity of its own, thanks to its fantasy/mythological styling – you get to ride a sort of spirit horse around the landscape, while different heroes throw lightning bolts or erect walls of ice.However, they also carry shotguns and assault rifles, so that it feels like a weird cross between Call of Duty and a Ray Harryhausen movie. What Respawn has always done well is design incredibly smooth kinetic playspaces, where traversal is rarely impeded. This is a trait that Wildlight Entertainment has inherited – in Highguard you can run, slide, climb and leap in seamless movements, rarely getting stuck on the scenery.But sadly, the game’s disproportionately opulent reveal at the Game Awards has caused some issues. Almost immediately after launch, negative reviews started streaming on tothe game’s Steam page, with players complaining about visual performance issues and long queues to get a match – which doesn’t feel that fair for a game that had only been online for a couple of hours. You have to wonder how destructive that unexpected Game Awards teaser was – the gamer community can be incredibly judgmental and they have long, bitter memories.Highguard did attract around 100k players on day one, not a bad start for a newcomer to the crowded online multiplayer space, but there’s a lot of work to do. The last couple of years has been a battlefield for online blasters, the scarred landscape strewn with the skeletons of failed competitors from Concord to Hyenas and Battleborn. On top of this, Valve, the company behind Steam, has its own Moba-inspired online team game, Deadlock, in development and reaction to the closed beta tests has been positive. Valve is not a rival anyone really wants to go up against.And there’s a reason everyone wants to be in this space – Fortnite is making around $5bn a year, andBattlefield 6was one of the bestselling games of 2025. But considering the risks (hundreds of millions of dollars in development and marketing costs) and the volatile, unpredictable market, I can’t help but feel worried for the Highguard team. They’re banking on players staying around for months, building a community of adoring fans, maintaining huge concurrent player numbers. But it’s going to take a lot to get over the hurdle of that botched reveal.Besides, I have a feeling the next mega hit online shooter won’t be a Frankenstein’s monster of a game, sewn together from the recognisable body parts of previous hits. It’ll be something wild and fresh and new – a Godzilla, emerging from the depths of the game-development ocean, unexpected and bizarre and covered in seaweed. And whatever it is, it won’t get the end slot at the Game Awards, we’ll never see it coming.What to playView image in fullscreenRoute to the summit … Cairn.Photograph: The Game Bakers“Is this another one of your masochist games?” asked my partner, somewhat warily, watching me playmountain-climbing gameCairnthis week. (He is well aware of my affection for extremely difficult video games; he’s witnessed me struggle through so many of them.) Cairn is a game about extreme mountaineering, in which you must move storied climber Aava’s individual limbs to find hand and footholds in the forbidding cliff faces of Kami, a mountain that has never been summited. Aava is obstinately determined to be the first person to get to the top, and as the game progresses, I began to question that obsession (and my own obsession with playing it). It is thoughtful, beautiful, and not always easy, and has provoked a lot of reflection.

In each case there’s a way you think the game should go, and then the designers use your own gaming literacy to challenge those expectations. Can you say more about this small wave of games?”This is also a favourite mini-genre of mine, as someone who for both professional and personal reasons has played really alotof video games. One of the first games like this I ever played wasShadow of the Colossus. Go kill the big monster, the game tells you, as hundreds of games had before. Then you find the first colossus, and it’s just peacefully wandering around. You climb it and slay it, and there’s no fanfare for you. The creature crumples and dies. I felt a little bit sick.Spec Ops: The Linewas also famous for doing this: telling the player to kill, then inviting them to feel awful about it. But as you point out, there are plenty more ways to subvert player expectations now.Frog Fractionsis a classic; if you know nothing about this game, that’s perfect, just play it.The Stanley Parablewas a great comedy-ish entry in this tradition, as isUndertale.

Then again, maybe he is exactly what a cynic needs. At the outset of his 1988 pieceBrandenburgs, with the dancers in tight green velour beaming beatifically out at us, the hardened viewer may be thinking: this is a bit twee, a bit dated. Twenty-five minutes later, after a hurricane of leaping and spinning and tightly honed technique, you’re thinking how joyful it is to be alive.Taylor was one of the most prominent and popular figures in American modern dance, leading his company for more than 60 yearsuntil his death in 2018. The company first visited the UK in 1964, but has not been to London in 20-odd years.

It’s sprightly and full of postcard moments – a snapshot at any point would reveal dancers in lovely open positions, or leaping with huge expanses of air between their feet and the floor. Every step is recognisable, readable, digestible, musical. Despite the sprint speeds and a dizzying number of turns, this is dance that harks back to simpler, analogue times, not the current age’s onslaught of everything.The women wear green Grecian-style dresses and it does feel a bit Olympean: there’s a scene that brings to mind Apollo and his muses, some Euclidean geometry at play. The dancers look like the athletes of the gods,to slightly misquote Martha Graham, although the god to whom they are in thrall may be Bach.View image in fullscreenJazz beats … Lee Duveneck and Alex Clayton of Paul Taylor Dance Company in Under the Rhythm by Robert Battle.Photograph: Ron ThieleThe company now has resident choreographers making new work, as well as preserving Taylor’s archive. The newest of them isRobert Battle, former artistic director of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. His piece Under the Rhythm is intended as a tribute to Battle’s mother and the power of dance to see us through life; it feels like a toast to the glories of African American jazz and modern dance, from the riotous rhythm of a Harlem dancefloor, to two dancers in red tailcoats, a little like theNicholas Brothers, hamming it up to Ella Fitzgerald’s scat. You could infer a nod to Ailey, and is it just me or was that Carlton’s dance from The Fresh Prince? There is an undercurrent of some of the pain and prejudice that lies beneath those stories, but there is also pure virtuosity and showmanship.There are no smiles in Taylor’sPiazzolla Caldera(1997), only seriously smouldering looks. It’s a feisty tango-inspired piece that plays into expectations of Buenos Aires’s seedy underworld. All those sexily furrowed brows indicating the heights of ecstasy start to look rather effortful, yet it’s never not easy to watch. This is dance that wants its audience to enjoy themselves, and it would be hard not to.AtLinbury theatre, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsDanceBalletRoyal BalletRoyal Opera HouseJS BachreviewsShareReuse this content"

Outside, Storm Chandra keeps the streets jumpy. Inside Belfast’s Limelight, a sold-out crowd sits on fold-up seats for a show shifted from Mandela Hall at short notice, the room oddly calm for a venue known for sweat and shoving.Williams is a lodestar in the broad galaxy of music still calledAmericana, and two days after turning 73, she has the authority of a multiple Grammy winner who writes with urgency. She is living with the after-effects of a stroke, stepping on and off stage with care, yet once she’s behind the mic she radiates resolve. If anything, the voice sounds newly burnished; the phrasing more deliberate, the vibrato catching the light.She opens with the title track from her just-released 16th album, World’s Gone Wrong, and it lands as protest carried on groove: harmonies locked, slide guitar set like a slow warning. “We the people … people have the power,” she adds, nodding to Patti Smith, and the band answers with patient force. Ex-Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford plays blues lines with slow-bend eloquence that never crowds her phrasing. Brady Blade steers the set, his cymbals creating a washed, phased shimmer as the music tilts skyward.The best moments come when the writing trusts small detail. Right in Time turns the everyday into charged intimacy – kettle boiling, jewellery coming off – before she smiles: “I guess some of my songs are a little suggestive.” Car Wheels on a Gravel Road burrows into memory via smell and radio, its simplicity doing the damage. Later, You Can’t Rule Me is a peak, delta boogie pushed into double-time. There is a slight sameiness in the run of new protest songs about economic strain, racial injustice, and who gets to wield power, granted, but Williams persuasively argues these issues are “at the forefront,” and everyone needs relief.A cover of Neil Young’s Rockin’ in the Free World turns the room into a bellowed closing singalong. Williams, delighted, catches herself: “It’s great to be in Dublin … oh wait – Belfast.

But later this yearHarry Potter and the Cursed Childwill only be staged in London as a shortened, single production running 175 minutes.The new format is in line with the other versions of the hit play presented in the US, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan. Its producers announced on Monday that a one-part production would make it more accessible, “allowing even more audiences to experience the story with one ticket and one visit to the theatre”.Currently, in London, theatregoers purchase separate tickets for each part of the play, with the cheapest total cost coming to £30. The two parts (which each have an interval) can be seen on the same day, with a couple of hours’ break in between, or on different days. Prices for the new version, which has one interval, are yet to be announced. The two-part production will run at the Palace theatre until 20 September. The one-part version will open at the Palace on 6 October.The play – which is the eighth story in novelist JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series – had its world premiere in London in 2016 and won a record-breakingnine Olivier awards. Rowling, who collaborated with writerJack Thorne and director John Tiffanyon the production, originally said that it was split into two parts because of the “epic nature of the story” which is set 19 years after the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.View image in fullscreen‘Deep affection for these characters’ … Naana Agyei-Ampadu as Hermione, Thomas Aldridge as Ron and David Ricardo-Pearce as Harry.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThe producers of the play, Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, said on Monday: “As newHarry Potterfans discover these stories every day, drawn in by their enduring power and the deep affection for these characters, we felt this milestone moment was the right time to make the production more accessible than ever before. Now running at under three hours, the reimagined production retains its scale, illusions and theatrical magic, and emotional depth, while allowing more audiences to experience the story in a single visit.”Tom Felton to reprise role as Draco Malfoy in Harry Potter and the Cursed ChildRead moreThe trimmed runtime should also appeal to theatregoers bringing young children (the show is recommended for over-eights) and those – not just children – who have shorter attention spans. But even at 175 minutes, the new Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will still be longer than many West End plays. Theatre impresario Rosemary Squire said last summer thataudiences were put off by long running times“because they’re starting to panic and think ‘I’ve got to get up for work tomorrow’, and ‘When will I get the last train?’, et cetera … As an industry, we need to listen to that.”It is not just an issue for theatres.Earlier this month, Clare Binns, the creative director of Picturehouse Cinemas, said: “I look at a lot of films and think: ‘You could take 20 minutes out of that.’ There’s no need for films to be that long.” Binns suggested that epic running times have deterred audiences returning to the cinema after the Covid-19 pandemic. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opened on Broadway in the two-part format. When US theatres reopened after the Covid pandemic, the streamlined one-part production took its place.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndHarry Potter and the Cursed ChildHarry PotterJK RowlingJack ThorneJohn TiffanynewsShareReuse this content"

It was at the suggestion of the conductor John Minchinton that they started playing as a duo, and in 1962Lord Harewoodinvited them to perform Bartók’sSonata for Two Pianos and Percussionat the Edinburgh international festival. It proved to be a notable success, and in the following year’s festival they gave it again.John’s joint victory at the Tchaikovsky International Competition in 1962, sharing first place with Vladimir Ashkenazy, led to international tours. In Australia in 1964 the couple had separate performing schedules as well as playing as a duo, and Brenda cared for their infant daughter, Annabel. Later tours included several to the US, where on one occasion they performed Mozart’s Concerto for Three Pianos in Houston with the conductor, André Previn, at the third keyboard, and to the Soviet Union.In 1968 they gave the premiere of the Concerto for Two Pianos by Alan Rawsthorne and Stravinsky’s Concerto for Two Solo Pianos at the Proms, and their recording of the Bartók Sonata was released. They also gave the work in the second of their two Proms appearances (1969). Other celebrated recordings included Rachmaninov’s twoSuites for Two Pianos(1975) and Messiaen’sVisions de l’Amen(1971).Brenda Lucas Ogdon performing works by Mozart, Beethoven and RachmaninovJohn’s struggles with mental illness, as well as Brenda’s in coping while raising a family, were documented in the book Virtuoso (1981), which she co-wrote with Michael Kerr. It was revised just before her husband’s death at the age of 52from pneumonia, exacerbated by undiagnosed diabetes, in 1989. In theBBC Screen Two docudramaof the same year adapted from the book, the couple were played by Alison Steadman and Alfred Molina.“John, impossible, adorable John, has dominated every aspect of my adult life,” Brenda wrote in Virtuoso. When I interviewed her four years ago for the booklet notes forA Life in Music, a double-CD reissue of her recordings with John or of his compositions, she recalled being nominated for a Women of the Year award on the strength of the book, and disconcerted at being designated “Brenda Lucas, author” on the place marker for the lunch. Of her recordings of John’s music, those of the two sets of Preludes and the Fourth Sonata are particularly fine and demonstrate a deep understanding of her husband’s creative persona.Brenda had had a promising solo career prior to her marriage to John in 1960, and in the years immediately following. She had been inspired initially by the example of the “larger-than-life and very glamorous” Australian pianist Eileen Joyce. She made her first appearance with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra at the age of 21, going on to give solo recitals for the BBC from their Manchester studio as well as a critically well-received recital at the Wigmore Hall, London, in 1962.Born in Hyde, Cheshire (now in Greater Manchester), Brenda was the elder daughter of Martha (nee Ratcliffe), headteacher of the infant school where Brenda started her education, and Jack Lucas, who worked for the then National Assistance Board. While theirs was not a particularly musical house, her father was a keen ballroom dancer and her mother could play the piano “a little”.When Brenda was seven her parents acquired an upright piano and almost immediately Brenda started picking out tunes by ear. A local music teacher, Mrs Round, taught her the basics, until at 11 Brenda moved on to the convent-run Harrytown high school in Bredbury, Stockport, where her musical talents were encouraged by Sister Mary Angela. At 13, Brenda scored the highest mark of anyone in the entire country at Grade VII and was awarded the Associated Board’s gold medal.Offers of scholarships at the Royal Academy of Music and Royal College of Music in London proving impractical when she was 14, Brenda finally went to the then Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern) in 1952, where she studied with Iso Elinson. She gained a reputation as an accompanist for wind and string players, including the violinist Martin Milner, later leader of the Hallé Orchestra. In 1956-57, she attended summer school courses at the Salzburg Mozarteum in Austria.It was at the RMCM that she met John – fellow students there also included the composersHarrison BirtwistleandPeter Maxwell Davies. She graduated with honours in 1957, and the couple moved to London, where in the early 1960s she had lessons with Ilona Kabos.After the birth of their second child, Richard, Brenda put her performing career on hold to care for her children and husband; John became increasingly ill and intermittently violent through the 70s. Although he resumed performing a decade later, until his death, Brenda – who toured again with him in the Soviet Union in 1985 – found it harder to pick up the pieces of her own career.However, she toured again to the US and, in 1996, Hong Kong, and made fine recordings in later years of music byBach, andDebussy and Ravel. In 1993, she established theJohn Ogdon Foundation, dedicated to preserving his legacy, and became a noted teacher.She is survived by Annabel, Richard, and four grandchildren.Brenda Lucas Ogdon, pianist and author, born 23 November 1935; died 13 December 2025Explore more on these topicsClassical musicobituariesShareReuse this content"

TikTok videos don’t count towards US chart positions, but viral trends drive listeners towards songs on streaming services that do count.Lover, You Should Have Come Over is an acoustic ballad in which Buckley laments a broken relationship and longs for the lover of the title to return and forgive him. “All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter … she’s the tear that hangs inside my soul for ever,” runs one particularly heartfelt section.The track features on Grace, Buckley’s sole studio album, released in 1994. The album only reached No 82 in the US but was a touchstone for college students and hopeless romantics, eventually becoming a platinum seller.Remembering Jeff Buckley: 'People would listen with their mouths open'Read moreTragically, Buckley never followed it up. He died in 1997, accidentally drowning while swimming in the Mississippi River. Sketches for songs he had been working on for a second album were released the following year as the compilation Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. In 2016, another compilation of unheard material was released: You and I, chiefly containing cover versions he’d recorded in 1993, including songs by Bob Dylan, the Smiths and Led Zeppelin.Buckley is not the only 90s-alternative name to belatedly get a chart hit thanks to TikTok: Radiohead’s song Let Down, from 1997’s OK Computer, charted for the first time in 2025.In December, TikTok’s Year in Music report claimed that eight of the 10 US No 1 singles of 2025 “had a viral moment on TikTok first”, and that all of the year’s 13 UK No 1 singles went viral on the platform at some point.Explore more on these topicsJeff BuckleyPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

When we think “ugly” (hurtful, spiteful, non-constructive) thoughts, our faces tense and harden. Similarly, when I ignore my needs, my face shows me signs of it.While you have valid critiques of beauty culture, I’d like to see them balanced with inspiring solutions, like expanding upon this “inner beauty”– beauty in energetic and emotional form, the eternal youthfulness that no filler or lift can imitate and no wrinkle can hide. I genuinely believe this would contribute towards a greater good!– Begin WithinTwo things can’t both be true here. Either the soul shapes the body (“you get the face you deserve”) or it doesn’t (“no wrinkle can hide inner beauty”).Join me in a little thought experiment: how can we visually determine when wrinkles indicate the ordinary ageing of a good-natured person, then? How do they physically differ from those of a “spiteful” person?We can’t, and they don’t, because this isn’t how bodies and souls work.And yet, these beliefs are as widely held as they are wrong!Consider the public reaction to Vanity Fair’s recent up-close and, uh,pore-sonal portraitsof members of the Trump administration. Comedian Lisandra Vázquezzeroed inon 28-year-old press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s fine lines, saying: “If you’re evil, you will age like milk” (99,000 likes, 65,000 shares).Images of 68-year-old chief of staff Susie Wiles provoked similarcomments: “Lying is bad for your skin,” “Hate ages people horribly” and cracks about her “thin, villainous lips”.Now consider the public reaction to a pivotal scene in 2023’s Barbie, in which a wrinkled, 91-year-old woman smiles at Barbie, who in return tells her she’s “beautiful”. Greta Gerwig, the director, called this “the heart of the movie”. Fans agreed. “You look at women who have lived life and think, wow, what beauty,” one Reddit commenterwroteafter watching.So what’s happening here?Our perception of a person’s physical beauty is colored byour perception of their behavior. If you look at Wiles’s wrinkles and see evil, it’s not because wrinkles signal moral failing; it’s because you think Wiles’sactionsdo. If an old lady smiles at you warmly and you see beauty, it’s not because wrinkles signal virtue; it’s because herwarmthdoes. Our silly little brains collapse these ethical judgments into aesthetic ones because human beings are physical, visual creatures, desperate to make visible sense of abstract thoughts.The false association between inner goodness and outer beauty is hard to shake for a few reasons. For starters, it’s old: the ancient Greeks used the same word,kalos, for both. In the 18th century, the concept found new life in phrenology and physiognomy – fields of pseudoscience that claimed people’s facial characteristics were manifestations of their character – which were weaponized byracists, eugenicists and Nazisto exert power over people they deemed “lesser than”.This framework has since been discredited, but it’s still constantly reinforced in western culture – readPerfect Me: Beauty As an Ethical Idealby Heather Widdows for more on this.It’s also a profitable idea for cosmetic companies, which promise “inner beauty” through external and highly visible consumption, as Tressie McMillan Cottom writes inThick: And Other Essays.(In my former life as a beauty editor, I wasguilty of thismyself. Sorry!)If you want an “inspiring solution”, how about completely divorcing inner and outer beauty?I think this starts with language – molder of minds,shaper of beliefs.Much like in ancient Greece, “beauty” serves as a catch-all term for many separate ideas today: the formal beauty of nature or art, a person’s physical appearance and the “energetic, emotional” state you reference (among others).At leastsomeof the above ethics/aesthetics confusion stems from using the same word to describe, say, donating a kidney to a stranger andgetting a BBL with cadaver fat, right? These are different things! They demand different names!If I had my say, we’d reserve “beauty” for flowers, paintings, sculptures, songs. A ripe peach, or a well-composed photograph. Satisfying sentences. My mother’s loopy handwriting. Sensorial experiences that take us beyond ourselves, and beyond our own bodies.When self-interest is involved, philosophers argue the word “beauty” doesn’t apply, anyway. Immanuel Kant said experiences of beauty must be “disinterested” – in other words, appreciated for their own sake, with no benefit to the beholder. Iris Murdoch described beauty as “an occasion for unselfing”.What the beauty industry sells us isn’t beauty at all then, but “appearance” or “cosmetics” or sometimes “hygiene”.And if a person’s appearance or spirit draws you in and incites desire? That’s attractiveness.You say your face shows when you’ve neglected your needs. This falls under the banner of health. Physical and mental wellbeingcaninfluence what you look like, sure – dehydration dulls skin; stress furrows brows and forms wrinkles – but this has nothing to do with getting what you “deserve”. Good people experience line-forming stress! Bad peoplemeditate daily! Plenty of lovely people lack healthcare, and plenty of terrible people pay top dollar for it!And while everyone deservesaccessto it, no one has a moral obligation to be or look healthy.As for the “inner beauty” you describe – the sort that “contributes to the greater good”? I’d simply call itgoodness. Focus on that. It won’t change your face, but look on the bright side: that means “no wrinkle can hide it”, either.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleAsk UglyWell actuallyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While they remain titleholders, a host of other cities from Berlin to Seoul and Lagos have been vying for the same recognition to become “the fifth fashion week”. But so far only one real winner has emerged: Copenhagen fashion week.On Tuesday, the Danish showcase, which has helped catapult homegrown brands including Ganni into the international spotlight while spearheading sustainability initiatives, kicked off the start of its 20th-anniversary celebrations.What began as the merging of two small trade fairs in 2006 has become a biannual event on the fashion calendar, attracting editors from glossy publications including Vogue, buyers from global luxury stores, and influencers who descend in their droves for the street style scene. Back in its infancy in 2006, it was mainly met with scepticism. Cecilie Thorsmark, the chief executive of Copenhagen fashion week (CPHFW), describes the showcase’s founder, Eva Kruse, as “a visionary”. The former Eurowoman magazine editor “set out from the start to make it the fifth fashion week. But she was met with a lot of doubt. People found her vision to be unrealistic. Yet, here we are today.”View image in fullscreenCecilie Bahnsen’s ‘meticulously crafted’ dresses appeal to US customers.Photograph: James CochraneSince CPHFW’s inception, the Danish fashion industry has grown significantly. Fashion is now Denmark’s third-largest export commodity. International demand from countries including the US and Germany are up 84% and fashion now represents5% of Denmark’s total merchandise exports.Linda Cui Zhang, the fashion director of Nordstrom, a luxury retail chain that operates in 39 US states, says Danish brands appeal to its customers as they “embody principles of the Scandinavian lifestyle”, pointing to Cecilie Bahnsen’s intricate romantic dresses that are “meticulously crafted and versatile enough for many occasions” and Lié Studio’s sculptural jewellery “made to be worn daily”.Reflecting on CPHFW’s vicennial anniversary, Thorsmark, who became chief executive in 2018, says the biggest highlight has been the successful implementation of itssustainability framework. In 2020, CPHFW gave brands three years to meet 18 minimum standards – ranging from the banning of plastic hangers to rules around the type of textiles that could be used – or face being banned from the schedule.For an industry known for greenwashing, it was a bold move. In its first year, several brands failed to meet the requirements, but today more than 30 brands comply, while fashion councils in Britain and Germany are also following its lead. Thorsmark says the framework has “really underlined the potential of taking a fashion week and transforming it from a showcase event to a catalyst for change”.One of Denmark’s biggest success stories is Ganni, a brand that has popularised everything from leopard-print jeans to fruit-emblazoned T-shirts, leading it to a £500m valuation in 2022. As a further marker of the brand’s success, two years later it followed in the footsteps of Bahnsen, another homegrown talent, and decamped to Paris fashion week, the acme of fashion, home to Chanel and Dior.View image in fullscreenCopenhagen fashion week helped Ganni ‘to become an international brand’.Photograph: GanniDitte Reffstrup, the brand’s creative director, says showing biannually in Copenhagen from 2014 – during which its#GanniGirlsstreet-style phenomena emerged – was instrumental to its success. “There is no doubt Copenhagen fashion week has been our main stage and helped us to become an international brand.”It is a sentiment echoed by Rikke Baumgarten and Helle Hestehave, the co-founders of Baum und Pferdgarten. When they took part in the inaugural edition of CPHFW, their families helped build the catwalk, friends helped cut out seating cards and the show was watched by mainly local or Scandi press. Twenty years later, the brand is stocked in more than 30 countries. “In the beginning the shows were far more primitive and intimate,” Baumgarten says. “It felt much more amateur. Copenhagen fashion week has changed enormously and it has been a crucial platform for our growth as a brand. Giving us visibility, credibility, and the opportunity to evolve from something very local into something truly international.”Reffstrup says CPHFW is essential for supporting new talent, and Ganni now assists by providing patronage and mentorship to emerging Nordic brands. “You can very easily drown in Paris or Milan. There are so many brands to compete with and even to get a time slot on the schedule is difficult. Here in Copenhagen you are centre-stage.”This year a homecoming annual slot has been introduced, with the aim of welcoming back brands after presenting elsewhere. Holzweiler, which has most recently shown in London, will be the first to take part on Wednesday. It was inspired by Bahnsen, who last August staged her 10th-anniversary show in the Danish capital rather than Paris.Thorsmark says: “The ambition will never be to keep brands in Copenhagen for ever but to support them in whatever feels relevant for the brand itself so that they continue to develop and thrive. Even though we do miss the brands incredibly, it’s a positive progression that shows the potential of what we can nurture in Copenhagen.”Explore more on these topicsFashion weeksDenmarkFashion industrySustainable fashionEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fee for divine guidance would be paid for by animal sacrifice – a goat, or perhaps a sheep for particularly pressing issues. Fast forward to 2026, and inflation has taken its toll. The price of admission to Sage’s Oracle Jet is now closer to that of a cow. For anyone who isn’t a regular at their local livestock markets, that’s about £1,700.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, the Oracle Jet does exactly what it says on the tin. This is an assisted espresso machine that guides users from coffee bean to espresso cup (hence the “Oracle”), froths milk to silken perfection, and heats up in seconds because of the use of fast-heating ThermoJet technology (yep, “Jet”).It promises “third-wave specialty coffee” in the comfort of your own kitchen – that’s really good coffee, in other words. A large colour touchscreen leads users through every step, and the level of assistance means mistakes are almost impossible. All the hard bits are automated, and all the fun bits – clunking the portafilter into place, pouring the silky hot milk into the espresso – are left to you.View at SageView at John LewisWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPersonal touch: you can add your own recipes alongside the 14 preset coffees.Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianThe Oracle Jet is a wonderfully approachable reimagining of the manual espresso machine. Where similarly priced fully manual models are all knobs and clunky click switches, Sage has replaced all the controls with a single power button and a 5in colour touchscreen.The result is it’s unlikely you’ll need to refer to the manual – although it’s there. Imagine an Apple MacBook-esque experience but for coffee: tap the power button and the Oracle Jet comes to life with a jaunty three-note motif. Bright images, annotations and looping videos introduce every aspect of the machine, after which a step-by-step tutorial leads you through brewing your first coffee, one tap at a time.With the introductions complete, the touchscreen presents a scrolling list of 14 drinks. The list includes (deep breath) flat white, latte, cappuccino, espresso, americano, babyccino, hot chocolate, tea, cafe crema, cold brew, cold espresso, caffe shakerato, milk shakerato and espresso martini (and no – the booze isn’t included).Keep in mind that the Oracle Jet isn’t a fully automatic – or super-automatic (as they’re sometimes known) – machine. You still need to brew the espresso, then steam the milk and add it to the cup yourself.View image in fullscreenHydration station: the removable water tank.Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianAlso, since this machine has a single ThermoJet for heating water – unlike its much pricier cousin, theOracle Dual Boiler– you’ll need to brew coffee and then steam the milk afterwards. Helpfully, though, you won’t have to stand at the machine and wait: you can pop the milk jug into place and tap the milk and coffee icons one after another – it will start steaming the milk the moment the coffee pouring is finished.Each of the 14 recipes can be customised to your taste – or to ensure that they fill your favourite mug. You can add your own recipes, too. This is just as well: if everyone in your household has a different idea about their perfect coffee, you can create a separate drinks profile for each person.The Jet displays many lovely little design touches. At 12kg, this is a heavy machine, so it’s handy that there are wheels underneath. Pull the lever under the drip tray to the left and you can taxi the Jet around the worktop. If you don’t have much clearance above the machine, you’ll appreciate being able to slide it out to refill the 340g bean hopper on top. And given that the double baskets hold about 22g of coffee, you’ll need to refill the machine every 15 coffees or so.The 2.3-litre water tank slots into the back, and while you can top it up via a chute hidden under the panel on the top of the machine, you’ll probably want to empty and refill it with fresh water fairly often. The internal water filter lasts about three months under normal use;replacementsare pricey at about £15 a pop.Given the Jet’s price, it’s nice to see a stainless steel milk jug and a little knock box (for tapping out the used pucks of coffee) included as standard. You also get some tools to clean the grinder and tamping fan, descaling powder, a couple of cleaning tablets, a blanking plate for back flushing, and a poking tool for clearing any steam wand blockages.View at SageView at John LewisSage Oracle Jet specificationsType:fully assisted espresso machineDimensions:38 x 37 x 43cm (WDH)Water tank:removable 2.3 litreReplaceable water filter:yesAccessories supplied:58mm portafilter, milk jug, cleaning brush, single and double unpressurised baskets, knock box, cleaning kit (two cleaning tablets, one descaling tablet), water hardness test kitTime to heat up:6secTime to steam milk:1min 12secGrinder included:yes, 45 settingsNoise:46dB (brew), 58dB (steam)Weight:12kgWarranty:two-year repair or replaceWhat we loveView image in fullscreenBrew’s the daddy? ‘It’s easy to tweak things towards perfection.’Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianWhen it comes to brewing espresso – both hot and cold – and whipping dairy or plant-based milks into a hot froth, the Oracle Jet is probably the best assisted machine there is.Feed it with the best-quality coffee beans and you’ll get everything from unctuous shots of espresso to startlingly fine flat whites – and with barely any effort at all. Thanks to its cold brew talents, it’s as happy serving up a refreshingly cold iced coffee as it is an espresso martini.The automation is just superb. First, you lift the portafilter into place underneath the grinder. A quick twist to the right and the tamping fan whirrs into action; the grinder soon follows suit, and the portafilter fills with the precise volume of coffee required. That done, you simply move the portafilter across to the brewing group and lock it into place with a firm twist. Tap the espresso icon and about 30 seconds later, it’s in your cup. If it pours too fast or too slow, the touchscreen prompts you to adjust the grind size accordingly. The knob on the side provides 45 steps of adjustment, too, which is plenty.What’s more, it’s incredibly easy to tweak things towards perfection. Whether it’s a shorter or longer shot, or adjusting the brew temperature up or down, a few taps on the touchscreen is all it takes. Just adjust, taste and then save the settings that you feel work best.It’s the ease with which the Oracle Jet creates superb coffee that makes it so lovable. The automatic tamping doesn’t save a vast amount of time compared with models that have manual levers – nor simple tampers, for that matter – but removing just one or two steps makes the process feel more immediate. Combined with a heat-up time of mere seconds – six, if you’re counting – it means you’re so much more likely to use it.View image in fullscreenLittle and large: the Oracle Jet is able to make 14 styles of drink, hot and cold.Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianSimilarly, you don’t need a barista certification to steam milk to a pristine microfoam. Half-fill the supplied stainless steel milk jug, select the type of milk you’re using – there are settings for dairy, oat, almond and soy – and tap the milk jug icon. There are eight adjustable “texture” (AKA froth) levels, and you can adjust the temperature from 40C to 75C. If you predominantly use one type of milk in your household, simply set that as the default.My best results were with full-fat dairy milk, but barista-centric oat milks were good, too. You can steam the milk manually, but it’s less satisfying than on a proper manual machine – the steam wand only moves back and forth, in contrast to the more adjustable ball joint on manual machines. And, frankly, the automatic results are superb – and a great timesaver: the Oracle Jet steamed 180ml of milk to 65C in a little over a minute in my tests, which is among the fastest of the machines I’ve tested.If you’re the kind of person who walks into a car showroom and simply has to buy the bigger, faster, better model, then you’ll probably already be striding past the Oracle Jet towards Sage’s £2,250Oracle Dual Boiler. But for most people reading this, there’s nothing the Dual Boiler does better to justify the additional money. And does it make a markedly better coffee? No, I don’t think it does.The Oracle Jet’s trump card over its pricier sibling is speed. It heats up in seconds, rather than the five minutes of its sibling, which means you can flick it on and make a couple of coffees in the time it takes the Dual Boiler to get up to temperature. The Jet lacks the manual mode – but the kind of person who cares deeply about such things is probably in the wrong place. If you’re willing to go it alone, then the excellent £1,099.95Sage Dual Boilerand a separate top-notch grinder would be a far better pairing.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreenAn advanced manual mode wouldn’t go amiss.Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianIt’s great that the Oracle Jet prompts users to adjust the grind size automatically, though its guidance isn’t infallible. On occasion, shots will pour too fast or too slow, and it won’t suggest any changes. With good coffee in the hopper, many won’t care – or potentially notice – but you won’t always be getting the best from the coffee beans at hand.In fairness, this isn’t a downside that’s unique to the Oracle Jet. Every coffee needs a slightly different grind size, dosage, brew temperature, shot ratio (the ratio of ground coffee to brewed coffee), extraction time or a combination of all five, to be at its best. However, the Oracle Jet gets beginners into the right ballpark without any difficulty. Perhaps it would be nice to see more focus on the beans in the hopper – the roast level, in particular – so it can optimise the settings accordingly.This is one area where the admittedly excellent interface could go one step further: a barista training mode, or similar. A software upgrade could transform the Oracle Jet into an amazing tool for teaching users how they can translate taste into actions for better coffee.My final criticism is the lack of a more fully featured manual mode. As this is aimed at beginners, I can see why Sage has hidden away the brewing temperature control in the main settings menu – but an advanced manual mode, like the Dual Boiler’s, could take shots from good to great to life-changing. Given that the Oracle Jet has wifi – and received several firmware updates during my time with it – it’s not an impossible ask.Warranty and repairabilityView image in fullscreen‘There’s a good supply of parts available for Sage machines.’Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianYou get two years of warranty with the Oracle Jet. As with most manufacturers, Sage will decide whether to repair or replace your machine in the event of an issue.In the event of an out-of-warranty repair being required, you’ll need an independent engineer. We sought the advice of Radu Bria, who runs acoffee machine repair business in Manchester. According to Bria, there’s a good supply of parts available for Sage machines: they can be sourced viaCoffee Classics, which is an authorised repair agent for Sage, Lelit, Baratza and Melitta. You can book out-of-warranty repairs through it directly, or support your local coffee machine engineer, such as Bria.As ever, regular maintenance is key to a long-lasting machine. A water-hardness test strip is supplied, so you can be made aware when it’s time to descale and clean the Jet. Since ThermoJet designs can be prone to limescale build-up, it’s important to use the manufacturer-recommended cleaning products regularly. Sage includes some to get you started.There’s a water filter in the box – they usually last for about three months – and you’ll definitely want to keep a spare in the cupboard.Sage Oracle Jet: should I buy it?View image in fullscreenJet-setter: ‘The kind of coffee that would give any top-notch independent coffee shop a good run for its money.’Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianWhether the Oracle Jet’s talents represent value for money will very much depend on how much you love coffee – and how hands-on you want to be with the coffee-making process. With a cow-sized budget burning a hole in your toga pocket, you’re not exactly short of options.If you want the best possible coffee, the Oracle Jet absolutely destroys the fully automatic bean-to-cup models on the market. They’re not even close: the Jet’s espresso and milk texturing are a huge cut above. Yes, it’s more effort than a single button press, but the reward is the kind of coffee that would give any top-notch independent coffee shop a good run for its money.And let me be clear, this machine isn’t daunting to use. For a household with a mixture of coffee obsessives and beginners, it’s a genuine joy. Feed it with superb coffee, and it will make stunning coffee regardless of your skill level. Yes, it is expensive, but if it helps you – and your fellow coffee-lovers – kick an expensive coffee-shop habit, it will pay for itself sooner than you think.View at SageView at John LewisSasha Muller is a tech and consumer journalist, avid coffee drinker and craft beer enthusiast with more than two decades of experience in testing products and avoiding deadlines.

To help answer that question, my teeth have become figurative guinea pigs. Over the past year, I’ve put a bunch of electric toothbrushes from Oral-B, Philips, Suri, Ordo, Silk’n, Foreo and more through their paces to separate the best from the rest. Here are my conclusions.At a glanceBest electric toothbrush overall:Spotlight Sonic Pro£94.99 at AmazonBest value electric toothbrush:Icy Bear Next-Generation sonic toothbrush£64.99 at AmazonBest electric toothbrush for sustainability:Suri 2.0£89.25 at SuriBest premium electric toothbrush:Philips Sonicare Smart 9400£199.99 at John LewisBest oscillating toothbrush:Oral-B iO3£75 at BootsThe best water flossers, tested: seven models for that dentist-clean feelingRead moreWhy you should trust meAs well as having the physical qualities required to test electric toothbrushes (my own teeth and a reliable toothpaste budget), I’ve been testing electronics – phones, drones and everything in between – for more than a decade.Also – and I’ll put this delicately to prevent you from closing the page in justified disgust – as someone who has to wear a retainer every night after Invisalign treatment, the toothbrushes weren’t short of nasties to clean during testing. They’ve seen things, man.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I appeared to undergo a Damascene conversion to good oral hygiene.’Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianI doubt many people include the four minutes spent brushing their teeth as a highlight of even the most tedious day, so spare a thought for the months when it has become my life’s obsessive focus. Fortunately, and purely by chance, my first test coincided with a dentist’s visit in which I appeared to have undergone a Damascene conversion to good oral hygiene, so it did have its upside.Anyway, the process was actually pretty simple: brush, brush and brush again, taking note of mouthfeel, grip, cleanliness, the features that appealed and those little things that made me irrationally grumpy. I used plaque-disclosing tablets, which turn your teeth a charming shade of pink and blue to reveal areas where plaque resides. Even the cheapest brushes did a good job of removing the blue, though, even if they didn’tfeelas clean, so this test proved unhelpful.Ultimately, while each of the 22 brushes I tested was leagues ahead of manual toothbrushes, I ordered them based on performance, features, feel, stamina and – perhaps most importantly, given how close the final results were – value for money.A quick note on that: toothbrush recommended retail prices (RRPs) are often what you’d call “aspirational”. They’re frequently on offer, and even £500 models regularly go on sale for less than half price. It’s worth clicking through and checking what today’s price is on the off-chance.The best electric toothbrushes in 2026View image in fullscreenA dental hygiene lineup of some of the toothbrushes tested.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianBest electric toothbrush overall:Spotlight Sonic ProSpotlightSonic Profrom£94.99£104.97 at Spotlight£94.99 at AmazonWhat we loveA great all-rounder that gives a super clean at a fair priceWhat we don’t loveThe different modes aren’t labelled on the brushPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£104.97 at Spotlight£94.99 at AmazonThe Spotlight Sonic Pro is a great all-rounder, with excellent features and a price that doesn’t verge on ridiculous. Founded by two sibling dentists, Spotlight has only two electric toothbrushes for adults at the moment, and the Pro model tested here delivers on every metric that counts.Why we love itFirst of all, the Spotlight Sonic Pro performs an impressive clean. Its four modes range from 30,000 (gentle) to 50,000 (polish) brush strokes a minute (BPM). That makes it the second most powerful sonic brush I tested, and the two that delivered more have RRPs starting at £400. While not completely necessary for a healthy mouth, such speeds help provide that “fresh from the hygienist” feeling, even when your teeth are crying out for a thorough clean after a day mainlining soft drinks.It also packs a pressure sensor to make sure you’re not brushing too hard and potentially damaging your gums, and there are four lights just below the head to show how far you are into your two-minute brushing cycle.Flip the heads over and you’ll find a tongue cleaner, plus it comes with a handy travel case too. While this doesn’t charge the brush, the magnetic USB-C charging base is pretty compact, and a single charge can last up to 70 days, which is above average for an electric toothbrush. Even at the higher speeds I was using it at, it didn’t show any signs of slowing down during the testing period, so that feels accurate.If you can do without the pressure sensor, progress lights, tongue cleaner and polish setting, you’re likely to be just as happy with thenon-Pro versionand can save a few quid.It’s a shame that …modes aren’t labelled on the brush itself, even if you can easily feel the difference.Type:sonicModes: four (gentle, clean, white and polish)Power: 50,000 BPMPressure sensor:yesBattery life: up to 70 daysApp: noReplacement head cost:£22.50 for threeSpotlightSonic Profrom£94.99£104.97 at Spotlight£94.99 at AmazonWhat we loveA great all-rounder that gives a super clean at a fair priceWhat we don’t loveThe different modes aren’t labelled on the brushBest value electric toothbrush:Icy Bear Next-Generation sonic toothbrushIcy BearNext-Generation sonic toothbrush£64.99£64.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe cheapest brush to come with a pressure sensorWhat we don’t loveNo charging stand, leading to slightly awkward rechargingPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£64.99 at AmazonThere were three strong contenders in the £50-65 price bracket that I was considering for the best-value pick (the£59.99 Ordo Sonic+and theSilk’n SonicSmile Plus (usually £50) were the others), but I ultimately chose the £65 Icy Bear because it was the only one to come with a pressure sensor. In fact, this was the cheapest toothbrush I reviewed that had one.Why we love itOddly, the pressure sensor isn’t pitched as the main selling point, which is instead, rather confusingly, fingerprint recognition. This isn’t some kind of added dental security – it’s to prevent it from being activated in luggage without needing an extra case, and it works pretty well (with a perfectly angled edge and a lot of effort, I was able to turn it on without skin contact – but it’s not something you’ll do by accident).Otherwise, it ticks all the boxes. The top of the handle glows white when in use, and flashes ominously if you’re pushing too hard, and there are a generous five brushing modes. At its maximum power, it hits a very respectable 40,000 BPM for a solid clean, too.It’s a shame that …there’s no charging stand, and you’ll need to open up a flap on the base for USB-C charging.Type:sonicModes:five (clean, whiten, polish, massage and sensitive)Power: 40,000 BPMPressure sensor:yesBattery life: up to 45 daysApp: noReplacement head cost:£10.39 for twoIcy BearNext-Generation sonic toothbrush£64.99£64.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe cheapest brush to come with a pressure sensorWhat we don’t loveNo charging stand, leading to slightly awkward rechargingBest electric toothbrush for sustainability:Suri 2.0Suri2.0from£89.25£89.25 at Suri£89.25 at AmazonWhat we loveBy far the most sustainable electric toothbrush on the marketWhat we don’t loveSomewhat lacking in the power department£89.25 at Suri£89.25 at AmazonTheoriginal Suri toothbrushwas not only solid, but also the only real choice for the climate-conscious in an industry that doesn’t seem to have taken much notice of the climate emergency.Unfortunately, it had a couple of issues that held it back: it lacked a pressure sensor, and the spring-pin charging system broke no fewer than three times on me. Both of these problems have been fixed in Suri 2.0, making it an easy recommendation.Why we love itIn short, you no longer need to feel like you’re missing out by opting for a green option. The Suri 2.0’s slim design is lightweight and better suited for trips away than ever, thanks to a new travel lock and plant-based head cover.Meanwhile, its unreliable spring-pin charger has been replaced by a wireless version (both in the bundled case and stand), and its new pressure sensor vibrates three times and pauses the brush if you push too hard.All of this builds on what made the original so good: its eco-friendly credentials. The company has been working with ClimatePartner to offset 100% of its emissions (including transport and manufacturing), and it provides a postage-paid compostable bag to send the used heads back for recycling. Theseheads (three for £14.99, or cheaper on a subscription), incidentally, are cornstarch, with the bristles made of castor oil.It’s a shame that …it’s a little lacking in the power department, with its 33,000 BPM vibration frequency feeling noticeably less thorough than its rivals.Type:sonicModes:two (clean and polish)Power:33,000 BPMPressure sensor:yesBattery life:1+ monthApp:noReplacement head cost:£14.99 for threeTo find out more, read our fullSuri 2.0 toothbrush reviewSuri2.0from£89.25£89.25 at Suri£89.25 at AmazonWhat we loveBy far the most sustainable electric toothbrush on the marketWhat we don’t loveSomewhat lacking in the power departmentBest premium electric toothbrush:Philips Sonicare Smart 9400PhilipsSonicare Smart 9400from£199.99£199.99 at John Lewis£199.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe most powerful brush tested, with a clever glass chargerWhat we don’t loveHave you seen the price tag?Photograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£199.99 at John Lewis£199.99 at AmazonIf you have a toothbrush budget most people could only dream of, then the Philips Sonicare Smart 9400 is the one to go for. I also tested theDiamondClean 9900, which retails for more than twice the 9400’s current price, but I actually prefer the way this one charges.Why we love itWhen I took the Sonicare 9400 out of the box, I thought they’d packed the wrong charger. It turns out that the handy rinse glass included in the packageishow it charges. You rest the charging puck underneath it, and the toothbrush charges through the glass when not in use. What a time to be alive.With up to 62,000 motions a minute, it’s the joint most powerful sonic brush I tested (tying with the aforementioned DiamondClean 9900), and you can really feel the results after use. It has four modes – clean (with three intensities), deep clean, gum health and white – feels comfortable in the hand, and comes with a charging case if you don’t want to take the magical glass charger on the road.It also connects to a rather excellent app to track your brushing habits. Unlike with the DiamondClean 9900, where it’s the only way to cycle between modes, you don’t have to use it. But if you do, you’ll receive guidance on your brushing, showing the areas you’ve missed and giving you the option to spend a bit longer on them if needed. It can be connected with Apple Health for iPhone data nerds, and it’ll even automatically reorder brush heads for you if you want, so you’re never caught short.It’s a shame that …it misses out on the sensitive mode of the DiamondClean 9900, so those with tooth pain may want to look elsewhere.

But because they all use the same motor and brush, and thus offer similar performance, this is the one I recommend: it jettisons unnecessary extras (like a connected app and screen) in order to simply deliver the features you need for a great clean.Why we love itIt boasts three modes – daily clean, sensitive and whiten – and its round heads are small enough to get into tight areas. Most importantly, its pressure sensor won’t only tell you when you’re applying too much pressure, but also when you’re applying too little, via an easy-to-understand white/green/red lighting system in a ring at the top of the handle.While it has fewer modes than the higher-numbered iOs, it delivers the same dentist-fresh-feeling performance, while retailing for a fraction of their optimistic RRPs.It’s a shame that …at £15 for two,replacement headsare a touch on the pricey side. And, like all the Oral-B brushes I tested, it made me oddly dribbly during the brushing, so stay near the sink.Type:oscillatingModes:three (daily clean, whitening and sensitive)Power: not disclosedPressure sensor:yesBattery life: up to 18 daysApp: noReplacement head cost:£15 for twoOral-BiO3from£65£75 at Boots£65 at AmazonWhat we loveWell-priced brush with the best pressure sensor I triedWhat we don’t lovePricey head replacements (even when discounted)The best of the restForeo Issa 3ForeoIssa 3from£88.95£89 at Foreo£88.95 at AmazonWhat we loveBattery life that simply can’t be beatenWhat we don’t loveDidn’t feel as effective as regular electric toothbrushesPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£89 at Foreo£88.95 at AmazonBest for:sensitive teethIt may look like something more at home on the shelves of Ann Summers, but the Foreo Issa 3 is doing something a bit different, which makes it ideal for those with extra sensitive gnashers, or those loth to give up their manual toothbrush.The medical-grade silicone and PBT polymer bristles are designed for scrubbing away at your teeth like a traditional manual toothbrush as hard as you like, rather than purely relying on the sometimes overpowering buzz of the motor. The sonic vibrations are still present here – with 16 intensities – but they’re significantly more gentle than the other models, as they’re designed to be supplemented by traditional brushing motions.Foreo reckons that said bristles are up to 10,000 times more hygienic than their nylon counterparts, which means the head needs replacing only every six months. The company also says the brush will go for an entire year on a single charge. Naturally, it’s been impossible to emulate that much use during the testing period, but it’s certainly shown no signs of slowing down, and given a charge takes only two hours, it won’t be a big hardship if it falls a little short.It didn’t make the final cut because …for me, it simply didn’t remove plaque as effectively in two minutes as its more traditional rivals, even with the added push of manual scrubbing.Type:sonic hybrid;modes:one (with 16 intensity levels);power: 11,000 BPM;pressure sensor:no;battery life: up to 365 days;app: no;replacement head cost:£24.99 for oneForeoIssa 3from£88.95£89 at Foreo£88.95 at AmazonWhat we loveBattery life that simply can’t be beatenWhat we don’t loveDidn’t feel as effective as regular electric toothbrushesCoulax C8CoulaxC8£12.99£12.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIncredible price, with seven replacement heads includedWhat we don’t loveSome user reviews question its reliability£12.99 at AmazonBest for:if money is tightI thought the cheap and cheerful£18 Superdrug ProCare modelwould be the most affordable model on test, but this bestseller from Amazon comes with a surprising number of features.For less than £15, you get a toothbrush with five settings, up to 40,000 BPM and eight(!) brush heads in the box. While my mouth didn’t feel as fresh as with more expensive models, bluntly, it didn’t feel like a quarter of the performance for a quarter of the price.It didn’t make the final cut because …while I had no issues with my test unit, Amazon’s AI analysis of its customer reviews found that “some customers report that it turns on randomly, doesn’t charge, and doesn’t retain any charge”.

What’s the catch? There are some, as I’ll get on to in a moment, but this is an utter bargain of a toothbrush for the most part. It hits a decent 36,000 BPM, and the USB-C chargeable battery will go for six weeks.Ordo fully embraces the chunky charm of its plastic design, and it comes in a range of bright colours that make a change from the austere black and white you get elsewhere. Best of all, it uses the same heads as other Ordo brushes, meaningthe company will recycle them free of charge.That said, you can’t make an electric toothbrush this cheap without a few compromises, and they’re pretty obvious here. It’s a basic, no-frills package with no case and a single head in the box, and you can forget about a pressure sensor or multiple modes (though it does have a built-in timer to tell you when to move to the next section).There are also some questionable design decisions, such as the rounded base that makes it impossible to stand upright, and the high-pitched noise it makes in use, which my partner found immensely irritating during testing. On top of that, Ordo’s heads have a silicone bit in the middle of the bristles for polishing: it divides opinion, but you can put me firmly on Team No Thank You.It didn’t make the final cut because …it can feel a little too no-frills at times.Type:sonic;modes:one;power:36,000 BPM;pressure sensor:no;battery life:up to six weeks;app:no;replacement head cost:£5 eachOrdoSonic Edgefrom£10£10 at Argos£15.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIncredible price, recyclable heads and colourful optionsWhat we don’t loveExtremely basic, and it won’t stand up with that rounded baseOral-B iO9Oral-BiO9from£220£220 at Ao£250 at Oral-BWhat we loveThe most fully featured toothbrush you can buyWhat we don’t loveIt’s the definition of pricey overkillPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£220 at Ao£250 at Oral-BBest for:if money is no objectWith a crazy £500 RRP, you may wonder what kind of black magic the Oral-B iO9 offers your daily brush. The answer is lots, but not enough to justify its price, hence the inclusion here.It comes with a whopping seven cleaning modes (daily clean, sensitive, gum care, intense, whiten, super sensitive and tongue clean), a colour screen to cycle through them, and built-in 3D teeth tracking that can detect 16 mouth zones to indicate how your technique is in the connected app. It charges quickly too – just three hours via the magnetic charging stand or the bundled snazzy charging case and proprietary cable with a plug.There is a middle ground between this and the recommended iO3 above, with theOral-B iO6offering a black-and-white screen and a connected app, albeit with slower charging, a non-charging case, weaker position tracking and fewer modes. If an app is important to you, but your money-to-sense ratio is still intact,that’s probably the one to go for.It didn’t make the final cut because …at RRP, it costs half a grand!

As such, plenty of people may find that manufacturers inadvertently (or, cynically, advertently) oversell their stamina.Still, if battery life is the be-all and end-all for you, you should give the Silk’n SonicYou a look. The manufacturer suggests you’ll get up to 300 days’ use with it, if you use the sensitive (30,000 strokes a minute) setting twice a day for a total of four minutes. That’s not as good as the Foreo, and it’d obviously go down faster if you brush more often, for longer, or use the 37,000-stroke-a-minute whitening mode, but given most of the toothbrushes I was testing were rated in the 14- to 90-day area, it’s still a stamina champion. It certainly didn’t need charging while I was using it.Infrequent charging can be a curse if you’re dealing with a bespoke charger that you can’t find when the time comes, but thankfully you just need to pop open the base and connect a common-or-garden USB-C cable to top it up.It didn’t make the final cut because …battery life is often directly linked to the power of the brush, and while 37,000 BPM is nothing to be sneezed at, you can get more power if you’re prepared to charge more often.Type:sonic;modes:three (sensitive, clean and white);power: 37,000 BPM;Pressure sensor:no;battery life: up to 300 days;app: no;replacement head cost:£12 for twoSilk’nSonicYoufrom£67.99£89 at Boots£67.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIncredible battery life for a sonic electric toothbrushWhat we don’t loveMore powerful options are availableWhites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrushWhites BeaconsfieldSonic LED toothbrushfrom£39.99£39.99 at Superdrug£39.99 at AmazonWhat we loveOffers whitening with your regular brushWhat we don’t loveThe whitening blue light hits battery life hard£39.99 at Superdrug£39.99 at AmazonBest for:whiteningWhile many toothbrushes (including this one) have a built-in whitening setting that adds time or alternates speeds to remove surface stains, the Whites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrush – with its terrifying picture of a toothy strawberry on the box – goes the extra mile by including blue light whitening technology.

Without them, “it’s harder to get the same result”, says Caitlin Miller, head of hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care UK. “To get the same level of cleaning found with an electric toothbrush, you’d have to spend a lot longer than two minutes brushing with a manual.”The reasons are threefold, she explains: manual dexterity; that people are more likely to use their expensive electric device properly; and sheer power.“You don’t have to really do anything with it, and it does a better job,” Miller says. “That’s not to say that they suit everybody. There are people who can do a perfectly good job with a manual toothbrush, but for most of my patients, I will see improvements when people go on to an electric toothbrush.”How do you use an electric toothbrush?“You want to hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle – half on the gum, half on the tooth. You should just be holding it horizontally, sweeping across the tooth and gum margins,” says Miller, adding that you should move slowly, allocating a couple of seconds for each tooth.“You don’t move it up and down, you don’t need to move it round and round. That’s the beauty of the electric toothbrush: you can be pretty lazy with it and it still does a good job.”But a common mistake is to press too hard, which is why some of the brushes in our guide come with pressure sensors – something actively recommended by Miller. “If you’ve got too much pressure, you’re essentially dampening the vibrations and bristles.”How often do you need to charge an electric toothbrush?This varies hugely between toothbrushes, and depends on how often you brush and the settings you use. The only certainty is that you need to charge them more often than a manual toothbrush – which is to say “at all”.According to Miller, plenty of patients fall back on inferior manual brushing because of this. “The number of people who say, ‘Oh, I do have an electric toothbrush, but I always forget to charge it, and then it takes three days, so I just use my manual toothbrush,’” she laments. “Keeping it charged is quite important.”The good news is that batteries now tend to be lithium-ion, meaning they charge quickly, and they last a decent amount of time, too.The ones I tested had manufacturer-quoted battery lives of between 14 and 365 days, which is an enormous gulf. Plenty of factors play into this, including power, connectivity and the size of the battery itself, but it’s also worth bearing in mind how this is measured. Generally, a manufacturer counts a day as four minutes of brushing over two sessions, but it might be more or less, so read the small print.You may instinctively be drawn to brushes with longer battery ratings, but convenience is also a factor. A proprietary charger might be more of a faff than a USB-C one, or a charging dock that sits neatly on the sink, especially if months go between charges and you forget where your cable lives.You may also want to charge more often than required. Anecdotally, I can easily feel the difference in strength between a toothbrush approaching the end of its battery and the same model fresh off the charger.How often do you need to replace your toothbrush head?As for replacing the heads, Miller suggests you do this every three months – or earlier if it looks splayed or frayed – because its cleaning performance will suffer. “You can see it under a microscope: it gets really worn on top.”Beyond an electric toothbrush, Miller stresses the importance of cleaning between the teeth, and she has a clear order of preference: interdental brushes, then floss and finallywater flossers.“If I’ve got patients who won’t use anything often, if I can get them on a water flosser, then that’s better than nothing,” she says.The different types of electric toothbrush: oscillating vs sonic toothbrushesThere are two main types of toothbrushes on the market: oscillating and sonic – with the latter seemingly dominating at the moment. “They work differently, but they’re both doing a similar sort of thing,” says Miller.In short, an oscillating toothbrush moves the bristles back and forth in a circular motion, while sonic brushes use vibrations to move the bristles in two directions to loosen plaque. The latter is measured in brush strokes per minute (BPM) and my selection was rated between 11,000 and 62,000 BPM. Miller says some of her clients find the sonic brushes a bit “ticklish” at first, but this is something you can get used to over time.Which is better? Asystematic review and meta-analysis of 38 comparison studiespublished in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene found a “small but clinically relevant advantage” for oscillating brushes. But it added that it’s “unlikely that dental care professionals in routine examination would be able to detect [the] small differences” between the two, meaning that personal preference should ultimately rule supreme.What should I do with my old electric toothbrush?The first question to ask is whether your electric toothbrush still works. If it does, you might consider passing it on to a friend or family member who’s still using a manual toothbrush. It’s far better for a still-functional brush to find a new owner than to end up in landfill, and it prevents a new model from being demanded: two easy wins for the planet.Don’t include used heads, obviously, but I’ve found these can enjoy a second life scrubbing between tiles or cleaning grubby cat chins (a nightmare retirement for the heads, but maybe no worse than rubbing against sticky teeth and gums).Still, while you cantake steps to make your toothbrush last longer, eventually it will need replacing. It’s important not to put broken electric toothbrushes in regular household waste, asbatteries are an environmental hazard. Instead, look for an e-waste bin if your council has one, or consider recycling points in shops such asBootsandCurrys.

Infused oil has countless uses – drizzle it over carpaccio, pasta or salad, use it to marinate meat, fish and vegetables, or simply as a dip for chunks of sourdough – and some of my favourites include lemon rind, garlic skin and rosemary; star anise, cacao and orange rind; and makrut lime leaf, lemongrass husk and coriander stems, which I found especially delicious drizzled over some noodles and pak choi. Freshly infused oils of this sort aren’t suitable for long storage, however, so use them up within a day to two.Kitchen scrap-infused olive oilAs I look around my kitchen, I’ve got a two-year-old jar of remarkably tasty chillies gathering dust, a bowl of clementines (I think of citrus rinds as harbingers of incredible flavour, rich in essential oils and highly aromatic terpenes) and a small jar of long pepper, a pungent, complex spice that’s been sitting on my kitchen shelf for years without a purpose. When put together, however, and left to bubble gently on the hob, they fill my kitchen with a wildly aromatic and exotic aroma.Like many of my recipes, this one is simply a starting point to provide a bump of inspiration for you to get inventive and creative in the kitchen. Dig around in your cupboards and see what flavours are hiding in there just waiting to be revealed.Makes250mlAssorted kitchen scraps– skins and offcuts from garlic, onion skins, chilli seeds, the outer leaves of leeks, celery leaves, spring onion tops, unwaxed organic orange and lemon peel, a sprig of thyme or rosemary1-2 tsp whole spices(eg, star anise, cloves, cardamom; optional)250ml extra-virgin olive oilPut a saucepan on a very low heat and add the kitchen scraps you’d like to infuse, ideally choosing a simple combination of two, three or four flavours that work well together, as well as the optional whole spices.Pour over the extra-virgin olive oil and leave to heat up just until it begins to bubble gently. Keep the oil warm on the heat for about 15 minutes, to infuse without frying the solids, then take the pan off the heat and leave to cool. Decant into a clean bottle or jar (sieve the oil first, if you like) then seal and use immediately or refrigerate for up to two days (it will solidify slightly but will return to liquid at room temperature); alternatively, freeze for up to three months. Don’t be tempted to keep it longer, however, because it can become unsafe.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteSauces and graviesSaladfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I love the romance and cosiness of creamy European soups drunk straight out of a mug around a fire in November, but in the icy tundra that is January I need something with more heat and intensity, something sustaining, spicy, gutsy and textured, so that I need a fork or chopsticks to eat it, rather than just a spoon. These punchy soups are simply rapture in a bowl, and make for extremely satisfying slurping.Khao swe (pictured top)Khao sweis a Burmese noodle soup with hot coconut broth, springy noodles and a madness of garnishes, from boiled eggs to peanuts or crisp shallots.

Stir in the stock and coconut milk, bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. Add the chicken and simmer over a low heat until it’s cooked through and tender.Stir in the fish sauce, lime juice and sugar, taste and add more lime, sugar or fish sauce if needed. Divide the noodles between four bowls, ladle the khao swe over the top and serve with your chosen garnishes.Sweet-and-sour peanut dal with pappardelleView image in fullscreenGujaratidal dhoklais one of my ultimate comfort foods, and this dish takes inspiration from that, except the dhokla (or pasta) part, which is normally made from scratch but which I’ve swapped here for pappardelle.Prep20 minCook1 hrServes4200g toor dal(AKA split pigeon peas), washed very well1 long red chilli, cut into thick rings (pith and seeds discarded if you prefer less heat)1tsp turmeric40g raw peanutsFor the tempering2tbsp coconut oil1 heapedtsp mustard seeds1 pinch asafoetida15–20 fresh curry leaves1tsp cumin seeds1 cinnamon stick, broken up2 cloves1tbsp grated ginger3garlic cloves, peeled and blitzed2 green chillies, finely blitzed (pith and seeds discarded if you prefer less heat)1 heapedtsp tomato puree2 ripe tomatoes, pureed1tbsp tamarind paste2tbsp grated jaggery, or soft brown sugarSea saltJuice of1 limeTo garnish250g fresh pappardelle, cooked according to packet instructions1 handfulfinely chopped coriander1 small red onion, peeled and finely choppedPut the toor dal, chilli, turmeric, peanuts and a litre and a half of water in a large saucepan, bring to a boil, then simmer over a low heat for 40-45 minutes, until soft and mushy.In a second pan, heat the coconut oil, then add the mustard seeds and, as soon as they pop, stir in the asafoetida and curry leaves.

Roll the mix into walnut-sized balls (you should end up with about 25 in total), then gently drop them into the soup and simmer for about four minutes, until cooked through. Add the halved dumpling wrappers to the pot, cook for a further 30 seconds, or until al dente, then ladle into bowls and serve with your favourite chilli oil.Explore more on these topicsWinter food and drinkSoupFoodNoodlesPastaVegetablesBeans, pulses and legumesrecipesShareReuse this content"

This doesn’t all come out of your pay, as your employer will stump up a chunk of that and your contribution will be boosted by tax relief.While your employer must automatically put you into the scheme, you can opt out, and this may be tempting if you are on a low wage. However, that means turning down free money from your employer and through tax relief. It also means missing out on the growth of that money.“The earlier you start, the better,” says Mark Smith, a spokesperson for Pension Attention, an industry-led campaign. If you opt out, you’ll be automatically enrolled again three years later, but Smith says that is a long time to be missing out on potential stock market growth. “Set a reminder for a year’s time to see if you can manage it then,” he says. “Better still, say no to opting out to begin with – see if you can manage financially with that contribution. If you really are struggling, you can think again.”Balance money prioritiesEarly in your career you may have priorities that come ahead of planning for retirement. If you want to save up to buy a home, for example, there are difficult decisions to make. Research by pension provider L&G found one in seven recent and prospective homeowners have paused, reduced or never paid into a pension, to prioritise buying a property.“For many younger people, rising living costs and the pressure to build a deposit mean tough trade-offs, including cutting back on pension saving,” says Katharine Photiou, the director of workplace savings at L&G Retail. “While understandable, these decisions can have a lasting negative impact on retirement outcomes.”View image in fullscreenNeglecting your pension while saving the deposit for your first home is understandable. However, they may have a negative impact.Photograph: Jack Sullivan/AlamyIf you are saving for a deposit, a lifetime individual savings account (Lisa) could be useful. Lisas let you put away up to £4,000 a year that you can use later for either a property purchase or to help fund your retirement.You must be under 40 to open one and until you turn 50 the government will pay a 25% top-up bonus on your balance each year. There is no tax relief on money paid in, but all the money taken out is tax-free. While you can access the funds before you retire, you will be charged 25% of the Lisa’s value if you withdraw the money before you turn 60 for any reason other than to buy a home.Pay more when you canIf a new job brings a pay rise, consider increasing your pension contributions before you get used to having the extra money in your pocket. “Check your employer’s policy. If you put in another 1%, they might match it – it’s a tax efficient way for them to pay you more,” says Smith. “Because of the way tax relief and compounding work, that 1% costs you significantly less than 1% of your take-home pay but could add thousands to your final pot.”Hargreaves Lansdown’s pension calculator shows that a 22-year-old earning £25,000 a year contributing at the auto-enrolment minimum, 5% from the employee, 3% from the employer, could expect to have £155,000 saved by the time they were 68. By adding a percentage point, so they pay 6% and their employer pays 4%, they would increase their fund to £194,000.Plan around parental leave“It’s important to keep contributing to your pension if you can afford to on maternity leave,” says Helen Morrissey, the head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown. “The amount that you [as the employee] will contribute is based on your wages, so may well come down in line with your maternity pay, but your employer will continue to contribute based on your pay before maternity leave for the first 39 weeks – some may pay for longer. If you are in a salary sacrifice scheme, then your total contribution remains unchanged, as it is classed as an employer contribution.”View image in fullscreenDon’t neglect contributions to your state pension, including any benefits during periods of not working.Photograph: David Burton/AlamyIf you don’t qualify for maternity pay, your employer must contribute to your pension for the first 26 weeks, the period known as ordinary maternity leave; beyond that point, it depends on your contract.Monitor if unemployedIf you are out of work, your contributions to a workplace scheme will stop, but your pension will remain invested. It’s wise to pay attention to your state pension, though.“Make sure you claim everything you are entitled to when out of work. Many benefits – such as jobseeker’s allowance – come with an automatic national insurance credit that goes towards building up the qualifying years you need for your state pension,” says Morrissey. Check your eligibility for NI credits if you stop work because of caring commitments or are on long-term sick leave, too.Then, Photiou says: “When you’re earning again, restarting contributions quickly can help you stay on track.”Do it yourselfOne of the most straightforward solutions for people who are self-employed, whether temporarily or long-term, is a stakeholder pension, a retirement plan with capped annual charges and a minimum monthly contribution of £20.While £20 a month is better than nothing, it is not enough to build up a substantial retirement fund. Paying £20 a month into a stakeholder pension from the age of 22 to the age of 68 could build you about £28,000, according to pension provider Nest’s calculator. Paying in £100 a month over that time would mean a pot of £139,000.The money will be locked in until retirement – if you want to retain access to your money before that, a lifetime Isa might be suitable here, too.Keep track of potsThe list of your former employers could reach double figures by the time you retire, potentially leaving a trail of just as many pension pots.View image in fullscreenAt the end of your career you may have worked for many different firms, with just as many pension pots still attached. Track them down.Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/Alamy“When you change jobs, you can either leave your pension where it is, transfer it to your employer’s scheme or into a personal pension,” says Morrissey. “You may choose to consolidate your pensions to make it easier to keep track of them, but before you do, make sure that you aren’t potentially incurring any expensive exit fees or losing valuable benefits such as guaranteed annuity rates.”If you have a defined benefit (or final salary) pension, where your payments are based on what you earned and guaranteed, it rarely makes sense to move it, she says.The government’s MoneyHelper website has general guidance on transferring and consolidating pensions, but for personalised guidance it’s worth paying for independent financial advice – you can find an adviser on the Unbiased website.If you have lost track of pension pots you have paid into in the past, use the government’sPension Tracing Service to find them. You will need to give them the name of the company or pension provider.Stay investedFrom the age of 55 (57 after April 2028), you can withdraw up to 25% of your pension tax-free. But, Smith says: “Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. There are significant tax implications to bear in mind.”Meanwhile, once you start drawing from your pension, as opposed to just taking this tax-free lump sum, the amount you can contribute to pensions is reduced to £10,000 a tax year under the money purchase annual allowance, instead of the standard allowance of £60,000 a year.You will also miss out on any future growth for the sum you withdraw. It is always advisable to take professional advice before drawing your pension: although this can be expensive, it often pays for itself in avoiding mistakes. Free guidance is available for over-50s through the government-backed and impartial Pension Wise service.This article was amended on 28 January 2026 to make clear that simply taking up to 25% out of your pension as a tax-free lump sum does not reduce the amount you can pay in to £10,000 a year, as an earlier version had indicated.Explore more on these topicsMoneyMoney hacksConsumer affairsPensionsPensions industryRetirement planningSaving moneyFamily financesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And visitors are being asked to help …Oliver BalchWed 28 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 04.32 ESTShareOur induction into tree-planting comes from Pietro, an Italian hydromorphologist charged with overseeing our group of 20 or so volunteers for the week. We’re standing in a makeshift nursery full of spindly willow and poplar saplings just above theVjosa River, a graceful, meandering waterway that cuts east to west across southern Albania from its source 169 miles away upstream in Greece.Expertly extricating an infant willow from the clay-rich soil, Pietro holds up the plant for us all to see. Its earthy tendrils look oddly exposed and vulnerable. “The trick is not to accidentally snick the stem or break the roots,” he says. Message registered, we take up our hoes and head off in pairs to follow his instructions.Map of Vjosa River, AlbaniaThe volunteering week is the brainchild of EcoAlbania and the Austria-basedRiverwatch. Back in 2023, these two conservation charities succeeded in persuading the Albanian government to designate the River Vjosa as Europe’s first “wild river national park”. It was a timely intervention. According tonew researchco-funded by Riverwatch, Albania has lost 711 miles (1,144km) of “nearly natural” river stretches since 2018 – more, proportionally, than any country in the Balkans. Now, the question facing both organisations is: what next?On our first evening, Riverwatch’s chief executive, Ulrich (“Uli”) Eichelmann, gives a presentation setting out his answer. But before he does, we have a dinner of lamb and homegrown vegetables to work through. The traditional spread is a speciality of theLord Byron guesthousein Tepelenë, a small town in the heart of the Vjosa valley and home to EcoAlbania’s field office – our base for the week.View image in fullscreenItalian hydromorphologist Pietro, left, with volunteers wading across a shallow stretch of river.Photograph: Joshua LimToday, Tepelenë houses a slightly dilapidated castle and little else, but two centuries ago it formed the political centre ofAli Pasha, a local potentate in the early 19th century. Under the then Ottoman empire, Pasha administered a large swathe of what is modern-day southern Albania and mainland Greece – hence, the visit (in 1809) of the guesthouse’s eponymous namesake.Uli makes for a fitting heir to the famously belligerent Ali Pasha. Armed with slides and statistics, he offers a hard-hitting overview of the threats facing Europe’s embattled river network. His opprobrium is particularly reserved for the thousands of dams now stymying the continent’s once free-flowing rivers, which he blames for causing irreversible damage to fish stocks and freshwater ecosystems.Tourism is like fire,’ says the director of EcoAlbania. ‘You can prepare your soup with it, but it can also burn your house down’As one of the last wild rivers in the Balkans, the Vjosa in Albania has been spared a similar fate, he asserts. But that’s not the end of it. “Although the river looks beautiful,” he says, “there are critical things missing.” High on his list are trees, a large proportion of which have been lost to fires, logging, road building and aggressive grazing. The result: high levels of erosion and, as a consequence, greater risk of flooding.Buoyed up by Uli’s presentation, we approach our replanting the next day with redoubled efforts. Our number includes a London-based book illustrator inspired byDavid Attenborough’s Oceandocumentary, a US geospatial analyst with the noble hope of creating an “Albania where Albanians might want to stay” (a reference to the country’s1.2 millionemigres now overseas), and an Italian university student interested in eco-tourism, to name a few.View image in fullscreenVolunteers have been focusing on planting trees as part of the plan for reversing years of damage to the river and its surroundings.Photograph: Joshua LimOver lunch on the second day, I get chatting to Aida, a tour guide from Tirana who wants to better acquaint herself with the Vjosa region. Visitors rarely come to this part of Albania, she says. “Perhaps they might pay a quick visit to Gjirokastër,” referring to a historic honeypot town on the neighbouring Drino River, “but, otherwise, they drive straight through.”Looking out over the river, with its braided islets and rugged mountain backdrop, we both agree that such oversight is a shame. The region has a rich cultural and religious history (Albania became officially atheist in 1967), an interesting gastronomic tradition (“perhaps not that sophisticated, but somehow tasty”), and a genuine surfeit of natural attractions, she tells me.A large proportion of trees have been lost to fires, logging, road building and aggressive grazing. The result: a greater risk of floodingThat night, it starts raining. Proper rain. Torrents of water pour down from angry, thunderous skies. The next morning, word comes from Pietro that the planting zone is now several feet underwater. With our planting temporarily suspended, I join some of the volunteers on an impromptu sightseeing expedition. Equipped with a list from Aida, we head upstream, stopping first at the slow-food town of Përmet (“Except for the Sea,” the town’s cocksure slogan reads, “We have Everything”). Next up is the delightful Orthodox church of St Mary, a gem of a place hidden up in the hills, where the local shepherd doubles as the doorkeeper. Last, we go for a hike up the Langarica canyon, which, despite the dreadful weather, we achieve without troubling the widely advertised emergency services (“ambulance”, “police”, “fireworks”).The next day, it’s still raining hard. Briefly, I consider going rafting or kayaking, two popular options on the Vjosa, but the river has now grown into a swollen torrent. Instead, I take a soggy hike up the nearby Peshtura gorge to see a noted waterfall, which, drunk on so much rainfall, is positively bursting from the hillside. In the afternoon, I decide to see if Gjirokastër is all it’s cracked up to be. A visit to its illuminating ethnographic museum and imperious clifftop castle persuade me it very much is.View image in fullscreenOliver Balch hiked up the Peshtura gorge to see a waterfall.Photograph: Joshua LimLater that night, I share my joys at discovering what the Vjosa region has to offer with Olsi Nika, executive director of EcoAlbania. Happy as he is at my enthusiasm, I can see he’s also concerned. He is not against tourism, he wants me to know, but, as a conservationist (he recently won the prestigiousGoldman Environmental prize), the prospects for the park worry him. Albania’s coastline is already busy with package holidaymakers and anairport is being builtin the river’s delta despite it being a designated protected area. And so, while he is happy that a spanglynew visitor centre is being builtin Tepelenë, he is anxious to see the government fulfil its ownmanagement planfor the park – something it has so far been slow to do. “Tourism is like fire,” he says. “You can prepare your soup with it, but it can also burn your house down.”Olsi’s words are still ringing in my ears the next day as I drive back towards Tirana. I stop just to the north of the river’s mouth at the archaeological site of Apollonia, an ancient Greek trading community later colonised by the Romans. The hilltop spot is entirely devoid of other tourists, allowing me a magical couple of hours to wander alone among the extraordinary ruins.If Herodotus is to be believed, Apollonia used to sit on the Adriatic coast, but centuries of silt from the Vjosa have seen it retreat miles inland. Over the same time, the river’s route has also altered. But nothing stays still, especially hydrology. Change is once more coming to the Vjosa. What it will bring remains uncertain, but, as a national park, she will hopefully continue to flow, untamed and unbroken.The trip was funded byPatagonia, which supportsEcoAlbania. EcoAlbania will arrange hotel, food and transport from Tirana to Tepelenëforabout £700 for the week. Volunteers need to arrange their own transport to Tirana.

Eve Henderson describes losing her husband, and her fight to help othersAnna MooreWed 28 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 21.27 ESTShareOn a Sunday in October 1997, Eve Henderson looked down at her husband, Roderick, as he lay in a hospital bed, unable to make sense of what she saw. She was, she says, “a block of stone”. They were in the neurological ward of a huge hospital on the outskirts of Paris. It had taken Henderson an hour to find, travelling on the Métro with the name scribbled on a scrap of paper. Roderick looked comfortable when she arrived; he was a good colour, but there was a round red mark in the centre of his forehead and a small tube inside his mouth, attached to something she later learned was breathing for him.“He looked fairly alive,” says Henderson, “and I just stood there. A doctor came in. She was in tears and I thought: ‘Bloody hell, am I meant to be crying?’ You’ve got no emotion, you’ve got nothing. You don’t know what to say or where you are. That’s what shock does to you.”Less than 24 hours earlier, on the Saturday night, Henderson, her husband, their two adult children and their partners had been toasting Roderick’s 54th birthday on the Seine. “We’d been dressed up, suited and booted, on aBateau Mouche[sightseeing boat].” All six had arrived in Paris for his birthday weekend the day before, travelling by Eurostar, sharing champagne and bacon rolls on the way.“When this happened, Roderick and I had been married for 32 years. We’d seen all the ups and downs,” says Henderson. “We were broke when we started – you have the kids, things get easier.” They lived in Swanley, Kent. Henderson worked part-time for Asda as, she says, “a glorified secretary”. Roderick was a tool-maker, an engineer. “That was part of the reason behind the weekend,” she says. “Eurostar was fairly new and he wanted to see the tunnel.”View image in fullscreen‘We’d been married for 32 years. We’d seen all the ups and downs’ ... Henderson with her husband, Roderick.Photograph: Courtesy of Eve HendersonWhen they had disembarked the boat that Saturday evening, the group had separated. The three men – Roderick, their son, Scott, and their daughter’s husband, Andrew – went on for a last drink. The three women returned to the hotel. Henderson was fast asleep when Scott woke her hours later, telling her that they had been attacked. The men had been to a bar on the Champs-Élysées, then left, walking no more than 30 yards before a gang of youths on inline skates came from nowhere. “There was no interaction and it was over in minutes,” says Henderson. Scott and Andrew were kicked at the knees and went straight down. Her husband was punched in the throat – the autopsy confirmed that it broke his larynx – then kicked in the centre of his head as he fell.To this day, there is no explanation and no one has ever been charged. (It was months before police appealed for witnesses or even brought in the murder squad.) It’s believed that this was a street gang, who had intended to rob them but were scared off by the crack of the kick to Roderick’s forehead – it’s possible they had not meant to hurt him seriously.A crowd gathered and all three men were taken to hospital by ambulance. Scott and Andrew were quickly discharged and they returned to the hotel in shock, with no idea what the hospital was called, or where it was, or that Roderick was now fighting for his life with a bleed on the brain. While their hotel concierge phoned around trying to locate him, Henderson watched the street from the balcony, expecting her husband to appear any minute.Now, 28 years later, Henderson will tell you that there could be few things worse than the murder of a loved one – but a murder abroad is one of them. The shock, the grief, the loss are the same, but instead of support, there’s a gaping void. “You’re a world apart,” she says, “a stranger in a strange city, floundering in the dark. You’re speaking a different language, dealing with a different legal system, different policing, different everything. You just feel so hopeless and alone. That’s the overwhelming feeling.”View image in fullscreenHenderson appeals for information in 1999 at the spot where her husband was attacked in Paris.Photograph: Paul CooperAlthough the days that followed are now, thankfully, a faded blur, there are some moments Henderson will never forget. The family were meant to be going home that same Sunday, so their hotel rooms were no longer available. “We had no cash left and we didn’t have credit cards then – lots of people didn’t.” She remembers queueing at the British consulate, along with everyone else waiting for visas, finally speaking through the glass to the receptionist, explaining that her husband was on life support, asking for practical help and getting none. She remembers eventually finding another hotel, sharing a bed that night with her daughter, wide awake, completely unable to reach over and cuddle her.After a few days, doctors explained that they would be removing Roderick’s life support. “I’ve watched these scenes in documentaries, and the families are involved in the decisions, there’s a nurse supporting them, someone putting their arms around you,” she says. “It was nothing like that. No one came near us. We were given no say or control over when it would happen – we were just told to say goodbye.”In the midst of all this, on the instruction of the British consulate, Henderson had to find her way to a police station and request an “incident number”. The first police officer insisted that it was a civil matter, that her husband was “a heavy man”, that he “fell and hit his head”. She was told she needed to find a lawyer and an undertaker. “I sat there in the police station, in tears,” she says. “You don’t even know your own phone number, and now you need to repatriate a body?”Her boss at Asda stepped in, engaged a French law firm and paid for Roderick’s repatriation. His unwashed clothes from that night arrived home in a hospital bag, cargo-class. Someone from the British consulate collected Roderick’s jewellery – a watch, an engagement ring and a wedding ring – but the Foreign Office refused to return them until Henderson had been granted probate.“All of this, this lack of empathy, did me damage,” she says. “The trauma of not being helped left a mark. I remember back home, looking at my grandchildren, thinking: ‘I can’t even pick you up.’ I had nothing to give. I was going to bed, thinking: ‘I want to wake up in five years’ time when this will all be in the past.’”Fighting for a proper investigation was the first step forward. She made appeals in French papers; she returned to Paris with a TV news crew and stood on the spot where the attack took place, handing out leaflets appealing for information. Henderson remembers writing to the father ofCaroline Dickinson, the British schoolgirl murdered in a French youth hostel in 1996. (Her killer remained at large until 2001, with her family fighting tirelessly for a proper investigation.) “He called me and said: ‘If you start this, you need to know you’re on your own – there’s no support out there,’” says Henderson. “He put me in touch with Roger Parrish, whose daughter Joanna was murdered in 1990 by a French serial killer. So many horrors. Roger educated me about the inquest system and the justice system. It was such a steep learning curve.” (In fact, ittook more than 30 years for the Parrishfamily to win any kind of justice.)View image in fullscreen‘Even now, you reach out to the other side of the bed and he’s not there.’Photograph: Courtesy of Eve HendersonWhen Henderson contacted the UK charity Support After Murder and Manslaughter (Samm), she was told that they didn’t take cases from abroad, but they introduced her to another family that had approached them. Shirine Harburn, 30, had been travelling in south-western China when she was found stabbed and murdered on a mountain. “Her sisters and her boyfriend were fighting for justice. They were young and articulate,” says Henderson. “They got their MP involved. The Chinese sent her body back still clothed andour police analysed it for DNA, then actually went out there. They got the two men who did it. Seeing all this, meeting these families, was so important for me. I was able to sit back and learn so much.”The more she learned, the more she wanted to change. In 2001, Henderson helped set up Samm Abroad, which later becameMurdered Abroad (MA), a charity and peer support and action group. “It gave me a purpose, a cause,” she says.It also made her an unpaid expert on the complexities of homicides abroad. Approximately 4,000 British nationals die overseas each year. This includes about 80 official homicides – more than one a week – but there will also be many more “suspicious” deaths. “These are deaths where families might be told, ‘He drove into a telegraph pole,’ or ‘She fell off a balcony,’ or ‘It was suicide,’” says Henderson. “The Foreign Office don’t challenge any of it. We work on the basis that if families believe it’s a homicide, we’ll welcome them.” Most cases take much longer to resolve than cases here. Five years isn’t unusual; many stretch on for decades.The guidance MA gives to families could cover anything. “It could be repatriation, or how to engage a lawyer in a foreign country, or what to do about the inquest,” says Henderson. “Every country has a different judicial process and we know a bit about many of them.” The financial cost can also be ruinous for families – paying lawyers, attending trials, paying for translations of documents, the time off work. “We’re not covered by theVictims’ Code,” says Henderson. “There’s no criminal injuries compensation unless there’s a scheme in the country where it happened, and even then you’d need to pay a lawyer to claim it.” One 2011 survey of MA families found that their ordeals had cost them an average of £59,000. “One father whose son was murdered in Greece got the sack because of all the time he was spending on the case,” says Henderson. “We helped him write a letter to his mortgage provider and they gave him a mortgage holiday.”View image in fullscreen‘The trauma of not being helped left a mark.’Photograph: Ryan Prince/The GuardianAll this has helped channel her own grief. “It keeps me going,” she says. “I can go out there and help all these other people in practical ways, but sometimes you do ask yourself: what can I do for my own kids? It’s almost like you can’t help your own. They lost their dad. I can’t bring him back.”Counselling has also helped her. “When I started, I cried solidly every time I went,” she says. “My counsellor was brilliant, a life-saver. It became somewhere I could offload and she helped me set small positive goals. I carried on going from time to time for 20-odd years.”Henderson tries not to picture the life she and Roderick might still be living. “You don’t go there – you have to try not to be bitter,” she says. “Your world changes, it collapses, but you don’t want to roll over.” After the murder, Henderson rented out the family house and moved in with her sister and 90-year-old mother, who have both since died. She now lives alone in Bexley, south-east London.My ex shot me 10 times – and after the coma, I became an undercover copRead more“Even now, you get odd moments. There’s something about sleep that takes away your memories, so you might wake up, reach out to the other side of the bed and he’s not there,” she says. “He loved our grandsons – he was a lovely grandfather. He’d take them to the shed where his tools were and do all the ‘boy things’. For years afterwards, I’d think about what he was missing – then, at some point, I had to have a rethink. He doesn’t know about any of this; it’s me that’s having to live without him. We have the life sentence.“We have guest speakers at our MA events and one was a clinical psychologist and trauma specialist,David Trickey. He said that when something like this happens, it’s like you have a big black hole blasted into your life. That hole never goes away – it doesn’t get any smaller – but over time, years pass, and your life around it gets bigger. I understood that. One grandson married on a beach in January. I’ve got two great-grandchildren now: Baby Violet, who came along two weeks ago, and Daisie.“You have to pick out the good bits or you’d go under,” she says. “I’m still here, I’ve got my marbles and I’m still passionate about MA. I can’t bear to think that other people are still suffering the same way I did. So I’ll fight on.”Explore more on these topicsSocietyHow we surviveDeath and dyingBereavementFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when I went on a short trip with a friend, it gave me a glimpse of another worldManish ChauhanWed 28 Jan 2026 05.54 ESTShareWhen I was 24, I visitedIrelandfor the first time. It was the autumn after I graduated from university, and a friend who had won an award for her dissertation used her prize money to rent a beach hut on Valentia Island, so that we could spend a week working on our novels.The stone hut stood very close to the water’s edge on the western tip of Ireland, overlooking the expansive metal-blue of the Atlantic. The island possessed a rugged kind of beauty – cliff edges, a lush rainforest, cold frothing water. It astounded us. As did the tranquillity. It was what we had come in search of.When we weren’t writing, my friend drove us around so that we could explore the island and the wider country, making our way through Killarney and down to Derrynane beach where we rode horses along the powdery golden coast. After a week of doing this, it dawned on me that we had yet to see a person of colour. We were so close to England that I had come expecting the diversity I was familiar with at home.One afternoon, I stopped off at a convenience store. When the young woman behind the till looked up and saw me, the shock in her eyes gave me the impression that I was perhaps the first person of colour she had ever seen in person. I bought what I needed and left, but later I found myself thinking about that encounter. It was the first time in my life where I had felt as though I stood out.View image in fullscreenManish Chauhan in 2005.I grew up in Leicester – one of the first“super diverse” citiesin England where minorities make up the majority. My school photographs show a sea of brown faces, and for many years I believed Leicester to be a blueprint of England, perhaps even the wider world. My sense of self was, rightly or wrongly, strong. And yet my upbringing wasn’t truly diverse, either, since I was primarily surrounded by people who were from a similar background, racially and socioeconomically.Back at the beach hut, I was forced to contemplate what it might have been like for somebody like my grandfather, who arrived in England from Africa in the 1950s. At that time, he would have been one of only a handful of non-white people living inLeicester. Or my mother, who arrived from India in the early 60s. In the decades that followed, a great many more Indians would arrive in the city and attempt to make it their home, drawn by the quickly expanding community. Had they felt invisible? Had they felt as though they stood out?By comparison, the otherness I had encountered on my trip felt temporary. I returned home to the secure bubble of my former existence. Or so I thought.In the years that followed, I began to conceive of people as balloons, their sense of self expanding or contracting depending on their circumstances and where they were in the world. I realised I had spent my formative years in the comfortable, empowering state of expansion, believing, somewhat naively, that I was a member of the majority. My experience on that holiday forced me to contract, and I suddenly felt alarm at my own insignificance – the way a king might feel upon discovering that his castle was merely a small room inside a much larger one.A moment that changed me: the Brexit result came through – and my life in Britain fell apartRead moreI left Leicester to go to university in Hertfordshire, eventually moving to London. It was in these places that I found people from all over the world living and working side by side; there that, rather than expand or contract, I felt I could simply exist in the comfortable middle. Since then, I have travelled more widely – and discovered the world to be a throbbing landscape of people who are different to me in every aspect. But rather than feel daunted – as I did at 24 – I enter these worlds with pride and empathy.After that trip, I was more able to look at things from different perspectives. In recent years especially, with thesummer riots of 2024as well as last year’s“unite the kingdom”rally led by Tommy Robinson, I came to see how a person’s sense of self might have contracted so greatly as to become destroyed. Beneath the chants and slogans and violence, I saw the fear, however misplaced, that seemed to motivate the hordes of people gathered – of losing their footing in the place they called home. I recognised that fear: it lives in the heart of every immigrant.Being raised in Leicester gave me the strength to recognise my power and privilege and to fight for it, while that short trip in my 20s gave me a glimpse into my own insignificance. The older I get, the more I find that, in order to live a life of meaning, one needs to experience both.Belgrave Road by Manish Chauhan is published by Faber & Faber (£16.99).

Now it appears that how much a $1m loss matters depends how eager you are for your business to be concluded.That’s pretty eager apparently – and unsurprisingly – if you’re Lily Allen and David Harbour. The former couple havejust accepted $7m for the Brooklyn townhousethey listed for $8m in October.The question is, despite it being such a steal, who would want to live in the four-storey brownstone? It may not technically be a crime scene, but a marriage was murdered there, and each room is surely haunted by the ghost of open relationships. Plus, you’d wonder if every friend who visited really wanted to see you or was just coming to gawp at the bathroom carpet.This home is almost as well-known as its former residents. Every inch of it was proudly revealed ina 2023 Architectural Digest video, which we lapped up at the time but now insist was full of warning signs we noticed all along. (Harbour answering the door saying, “Oh God. What the hell are you doing here? I mean, last time I was single and I was living on the Lower East. I have a family now. Kids, I mean this is so embarrassing. You look good though. Come on in,” has, to put it mildly, not aged well.)And, of course, Allen immortalised it on her album, detailing the purchase in the title track, before it became the clashing patterned backdrop for the events of the further 13 songs. This was the site of her own personal nightmare. If those walls could talk, they’d be sobbing too hard to get a word out.Maybe the buyer has other plans, which include not missing a trick. Perhaps they’re going to leave the distinctive interior exactly as is, whack a blue plaque on the front, and open a West End Girl Museum. Watch out MoMA here comes MoMAdeline.

But the runaway success of a defective stuffed toy suggests that many Chinese are not feeling the vibe.A red horse toy produced by Happy Sister in the city of Yiwu in the west of China was meant to wear a broad grin, but a factory error meant it hit the shops sporting a despairing grimace. Because the smile was placed upside down, the horse’s nostrils could be interpreted as tears.Labubu underground: Lafufu makers defy Chinese authorities to feed the world’s appetite for viral dollRead moreDespite the manufacturing error, the toy has become an unexpected success with shoppers after going viral on Chinese social media and capturing a zeitgeist of corporate fatigue and worker burnout.It also taps into a broader trend for so-called “ugly-cute” toys, popularised in recent years by characters such as Pop Mart’stoothy monster Labubu.“People joked that the crying horse is how you look at work, while the smiling one is how you look after work,” Zhang Huoqing, owner of Happy Sister, told Reuters.By mid-January she said she was receiving daily orders of more than 15,000 units, prompting the factory to open up 10 additional production lines.View image in fullscreenA crying horse and a cheerful horsePhotograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockMany Chinese white-collar workers have enduredthe notorious 996 system, which requires employees to work 9am to 9pm, six days a week. The practice is exalted by tech entrepreneurs including Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, but has been increasingly criticised since 2021 when an employee of a e-commercecompany died suddenlyafter finishing a late-night shift. The 966 practice was outlawed that year, but long overtime hours are still common.“This little horse looks so sad and pitiful, just like the way I feel at work,” wrote an online buyer of the toy, by the name of Tuan Tuan Mami,according to SCMP.“Consumer products and internet memes can act as outlets for discussing work pressure, especially on platforms like Xiaohongshu, where consumer culture and emotional expression are tightly intertwined,” Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, an e-commerce consulting firm,told Business Insider.Meanwhile, wholesale orders for the “crying horse” have been placed from South Africa, east Asia and the Middle East. Its image is expected to appear on a new range of merchandise in the coming year.Zhang never discovered who sewed the horse’s snout on upside down. “Since we can’t figure out exactly whose mistake it was, we’ll just give everyone a bonus,” she said.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Thinking it needed to be let out, they traipsed downstairs and opened the back door – to be greeted not by their neat garden but an expanse of water.“It was like a sea out there,” said James Wade. Over the coming hours the water crept into their home on a modern estate in Taunton, forcing James, his wife, Faye, and their three children, six, 11 and 12, out and into emergency accommodation.“We have been here for 13 years and this has never happened before. Even during the huge floods of 2014 we were dry.”The Wade family are one of about 50 households that Somerset council estimates have been flooded this weekas Storm Chandra battered the UK.With anotherMet Officeyellow warning for rain coming into force for parts of the south-west of England on Thursday, the council fears more homes and businesses will go underwater, and hasdeclared a major incident.View image in fullscreen‘This has never happened before,’ said James Wade, who had to go into emergency accommodation with his wife, Faye, and their three children.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianThough the Wades’ home is close to Black Brook, the stream did not breach its banks. The water that hit them and their neighbours in the early hours of Tuesday is thought to have bubbled up through obstructed drains.“On one hand, it seems so simple,” said Wade. “They need to keep the drains clean. But I understand that there is a cost issue and with climate change, this heavy rain is the new norm.”A little farther east, people in the market town of Ilminster were mopping up and preparing for the next bout of rain.Allison Bushby, 59, a craftsperson who lives on a residential park at the edge of the town, said she was woken by a flood alarm at 1am on Tuesday. The water in her small garden was thigh-high, and she left at 6am when she was still able to pick her way out.Flooding is not unusual here. They were hit exactly this time last year. The water piles in from all over the place – farmers’ fields, a culvert, drains.“I’m prepared now,” Bushby said. She habitually keeps her belongings in chunky storage boxes, which she moves on to her counters when the rain starts falling. “They’re a godsend.”View image in fullscreenAllison Bushby said she was prepared for flooding on the residential park where she lives – it had happened at the same time last year.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianWhen the Guardian visited on Wednesday, Bushby had just returned home and was baking a cake for the park staff. “They’re so good when this sort of thing happens,” she said. “The whole community pulls together wonderfully.”Mike Rigby, the lead member for economic development, planning and assets on Somerset council, said the topography of Somerset – much of it low-lying and surrounded by high ground including Exmoor and the Blackdown Hills – made it susceptible to flooding.The water poured off the hills into places where people live and work. “Because of that geography, we have a massive risk,” Rigby said.Places that had not flooded before – such as the Wades’ street – had been hit this time. “We’ll have to investigate that.”Rigby said the council tackled drains “reactively”. He said: “When they block and we find that out from our own observations or from reports from the public, we’ll go out and unblock them, but what we’d like to do, frankly, is to have a proactive function.“What we really need is a dedicated pot, a hypothecated grant from the [UK] government to keep the drainage system properly maintained to a better standard.”He said it was important to earmark that money for this job so it didn’t get “sucked up into the vast black hole of social care”.Extreme rainfall is becoming more common and more intense in many parts of the world because of human-caused climate breakdown. This monthleaders in CornwallandDevon, which have been hit by the storms Goretti and Ingrid as well as Chandra, have claimed they need more money to bolster resilience.Rigby said: “The really intense rainfall we’re now seeing means we’re going to have to think more about how we manage water.”View image in fullscreen‘This needs to be managed locally by people who understand the moors,’ said Bryony Sadler.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianThe crisis in Somerset is not over. Onthe Somerset Levels,a low-lying area of moors, rivers and ditches, residents who had not yet been flooded were anxiously watching water levels.Bryony Sadler, a mum, hairdresser and spokesperson for the Flooding on the Levels Action Group (Flag), took the Guardian on her dog-walk and pointed to vast stretches of water that were not there earlier this week.The areamade headlines for weeksin 2014 when there was severe flooding. Since then there has been investment in dredging the rivers and in pumping equipment. “But it’s as if they think they have done that. Tick. That will placate them,” Sadler said. “This needs to be managed locally by people who understand the moors, not faraway officials.”Sadler is worried for the animals as well as the people who live in this nature-rich environment. She pointed out a deer picking its way through flood water. “What will happen to them? And to the hedgehogs and worms?”As day broke on Wednesday the water level at the Northmoor main drain close to Sadler’s home was 4.04 metres (13ft 3in). By 1pm it was at 4.14 metres. The Environment Agencyjudges that property can be floodedwhen it goes above 4.13 metres.Sadler was working out how to move her dogs, chickens, teenagers and mother if the water continued to rise. “It’s beautiful living out here most of the time,” she said. “An amazing place, amazing people, but at the moment it feels a little depressing.”Explore more on these topicsSomersetFloodingUK weatherEnglandExtreme weatherClimate crisisLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Below, rubble and glass have been moved quickly into piles as owners survey cars crushed by the falling masonry.Anastasia, 35, who lives in a nearby block, was displaced to Odesa from Donetsk after the Russian invasion and occupation in the east. Now she is contemplating the implications of the strike.“I was sleeping. I thought it was a dream at first as the building shook. I didn’t hear the explosion but I heard another Russian Shahed drone that was extremely loud. It had been quite quiet since I’ve been here. Recently it’s started to feel more dangerous. I haven’t decided whether to move, but right now I’m scared.”She is not alone. Russian strikes against Odesa have escalated sharply in recent months, as conflict centred on the Black Sea has heated up again after it had settled into stalemate.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of a Russian drone attack in Odesa.Photograph: Nina Liashonok/ReutersView image in fullscreenA woman sits inside a residential building heavily damaged by a Russian airstrike.Photograph: Oleksandr Gimanov/AFP/Getty ImagesUkrainian strikes late last year on oil tankers in Russia’s shadow fleet, and farther afield on the Russian naval base at Novorossiysk, coincided with renewed Russian attention on Odesa. Vladimir Putin has long claimed Ukraine’s main port as Russian, and in December he threatened to cut the city off from the sea.Taking Odesa, or even placing it under naval blockade, remains far beyond Moscow’s reach. Ukrainian naval missile batteries sank its warships, including most famously the Moskva,at the beginning of the war. So instead Russia has pounded the city with missiles and drones.The biggest recent strike, on 13 December, in which 160 drones and missiles targeted energy infrastructure, left large parts of the city without water and electricity for days on end, marking the beginning of a period of almost daily attacks.View image in fullscreenA power cut caused by Russian attacks plunged Odesa into darkness on 22 December.Photograph: Oleksandr Gimanov/AFP/Getty ImagesIn his office in Odesa, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s navy, Dmytro Pletenchuk, brings out a calendar for the month of January so far. “Shahed. Shahed. Shahed … There are two days this month without attack,” he says. It is 19 January. 16 days of rockets and missiles in total.“The Russians attack the energy infrastructure day after day and night after night because it is so cold now they think we must capitulate.“Right now the situation in the Black Sea is like a chess board. There’s no way for anyone to move. We’ve pushed the Russian warships away to Novorossiysk, but Russian aviation still controls the air over large parts of the Black Sea. So now it is a grey zone, 25,000 km of sea turned into a grey zone.”View image in fullscreenResidents of a building damaged in a Russian strike on 27 January gather in its courtyardPhotograph: Oleksandr Gimanov/AFP/Getty ImagesThat has meant a war fought at long range, but no less violently, as Ukraine has pursued crucial Russian oil shipments, and Moscow has tried to target Kyiv’s key economic lifeline, its export of agricultural products by sea.“It has escalated since the autumn when Russia increased the frequency of its shelling of Ukrainian ports,” Pletenchuk said.In tandem with that effort – as elsewhere across Ukraine – has been Moscow’s targeting of civilian energy infrastructure, which Ukrainian officials say is intended to “disconnect” the country from the grid.mapAccording to the governor of the Odesa region, Oleh Kiper, in military terms the Black Sea is an asset for the country’s defence but also a complicating factor.“On the one hand it is nature’s barrier protecting us,” he said. But unlike other cities farther inland, including the capital, whose air defences are layered like an onion around it, the sea makes it more difficult to construct the same defence in depth, creating vulnerabilities to long-range strikes by drones fired from Russian-occupied Crimea and from missiles.“The worst attack was 13 December,” Kiper said. “After that massive attack at least 60% of the total Odesa region was without electricity, with no water, no heat and no water supply.

They want to damage our morale. So everyday we have Shahed attacks. At the same time we are seeing Russian psychological operations on social media.”How important Odesa and the Black Sea remained to Moscow’s ambitions last year was underlined in a recent statement of Ukraine’s chief of staff Oleksandr Syrski.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of a Russian strike on Odesa on 27 January.Photograph: Michael Shtekel/AP“The Russian aggressor sought to end the war against Ukraine, but planned to do so by devastating us, imposing its terms from a position of strength,” he said. “They attempted to seize the remaining territories of Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as the right bank of Kherson, and aimed to reach Odesa to completely cut off our access to the sea.”That was echoed at the beginning of January by the country’s president, Volodomyr Zelenskyy.“They definitely want to cut off Odesa and other cities in terms of infrastructure,” he said. “They are striking and killing both people and the economy by reducing our export capabilities through the maritime corridor.”With 90% of Ukraine’s agricultural produce exported by sea through the Odesa region’s ports, shipping routes have been turned into a war zone. “The Black Sea, which feeds us and is an integral part of our economy, is also our weak spot,” the Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Kovalenko told the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview.View image in fullscreenThe waterfront not far from the port area of Odesa.Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The GuardianAll of which, says Nosicov, requires Ukraine to treat all elements of the Russian threat on land, sea and air with equal seriousness.“Even now we are preparing Odesa for a circular defence with anti-tank traps, kill zones and mines,” he said. “We will always take this Russian threat seriously, even if I believe that Putin giving an order to take Odesa would be the biggest Russian defeat in this region.”While Russia appears only able to strike at a long range, it is freezing civilians who bear the brunt of its attacks.At the Lyceum for Construction and Architecture, a trade school in the centre of Odesa, its director, Igor Chernenko, is supervising the cleanup and repairs after his institution was hit recently by three Shahed drones.View image in fullscreenIgor Chernenko examines the damage caused by one of three Russian drones that struck the site in January.Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The GuardianWith no heating, the smell of smoke permeates Chernenko’s office, where he is bundled up in a winter coat and hat in a place that once hosted more than 320 students and 72 staff.“The strike happened on 13 January at around 2.40am. A duty night guard had been in the basement and she called to say everything was shaking. When I arrived at 4am the building was still on fire.“I can’t think why the Russians would hit here. My only thought is that they don’t want us to prepare workers who will rebuild Ukraine.”He leads the Guardian on to a second-floor roof covered in snow where two of the drones punched through, shattering windows of an office building a block away and showering a neighbouring tower in shrapnel.“Among the most valuable things we lost was our archive, which we’ve kept since 1945. To be honest the situation is just getting worse. Before that we had attacks once a week but now it’s every night.“What they are doing it. It’s because Odesa is a pearl next to the sea.

What is known is that Patten, who was 19 and pregnant, was a force to be reckoned with.After taking the helm from her sick husband in the middle of a ferocious storm off the coast of Cape Horn, the notoriously hazardous tip of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago off southern Chile, she successfully put down the mutiny and navigated her way to safety through a sea of icebergs.Patten arrived in San Francisco Bay 10 weeks later with her crew and her cargo intact, the first woman ever to command a merchant clipper ship.A map of Mary Ann Patten’s routeYet her story has been all but forgotten. Now, the author and historian Tilar J Mazzeo is seeking to put that right with her latest book, To the Edge of the World: A Perilous Storm, A Mutinous Crew and the Woman Who Defied Them All.“I got the idea to write it when my husband and I were out sailing,” says Mazzeo, who lives on Vancouver Island in Canada. “The gentleman we bought our boat from left all his books onboard. I came across a reference to Mary Ann Patten in one of them.”Mazzeo found Patten’s tale inspiring and “quietly heroic”, she says. “There were very few sea captains in the 1850s and 1860s who could have achieved what she achieved, as a maritime feat. It’s amazing she and her crew survived.”When Patten set off from New York on Neptune’s Car, a fast 65-metre (216ft) sailing ship laden with mining equipment and groceries worth the equivalent of $12m (£9m) today, her husband, Joshua, was the captain. They were hoping to break speed records and earn a fortune by participating in a five-way clipper race to San Francisco.Their bad luck began the day before they departed in June 1856. The first mate broke his leg on deck and a new first mate, William Keeler, was appointed at very short notice.“In retrospect,” Mazzeo writes, “it is hard to know if Keeler was incompetent, hopelessly lazy, simply malevolent or deliberately trying to sabotage Neptune’s Car and throw the race because he’d been paid to do so by a competitor.”View image in fullscreenA painting of Neptune’s Car, the fast clipper captained by Mary Ann Patten after her husband was taken ill.Photograph: Hansard Collection/AlamyKeeler was repeatedly caught sleeping on duty – and when Joshua demoted him, he threatened his captain with violence. He was then locked up in leg irons in the brig.The second mate was illiterate and so unable to read the almanac tables required to navigate. So Joshua, who had unknowingly contracted tuberculosis before they set sail, was required to keep watch on deck almost around the clock to keep the ship on course.By the time they entered the Le Maire strait, a narrow channel near Cape Horn that Mazzeo describes as “a graveyard of shipwrecks”, Joshua’s health was failing. On 1 September, he collapsed on deck.View image in fullscreenThe author Tilar Mazzeo near the Chilean research station in Antarctica.Photograph: Max HabegerPatten, who was three months pregnant, was faced with a stark choice: allow someone else to take command and navigate the ship, or step up herself. She had been educated at one of the first schools in the US to admit working-class children, and she had learned celestial navigation skills from her husband.Supported by the second mate, “she takes the helm”, says Mazzeo, “just as they come around the tip of the strait and are fully exposed to the force of the winds in [the] Drake Passage.”To stay on course, Neptune’s Car needed to make the notoriously difficult turn around Cape Horn, but “a terrible gale” trapped the ship for days off one of the most dangerous coastlines in the world, and they could make no progress. “On the third day, Mary Ann realises the crew is going to mutiny – that they’re losing trust in her.”That’s when Keeler, still in shackles but sensing an opportunity, connives to send her a letter asserting his right to take command of the ship. “And that’s the moment Mary Ann gives this extraordinary speech to the crew,” Mazzeo says.“She stands there, furious, explaining all of the ways the first mate has forfeited whatever rights he had to command of the ship, and asking them to support her.”Later, the crew would report that the older sailors had tears in their eyes as they witnessed the 19-year-old’s determination and courage.“Whatever she said, it must have been amazing, because the men tell journalists later that they all found themselves applauding.”View image in fullscreenAfter persuading the crew to accept her as their captain, Patten fights the storm for days. Another ship trying to round the cape and in distress is spotted lying ahull – a desperate tactic that involves furling the sails, battening down the hatches and letting the vessel drift freely at the mercy of the storm.Patten realises the “force of the wind in the wave is simply going to crush Neptune’s Car, that the wooden vessel is going to crash and break apart. So she takes the most extreme measure a sea captain can take in bad weather, which is to decide to sail to the outer edge of the cyclone of the storm – and let the storm essentially spit her out,” Mazzeo says.Patten then finds herself surrounded by icebergs and ice fields off the coast ofAntarctica, unable to stop moving for fear Neptune’s Car would become frozen in the ice. “The only way to know which direction you’re going in would be through celestial navigation.”This skill, which Mazzeo learned to help her write the book, means that “with just an almanac, a watch and a sextant, you can pinpoint where you are in the world – it’s what allows Mary Ann and her crew to survive”.‘I had found gold before, but not like this’: four of the most splendid treasures salvaged from shipwrecksRead moreMazzeo also retraced Patten’s journey around Cape Horn and went on a 500-mile voyage from the coast of Chile to the South Shetland Islands, to get inside the captain’s head as she neared Antarctica.She was struck by the “electric blue” of the icebergs and how strange and unfamiliar the continent must have looked to Patten, who grew up in Boston. “Before Mary Ann, no other woman is known to have captained a ship in those waters.”Mazzeo details in her book how, against the odds, Patten managed to turn the boat around and steer Neptune’s Car back on course. “She’s a real survivor.”“The story is really about what a woman in the 1850s – given an education and an opportunity – was capable of doing, and how we remember that.”To the Edge of the World: A Perilous Storm, A Mutinous Crew and the Woman Who Defied Them Allby Tilar JMazzeo is published on 29 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsWomenSeascape: the state of our oceansHistory booksAntarcticaOceansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Delcy is now going through a face wash,”said Andrés Izarra, an exiled former minister under Maduro and his mentor, Hugo Chávez.Leaked video shows Venezuela regime’s desperate struggle to control messageRead moreBut sinologists say they understand why leaders of the United Socialist party of Venezuela might look to the Communist party of China for inspiration as they seek to leave behind years of social and economic chaos –without losing political control.“The Deng Xiaoping reform era is a very interesting model for Venezuela,” said Orville Schell, the Arthur Ross director of the Center on US-China Relations at Asia Society in New York. “They need to open up to the outside world and get the economy going … If she [Rodríguez] has brains, she will economically reform because, my God, she’s got to get their oil industry back pumping and irrigating her government with some funds.”Venezuela’s interim leader is soon expected to make an official visit to the US – the first by a Venezuelan president in more than 25 years – although it seems unlikely she will appear at a Texas rodeosporting a 10-gallon cowboy hat,as Deng did in 1979 to signal Beijing’s desire to engage with the world.View image in fullscreenDeng Xiaoping wears a cowboy hat at a rodeo in Texas when visiting the US in 1979.Photograph: Bettmann/Getty ImagesBut China’s authoritarian experience suggests anyone expecting a political thaw to accompany economic reform in Venezuela will be bitterly disappointed.Schell recalled how Deng brieflyflirted with political reforms in the 80s.“There were village elections – even some higher-level county elections were allowed … Publishing bloomed. Media suddenly opened up. Universities were much freer and there was almost nothing you couldn’t talk about,” he said.But deep down, Deng remained wedded to his “four cardinal principles” philosophy that insisted the party’s “dictatorship of the proletariat” could not be challenged. “The fundamental structure of the polity did not change,” Schell said.Any hope of democratic change evaporated in June 1989 when Deng ordered troops toclear protesters from Tiananmen Square. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of people were killed.Schell also said he suspected Venezuela’s current leaders would be reluctant to cede power and predicted Rodríguez – who didn’t seem “a Jeffersonian Democrat” – would “go very cautiously”when it came to political reform. “They are the elite, and they do not want to give up their privileges … a bit like the Chinese Communist party. They did not want to give up theirs either and migrate into a multiparty [system], where they had to actually compete politically.”“Venezuela is not China, but autocracies do have some common chords,” Schell added.Maduro’s heirs have shown clear signs of wanting to follow in the footsteps of Deng, whose economic pragmatism was captured by the phrase: “It doesn’t matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.”Long before Maduro’s abduction, he and his close allies repeatedly visited China to understand how it became the world’s second largest economy and helped millions lift themselves from poverty after decades of famine and violent political extremism.View image in fullscreenMaduro (l) with Xi during a visit to a housing development in Caracas in 2014.Photograph: Carlos García Rawlins/ReutersDuring a 2023 trip to Shanghai, one prominent Maduro envoy, Rafael Lacava,told his hosts: “From the economic point of view we are in a transition and this transition looks to the Chinese model … We strongly believe that this is the model we need to follow in the coming years.”Those visits resulted in the creation of five special economic zones in Venezuela, inspired bythe areas Deng set up to attract foreign investmentin south-east China in the 1980s.Phil Gunson, an analyst in Caracas for the International Crisis Group, said Chavista intellectuals had been pondering the need for Deng-style change for several years. Rodríguez, who was put in charge of Venezuela’s oil industry and economy after becoming vice president in 2018, was one of the key proponents of such thinking, alongside her brother, Jorge.“They have been seeking controlled economic reform for a while,” Gunson said, noting how Rodríguez oversaw a modest economic recovery by partly dollarising the economy and courting business leaders and foreign investors. She has travelled frequently to China since becoming Maduro’s foreign minister in 2014.A central goal now was reviving Venezuela’s decrepit oil industry by reversingChávez’s 2007 nationalisationin order to attract tens of billions of dollars of foreign investment. “It was one thing to shut out foreign firms at the height of a commodities boom … while oil was $120 a barrel. But now it’s less than half that and there’s a desperate need for inward foreign investment because [state oil company] PDVSA simply cannot revive the oil industry on its own,” Gunson said.Ricardo Hausmann, a Venezuelan economist and former minister who runs Harvard’s Growth Lab, said it was possible a China-style economic opening was the “gameplan” of Rodríguez’s new regime, which Donald Trump has unexpectedly backed while sidelining the opposition movement led by theNobel peace laureate María Corina Machado.But Hausmann said he believed such an effort would fail, doubting foreign investors and oil companies would risk their money in a place ExxonMobil’s CEOrecently called “uninvestable”.If the strategy does succeed, the long-term consequences for Venezuelan democracy could be dire.View image in fullscreenThe Deng Xiaoping mural in Shenzhen, the city commissioned to begin development in 1978 under Deng’s opening and reform era.Photograph: Ryan Pyle/Corbis/Getty ImagesFrank Dikötter, the author of several books about China, said the heirs of the Great Helmsman had used the “socialist modernity” pioneered by Deng to “build up an economy which has given them enough clout to enforce and enhance limits on democracy … with much greater controls on every aspect of life.”Today, under Xi Jinping,China’s most powerful leader since Mao, the east-Asian country is the world’s No 2 economy, but also its largest and most sophisticated surveillance state.Schell said he suspected Trump had decided to ditch Machado because he felt comfortable with Venezuela becoming an economically prosperous autocracy, so long as it obeyed Washington. “That’s why he didn’t bring Machado back. He doesn’t want someone with a Nobel prize and a lot of woolly ideas about democracy.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAmericasChinaDelcy RodríguezNicolás MaduroMao ZedongXi JinpingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since early 2018, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has visited China three times while German leaders have visited four times.The PM’s visit has attracted fierce criticism from his political opponents in the UK, particularly after the government gave the green light for aChinese mega-embassy near Tower Bridge in London.After a speech in London, the Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said she would not visit China “at this time” if she were in charge.“We should be talking more to those countries who are aligned with our interests, not the country that is doing everything it can to undermine our economy,” Badenoch said.Starmer will be hoping to develop a personal bond with Xi, which government insiders have said could help in future negotiations – for example if seeking China’s support in bringing an end to the conflict in Ukraine.His gift for the president, who is a Manchester United fan, was the football used during last week’s match when Xi’s team beat Arsenal, which the prime minister supports.Since taking office, Starmer has pursued a policy towards China which has been more open to engagement, while also cautious. He has met Xi before, withthe pair holding talksat the G20 summit in Rio in late 2024.Among deals expected to be agreed during the trip is the issue surrounding asylum seekers arriving in the UK in small boats from France.Downing Street said the planned agreement would seek to tackle the supply of boat parts which are manufactured in China, with 60% of the engines used last year being Chinese.The deal, to be signed after the talks with Xi and Li, will see UK law enforcement agencies work with Chinese authorities to share intelligence over the illicit export of boat parts, and to engage with manufacturers of the engines.It is also intended to deepen cooperation over serious and organised crime, such as the trafficking of powerful synthetic opioids, which have been responsible for more than 750 deaths in the UK.The agenda for the much of the talkswill focus on how to balance the need for commercial and diplomatic engagement with China while limiting its direct influence over UK infrastructure, and maintaining pressure on human rights, including the Uyghur population of Xinjiang, as well as people in Hong Kong.Asked about the implications of Mingyang, China’s biggest offshore wind company,potentially being allowedto supply turbines for windfarms in the UK, Starmer refused to add further comment.No decision has been made in relation to Mingyang,” he said. “There’s no decision on that yet, one way or another, but obviously uppermost in our minds is the national security of the United Kingdom.”Starmer dismissedapparent US concerns about the UK’s deal to hand sovereignty of the Chagos islands to Mauritius, saying US intelligence agencies disagree with Trump’s newly found opposition to the plan.Downing Street sources said the agreement is a “done deal” and will not be scuppered by the US.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerXi JinpingChinaTrade policyCybercrimeGlobal economyHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Burner phones, for example, are routinely used by No 10 on some trips abroad – at G20 the summits in Brazil in 2024 and South Africa in 2025, for example – though not on visits to allied nations or Five Eyes intelligence partners.For visits to China these precautions have been standard for at least a decade, such is the expectation that Beijing will eavesdrop and monitor.When she was prime minister, Theresa May was warned ahead of her trip to Beijing in 2018 to get dressed under the duvet to ensure that spy cameras would not film her without any clothes on. It was advice that was passed on generally by officials to all those travelling on the trip eight years ago.View image in fullscreenTheresa and Philip May with Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at a tea ceremony in Beijing in 2018.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/EPAConcerns about peeping tom surveillance are particularly relevant to those in the official entourage or business and press delegations staying in hotels. “There was a well-worn routine in places like Shenzhen that foreigners from the west would be assigned the same rooms so they wouldn’t have to move the equipment,” a former senior British intelligence official said.

He was reprimanded, though No 10 said there had been no security compromise.Part of the standard security guidance given to ministers and their aides reflects this incident. “The rest of the advice,” the senior security official said, “was warning middle-aged men that if an attractive young Chinese woman appeared interested in you, she probably wasn’t”.Michael Gove, writing in the Mail last year, recalled being given similar warnings before being dispatched on a ministerial trip in 2010: “I was also told that if anyone from the opposite sex who approached me was out of my league they had only one thing on their mind – and it wasn’t comparing notes on Confucian philosophy.”View image in fullscreenMichael Gove, Vince Cable, George Osborne and David Cameron at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during a two-day trip in 2010.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PADavid Cameron visited Beijingas prime minister in December 2013. A former aide recalled that China insisted on supplying a personal protection officer “over six-and-a-half-foot tall” to follow the British prime minister and his team as closely as reasonably possible.The practice, again, is relatively standard, but it offered an obvious possibility for low level information gathering. “At the end of the trip after pretending he couldn’t speak or understand, at the plane he said goodbye and safe travels in perfect English,” they recalled, presumably as a reminder they were being watched.General guidance, according to one British official who visited Beijing, “is that everything is bugged” and the only area for sensitive or secret conversations and debriefs is the secure compartment in the British embassy.Similar considerations apply when meeting Chinese leaders or officials – at international summits – or when visiting the country’s diplomatic premises in London or elsewhere.When James Cleverly was foreign secretary, a former adviser recalled that during the UN general assembly in New York, he and his team refused to take their mobiles into the Chinese consulate. The handsets were all stored in a lead-lined bag in the hands of officials who did not go inside the diplomatic building.One of the consequences of this abundance of caution is that ministers are out of ordinary contact in China, meaning their families cannot easily get in contact, having instead to communicate via a private secretary or other close aide.It can also cause other political issues, as happened to Vince Cable in 2014. The Lib Dem, who was then business secretary, was visiting China and did not have his mobile phone with him. Back in the UK, an old ally, Matthew Oakeshott, launched a coup attempt against the then party leader, Nick Clegg – but the plot struggled for momentum and quickly collapsed with Cable uncontactable.“I wasn’t part of this plot. It all broke in the middle of the night in China and not surprisingly we were not rushing to the phone,” Cable said.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerChinaAsia PacificInternational tradeTrade policyEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

It has been raised with the White House at the tail end of last week, over the weekend and into the early part of this week.“The position, as you know, is that when the Trump administration came in, we paused for three months to give them time to consider the Chagos deal, which they did at agency level.“Once they’d done that, they were very clear in the pronouncements about the fact that they supported the deal – and they were announcements made by the defence secretary, from memory, Marco Rubio as well, and by president Trump himself.”Pressed on whether he believed Trump fully understood the deal – after he appeared to get the details wrong – Starmer added: “There was a three-month pause whilst his administration looked in detail at an agency level, because obviously this is about security and intelligence.“So it was an agency review that was conducted in the US before they then concluded that it was a deal they wanted to support, did support and did so in very clear terms.”Trumplast week suggestedBritain’s decision to cede theChagos Islandsto Mauritius was among the reasons he wanted to take over Greenland, firing off a flurry of social media posts.He wrote: “Shockingly, our “brilliant” Nato Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital US Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.“There is no doubt thatChinaand Russia have noticed this act of total weakness. These are International Powers who only recognise STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before.“The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.”His U-turn initially blindsided Downing Street, which had thought the deal was done and dusted months before, but subsequently resulted in a new, more combative stance from Starmer, who said he“will not yield” on the issueof Greenland.The next stage of the bill connected to the handover of Chagos has been delayed in the House of Lords, with Downing Street saying on Wednesday this was because of discussions with the US.A No 10 spokesperson said: “We’re continuing to work with the US. We’ve worked with them throughout in terms of developing this treaty and as the ministers have set out, we are continuing to do that.”The Labour government agreed in October 2024 to hand over sovereignty of Chagos to Mauritius. Underthe terms of the deal, the UK will maintain an initial 99-year lease of Diego Garcia, where it runs a military base jointly with the US, at a cost projected officially to be £3.4bn.The deal was agreed under pressure from Washington, British officials say, adding that their American counterparts were worried about what would happen to the base if Mauritius won a case at the international court of justice over its sovereignty.At the time, Starmer argued that the UK had “secured the base for the long term” and that “has been opposed by our adversaries” including China. However, the Tories claimed the government had sided with Beijing.China abstained on the UN vote, which was a key stage in the road to the deal, and experts believe Beijing privately views the agreement as a setback for China, for national security reasons.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsKeir StarmerDonald TrumpChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Broader changes to NDIS access rules are due to come into effect from mid-2027.It had been initially proposed that states and territories would develop their own foundational support programs for kids, but a lack of progress saw the federal government move to set up a new national scheme.Among additional sweeteners being offered to secure the deal this week are budget funding “adjustments” to benefit smaller states, as they struggle with rising costs for health and hospital services.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailButler and Albanese have offered $23bn in new funding, part of lengthy negotiations over plans for the federal share of hospital funding to grow to 42.5% by 2030, and reach a 45% share by 2035.An extra $2bn in federal funding will go towards speeding up hospital discharge for elderly people waiting for beds in aged care facilities. The most recent estimate suggests more than 3,000 people are waiting to transfer from hospital wards to aged care.The federal government expects the deal to take its contribution to hospitals to $216bn over five years, beginning from July 2026.Labor wanted the dealsigned by national cabinet before Christmas, but the emergency response to the Bondi beach terror attack upended the plans. Albanese and Butler have stressed good faith negotiations in recent days, calling their revised offer “generous”.Amid drawn-out negations, Albanese had warned the states they needed to curb growth in hospital activity spending and staffing costs.Premiers and chief ministers are due to consider the latest version of the plan in a meeting of the Council for the Australian Federation – their forum for talks without the federal government – on Thursday. The council is chaired by the Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff.Guardian Australia has been told by multiple jurisdictions that there is growing expectations a deal will be agreed, even if concessions to give additional loading to smaller states mean larger ones will receive less generous shares of the additional federal money.Figures from May 2025showed children under 15 made up 43% of the more than 717,000 participants enrolled on the NDIS, but just 13% of all payments. Participants who had autism or other developmental delays as their primary disability made up half of the scheme’s participants, but just 23% of total payments.Butler said last year the government’s current 8% growth target for NDIS spending was “simply unsustainable” in the medium and long term, proposing it could be lowered to 5% or 6% in the coming years, through agreement by national cabinet.Explore more on these topicsHealthNDIS under pressureAnthony AlbaneseMark ButlerAustralian politicsNational disability insurance schemeDisabilityAutismnewsShareReuse this content"

France’s last newspaper hawker celebrated with prestigious awardAli Akbar, 73, honoured by Emmanuel Macron with National Order of Merit for dedication he pours into workAshifa KassamEuropean Community affairs correspondentWed 28 Jan 2026 14.28 ESTFirst published on Wed 28 Jan 2026 14.25 ESTShareFor more than five decades he’s pounded the pavements ofParis, becoming part of the city’s cultural fabric as he strikes up conversations, greets longtime friends and offers parodies of daily news headlines.On Wednesday, the efforts of the man believed to be France’s last newspaper hawker were recognised, as Ali Akbar, a 73-year-old originally from Pakistan, received one of France’s most prestigious honours.In a ceremony at the Élysée Palace, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, described Akbar as the “most French of the French” as he made him a knight of the National Order of Merit in recognition of his distinguished service to France.“You are the accent of the sixth arrondissement, the voice of the French press on Sunday mornings. And every other day of the week, for that matter,” said Macron. “A warm voice that, every day for more than 50 years, has boomed across the terraces of Saint-Germain, making its way between restaurant tables.”Speaking to Reuters in August, Akbar highlighted the delight he got from walking through Paris each day. “It’s love,” Akbar said as he crisscrossed the cobbled streets of Saint Germain-des-Prés. “If it was for the money, I could do something else. But I have a great time with these people.”View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron celebrates Ali Akbar in a ceremony at the Élysée Palace in Paris.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/EPABorn in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Akbar said he stumbled across his calling after arriving in Paris in 1973. When visa issues stymied his first attempt to carve out a life inEurope, he was determined to find a job that would allow him to support his parents and seven siblings back home.With the help of an Argentinian student who was selling satirical magazines, Akbar joined the ranks of the few dozen newspaper sellers in the city. His ready smile, sense of humour and readiness to walk miles a day proved a hit, allowing him to make a modest living.By day he sold newspapers to France’s powerbrokers, such as the former president François Mitterrand, and to Sciences Po students who would later join their ranks, such as Macron and the former prime minister Édouard Philippe. At night, in his early years,he slept rough under bridgesand in squalid rooms as he scrambled to send as much money as he could to Pakistan.As the decades passed, Akbar became a familiar face in the restaurants and bars of the Left Bank. “Ali is an institution,” said Marie-Laure Carrière, a lawyer. “If Ali didn’t exist, St-Germain-des-Prés wouldn’t be St-Germain-des-Prés.”Slowly and steadily, he built a life in Paris, getting married and raising five children, even as the newspaper industry began to wilt. While once it had been easy to sell as many as 200 newspapers a day, those days were a distant memory, Akbar said. “I sell about 20 copies of Le Monde in eight hours,” he said. “Everything is digital. People just don’t buy newspapers.”Still, he persisted. “I have a certain way of selling newspapers. I try to make jokes, so people laugh. I try to be positive and I create an atmosphere … I try and get into people’s hearts, not their pockets,” he said.When news of the order of merit came, it felt like a tribute of sorts to a way of life that is rapidly disappearing, particularly in a district once frequented by philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. “People used to do their shopping in small shops. It was a village, there were small markets everywhere, butchers and fish shops. Everyone was local, everyone knew each other,” said Akbar. “Nowadays its different. Every day there’s a new face.”‘I have Yes tattooed on my foot!’ Zoey Deutch on playing Jean Seberg in a joyous celebration of Godard classic BreathlessRead moreOn Wednesday, Macron ​praised the journey that had landed Akbar at the Élyséé Palace. “Before becoming an icon of Parisian life, you grew up in Pakistan, on the streets of Rawalpindi. As a child, you had to face the worst: poverty, forced labour, violence. You dream of only one thing: leaving. Escaping poverty, getting an education​. Earning enough money to buy your m​other a beautiful house​,” said Macron. ​ “You cross Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Greece. You experienced a clandestine life, destitution and constant fear. But you persevere.​”In the lead up to the ceremony, Akbar said it was an honour to receive the distinction. He told the broadcasterFranceinfoit was a balm for the many wounds he had racked up in his lifetime.Even so, he said he had no plans to give up selling newspapers, insisting he would continue zigzagging the city’s streets and cafes as long as he had the energy. “Retirement will have to wait until the cemetery,” he joked.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Although the court rejected the complaints by individuals, it did admit Greenpeace’s claim as an organisation.“They really listened to us,” said Jackie Bernabela, one of the original claimants, whospokeat the court’s October hearing about how climate change was already affecting her life. “Not only us, but all the other Caribbean islands in the world – if we join as one unity we can make things happen.”View image in fullscreen‘They really listened to us,’ said Jackie Bernabela, one of the original claimants in the case.Photograph: Laurens van Putten/EPAThe court ruled that the government was breaching articles 8 and 14 of the European convention on human rights, which protect the right to respect for private and family life and prohibit discrimination.Bonaire, a Dutch special municipality since 2010 – though theNetherlandshas been present on the island for about 400 years – is particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, extreme heat and other climate-related impacts, and its local authorities do not have enough people, resources or specialist knowledge to tackle them fully. These risks had been clear for decades, the court ruled, but there was still no coherent plan to address them.Furthermore, the court ruled that the Netherlands was not doing its fair share to cut national greenhouse gas emissions.The Dutch government was ordered to put in place a concrete adaptation plan. And it was given six months to set a national carbon budget that expressed a fair share of the remaining global carbon budget in line with a threshold of 1.5C global heating above preindustrial levels, which must be done in a transparent way. It must also set legally binding interim targets to cut emissions, the court said.The Netherlands has acknowledged that Bonaire is at risk from climate change. But in court, the government’s legal team said the nation was already doing more to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions than many other countries. The court did not agree, noting that, under international climate agreements, countries are expected to contribute according to their capacity to pay and taking into account their historical emissions.“This is an incredible victory for the people in Bonaire,” said Eefje de Kroon, a climate justice expert at Greenpeace Nederlands. “Not only has the court established that people from Bonaire are being discriminated against because of the climate crisis but also the Dutch government needs to do much more to protect them.”View image in fullscreenThe Netherlands has acknowledged that Bonaire is at risk from climate change.Photograph: Michel Porro/GettyBernabela was particularly moved by the court’s statement that Bonaire citizens were being discriminated against. “The Netherlands are engineers number one in the world, especially in water management – but they have no plan for us,” she said. “So we feel already – and not only with climate change – that we are second-class citizens.”Just over a decade ago, the same Hague courtmade history by ordering the Dutch governmentto cut its emissions by at least 25% within five years – a landmark ruling that wasupheld by the country’s top judges in 2019. That judgment inspired awave of climate litigation across the world.As well as previous domestic rulings, Greenpeace’s legal team relied on recent advisory opinions on climate change by theInternational Court of Justiceand theInter-American Court of Human Rights, both of which said states had clear legal duties to address climate change and to help communities adapt.In a statement, Sophie Hermans, the Dutch minister for climate policy and green growth, said the court had delivered a “ruling of significance for the residents of Bonaire and the European Netherlands”. She said she and colleagues from the ministry of infrastructure and water management and the ministry of the interior and kingdom relations would now carefully review it.The ruling can be appealed against.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCaribbeanNetherlandsGreenhouse gas emissionsHuman rightsSea levelColonialismnewsShareReuse this content"

This makes art the opposite of politics, where politicians are under constant pressure to give easy answers to difficult questions.I was thinking about this distinction this month while watching theEuropean film awards, this continent’s answer to the Oscars, which has moved its annual ceremony to January this year as it seeks to position itself as amajor tastemaker for grownup cinema.One of the most gratifying wins of the night was the best documentary prize forFiume o Morte!by the Croatian director Igor Bezinović – anAct of Killing-style re-enactment of the 1919 conquest of the Adriatic city of what is now Rijeka by a rag-tag army assembled by the proto-fascist dandy-poet Gabriele D’Annunzio. It was precisely the kind of quirky cinematic gem that the European film awards should be there to champion: a film ignored by the main festivals, about an overlooked but relevant episode in history.In his acceptance speech, Bezinović thanked the non-professional actors he’d recruited in his home town of Rijeka. But since the awards ceremony was held in Berlin, he also drew attention to the fact that, last month, 55,000 students in 90 cities had taken to the streets to protest “against the militarisation ofGermanyand against conscription”. Bezinović said he hoped “that these protests will inspire students all over Europe”.These words were met with frenetic applause, which is understandable. Pacifism is at the core of modern European identity: we are a crowded-together collective of similar-but-different nation states, who have managed to not be at each other’s throats for an unprecedented period of time precisely because we extricated ourselves from intense militarisation.View image in fullscreen‘Not so much “pro-military” but “pro-soldier”’ … the Bafta-nominated documentary 2000 Meters to Andriivka.Photograph: Mstyslav Chernov/AP PhotoHistory has taught Europeans to be cautious not just of picking up guns but of being sucked into martial mindsets. They value peace prizes over war medals. The European film awards don’t celebrate stories of superheroes or military glories but tales about conflicted antiheroes, like the protagonists of Joachim Trier’sSentimental Value. American-style board games work with luck and conflict, while “Eurogames” run on collaboration and teamwork. And in Germany, especially, the spectre of a military-industrial complex fanning political fascism is not imagined but a fairly recent historical reality.And yet “no to militarisation” still feels like an easy answer to a difficult question. It’s difficult because the pacifist consensus that western Europe has established since the time of the cold war has relied on American security guarantees and Russian fossil fuels – two trade-offs that have started to look increasingly unwise since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and, at the very least, since President Trump’s threats of aggression against Greenland this year.All the evidence suggests that calls for European rearmament are not driven by an out-of-control yearning for former military glories, but a gradual awakening to these realities – which is why this turn is happening slowly and often reluctantly, and why Germany’s new plans fall some way short of conscription, as our Berlin correspondent Kate Connollyexplored in a podcast this week. It’s understandable to feel frustrated with political leaders of the past having manoeuvred Europe into this conundrum, or with those of today remaining in the“comfort zone of cowardice and inaction”, as Nathalie Tocci wrote. But we should also ask what role we have to play in this – the kind of people on the liberal left who enjoy thoughtful European arthouse cinema, or indeed those who make it.Does being more sympathetic to the military automatically take artists down the same route as D’Annunzio, who was a revered literary figure with socialist sympathies before he tipped over into ultra-nationalism? Or can there be a middle way for culture in times of war? When I asked Charlotte Higgins, the Guardian’s chief culture writer, about this, she pointed me to the Ukrainian photojournalist and film-maker Mstyslav Chernov’s Bafta-nominated documentary2000 Meters to Andriivka, a film “which is not so much ‘pro-military’ but ‘pro-soldier’, deeply empathetic towards the men who are sacrificing their lives for inches of Ukrainian soil”.Inan essaypublished last year, the former Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba argued that Europe does not have to abandon the idea of pacifism by arming itself to the teeth. Instead, to survive it might have to embrace the idea of being an “armed pacifist”. It’s the kind of paradoxical image you would usually expect from artists, not politicians.To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeGermanyAwards and prizesCroatiaYoung peopleProtestnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!Iranian government braces for possible attack as US navy arrives in regionRead more“As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn’t, and there was ‘Operation Midnight Hammer,’ a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse! Don’t make that happen again.”It was the starkest indication yet from Trump that he intends to mountsome kind of military strikeimminently if Iran refuses to negotiate a deal on the future of its nuclear programme. The post also reflects a remarkable shift in the White House’s stated rationale for sending a carrier strike group to the region, moving away from outrage over the death of protesters to the fate of Tehran’s nuclear programme.Trump urged Iranians to keep protesting earlier this month, telling them “help is on its way”, but he later backtracked on the grounds that “the killing has stopped”.There is speculation that he actually held back because he did not have enough military assets in the area, Gulf States had urged restraint and Israel had counselled it needed more time to prepare for likely reprisals from Iran.Activists say more than 30,000 people were killed during the recent unrest. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, told the Senate on Wednesday that thousands had been killed and said the Iranian government was “probably weaker than it has ever been” since the 1979 revolution.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio testifying before the Senate foreign relations committee.Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPAIranian missiles and drones could still pose a threat to US personnel in the region though, he added.About 30,000US militarypersonnel were “within the reach of an array of thousands of Iranian one-way UAVs and Iranian short-range ballistic missiles that threaten our troop presence,” Rubio said. “We have to have enough personnel in the region … to defend against that possibility.”Trump would also maintain the “preemptive defensive option” of striking Iran if there were indications that it was planning an attack on US troops, he said. “They certainly have the capability because they’ve amassed thousands and thousands of ballistic missiles that they’ve built.”European diplomats had been expectinga crisis to developover the weekend and detected signs of Israeli nervousness about the scale of possible Iranian reprisals.In a social media post written in Hebrew, Ali Shamkani, a senior adviser to the Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said: “Any military action by America, from any source and at any level, will be considered the beginning of a war, and the response will be immediate, comprehensive and unprecedented, directed at the aggressor, at the heart of Tel Aviv and at all its supporters.”The Gulf States and Turkey have been speaking to both sides, trying to find common ground between Iran and the US, but Tehran has said it will not negotiate under duress or with preconditions.Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that a deal with Iran ought to happen. He told CNBC: “Obviously, the deal has to do with missiles. It has to do with enrichment. It has to do with non-state actor proxies. It has to do with [Iran’s stockpile of nuclear] material.”It has become clear in recent days that Trump is interested in curbing not just the remains of Iran’s already shattered nuclear programme but also its ability to fire long-range missiles, always seen as the centrepiece of Iranian military projection. In recent weeks Trump has also suggested Khamenei must leave the world stage, a demand Iran will reject.Asked by Senator John Cornyn about the potential for a change of regime in Iran, Rubio said: “You’re talking about a regime that’s been in place for a very long time … So that’s going to require a lot of careful thinking, if that eventuality ever presents itself. I don’t think anyone can give you a simple answer to what happens next in Iran if the supreme leader and the regime were to fall.”Some will see the sudden escalation of the threat as a useful piece of distraction at a time when Trump is under domestic political pressure over the violence administered by homeland security officers in Minnesota.The Iranian mission at the UN in New York said: “The last time the US blundered into the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it wasted $7tn, and over 7,000 American lives were lost. Iran stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respects and interests but if pushed it will defend itself and respond like never before.”Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he was not prepared to negotiate under threats but he was willing to talk without preconditions, terms he had relayed via numerous intermediaries to Witkoff.“Our brave Armed Forces are prepared – with their fingers on the trigger – to immediately and powerfully respond to ANY aggression against our beloved land, air, and sea,” he posted on X on Wednesday night.“At the same time, Iran has always welcomed a mutually beneficial, fair and equitable NUCLEAR DEAL – on equal footing, and free from coercion, threats, and intimidation – which ensures Iran’s rights to PEACEFUL nuclear technology, and guarantees NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.”View image in fullscreenAbbas Araghchi speaking in Tehran this month.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAIn the last 24 hours, Araghchi and the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, have between them spoken to diplomats from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.All three Arab states will be feverishly exploring ways to reopen talks without Iran having to accept a preconditioned result. They were critical in persuading Trump to hold back from mounting an attack three weeks ago, but Trump now has greater flexibility of military options and seems more focused on a nuclear deal rather than punishing Iran for the bloody suppression of street protests.There is deep suspicion in Tehran about talking to the US since the two sides were in the middle of talks last June when Israel was given clearance by the US to mount an attack on Iran designed to decapitate its leadership and destroy its civil nuclear sites.Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister, urged the US to detach its wider demands about Iran’s missile programme and support for militia in the region from the nuclear file. He said he thought that if Witkoff insisted on putting all items on to the table at once, Iran would not respond.Trump has insisted that Iran abandon its domestic nuclear enrichment programme, permit UN nuclear inspectors to return and hand its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to a third party, most likely Russia. Iran has always held out against abandoning its domestic capacity to enrich uranium but has been willing to set rigid limits on its stockpile.Since the last round of negotiations ended with an Israeli and US attack killing 1,000 people and severely damaging its key nuclear sites, Iran has been weakened further by a plunging currency and rampant inflation.With the nuclear sites already damaged, the key targets in any attack would likely be Iran’s leadership. June’s attack revealed Israel had near total dominance of the skies above Iran.Almost all the Gulf states, fearful of Iranian reprisals, have said they are not willing to allow the US to use their airspace or bases to mount an attack on Iran.Iranian officials said: “We will target the same base and the same point from which air operations against us are launched, and we will not attack countries because we do not consider them to be enemy countries. We will increase our level of defence readiness against the US military buildup to the highest level. If the Americans want negotiations without pre-determined outcomes, Iran will accept it.”Explore more on these topicsIranTrump administrationUS foreign policyIran's nuclear programmeUS politicsDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I think if most people have access, it’s some kind of degraded service,” said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik. “It’s almost like they’re developing a content blocking system by trial and error.”On Wednesday, previously unavailable Iranian Telegram channels came back online. Data from Cloudflare and Kentik show that an uneven restoration of internet traffic to Iran began on Tuesday morning – reaching about 60% of pre-shutdown levels at one point. The pattern of this internet traffic did not follow a smooth curve, Madory said, but rather had jagged peaks, indicating authorities were likely continuing to throttle connections.Iran internet use graphA report from Filterwatch, an organisation monitoring Iran’s internet traffic, suggests that certain services, such as Google, Bing and ChatGPT, are now available to some users on a province-to-province basis, but many are unstable and many social media and messaging platforms remain unusable.Iran’s internet shutdownbegan on 8 January, after nearly two weeks of escalating anti-government protests. The blackout has become one of the defining features of what may be thebloodiest weeks in Iran’s recent history.It has helped obscureextreme violence against Iran’s population, with accounts of mass burials and truckloads of bodies filtering out of the country only sporadically, and often days late, through journalists, activists and a few Telegram channels. It has also likely cost Iranian authorities a great deal of money due to lost economic output, with whole sectors of the economy unable to work.View image in fullscreenNationwide protests against failing economic policies started in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar in late December.Photograph: MAHSA/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite the regime’s efforts to whitelist certain websites and fine-tune their internet blockade, Iranian authorities have still said the shutdown has cost them up to $36m each day, according to arecentestimate by a government minister. This is on a par with previousresearch that has estimated the costof various global internet blackouts to be hundreds of millions of dollars. The OECD put thecost of Egypt’s 2011 internet shutdownduring the height of Tahrir protests at $90m.A report from an Iranian news outlet, confirmed by Iranian digital rights researchers, describes Iranian CEOs gathering in the dining hall of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce this week to access the internet – with all of their activity monitored by the government.Demand was so great that each businessperson was restricted to half an hour of access. One described the environment as “like an internet cafe from the 1980s or a university campus”.Two weeks ago, Iranian authorities appeareddetermined to continue the blackoutfor some time, perhaps indefinitely, with a government spokesperson reportedly saying the internet would be restricted until at least Nowruz, the Persian new year, on 20 March.Madory said authorities apppeared to be adjusting the shutdown, but not with an intention to end it. “It’s definitely not restored to pre-8 January levels,” he said. “Every day is different. Even within a day, it’s not consistent. It appears like they’re just developing this on the fly.”Explore more on these topicsIranInternetMiddle East and north AfricaProtestHuman rightsCensorshipnewsShareReuse this content"

His last term, which ended in 2014, coincided with the rise of theIslamic Stategroup, which seized swaths of the country.View image in fullscreenMohammed Shia al-Sudani, Iraq’s caretaker prime minister, stepped aside as a candidate earlier this month after al-Maliki was named as the nominee for a collection of Shia parties.Photograph: Iraqi Prime Minister Media Officei/ReutersThe list of candidates of the caretaker prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, won the largest share of seats in November’s parliamentary elections. But al-Sudani stepped aside earlier this month, clearing the field for al-Maliki after the two competed for the backing of the Coordination Framework, a collection of Shia parties that is the largest parliamentary bloc.The framework named al-Maliki as its nominee last week. A parliament session was to take place on Tuesday to elect a president, who in turn would appoint the prime minister, but was cancelled owing to the lack of a quorum, with no alternative date set.Al-Maliki said he would continue to stand for the premiership “out of respect for the national will and the Coordination Framework’s decision”.Al-Sudani came to powerwith the backing of the Coordination Framework in 2022. During his first term he managed to balance relations with Iran and the US, and restrained Iraqi pro-Iran militias fromintervening in support of Iranduring last year’s 12-dayIsrael-Iran war.Some of those militias have voiced their support for al-Maliki.Abu Alaa al-Walae, the commander of the Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada militia, called Trump’s statement “blatant interference in Iraqi affairs”, adding: “The criminal Trump, who physically assassinated the leaders of victory, now wants to repeat the act by politically assassinating [al-Maliki].”During his first presidential term, Trump ordereda drone strikethat killed the powerful Iranian military leaderGen Qassem SuleimaniandAbu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy leader of Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella group for an array of militias – including Iran-backed groups – formed to fight Islamic State.Explore more on these topicsIraqNouri al-MalikiDonald TrumpIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It will continue to demand parliamentary action until it is resolved,” he told the Guardian.Falconer said he hoped there would be a change of approach in the Lords to allow it to move to a vote in the upper house.Ian McEwan calls for assisted dying rights to extend to dementia sufferersRead moreHe said: “That is what should happen and that continues to be my aim. However, because the Lords is a self-regulating chamber there is no mechanism to prevent a small minority of peers frustrating the will of the majority who want to see the bill progress through all its stages.“Together with Kim Leadbeater MP, who introduced the bill in the Commons, I have sought advice on the possible ways forward and it is clear to me that while we would strongly urge the Lords to come to a conclusion while there is still time, the Parliament Act is an option.”The Parliament Act allows theHouse of Commonsto reintroduce a bill and force legislation through if the Lords repeatedly block it. Since 1949, when it was revised, it has been used for just a handful of bills to enact laws that have not had the consent of the Lords, including decriminalising homosexuality and banning foxhunting.After the session of parliament ends, a bill must be reintroduced and passed again in the new session to trigger the act’s override mechanism. It must be exactly the same version of the bill as passed by the Commons.There are two ways to invoke the Parliament Act: by a supporter adopting it at the next private member’s bill ballot or for the government to give time to the bill for it to return to the Commons.They would not have to formally adopt the bill and could remain neutral, according to constitutional experts. But for No 10 to give even limited time in the next session to the bill would likely provoke an outcry from opposing MPs – as well as from cabinet ministers such as Wes Streeting and Shabana Mahmood who are high-profile opponents.MPs are expected to begin putting pressure on party leaders, including Keir Starmer, to take this approach, warning that if they allow the bill to fall, they would face a large public backlash and risk looking impotent if the bill fell due to theactions of unelected peers.But invoking the Parliament Act is likely to spark fury among the bill’s opponents who will say it is a tacit admission that Starmer was never neutral because of his previous support for reforming the law.On Friday, peers will begin their 10th day of debate on the bill with hundreds of amendments still to consider out of more than 1,200 that have been laid. Of the 59 clauses in the bill, peers have not yet concluded debate on clause 1.According to analysis by the Hansard Society, the bill is likely to need at least 16 more sitting days to even reach the end of committee stage, but has less than half of that time available.Last week MPs and peers who support the bill angrily accused a handful ofConservative and cross-bench peersof deliberately filibustering with repetitive speeches and pointless amendments.Its critics say the bill is deeply flawed and unsafe anddoes not have the support of any of the royal colleges– and say that ministers and its sponsors are not able to answer even some basic questions about it at the dispatch box, contributing to the delay.A source close to Leadbeater said they were confident the Parliament Act would apply if the bill was taken through a second time and there are precedents for the government to give time to the bill for conscience issues.Though Starmer himself is a longtime supporter ofchangesto the assisted dying law, there has been scepticism about the bill among strategists in Downing Street, some of whom see it as an unnecessary distraction and a risky electoral issue.Starmer has shown himself unwilling to personally intervene or adopt the bill, stressing the government’s neutrality thus far, though he has voted twice in favour of its passing.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEnglandWalesHouse of CommonsHouse of LordsHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

It will mean millions of renters, including children, trapped living in poor-quality homes with nowhere to turn.”The campaign group had pushed for a deadline of 2030 for implementation of the new standard, which was promised as part of the Renters’ Rights Act.Paula Barker, the Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, said the decision was a “disgrace”, adding: “This means families, individuals and children will remain stuck in dangerous, substandard housing, that very well may be having long-term impacts on their health, for close to another decade. This decision is shameful and completely unacceptable.”The English Housing Survey in 2020-21 found that 21% of privately rented homesdid not meet the DHS, with 12% having a category 1 hazard, meaning they posed a significant safety risk.According to the Health Foundation, one in five private rented homes are classed as “non-decent”, meaning they contain a hazard or immediate threat to health, are in a state of disrepair, or are not effectively insulated or heated.In the social rented sector, a DHS was introduced in 2001 with an enforcement deadline of 2010, although some councils applied for extensions. As of 2023, 10% of social rented homes failed to meet the DHS, which has not been updated since 2006 and ministers argue it is out of date.Pennycook previously said a 2035 timeline for the new DHS “broadly aligns with the nine-year implementation period that accompanied the original introduction of the DHS in the social rented sector”.The new DHS will force landlords to ensure homes are in a reasonable state of repair, free of hazards, damp and mould, and equipped with facilities including noise insulation and child-resistant window restrictors.Sarah Elliott, the chief executive of Shelter, said: “Renters simply can’t wait this long for decent homes. It is outrageous that millions of renters are stuck paying hand over fist for often shoddy homes that pose a real danger to their health. Now, to add insult to injury, renters are being asked to wait almost an entire decade for the basic protection of a decent home,” she said.“The government must ensure renters’ homes are safe to live in now, not in 2035, while supporting councils to bring rule-breakers to book by properly funding local authority enforcement teams.”Paul Shanks, from the Renters’ Reform Coalition, said the government’s “lack of urgency gives landlords the green light to continue profiting from rotten homes, and will have real consequences for the health and wellbeing of millions of tenants”.“We’re asking the government to bring the timeline forward – renters cannot afford to wait a decade for these basic protections,” he said.Gavin Smart, the chief executive of the Chartered Institute ofHousing, the professional body for the housing profession in the UK, welcomed the new DHS, saying it would “update minimum standards for the first time in 20 years” and would be “crucial to improving quality of life and reducing living costs for tenants”.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Landlords must continue to fix problems where they exist while the new decent homes’ standard is being implemented.“Some measures, such as the minimum energy efficient standard, will also be implemented sooner and the changes announced today will lead to cheaper energy bills and warmer homes for tenants, while ensuring landlords have time to meet the new standard.”Explore more on these topicsRenting propertyHousingPropertyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, he announced that Democrats had “united” on a “set of common sense and necessary policy goals that we need to rein in ICE and end the violence”.These include a prohibition on patrols by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and a mandate that they coordinate with local and state police; the imposition of a uniform code of conduct and requirement of independent investigations into violations; and a ban on mask wearing by federal agents, along with a rule that they wear body cameras and carry identification.“These are common sense reforms, ones that America Americans know and expect of law enforcement,” Schumer said. “If Republicans refuse to support them, they are choosing chaos over order, plain and simple. They are choosing to protect ICE from accountability over American lives.”At a press conference held shortly before Schumer unveiled the Democrats’ demands, Senate majority leader John Thune signaled openness to discussing reforms to ICE with Democrats, but no change in the GOP’s plans to begin voting on the spending bills Thursday. All six wereapproved by the House of Representatives last week.“Democrats have objected, and so we’re anxious to hear what their demands are, what their requests are, what their asks are. I think the administration is willing to sit down with them and have a discussion, perhaps a negotiation about how do we move forward,” Thune said.“But the one thing I do know… is that a government shutdown is not in anybody’s interest.”The Republican leader added that the DHS funding bill includes less money for ICE than what the Trump administration had requested, as well as funds for body cameras for agents and “de-escalation training”, which he called “things that Democrats have said that they wanted”.He noted that failure to pass the DHS bill wouldn’t stop ICE’s operations, since it received tens of billions of dollar from theOne Big Beautiful Bill Actearlier this year. But it would affect other agencies under DHS such as the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which is responding to the past week’s wide-ranging winter storm.“I hope we can get this thing back on track. We need to fund the government,” Thune said.Schumer’s demands greatly increase the chances of at least a partial shutdown beginning later this week, because any changes to the DHS funding bill in the Senate require it to be passed again by the House.Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, told reporters that her party has no similar objections to the other five spending bills pending before the Senate, which authorize funds for departments including labor, defense and health and human services through September.“Democrats are ready to avert a shutdown. We have five bills we all agree on – about 95% of the remaining budget. It is ready to go. We can pass those five bills, no problem,” she said.“The ball is in the Republicans’ court, but when it comes to DHS, we cannot ignore what happened on Saturday, especially after what we have seen over the last 12 months. We have to split this bill off and grapple with the brutal reality that ICE and [Customs and Border Protection] are out of control and endangering American citizens.”Republicans control the Senate with 53 seats, and most legislation requires at least 60 votes to clear the filibuster – making bipartisan compromise essential.The Democratic opposition sets up a scenario similar to one that played out last September, when the minority party refused to vote for government funding bills unless tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans were extended. That resulted in the longest government shutdown in history, which ended after 43 days when seven Democratic senators joined with the GOP to reauthorize spending.Most Democratic senators are publicly onboard with the party’s strategy over the DHS appropriations bill, and some havejoined callsfor homeland security secretary Kristi Noem to resign or be fired over Pretti’s death.John Fetterman, who represents swing state Pennsylvania, is among those supporting Noem’s ouster, but has expressed hesitation with the prospect of a government shutdown.“I’ve … spent significant time hearing many different positions on the funding bills and maintain that I will never vote to shut our government down, especially our defense department,” he said in a statement on Monday.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Chuck SchumerUS SenateDemocratsUS politicsUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The earnings report described Tesla’s chaotic year as a “transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company”.The high hopes and grand possibilities Musk has outlined helped Tesla beat Wall Street expectations, even as the company reported its first-ever decline in total revenue – losing 3% year-over-year. Tesla reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.50 after the market close on Wednesday, exceeding the $0.45 that Wall Street expected. Its reported revenue was $24.9bn, beating analyst estimates of $24.79bn.The company’s total automotive revenues dropped 11% year-over-year in 2025. Earlier this month, Tesla reported its fourth quarter vehicle delivery numbers, which measure buyers’ receipt of their cars rather than dealership sales, revealinga 16% declineyear-over-year, hurt especially by cratering interest in Europe. The company’s stock rose as high as 4% in after-hours trading, before tapering off its gains.At Davos, tech CEOs laid out their vision for AI’s world dominationRead moreAs Tesla’s vehicle sales have fallen over the past year, Musk and the company have emphasized a shift towards AI-driven projects such as Optimus consumer robots and self-driving Robotaxis. All of these technologies remain unproven and not widely available to the public, let alone profitable, but they have allowed Musk to claim the company will see unparalleled future growth without much to show for it today.Musk has stated that Optimus would be the “biggest product of all time” and said that the robots, along with autonomous vehicles, would usher in “a world where there is no poverty”. Tesla plans to start production of Optimus before the end of 2026, according to the earnings report. Musk has said the company willsell the robot to the publicin 2027. Tesla also revealed that earlier this month it agreed to invest $2bn into xAI, Musk’s artificial intelligence company.Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, stated on the earnings call that the company’s capital expenditure would be $20bn, an immense amount that is vastly more than what many analysts estimated.Although Tesla’s stock price plummeted during Musk’s tumultuous time in government last year, it rebounded to its highest price ever in December amid ongoing market frenzy for AI investments and Musk’s promise of building a “robot army”. The previous month, Tesla shareholdersalso approved a pay packagefor Musk that could award him up to a trillion dollars in compensation if the company meets a series of financial milestones.While Tesla has touted its upcoming projects as evidence of upcoming success, some of its formerly futuristic products have struggled. The company’s Cybertruck, which Musk said earlier this month was “the best vehicle Tesla has ever made”, saw a drastic 48% decline in sales last year, according toKelley Blue Book reports.Tesla has faced increasing competition from other electric vehicles companies, primarily China’s BYD, whichovertook Tesla last yearas the world’s largest electric carmaker. BYD’s sales grew by 28% in 2025, as it offered consumers in a number of marketsless expensive alternativesto Tesla’s models.Explore more on these topicsTeslaQuarterly resultsElon MuskAI (artificial intelligence)RobotsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nationwide, dozens of weather-relateddeathshave been reported, from Texas andTennesseeto New England, since Friday. Various communities have grappled with heavysnow, ice and dangerously cold temperatures.As of Wednesday afternoon, approximately 370,000 customers across the country are without power, according toPoweroutage.us, including around 129,000 in Tennessee and roughly 113,000 in Mississippi.In Tennessee, Nashville Electric Service (NES)saidthat its crews are continuing to work “around the clock” to restore power to customers impacted.The company said that so far, NES crews have restored power to more than 123,000 customers, but that about 107,000 NES power outages remain and more than 300 broken poles have been reported.The number of deaths alsorose to eightin Louisiana, the state health department confirmed. The cause of death for five of the victims has been determined to be hypothermia. An elderly person in DeSoto Parish died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Also in DeSoto Parish, a 79-year-old woman died after her oxygen concentrator failed as a result of no power. And a Texas man died while driving on icy roads in Mansfield.The Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, said on Wednesday that there had been 10 deaths in the state, all of which have beenconfirmedto be a result of the harsh conditions brought on by the winter storms.“We are still experiencing dangerously cold temperatures and windchills, which will continue through the week. Windchills will be negative to single digits for most of the state until Tuesday,” Beshear said, adding: “We also need Kentuckians to make sure they’re bringing their pets inside; this weather is just as dangerous for them.”Additionally, at least seven people are confirmed dead in Mississippi following the major winter storm system. In New York, 10 people were found dead outdoors in the freezing temperatures, with mayorZohran Mamdaniconfirming thatexposureto the severe cold played a role in seven of the 10 deaths.Forecasters are also tracking another winter system. The National Weather Service’s weather prediction centersaidon Wednesday that a “winter storm” is “likely this weekend” in some areas, including North and South Carolina, and Virginia.“Confidence is increasing for impactful heavy snow across much of the Carolinas and parts of southern Virginia, beginning as early as Friday night and lasting through the weekend,” the agency said. “Confidence in impacts associated with snowfall remains lower to the north along the East Coast and into New England at the moment.”The strong storm system is “likely to produce gusty winds” the agency said, warning that “where these winds overlap with snowfall, reduced visibility is likely and could make for difficult travel conditions at times.”Weather officials also warned that “several factors for this potential winter storm remain uncertain and forecast changes are anticipated as the system draws closer.”In a recentupdate, the National Weather Service said: “While there is still uncertainty regarding the track” of the winter system, “snowfall is forecast to begin in parts of the Mid-South/Southern Mid-Atlantic on Friday morning.”“Snowfall in this region is expected to then persist through at least the weekend, with the most immediate impacts felt in the coastal regions of the Carolinas and Virginia,” they said. “Further south in Florida and Georgia, rain is expected on Friday as a result of this system, but is expected to be short-lived.”The storm this weekend could intensify into a “bomb cyclone” with the potential for significant snow, strong winds and some coastal flooding from the Carolinas to New England, theWeather Channelcautioned.On Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service in Newport/Morehead Citysaidthat “trends have been increasing for SIGNIFICANT amounts of snow” and said it is “expected to be a mostly snow event” and that “localized blizzard conditions” are “possible” along the coast.And the agency’s office in Morristown, Tennessee,saidthat snowfall is becoming “increasingly likely for this weekend across southwest Virginia, northeast Tennessee, and far east Tennessee mountains” with “extreme cold conditions” expected “area-wide”.Farther north, the National Weather Service in Baltimore and Washington DCsaidon Wednesday morning that it was monitoring a “chance for light snow” in some parts of the region later on Wednesday afternoon and evening.In New York City, where a cold weather advisory remains in effect, bitterly cold temperatures areexpectedto persist throughout the week.“The snow may have stopped falling, but the cold remains,” Mamdanisaidin a video on Tuesday. “Our city is in the midst of what may be the longest stretch of below freezing temperatures in recorded history. Extreme cold snaps like this are threatening, already 10 of our neighbors have passed away after being found outdoors. We are doing everything in our power to keep New Yorkers safe.”The New York City ferrysuspendedservice on Tuesday afternoon and remainedclosedon Wednesday due to ice in the East and Hudson rivers and across the New York harbor.The lingering impact of the storm over the weekend has also forced school closures and remote learning in parts of the country.

Rates currently sit at a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.TheTrump administrationhas put unprecedented pressure on the Fed chair,Jerome Powell, to cut rates, withDonald Trumplaunching personal attacks on Powell and the justice department opening acriminal investigationinto his handling of the refurbishment of the central bank’s offices.The FOMC has 12 voting members and meets just eight times a year to set interest rates. The stakes of each meeting have been high during Trump’s second term. Though economists say that the Fed’s independence, as the US central bank, is key for economic stability, the president has unabashedly tried to bend the Fed to his economic agenda.Chart showing interest rate changes over timeCutting interest rates can spur short-term economic activity, though at the risk of pushing up prices in the long term. But Trump has claimed that the Fed not lowering interest rates costs theUS economy“hundreds of billions of dollars”.Fed officials have resisted these calls. In December, at the last FOMC meeting, Powellimpliedthe Fed would be pausing cuts for the time being. “We’re well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here,” he said. After the Fed meeting, Trump called Powell “stiff” and said that the rate drop “could have been doubled”.The full extent of Trump’s anger would not be seen until 11 January, when Powell – whose term as chair is up in May – announced he was undercriminal investigation.The investigation is focused on congressional testimony that Powell gave last summer on renovations at the Fed headquarters, which has gone over budget. Trump alleges Powell committed fraud, though the Fed chair has said that the renovations were necessary safety upgrades to decades-old buildings.In arecorded statement, what many said was aremarkable defianceof Trump’s bullying, Powell called the investigation a “pretext”.“The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of theFederal Reservesetting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” Powell said. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions – or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”The investigation remains ongoing, despite swift backlash frombusiness leadersand some Republicanlawmakers.Despite these ongoing threats, Powell on Wednesday said a majority of Fed policymakers believe interest rates are at a neutral level, suggesting that further rate cuts will not be coming any time soon.“I think, and many of my colleagues think, it’s hard to look at the incoming data and say that policy is significantly restrictive at this time,” Powell said.The Fed chair declined to answer multiple questions on the investigation, including whether the Fed responded to the justice department’s subpoena. He also declined to comment on whether he will remain on the Fed’s board after he steps down as chair. Powell’s term on the board is set to expire in 2028.But Powell made it clear that he remains a staunch believer of Fed independence and expressed the importance of the Fed retaining its credibility.“Monetary policy can be used through an election cycle to affect the economy in a way that’s politically worthwhile,” Powell said. Having an independent central bank is a “good practice”, and if that’s lost, “it would be hard to restore the credibility of the institution”, he cautioned.“If people lose the faith that we are making decisions only on the basic assessment of what is best for everyone – for the wider public, rather than trying to benefit one group or another – if you lose that, it’s going to be hard to retain it,” Powell said. “And we haven’t lost it. I don’t believe we will. I certainly hope we won’t.”When asked if he is confident the Fed can maintain independence at this point, Powell said: “Yes – I mean, I am strongly committed to that, and so are my colleagues.”Asked for his advice for his successor Fed chair, Powell was willing to provide an answer. “Stay out of elected politics, don’t get pulled into elected politics. Don’t do it,” he said. “It’s easy to criticize government institutions in so many ways. I will tell whoever it is: you are about to meet the most qualified group of people you not only have ever worked with, [but that] you will ever work with.“When you meet Fed staff – and not everybody is perfect – but there isn’t a better cadre of professionals more dedicated to the public well-being than [those] working at the Fed.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS interest ratesJerome PowellDonald TrumpUS economyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Amazon employs about 1.5 million workers worldwide.Most job cuts are expected to be in the US, although some roles in the UK may also be affected.The company said the “additional organisational changes” were designed to “strengthen our organisation by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy”, according to ablogpost to stafffrom Beth Galetti, the senior vice-president of people experience and technology.Galetti said some teams had not been affected by the job cuts announced in October, but this was not the beginning of regular waves of layoffs. “Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan,” she wrote.US-based employees who are affected will be offered 90 days to find a new role internally, with the timing for applying for new roles varying in other countries.Galetti saidAmazonwould continue to hire new staff and invest in “strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future”.The official announcement came just hours after workers at Amazon Web Services (AWS) received an online meeting invitation from a top executive on Tuesday for the following day – subsequently cancelled – that also contained a draft email revealing the cuts.The message erroneously said that affected employees in the US, Canada andCosta Ricahad already been told they had lost their jobs.It was signed by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice-president of applied AI solutions at AWS, while the layoffs were referred to in the email as “Project Dawn”.“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Aubrey wrote in the email, which was seen by multiple news outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organisation and AWS for future success.”The email referred to a separate message from Amazon’s human resources boss, which did not appear to have been sent.Amazon has been trying to reverse a pandemic hiring spree in an effort to cut costs and slim down its vast operation.Its chief executive, Andy Jassy, has previouslywarned white-collar workersat the company that their jobs could be taken by AI in the next few years.The news of fresh Amazon layoffs came as the US delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS) said it wouldcut up to 30,000 jobs this year, adding to last year’s staff reductions, as it focuses on higher-margin shipments.UPS has been working to cut millions of low-value deliveries it carries out for Amazon, which is its largest customer but increasingly also a delivery rival. UPS has called its business with Amazon “extraordinarily dilutive” to margins.It is understood that a few hundred of the job cuts are expected to be in UK corporate offices in London and Manchester, with warehouses unaffected.Additional reporting by Sarah ButlerExplore more on these topicsAmazonJob lossesE-commerceCanadaCosta RicanewsShareReuse this content"

The EPA is poised to remove its own ability to act on theclimate crisisand has, separately, unveiled a new monetary worth assigned to human lives when setting air pollution regulations. The current new value? Zero.‘Abdication’: Trump takes US out of Paris climate agreement for a second timeRead more“The EPA was designed to protect public health and the environment and did a remarkably effective job of that,” said William Reilly, who was EPA administrator under a previous Republican president, George HW Bush.“That record is now at risk and we will see the degradation of air quality in major cities. The administration seems to conceivethe purpose of the agency as solely promoting business, which has never been the agency’s mission. That’s revolutionary – it’s not been seen before.”A vivid illustration of this, Reilly said, was when the EPAasked businesses last yearto simply email a request to be exempt from air pollution rules. “The notion you could be excused from a black letter law just by asking for it was startling to me,” he said. “I thought it was a spoof. But it did happen.”After returning to the White House, Trump vowed to “unleash” oil and gas drilling and the burgeoning AI industry by sweeping away environmental regulations that the president says only serve a “globalist climate agenda” and a “scam” clean energy sector.The EPA under its current administrator, Lee Zeldin, has zealously followed this lead – initiating 66 environmental rollbacks in the first year, according to a tally compiled by green group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).View image in fullscreenLee Zeldin at the White House on 25 November 2025.Photograph: Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty ImagesThis list includes paring back limits on pollutants such as mercury and soot coming from cars and power plants, cancelling grants for renewables and aid for communities blighted by toxins, squashing clean water protections and deleting mentions of the climate crisis from the EPA website.Two particular reversals have shocked former EPA staff and could fundamentally transform the agency. Last year, the agencyannouncedit would rescind the so-called “endangerment finding”, a landmark 2009 determination affirmed by the supreme court andoutside expertsthat greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide harm human health.Removing the finding would essentially demolish all climate-related regulations issued by the federal government, a move cheered by pro-fossil fuelcompaniesand Republican-ledstatesthat have urged Trump to take drastic action to remove any restraints on global heating.Then, this month,the EPA saidthat it would no longer consider the cost to human health from two common air pollutants – but still weigh the cost paid by industry for regulatory compliance.This will hide theoutsizedeconomic as well as health benefits of reducing pollution – the EPA had previouslycalculatedthat reducing emissions of tiny soot particles, harmful to lung, heart, and brain functions when inhaled, would deliver $77 in benefits for every $1 spent by businesses to comply.“This move ignores the incredible success we’ve had in reducing air pollution while growing our economy,” said Jenni Shearston, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “It appears the EPA is putting more importance upon the cost to industry than the cost to the public. I’m worried this will mean more air pollution will be emitted as a result.”An EPA spokesperson said the agency was “taking steps to update” the consideration of human health in regulatory decision making, adding that “legal decisions about standards are guided first by scientific evidence of health risk, not by whether benefits can be assigned a precise dollar value.” They did not clarify how EPA will model these impacts in the future.The spokesperson also defended the decision to roll back the endangerment finding, a decision they said “is the legal prerequisite used by the Obama and Biden administrations to justify trillions of dollars of greenhouse gas regulations”.Reilly’s criticism was an example of the “out-of-touch, elitist thinking that failed American taxpayers and held back real environmental progress” and it was a “propagandist narrative by outlets parroting far-left talking points” to suggest the agency will no longer assess the public health costs of pollution, the spokesperson added.Zeldin, a Republican who was previously a New York congressman, has been an enthusiastic public champion for theTrump administration, appearing dozens of times on Fox News. However, unusually for an EPA administrator, Zeldin appears to be spending less time than predecessors telling Americans about efforts to cut their exposure to toxic air and water.Instead, the EPA chief has said he wants to thrust “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion”, called for a revival of coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, and demanded drivers opt for gasoline, rather than cleaner electric, cars.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump signs executive orders about coal production at the White House on 8 April 2025.Photograph: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesIn a novel move for an environmental regulator, Zeldin has eventaken it upon himselfto ensure that “making the United States the artificial intelligence capital of the world” is a core priority for his agency. When asked on Fox in September whether he agreed with Trump’s attempt to shut down clean energy projects, Zeldin replied: “I am for whatever President Trump is advocating for.”The EPA’s 16,000-strong workforce, meanwhile, has beenshrunkthrough firings and early retirements by a quarter, with entire divisions of the agency – such as the EPA’s scientific arm, called the office of research and development – slated for closure. Enforcement actions against rule-breaking polluters haveplummeted.The changes amount to “a war on all fronts that this administration has launched against our health and the safety of our communities and the quality of our environment”, said Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program.“It is an attempt to completely eliminate EPA and just leave a symbolic husk,” said Tejada, who is now senior vice-president of environmental health at NRDC.Hundreds of EPA staff have revolted at this agenda,signing an open letter last summeraccusing the administration of “recklessly undermining” the agency’s mission and promoting a “culture of fear” – a protest that led to 140 staffers being suspended from work.“He answers to capital and nothing else,” Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents EPA employees,said of Zeldin. “The EPA isn’t fulfilling it’s mission and won’t be able to again until the boot is taken off the neck of dedicated civil servants to do their job.”Anonymous testimonials taken from EPA staff by the union suggests a widespread sense of despair has taken hold. “To say that this year has been hard, insulting, demeaning, horrific, stressful … all would be a gross understatement,” said one.Another said Zeldin’s tenure had been “Orwellian”. A third staffer, who works on Great Lakes water quality, added: “We no longer use EPA’s authorities to safeguard our water resources – we use them to protect the interests of industry.”View image in fullscreenAn image of Lee Zeldin above a chyron that reads ‘EPA to eliminate environmental justice offices’ on a screen in New York on 12 March 2025.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP via Getty ImagesThe EPA’s transformation will not immediately plunge the US back into the era that predated the agency’s foundation under Richard Nixon 55 years ago, a time when US cities were routinelyshroudedin thick, choking pollution, lead was found in paint and gasoline, and rivers were so riddled with chemicals that they caughtfire.But the next three years of the Trump administration threaten to erode much of theprogressmade since this time, warned Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy adviser.Deportations up, job growth down: Trump’s second term so far – in chartsRead more“EPA’s current leadership has abandoned EPA’s mission to protect human health and safety. Human lives don’t count. Childhood asthma doesn’t count. It is a shameful abdication of EPA’s responsibility to protect Americans from harm,” he said.“Under this administration, the Environmental Protection Agency is now the EnvironmentalPollutionAgency, helping polluters at the expense of human health.”The EPA said it rejects this criticism, pointing to alistof what it says are 500 environmental “wins” achieved in the first year of Trump’s term, including a “historic new agreement with Mexico to permanently tackle the Tijuana River sewage crisis, major action to regulate high-risk phthalate chemicals, accelerated enforcement to block foreign polluters, and billions of dollars directed toward reducing lead in drinking water”.“Contrary to the suggestion that the administrator’s focus is misplaced, talking about affordable energy and technology leadership directly supports the EPA’s mission,” the EPA spokesperson said.“Clean air and water depend on stable infrastructure, reliable energy, and innovation that allows us to reduce pollution more efficiently. By cutting red tape, improving oversight, and ensuring sound use of taxpayer dollars, the Trump EPA is building the foundation for long-term environmental and economic health.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe first year of Trump 2.0Trump administrationClimate crisisUS politicsFossil fuelsPollutionAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

Asked whether he was concerned about the currency’s slide, he told reporters: “I think the value of the dollar – look at the business we’re doing. The dollar’s doing great.”The greenback has tumbled by 10% over the past year, while Tuesday’s fall was the largest one-day drop since last April, when Trumpannounced his sweeping tariff plans, marking a global market sell-off.A line graph shows the movement of the US dollar against six major currencies since 2020The dollar has now touched its lowest level since February 2022, after unpredictable US policymaking, including Trump’srecent threats to take over Greenlandand impose further tariffs on European allies, unleashed fresh geopolitical shocks.“A weaker dollar is a two-sided coin,” said Steve Sosnick, a market strategist at Interactive Brokers, adding that it was good for multinational companies.“If you have operations around the world and foreign currency revenue that will have a conversion advantage when you turn it into US dollars, that will be good. On the other, it makes imported goods more expensive and there might be some inflationary impact from that.”The dollar’s slide has also propelled some rival global currencies to multi-year highs.The Swiss franc has soared to its highest level against the dollar in more than a decade, as traders have sought out a store of wealth traditionally viewed as a haven insulated from global volatility. The franc has already climbed 3% against the dollar so far this year, after a 14% rise in 2025.The euro has also surged to $1.20 against the dollar, setting a new milestone. The European single currency has climbed about 2% over the past week, marking its biggest weekly gain since last April, while 2025 was its best year since 2017 as it rose 13%.Gold has continued to climb to new record highs, breaking through the level of $5,200 (£3,770) an ounce. The precious metal, which investors traditionally seek out during times of political uncertainty, has continued an extraordinary rally, after ithit $5,000 an ounce for the first timeon Monday. The price of gold has jumped by almost 90% since Trump’s second inauguration a little over a year ago.Some analysts expect the dollar to weaker further, amid concerns about presidential pressure on theFederal Reserve, combined with the economic outlook in the US and its rising debt load.The US central bank is due to announce its first interest rate decision of the year on Wednesday, when it is widely expected to keep rates on hold, despite Trump’s demandsfor policymakers to cut rates.After unprecedented attacks on the Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell – whom Trump has called “stupid” and threatened to fire – the justice department has also opened acriminal investigationinto Powell over renovations to the central bank’s headquarters.Powell’s term as chair is due to expire in May, and Trump could name a successor soon after the interest rates decision.Explore more on these topicsDollarCurrenciesDonald TrumpFederal ReserveJerome PowellUS interest ratesUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

Payments would be front-loaded over the next decade and decline as people shifted from running their homes and vehicles on gas, petrol and diesel to clean electricity.After that, households would be expected to face lower coststhan when their homes relied on fossil fuels. Small businesses would also be compensated.The report fleshes outa 2024 call by Garnaut, the Superpower Institute’s director, for Australia to re-embrace carbon pricing 12 years after the then Coalition prime minister Tony Abbottabolished what some had described as a world-leading schemeto address the climate crisis.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn the years since, Labor has repeatedly rejected the idea of returning to charging polluters for their emissions, fearing another brutal political fight over often inflated claims about the cost to the public.Sims, the chair of the Superpower Institute and an ex-chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, suggested the political, economic and climate landscape had changed significantly since 2014.He said Australia faced three choices – missing its emissions targets under existing policies, ramping up existing policies in a way that pushed up consumer costs, or forcing polluters to foot the bill and dramatically accelerating the pace of emissions cuts.Sims said on average about $5bn a year should be dedicated to household cost-of-living relief. The rest could be spent addressing a long-term structural budget deficit, which he said was worse than people realised, and on social policies and green industries.He said the “simple” polluter pays levy could apply to the carbon content of fossil fuel imports and the coal, gas and oil extracted in Australia by about 60 companies.“These products are responsible for about 80% of Australia’s emissions, but ordinary Australians are picking up the tab,” he said. “It’s a simple principle: if you cause the damage you should help fix it. That’s not radical, it’s fair.”The institute suggested the pollution levy should start at $17 a tonne of carbon dioxide, rising until it is linked to the European Union carbon price in 2034.It said the new gas levy, similar to calls from other organisations in recent years, would ensure companies paid “their fair share for extracting the gas resources that belong to all Australians”. Institute modelling suggested the levy would be “economically neutral” and not affect gas industry investment returns or export prices.The report estimated the two taxes would on average collect $35.6bn a year from 2026 to 2050. Annual revenue would start at less than $20bn and rise to more than $40bn after 2030.Despite Australia’s two-decade-plus volatile contentious public fight over carbon pricing, the institute expected the policy could be popular.It commissioned polling from Redbridge Group that suggested 68% of Australians agreed with introducing a “polluter levy” on the country’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters.Henry, who led federal Treasury for a decade until 2011 and was not involved with the Superpower Institute analysis, said the numbers in the report were credible and backed its recommendations.He said the government had an opportunity in the current political moment to introduce major change as many people understood “that some big things need to happen” and “that benefits that have accrued to the nation have been overly concentrated in a few hands”.“I think there’s a view quite broadly shared in the community that much of the good fortune that Australia has been endowed with over millions of years we’ve been doing our level best to piss up against the wall,” he said.“I think that gives leaders an opportunity to do some creative things in the national interest, and particularly in the interest of future generations.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisAustralian politicsBusinessGreenhouse gas emissionsFossil fuelsTaxPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

France’s last newspaper hawker celebrated with prestigious awardAli Akbar, 73, honoured by Emmanuel Macron with National Order of Merit for dedication he pours into workAshifa KassamEuropean Community affairs correspondentWed 28 Jan 2026 14.28 ESTFirst published on Wed 28 Jan 2026 14.25 ESTShareFor more than five decades he’s pounded the pavements ofParis, becoming part of the city’s cultural fabric as he strikes up conversations, greets longtime friends and offers parodies of daily news headlines.On Wednesday, the efforts of the man believed to be France’s last newspaper hawker were recognised, as Ali Akbar, a 73-year-old originally from Pakistan, received one of France’s most prestigious honours.In a ceremony at the Élysée Palace, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, described Akbar as the “most French of the French” as he made him a knight of the National Order of Merit in recognition of his distinguished service to France.“You are the accent of the sixth arrondissement, the voice of the French press on Sunday mornings. And every other day of the week, for that matter,” said Macron. “A warm voice that, every day for more than 50 years, has boomed across the terraces of Saint-Germain, making its way between restaurant tables.”Speaking to Reuters in August, Akbar highlighted the delight he got from walking through Paris each day. “It’s love,” Akbar said as he crisscrossed the cobbled streets of Saint Germain-des-Prés. “If it was for the money, I could do something else. But I have a great time with these people.”View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron celebrates Ali Akbar in a ceremony at the Élysée Palace in Paris.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/EPABorn in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Akbar said he stumbled across his calling after arriving in Paris in 1973. When visa issues stymied his first attempt to carve out a life inEurope, he was determined to find a job that would allow him to support his parents and seven siblings back home.With the help of an Argentinian student who was selling satirical magazines, Akbar joined the ranks of the few dozen newspaper sellers in the city. His ready smile, sense of humour and readiness to walk miles a day proved a hit, allowing him to make a modest living.By day he sold newspapers to France’s powerbrokers, such as the former president François Mitterrand, and to Sciences Po students who would later join their ranks, such as Macron and the former prime minister Édouard Philippe. At night, in his early years,he slept rough under bridgesand in squalid rooms as he scrambled to send as much money as he could to Pakistan.As the decades passed, Akbar became a familiar face in the restaurants and bars of the Left Bank. “Ali is an institution,” said Marie-Laure Carrière, a lawyer. “If Ali didn’t exist, St-Germain-des-Prés wouldn’t be St-Germain-des-Prés.”Slowly and steadily, he built a life in Paris, getting married and raising five children, even as the newspaper industry began to wilt. While once it had been easy to sell as many as 200 newspapers a day, those days were a distant memory, Akbar said. “I sell about 20 copies of Le Monde in eight hours,” he said. “Everything is digital. People just don’t buy newspapers.”Still, he persisted. “I have a certain way of selling newspapers. I try to make jokes, so people laugh. I try to be positive and I create an atmosphere … I try and get into people’s hearts, not their pockets,” he said.When news of the order of merit came, it felt like a tribute of sorts to a way of life that is rapidly disappearing, particularly in a district once frequented by philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. “People used to do their shopping in small shops. It was a village, there were small markets everywhere, butchers and fish shops. Everyone was local, everyone knew each other,” said Akbar. “Nowadays its different. Every day there’s a new face.”‘I have Yes tattooed on my foot!’ Zoey Deutch on playing Jean Seberg in a joyous celebration of Godard classic BreathlessRead moreOn Wednesday, Macron ​praised the journey that had landed Akbar at the Élyséé Palace. “Before becoming an icon of Parisian life, you grew up in Pakistan, on the streets of Rawalpindi. As a child, you had to face the worst: poverty, forced labour, violence. You dream of only one thing: leaving. Escaping poverty, getting an education​. Earning enough money to buy your m​other a beautiful house​,” said Macron. ​ “You cross Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Greece. You experienced a clandestine life, destitution and constant fear. But you persevere.​”In the lead up to the ceremony, Akbar said it was an honour to receive the distinction. He told the broadcasterFranceinfoit was a balm for the many wounds he had racked up in his lifetime.Even so, he said he had no plans to give up selling newspapers, insisting he would continue zigzagging the city’s streets and cafes as long as he had the energy. “Retirement will have to wait until the cemetery,” he joked.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

By the time he bought a Tesla in 2023, BEVs were no longer a complete oddity inTurkey, making up 7% of new car sales.Fast-forward two years and electric cars are selling so fast that Turkey has caught up with the EU in its rate of adoption. Its market is now the fourth largest in Europe, behind Germany, the UK and France.“A premium product is a thing that makes you happy but that not everyone can have,” said Astarcıoğlu, a mechatronic engineer from Istanbul and the developer of an app to find charging stations. “My Tesla has become an ordinary car over here.”BEVs made up 16.7% of new car sales in Turkey in 2025, just behind the EU’s 17.4%, registration data published on Tuesday shows. While uptake is lower than in the Netherlands or the Nordics, where BEVs make up 35% to 96% of new cars sold, sales in Turkey have raced ahead of almost every country in southern and eastern Europe.Its electric vehicle surge is part of a global trend in which emerging markets from Uruguay to Vietnam are spurning fossil fuel-burning cars at surprising speed. The latest data comes as Turkeyprepares to hostthe UN climate summit, and one month after the EUwatered downits 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.Analysts attribute the boom to a disparity in Turkey’s special consumption tax, which has left electric cars only slightly more expensive than comparable petrol cars. Sales remained high even after the government raised taxes on electric vehicles in August.“Practically speaking, Turkish people don’t buy electric vehicles because it’s eco-friendly,” said Ufuk Alparslan, an analyst at the climate thinktank Ember, saying that running costs were lower for electric cars. “The motivation is purely economical.”Electrifying car fleets is seen as a crucial step to decarbonising the transport sector and reducing pollution, but efforts in many regions have run into roadblocks. In the EU, where planet-heating emissions from cars have risen by 17% since 1990, attempts to phase out combustion engines have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile industry.The Turkish government does not have a dedicated electric vehicle strategy but has championed a domestic carmaker, Togg, which in 2024 overtook Tesla as the country’s leading EV seller. In an interview with Bloomberg HT last week, Togg’s board chair, Fuat Tosyalı, announced plans to increase production from 40,000 cars in 2025 to 60,000 in 2026.Togg’s entry into the market, which was buoyed up by tax support and zero-interest credit from state-owned banks, has helped normalise electric vehicle adoption, said Berkan Bayram, the founder of the Turkish Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. “It gained the heart of Turkish buyers.”Foreign carmakers who must contend with import duties have benefited from the Togg-friendly tax system, with manufacturers including Tesla reducing motor power in Turkey to fall into the same favourable tax bracket. China’s BYD is also jostling for a greater share of the market and plans to build a $1bn factory in Turkey.In addition to the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuel vehicles, the transition to electric mobility could be a geopolitical boon for countries that do not produce oil themselves. Turkey’s car fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2053, sending demand for oil imports soaring, according to areportby InstitutDE, a Turkish diplomatic thinktank in Brussels.While imports will rise in all scenarios studied, a failure to run more cars on electricity would heighten Turkey’s exposure to external shocks, price volatility and geopolitical risks, the report found.However, the recent increase in BEV sales may not herald a systemic shift away from fossil fuel cars. The tax incentives are “very fragile” and can change easily, said Baki Kaya, an economist and former diplomat who co-wrote the InstitutDE report.“It’s not the result of a strategic decision,” he said. “And I’m personally not that optimistic [it will continue].”Analysis from Ember found the overall tax burden on electric cars remained high, with the total tax applied to electric cars in the lowest bracket reaching 50%, and rising to 86% in a higher bracket. Without changes, inflation and exchange rates could soon shrink the number of affordable BEVs, Alparslan said.“Although electric cars have started to become widespread in Turkey, there is still a large, untapped potential to reduce energy imports through renewable energy and electric vehicles,” he said. “Tax policies that keep electric vehicle prices at more affordable levels could accelerate this momentum.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAutomotive industryTurkeyMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

Reed will spend his immediate time on the DP World Tour, where he won the Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday. Reed tees up in Bahrain from Thursday.It would now be only natural for LIV to be anxious about talent drain which once ran in their favour.Rory McIlroy backs Muirfield for Open return despite ‘lowest point’ in 2013Read moreAt Reed’s post-tournament media conference in Dubai he surprisingly revealed he had not yet committed to LIV for this year. He joined the Saudi Arabian‑backed tour in 2022 in a deal worth tens of millions of dollars. In a statement posted on Wednesday, the 2018 Masters winner explained his switch.“After careful thought and consideration, my family and I have decided that I will no longer compete on the LIV Golf Tour,” Reed said. “I am excited to announce that I am returning to thePGA Touras a past champion member for the 2027 season and am eligible to begin competing in PGA Tour events later this year.“I will continue to compete and play as an honorary lifetime ­member on the DP World Tour, which is ­something that I am truly honored and excited to do. I’m a traditionalist at heart, and I was born to play on the PGA Tour.”In its own statement, the PGA Tour said: “Patrick Reed has informed the PGA Tour of his desire to return. A nine-time PGA Tour ­winner, he is seeking reinstatement of his PGA Tour membership for the 2027 season, playing out of the past ­champion category.“As a result of resigning his membership in 2022 prior to violating any PGA Tour regulations, Patrick is ­eligible to compete on the PGA Tour as a non-member beginning on 25 August 2026. He may also pursue improved PGA Tour status via the DP World Tour.”The top 10 players on the DP World Tour’s order of merit, not already exempt, earn PGA Tour cards this year. Koepka was reinstated immediately on the PGA Tour via criteria which applied to major winners from 2022 onwards.The exits of Koepka and Reed leave Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Smith as the most significant ­players on LIV. Attention will turn naturally towards if or when that trio seek to beat a path back towards the PGA Tour.Explore more on these topicsLIV Golf SeriesPGA TourGolfEuropean TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

ESPN said the longtimeNew England Patriotscoach received a call from the Hall of Fame last Friday with the news. According to the report, Belichick said “Six Super Bowls isn’t enough?” when he was told the news.The Hall of Fame declined to comment before its class of 2026 is announced at NFL Honors in San Francisco on 5 February.Bill Belichick’s humiliating college football debut brings only schadenfreude or sadnessRead moreThe report of Belichick’s snub was met with significant criticism and shock consideringhe is widely regardedas one of the greatest coaches of all time. Critics of the snub include Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who posted on social media: “Insane … don’t even understand how this could be possible.”Three-timeNFLdefensive player of the year JJ Watt also expressed his shock. “This has to be some knock-off Hall of Fame or something, it can’t be the actual NFL Hall of Fame,” he wrote on social media. “There is not a single world whatsoever in which Bill Belichick should not be a First-Ballot Hall of Famer.”Tom Brady, who played 20 of his 23 seasons under Belichick, also questioned the decision, calling the omission “completely ridiculous” during an interview with Seattle Sports 710-AM on Wednesday.“I don’t understand it,” Brady said. “I was with him every day. If he’s not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there’s really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, which is completely ridiculous.”Brady added: “There’s no coach I’d rather play for. If I’m picking one coach to win a Super Bowl – give me one season – I’m taking Bill Belichick.”The surprise extended outside the world of football. LeBron James was incensed by the report. “Man there’s no way I read that right! Right? Ain’t no WAY Bill Belichick ain’t 1st Ballot HOF!! That’s IMPOSSIBLE, EGREGIOUS, and quite frankly DISRESPECTFUL!” the Lakers star wrote on social media.Belichick was hired by New England in 2000 and led the franchise to six Super Bowl wins and three other appearances in the title game during an 18-year span from 2001-18. Belichick’s 333 wins in the regular season and playoffs with New England and Cleveland are the second most to Don Shula’s 347. He won AP NFL Coach of the Year three times.Belichick also was one of the game’s top defensive assistants before taking over in New England, winning two earlier Super Bowls as defensive coordinator for the New York Giants.Belichick’s career did have blemishes. He was implicated in a sign-stealing scandal dubbed “Spygate” in the 2007 season and was fined $500,000 after the team was caught filming defensive signals from the New York Jets during a game. According to ESPN, former Colts, Bills and Panthers general manager Bill Polian, a member of the Hall of Fame himself, told other voters that Belichick should be made to “wait a year” before induction as punishment for the Spygate scandal. On Tuesday,Polian saidhe was “95% sure” he had voted for Belichick.Belichick’s tenure in New England ended following the 2023 season. He recently finished his first year coaching in college at North Carolina, whichended in disappointment.Belichick was one of five finalists among senior players who last appeared in a game in 2000 or earlier, coaches and contributors. Patriots owner Robert Kraft was the contributor finalist, with Roger Craig, Ken Anderson and LC Greenwood the players.Between one and three of those finalists will be inducted into the Hall along with between three and five modern-era players from a group of 15 finalists.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew England PatriotsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Pretti’s death was the culmination of a weeks-longcampaign of terrorconducted against residents of the city, includingRenee Good, who was herself killed by DHS forces just two weeks earlier. Indeed, “Operation Metro Surge” in Minneapolis has accounted fortwo-thirds of homicidesin the city in 2026.Of course, Minneapolis has not been the only site of depravity. In 2025,DHS reported a “historic” surge in deportations, gleefully noting that it had removed over 622,000 people from the US. Duringthe same period,32 people died in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, which marked the deadliest year for the agency in its over two decades of operation. In January 2026 alone, atleast nine peoplehave been killed directly by DHS or died in their custody. Additionally, anOctober 2025 investigationrevealed a pattern of sexual assault and forced labour targeting transgender and queer detainees at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center.Removing US as World Cup host would be eminently sad – and entirely justified | Alexander AbnosRead moreIn this context, it is perhaps unsurprising that many current and former athletes followed Haliburton’s lead, includingVictor Wembanyama,Breanna Stewart,Karl-Anthony Towns,Spencer Strider,Isaiah Thomas,De’Aaron Fox,JR SmithandJohn Randle. The NBA Minnesota Timberwolves held amoment of silencefor Pretti, as did the PWHL’sMinnesota Frost. (The Minnesota Wild did not, nor did either NFL conference championship game, despite this practice being deployed bymany teams across the leaguefor Charlie Kirk).Some former athletes offered a rather more depraved perspective, includingChipper Jones, who posted, “Less talk…..more handcuffs!” and noted tied-for-fifth-place college swimmerRiley Gaines, who added: “It’s so easy not to get shot by ICE.”In the aftermath of Pretti’s killing, we spoke to three current and former athletes about their views on the rising tide of American fascism.“I am sickened and outraged by the most recent public executions carried out by the state in Minnesota,” former Harvard and USC women’s basketball star, and Athletes Unlimited player McKenzie Forbes told us. “I think it is representative of the current state of our country that these government officials act with such audacity and impunity in broad daylight. Fascism is here now and if we as the people do not get organized with our neighbors it will only continue to get worse.”View image in fullscreenDoug Baldwin: I would hope that human decency would consider the human toll of these situations.Photograph: Jane Gershovich/Getty ImagesTwo-timeMLBAll-Star Sean Doolittle agreed. “Like so many people, I was horrified and heartbroken as I watched the murder of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti on my phone,” said Doolittle who won the World Series with the Washington Nationals in 2019, and is now a coach with the team.“It doesn’t make it any less infuriating that on some level, this has felt inevitable since the federal surge began in LA and DC last summer. DHS has an incredibly violent history. What we’re seeing play out in our cities feels like the natural progression of militarizing our police forces, providing endless taxpayer dollars at the expense of schools and social safety net programs.“Many people have said that things like this don’t happen in America. But in many ways the violence exhibited by DHS and federal agents mirrors the tactics used by law enforcement in Black and Brown communities for decades. And it’s reminiscent of tragic deaths at the hands of law enforcement – likePhilando Castile– another man who was killed by police during a traffic stop in 2016, just a 15-minute drive from where Alex Pretti was killed.”Forbes echoed this sentiment: “Be wary of state and local level government officials, police departments … trying to separate themselves from ICE,” she said. “They are all a part of the same apparatus that does the dirty work for the ruling class.”Former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin Jr has been saddened, but not surprised, by the violence in Minnesota.“How could you not be upset? I mean, no matter where you land on the political spectrum, I would hope that human decency would consider the human toll of these situations,” said Baldwin, who won the Super Bowl with Seattle in 2013. “… We shouldn’t be surprised though. Human history is riddled with our struggle to live on this planet together. History also gives us a blueprint of how to combat these challenges. In my humble opinion, love, discipline, and endurance towards the struggles currently, and the ones that may or may not come, is what will be necessary. Our ancestors did it, and so I know we will as well.“It does feel bleak, at times, right now. And, sadly, I am expecting it to get worse before it gets better. But I know it will get better.”Doolittle is a little more pessimistic but sees hope in the strength of community. “The problem with the freest country in the world having a masked secret police force that directly serves the President of the United States kidnapping people and disappearing them in a web of for-profit prisons, or executing innocent people on the street with total impunity isn’t that they’re ‘untrained,’ as some politicians have suggested – it’s that it exists at all,” he said.“But despair is not and can never be the answer. What we saw here in DC – community organizers, rapid responders, legal observers, random neighbors and bystanders coming together and stepping up – is what we are seeing in every other city experiencing similar DHS enforcement surges. The stories from other cities of neighbors volunteering to help walk kids to school, getting groceries, doing laundry and walking pets for other community members who are at risk, documenting arrests, working to get information out to families who might not have known that their loved ones were taken.”Doolittle says he has seen ICE activity and knows other athletes will be aware of it too.“Passing national guard tanks on my way into work, seeing agents stationed all around the neighborhood near the stadium. I don’t have a special perspective on this because I’m involved in sports. I have a perspective because I saw it happening in my city to my neighbors,” he said.“And for anyone currently employed in any of our major American sports leagues, most of them have seen it too. Soon we will be hosting athletes from all over the world in the World Baseball Classic, the Olympics,and the World Cup. Those athletes will see it too, and some of them may be at risk.”Baldwin agrees that this moment is significant. “In my humble opinion, we are in another pivotal moment in our human history,” he said. “The path we take here, now, will be determined by how we each show up in the world to influence that path.”View image in fullscreenMcKenzie Forbes: ‘Athletes 100% have a responsibility to speak out against state repression’.Photograph: Tyler Schank/NCAA Photos/Getty ImagesForbes and Baldwin slightly disagree on the responsibility of athletes in this moment.For Forbes, “athletes 100% have a responsibility to speak out against state repression as we have plenty of eyes on us at all times … You force the viewer to reckon with the harsh reality of what we are living through which I think is really important.”Baldwin, on other other hand, believes that “everyone has a responsibility to contribute to our collective consciousness in whatever way they are able to do so. However, that is an individual choice and journey. I try hard not to judge those decisions because those are deeply personal.”Doolittle is most concerned with his own responsibility for players under his charge. “Now that I’m a coach it’s my job to create an environment based on things like trust and mutual respect,” he said. “Major LeagueBaseballis the best baseball league in the world because we have players from all over the globe. I love my guys and I feel protective of my players. It breaks my heart that I can’t keep them safe from getting caught up in these federal operations once they leave the ballpark; that their families can’t visit because it’s too dangerous; because they come from a different part of the world.“Athletes aren’t uniquely positioned to speak on this because they’re in the public eye. But they are uniquely positioned to speak on this because they live and work all over the country and many have seen it themselves.”In the end, Doolittle offered perhaps the most authentic possible distillation of this moment: “I’m really mad so thank you for letting me vent.

ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations team has long worked the Super Bowl and other major sporting events, largely focused on preventing human trafficking and stopping the sale of counterfeit goods, but immigration operations would be unusual.“We have heard from the administration that they intend to have ICE at the Super Bowl. I don’t know how much of that is rhetoric,” Matt Mahan, the San Jose mayor, toldKTVU.‘Fascism is here now’: the US athletes pushing back on Trump’s AmericaRead moreThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to confirm reports about operations around Levi’s Stadium on 8 February, writing in a statement that the agency does “not disclose future operations or discuss personnel”.“DHS is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure theSuper Bowlis safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the World Cup,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin, adding that security for the event would include a response “conducted in-line with the US constitution”.“Those who are here legally and are not breaking other laws have nothing to fear.”The move, which comes as the administration faces mounting criticism over its immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota and the killings of two US citizens by federal agents, has caused concern in the community, particularly for vulnerable families.“It’s going to increase the level of tension and fear in our area,” Peter Ortiz of the San Jose city council told theSan José Spotlight. “We’re already seeing that they are scared to go out to eat, scared to go to the local corner store, scared to send their kids to school.”Corey Lewandowski, an adviser to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, announced last fall that agents would conduct operations during the Super Bowl.“There is nowhere that you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally, not the Super Bowl, and nowhere else,” Lewandowski said on the Benny Johnson podcast. “We will find you, we will apprehend you, we will put you in a detention facility and we will deport you.”Noem also confirmed ICE operations at the game during aninterviewwith that same podcaster.“We’ll be all over that place,” she said. “We’re gonna enforce the law so I think people should not be coming to the Super Bowl unless they are law-abiding Americans who love this country.”The agency has collaborated with theNFLfor two decades, according to a DHS statement, and sent nearly 700 employees to New Orleans last year to aid in security for the event, and “intellectual property enforcement”.But Trump administration officials have derided the NFL as “woke” and criticized the decision to have Bad Bunny perform at this year’s half-time show. The Puerto Rican artist, who will perform along with Green Day,opted not to includeUS stops on his latest tour over concerns his fans could face ICE raids.Donald Trump described the half-time show entertainment this year as a “terrible choice” and said he will not attend the game.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationSuper BowlNFLnewsShareReuse this content"

He has also interviewed for Tampa Bay’s offensive coordinator opening and was tied to the New York Giants offensive coordinator spot after John Harbaugh was named coach.Monken is the seventh coach hired by owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam since they bought the franchise in 2012. The previous six compiled a 73-139-1 regular-season record, the second-worst mark in the NFL over that span. The Browns were 5-12 this season and 8-26 the past two years,despite boasting a strong defense.Cleveland interviewed 10 people for the opening after Kevin Stefanskiwas fired at the start of January.After announcing Stefanski’s firing, Jimmy Haslam bristled over the narrative that the Browns are a dysfunctional organization. However, the coaching search ended up having more people withdraw their names from consideration than finalists during the three-week search.Myles Garrett is having a season for the ages. The Browns are wasting itRead moreGrant Udinski withdrew his name from consideration on Monday to remain in Jacksonville as offensive coordinator. The Browns had second interviews scheduled with Mike McDaniel and Jesse Minter before both canceled. McDaniel, who was Miami’s coach for four seasons, will be the Los Angeles Chargers’ offensive coordinator while Minter was named Baltimore’s head coach after two seasons directing the Chargers’ defense.Monken does have previous history with the Browns, serving as offensive coordinator on Freddie Kitchens’ staff in 2019. He went to the University of Georgia from 2020-22 and was the offensive coordinator when the Bulldogs won the national title in 2021 and 2022.The Ravens were second in the league this season in rushing yards per game (156.6 yards) and 11th in scoring, averaging 24.9 points per game. Baltimore had the league’s top-ranked offense in 2024, when they became the first team inNFLhistory to have at least 4,000 passing yards and 3,000 rushing yards in the same season.Monken’s first priority will be trying to keep Jim Schwartz as defensive coordinator. Schwartz has been the architect of one of the league’s top defenses the past three seasons. Cleveland led the league in total defense in 2023 and ranked fourth this season as Myles Garrett had 23 sacks and broke the NFL single-season record. Schwartz is under contract to Cleveland for one more season, but it remains to be seen what his response will be after being passed over for the head coach position.The bigger task for Monken will be trying to find a quarterback and a sustainable offense. Stefanski started a league-high 13 different quarterbacks during his tenure, including seven over the past two seasons.The Browns thought they had their quarterback in 2022 when they released Baker Mayfield and acquired Deshaun Watson from Houston for five draft picks, including three in the first round. Instead,the trade for Watson has set the Browns back. Watson has played in only 19 games. He has gone 9-10 as Cleveland’s starter with 19 touchdowns, 12 interceptions and an 80.7 passer rating. He did not play this season while rehabbing from a torn achilles tendon.Jimmy Haslam saidduring the league meetings last Marchthat the Browns “took a big swing and miss” with the Watson trade and that “we’ve got to dig ourselves out of that hole.”Shedeur Sanders started the final seven games, going 3-4. He faced growing pains, including a makeshift line and missing the leading rusher and receiver for the last two games. Whether Sanders convinced the Browns that he can start next season will be debated in the coming months.This season’s Browns joined the 1968 Buffalo Bills as the only teams in the Super Bowl era to have rookies lead the team in passing, rushing and receiving yards. Cleveland have the sixth and 24th overall selections in April’s NFL draft.“Let me just say this, the next 120 days are crucial for the organization,” Haslam said on 5 January. “We’ve got to find the right head coach. We’ve got to be efficient again in free agency. We have 10 draft picks, including two number ones. We have four picks in the top three rounds. And we’ve got to get really good players who are really good people again. We’ve got to be opportunistic if trade opportunities come along. We are solely focused on having a great 120 days so we can start winning games around here.”Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

That was exaggerating, obviously, but it would be nice to have some privacy. It would be nice also to have your own process and not always be observed.“I don’t think it should be like that because we’re tennis players, we’re meant to be watched on the court and in the press, that’s our job. It’s not our job to be a meme when you forget your accreditation. It’s funny, for sure, people have something to talk about. But, for us, I don’t think it’s necessary.”Amanda Anisimova said she headed straight for the locker room, where she knew she would not be filmed, after her quarter-final loss to Jessica Pegula. “There are good moments that people see and that’s fun,” the American said.“Then, when you lose, there are probably not-so-good moments. The fact that the video of Coco was posted, it’s tough, because she didn’t have a say in that.”Gauff has been criticised in some quarters for smashing her racket but she was given support by Serena Williams, who posted on X: “Passion. Caring. Matters. Nothing wrong with hating to lose. Now Coco when you want I can show you how to demolish in one swipe … Serena style.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenIga SwiatekTennisAustralia sportCoco GauffnewsShareReuse this content"

But the deal he’s offering looks worse than the old one. Will Congress give Zuffa the power to dominate boxing?Thomas HauserWed 28 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 09.15 ESTShareEvenTurki al-Sheikh’s most severe critics acknowledge that, under his guidance, the Saudi interests that have dominated professional boxing in recent years have paid generous purses to fighters. Now the Saudis have turned to TKO Group Holdings and Dana White to oversee Zuffa Boxing – a newly created vehicle designed to expand the footprint of its equity partners in the United States.ZuffaBoxingis taking a far less generous approach toward fighters than Sheikh did. That’s evidenced by the contract that many of the fighters being recruited by Zuffa are being asked to sign.Almost two dozen people have been interviewed for this article. Some of them asked that they not be mentioned by name out of concern that it could invite retaliation or damage professional relationships. Others had no such reservations. Let’s put the matter in context.Inside Canelo v Crawford and the Saudi-TKO plan to dominate boxing | Thomas HauserRead moreTKO Group Holdings is a sports and entertainment company whose vast portfolio includesUFCand World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). On 6 August of last year, TKO president and COO Mark Shapiro announced:(1) TKO was forming a boxing promotional company called Zuffa Boxing that would be a joint venture between TKO Holdings, the Saudi Arabian General Entertainment Authority, and Sela (a live-experiences and recreational company owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund)(2) Zuffa Boxing would promote approximately 12 “league” fight cards annually for a period of five years(3) TKO would also work with Sheikh to promote several super-fights (such asCanelo v Crawford) each year. The league fights and super-fights would be separate businessesSela owns 60% of Zuffa Boxing and TKO owns 40%.UFC president and CEO Dana White has been charged with overseeing Zuffa Boxing.“I live in my own little bubble,” White told Brian Campbell of CBS Sports. “I’m gonna do my own thing. I’m not worried about what any of those [other promoters] are doing. Those guys don’t think big enough. Those guys all think small. They don’t think the way that I think. My goal is to rebuild boxing in the United States.”Unlike Riyadh Season’s boxing program (which has been written in red ink), Zuffa Boxing is designed to run in the black.On 29 September, Zuffa Boxing and Paramount announced a media rights agreement that makes Paramount+ the “exclusive home of Zuffa Boxing” in the US, Canada and Latin America. “Beginning in January 2026,” the announcement read, “Paramount will exclusively distribute a full slate of Zuffa Boxing events starting with 12 action-packed cards with plans to grow that number in subsequent years. The bouts will be available via Paramount’s direct-to-consumer streaming platform Paramount+, with the potential for select events to be simulcast on CBS and other Paramount platforms.”Paramount is believed to be paying Zuffa Boxing $100m a year for these 12 fight cards.But there’s a potential stumbling block. Zuffa’s boxing program as presently conceived runs afoul of the Professional Boxer Health and Safety Act and the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act (often referred to jointly and referred to herein as the Ali Act). Thus, Zuffa and its allies have launched a massive lobbying effort to change the law.Vergil Ortiz Jr sues Golden Boy in dispute tied to stalled Jaron Ennis talksRead moreThe Ali Act was enacted to curb the power of promoters and others who were exploiting fighters and dominating boxing.The proposed legislation would water down several provisions of the act that currently protect fighters’ interests. More specifically, it would allow for the creation of “unified boxing organizations” (UBOs) as an “alternative system for compliance with the requirements of the Act”. Zuffa Boxing, by virtue of its capitalization and organization, could qualify as a UBO. Most promoters couldn’t.The Ali Act was intended to create, among other things, a firewall between ratings organizations, managers and promoters. The proposed amendment destroys that firewall for UBOs. If the Ali Act is amended, Zuffa Boxing will be able to assume the roles of sanctioning body, promoter, manager and ranking authority. This latter point is significant because Zuffa has indicated that it will tie fighters’ purses directly to its own championships and rankings.The Ali Act requires that promoters make certain financial disclosures to fighters and governing athletic commissions. If the proposed changes become law, fighters would be in the dark as to how much revenue promoters are receiving in conjunction with their fights.The proposed amendments would also eliminate the Ali Act’s protection against “coercive contracts” imposed on fighters. UBOs could exclude boxers who have not signed a long-term contract with them from participating in any of their events.A number of arena operators representing venues such as Madison Square Garden and Crypto.com Arena are supporting the Ali Act amendments. So are various state athletic commission officials.“TKO and Zuffa play hardball,” one state regulator told the Guardian. “And they generate so much revenue from WWE and UFC that no one wants to cross them.”“They’re very good at instilling fear,” another official said.By and large, fighters are wary of the proposed changes. Muhammad Ali’s widow, Lonnie Ali, has supported the amendments. But Ali’s grandson, Nico Ali Walsh (a fighter with 15 pro bouts on his resumé), opposes them.View image in fullscreenIreland’s Callum Walsh, shown here with Dana White during last year’s Canelo v Crawford card, was handpicked to headline Zuffa Boxing 01 earlier this month.Photograph: Steve Marcus/Getty ImagesFormer WBO 140lb champion Chris Algieri spoke for his brethren when he stated, “The Muhammad Ali Act does need changing. But it needs to be expanded and tightening up, not weakened in a way that will harm those who actually fight. Fighters – and I speak from experience – get exploited enough as it is.”Evander Holyfield noted, “The loudest voices pushing for this rewrite aren’t boxers but the promoters of mixed martial arts – the people who made ‘business first, fighters last’ a mega-sport.”And Oscar De La Hoya declared, “The bill would allow promoter-controlled Unified Boxing Organizations to own rankings, titles and fighters essentially duplicating the UFC’s single-entity model inside boxing. It would legalize the very conflicts of interest the original Ali Act was written to outlaw. The Ali Act was one of the few federal laws ever passed to protect athletes rather than corporations. The new legislation would gut that framework, and the open marketplace that keeps the sport honest would collapse into monopoly.”Earlier, De La Hoya had been more blunt, saying, “TKO has been begging for these changes so they can fuck fighters over with their new league.”Dana White’s response to that is to say Zuffa is giving fighters a great opportunity and, “The guys who want to fight under the Muhammad Ali Act exactly the way it is will have that opportunity to do that. Or you can bet on me and fight with me under our version of the Muhammad Ali Act.”But that’s the same as saying fighters had a choice to sign or nor sign with Don King prior to the Ali Act being passed. Economically, fighters are a particularly vulnerable group who need protection.Boxing’s world sanctioning bodies have long been criticised, and appropriately so. High sanctioning fees, questionable rankings and other practices cry out for reform. White played on that theme earlier this year when he told Stephen A Smith, “I’m going to get rid of the sanctioning organizations.”But will Zuffa Boxing be any better?“Zuffa will be a sanctioning body,” one promoter says. “They might not call themselves a sanctioning body. But they’ll be ranking fighters. They’ll be giving out belts. They just won’t take a sanctioning fee because they’ll be making money off fighters in other ways.”France taps out as G7 summit moved to avoid clash with White House UFC eventRead moreTesting for the presence of banned performance enhancing drugs in a fighter’s system is one of the most important issues facing boxing today. The Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (Vada) is widely recognised as the most reliable PED testing entity in boxing. Sheikh, to his credit, has been supportive of Vada and employed its services for most Riyadh Season events.Testifying before Congress in support of amending the Ali Act, UFC senior executive vice-president and chief operating officer Ike Lawrence Epstein referenced Zuffa’s UFC PED-testing program and claimed, “UFC maintains the most effective and progressive anti-doping program in professional sports.”But Epstein’s claim is subject to dispute. When asked about it, one state regulator countered, “How many times since UFC instituted its own PED-testing program has a UFC fight been pulled down or the result of a UFC fight been changed because of a positive test result? Zuffa doesn’t even require that a positive test result be reported to the governing state athletic commission.”In recent years, Jake Hurwitz has been the anti-doping compliance coordinator for UFC. He just left UFC to start his own PED-testing company (Global Sport Anti-Doping). His first client is Zuffa. That doesn’t inspire confidence.Epstein also dropped a clue as to Zuffa Boxing’s intentions during his testimony before Congress when he declared, “The UBO would solve the problem of boxing’s historical lack of a centralized industry organization.”In this instance, a “centralized industry organization” sounds like monopolization.There are several positives in the proposed legislation. For example, the amendments would require that a fighter be paid at least $200 per scheduled round for each fight. But Congress could enact this minimum compensation and leave the rest of the Ali Act in place.On 4 December, the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Workforce Protections held a one-day hearing on the proposed legislation. On 21 January, the Education and Workforce Committee voted to send the bill to the House floor for a full vote. Passage in the House is a foregone conclusion. The Senate has yet to hold hearings. There’s a small chance that the bill could be defeated in the Senate. But it’s likely to pass because monied interests are behind it and there’s no strong interest group in opposition.At the 4 December hearing, Andy Foster (executive officer for the California State Athletic Commission) testified, “Professional boxers need help to achieve labor equity. Another key positive aspect of this bill is that the UBO model shifts the nature of the industry and would be less exploitative to boxers signed to a UBO.”But one of the ways that Zuffa Boxing plans to make money appears to be by lowering labor costs. When asked by the Guardian if he had read the contract that Zuffa is asking fighters to sign, Foster said that he had not.This writer has read the contract. There’s no indication that Zuffa has shared it with members of Congress. But the representative of a fighter who’s being recruited by Zuffashared it with the Guardian.The first few pages of the contract reference the number of bouts the fighter would be contracting for, the length of the contract term, and the purse for each fight. That’s followed by 31 pages of “Standard Terms and Conditions”.The purses paid by Zuffa will differ from fighter to fighter depending on who the fighter is and variables such as whether or not the fight is for a Zuffa Boxing championship. Some fighters will be guaranteed three fights a year; others two. Some of the standard terms and conditions may be negotiable. Others aren’t.The Zuffa Boxing contracts are similar in some respects to the contracts used by other major boxing promoters. In other respects, they go further and make Don King’s contracts of old look fighter-friendly. These contracts offer a window into how Zuffa will treat boxers if the proposed Ali Act amendments are enacted into law.The contract is between the fighter and Zuffa Boxing but envisions that an entity called TKO Boxing Promotions will be the promoter of record for most of the fights and that fighters will enter into bout agreements with TKO for each of their fights.Zuffa is given the exclusive unrestricted worldwide right to secure, promote and present all of the fighter’s bouts and related activities during the term of the contract. During that time, the fighter is prohibited from participating in any other boxing, mixed martial arts, professional wrestling or other combat sport competition or exhibition.Zuffa has an obligation to offer a specified minimum number of bouts to the fighter during each year of the contract term. But unlike most promoter-boxer contracts which call for opponents to be mutually agreed upon, the Zuffa contract states, “Bout opponents are to be designated by Zuffa Boxing (subject to Fighter approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).” If the fighter declines to take a fight that Zuffa offers him, it counts against one of the fights that Zuffa is obliged to offer him that year.Worse, Zuffa’s standard terms and conditions state, “If at any time during the Term, Fighter claims to be injured or temporarily disabled, Zuffa Boxing may, at its election, for each such injury or disability claimed by Fighter, declare that Zuffa Boxing has satisfied its obligation to offer one of the Bouts hereunder, without any compensation due to Fighter for said Bout.” The proposed amendment to the Ali Act walks that back a bit and would require Zuffa to pay the fighter $2,000 unless the fighter was already collecting insurance money (for example, worker’s compensation for an on-the-job injury).The Zuffa contract further provides that, if a fighter has an undercard bout and the main event is postponed or cancelled, Zuffa can pull the fighter’s fight down without any payment obligation to the undercard fighter.The contract also gives Zuffa numerous “ancillary” and “marketing” rights, including the unrestricted worldwide right to use the fighter’s “identity” to promote “Zuffa Boxing, the Zuffa Boxing brand, Zuffa Boxing Content and each Zuffa Boxing Event” and to “promote any product or service of a Zuffa Boxing affiliate, licensee, sponsor or content distributor”.“Zuffa Boxing event” is broadly defined to include the bouts, pre-bout events, post-bout events, promotional appearances, “Personal Data Capture Services”, and other activities arising out of services performed by the fighter pursuant to the terms of the contract.“Zuffa boxing content” extends to any element of the fighter’s identity in connection with the Zuffa Boxing Events and any other programming produced or created by or on behalf of Zuffa Boxing from the effective date of the contract through the end of the term.Merchandise is divided into two categories:“Event Merchandise”is any merchandise or other product derived from, created, used, or sold in conjunction with any Zuffa Bouts, Pre-Bout Events or Post-Bout Events“Merchandise” without the “event” qualifier is all other merchandiseMerchandise runs the gamut from apparel to banners, buttons, posters, jewellery, photographs, souvenirs, toys, collectibles, casino games, trading cards and memorabilia items.Depending on whether the item is event merchandise or other merchandise, the fighter will receive either 15% of gross revenue received by Zuffa or 30% of net revenue. “Gross revenue” and “net revenue” can become exponentially smaller when filtered through a maze of companies with common ownership.Try telling Peyton Manning or Patrick Mahomes that they’ll receive only 15% of the gross revenue paid for their name on an endorsement deal with Nationwide or State Farm.The contract pays special attention to video games, giving Zuffa, in its sole discretion, the exclusive worldwide right to use the fighter’s identity in connection with the creation, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of video games by Zuffa or licensed third parties. The fighter’s identity includes, among other things, the fighter’s “moves, acts, gestures, vocalizations or physical performance during a bout or when otherwise captured at Zuffa Boxing’s reasonable request”.Other rights given to Zuffa extend to the sale of virtual reality, augmented reality, hyper-reality, artificial intelligence, and enhanced reality games and experiences as well as motion pictures.Many of these rights, while not exclusive beyond the term of the contract, extend non-exclusively in perpetuity.The contract requires that fighters wear only equipment and the uniform approved by Zuffa during fights as well as at pre-bout and post-bout events. Zuffa shall have the right to include any logo, name, brand, advertising, or informational material of its choosing of the uniform and equipment. The fighter cannot incorporate any of these elements on his equipment or uniform without Zuffa’s prior written approval (and at Zuffa’s sole discretion).The fighter must make promotional appearances to help market the Zuffa brand, Zuffa events, and Zuffa merchandise including appearances at press conferences, interviews and other sponsorship and promotional activities “as reasonably requested” by Zuffa. The timing of these appearances is to be mutually agreed upon by the fighter and Zuffa with the fighter’s consent “not to be unreasonably withheld”. Zuffa will arrange and pay for round-trip air fare and hotel accommodations for the fighter and a per diem for meals in conjunction with these appearances. But it will not be required to pay the fighter for the appearance itself.Zuffa even gets a range of rights relating to any tattoos that the fighter may have on his body.The fighter must arrive on site for his bouts at a time designated by Zuffa (which can be as much as eight days before the bout) and depart the lodging provided by Zuffa prior to the designated checkout time on the day after the fight.The fighter will be provided with four tickets to each of his bouts. But if the fight is at the Meta Apex arena in Las Vegas, these tickets will only be good for his fight, not the entire card, unless the fighter is in the main event.There’s a long list of expensive medical tests that the fighter must undergo. However, the contract states in solid capital letters, “ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION AND TESTS SHALL BE PAID BY FIGHTER.”There are also mechanisms by which Zuffa can extend the contract well past its original term.If a fighter is offered a bout against an opponent designated by Zuffa and does not accept that Bout “because the Fighter is unwilling or unreasonably refuses to compete for any reason whatsoever”, Zuffa may, at its election for each such declination, extend the contract term for “the length of time sufficient to find a new opponent to accept the Bout for up to a maximum of six months”.If at any time during the contract term, a fighter is unable to compete (for example, if the fighter is “disabled, sick or injured; incarcerated; [his licence is] suspended or revoked by an Athletic Commission or anti-doping authority; or Fighter’s ability to travel is restricted by a governmental agency”), for each such period, the contract term shall automatically be extended for the longer of the period of time that fighter is unable to compete (as determined by Zuffa after consultation with fighter) or six months.If a fighter is scheduled to fight and the bout is postponed for any reason other than Zuffa’s or TKO’s non-performance (for example, if the opponent is injured), Zuffa may extend the term of the fighter’s contract by the number of days between the date originally scheduled for the bout and the date on which the bout subsequently occurs.If the fighter is a Zuffa Boxing “champion” at the end of the term, the term shall automatically be extended for one year or until the fighter has participated in three more Zuffa Boxing bouts (whichever eventuality occurs first).A recent change to the proposed Ali Act amendments in committee in the House provides that the contract term imposed on a fighter may not exceed six years. Six years is a long time for a fighter.Meanwhile, Zuffa’s rights may be locked in. But the fighter has very little job security. Zuffa has the right to terminate the contract and any bout agreement in effect if any of the following occur:(1) The fighter is “not declared the winner of any boxing bout by the athletic commission.” In other words, if the fighter loses or draws or the bout is declared “no contest”, Zuffa can cut the fighter. So let’s assume that Zuffa has a fighter it wants to cut. Zuffa can match him against an opponent who is way over the fighter’s head. If the fighter, as expected, loses, Zuffa can cut him. And if he declines the fight, Zuffa can, without payment, count the declination against its contractual obligation to the fighter. Zuffa can also cut a fighter if the fighter makes two successive declinations.(2) Zuffa can cut a fighter if Zuffa Boxing is “dissolved, ceases to operate, or discontinues the weight class or division that fighter participates in”.(3) Zuffa can cut a fighter if the fighter is injured or disabled. Alternatively, if the fighter decides to retire or is permanently disabled at any time during the contract term, Zuffa may, at its election, suspend the contract term for the period of such retirement or disability (said suspension not to exceed four years). During the suspension period, Zuffa’s merchandise rights would remain in effect.(4) Zuffa can cut a fighter if the fighter is charged with a felony or misdemeanor (other than a minor traffic offence); if the fighter’s licence to participate in bouts is suspended or revoked by an athletic commission; if the fighter violates Zuffa’s Athlete Conduct Policy; or if the fighter or any of the fighter’s affiliates materially breaches or defaults on any provision of the contract.View image in fullscreenDana White watches the undercard of last year’s Canelo v Crawford card alongside Turki al-Sheikh.Photograph: Chris Unger/TKO Worldwide LLC/Getty ImagesThe proposed Ali Act amendments that have been reported out of the House committee would specifically allow a fighter to begin negotiations with another UBO or promoter during the 30 days preceding expiration of the fighter’s contract with Zuffa. But the Zuffa contract would give Zuffa six months to match the material financial terms of any competing offer for the fighter’s services on the same financial terms as the competing offer or any later modified offer made to the fighter.UFC has been plagued by class actions in the past and, without admitting wrongdoing, recently paid $375mto settle an antitrust lawsuitbrought against it by UFC fighters who claimed that they were illegally exploited by the company.The Zuffa Boxing contract provides in part, “To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the parties agree that no claims may be initiated or maintained on a class action, collective action, or representative action basis either in court or arbitration.”The contract precludes the fighter from seeking any consequential, incidental, or punitive damages from Zuffa, nor shall the fighter have the right to seek an injunction or other equitable relief.It requires that the fighter relinquish the right to sue Zuffa in state or federal court and submit any claim he may have against Zuffa to binding arbitration in Clark County, Nevada.In the event that either side engages counsel “in connection with the enforcement or interpretation” of the contract, the prevailing party would be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party regardless of whether or not a legal action is filed.These provisions would make it impractical for a fighter to institute litigation against Zuffa.The fighter would have the right at his sole cost and expense to audit Zuffa’s books to see if he’s getting an honest accounting with regard to merchandise sold pursuant to the contract. But Zuffa must be given 30 days advance notice of the audit, which can only be conducted by “a reputable licensed and certified public accounting firm approved by Zuffa Boxing”.The contract also states, “Fighter additionally agrees that, if Fighter chooses to undertake any training activities or preparation for Bouts, such activities and/or preparation for Bouts will not take place in California.”Apparently, California law would protect Zuffa’s fighters in a manner that’s not to Zuffa’s liking. The Guardian reached out to Dana White for comment regarding the Zuffa Boxing contract but he was unavailable to respond on short notice.Originally, there was ambitious talk from Zuffa about a boxing “league” that would divide 200 of the best male boxers in the world – women weren’t included in the plan – into 12 weight classes. But the “best” boxers in the world (as well as their promoters and managers) wouldn’t commit to a plan that was clearly against their best interests.Thus, Zuffa shifted its focus from established stars to what it calls “exciting young prospects”.On 23 January, Zuffa launched its Paramount+ series at the Meta Apex with a fight card denominated “Zuffa Boxing 01”. The main commentating team consisted of blow-by-blow commentator Joe Tessitore with Max Kellerman and Andre Ward as analysts. Three fights were streamed during the main portion of the card. There was a lot of shilling and more sizzle than steak.Kellerman began his commentary with “I’ve waiting for this moment my whole life, since I was a little kid.” But in truth, the show had no more to recommend it than an average club-fight card.The opening bout – Julian Rodriguez v Cain Sandoval – was a good one. The fighters were evenly matched. Rodriguez won a 99-91, 99-91, 98-92 decision but had to work hard for it.Then things fell apart.Dana White has said repeatedly that boxing fans are tired of A-side-v-B-side fights where the B-side is, in effect, a designated loser with virtually no chance to win. But the next two bouts were A-side-v-B-side fights.Misael Rodriguez was a 6-to-1 favourite over Austin Deanda in a fight that matched an Olympic bronze medalist from Mexico against a guy from Virginia who had no amateur fights before turning pro. After four dreary rounds, Deanda said he was suffering from double vision and the fight was stopped.The main event matched Callum Walsh against journeyman Carlos Ocampo. Ocampo had fought three step-up fights in his career and lost all of them, two by first-round knockout. Walsh (like Misael Rodriguez) was a 6-to-1 favourite.It was a painfully boring fight. Ocampo is a one-dimensional boxer and fought like it in a 10-round sparring session. In round six, he hit Walsh on the back of the shoulder; Walsh’s left glove touched the canvas; and referee Allen Huggins called it a knockdown. Otherwise, Walsh won every minute of the fight. Neither fighter pushed the pace. Ocampo wasn’t very good. And neither was Walsh, who won a 98-90, 98-90, 97-91 decision.At the post-event press conference, White declared, “The fights were great.” (They weren’t.) But in the next sentence, he acknowledged, “We got a lot of work to do.”As for what comes next; Zuffa Boxing has announced that its second fight card will feature Jose Valenzuela v Diego Torres at the Meta Apex on 1 February. Valenzuela has lost three of his last five fights but opened as a 7-to-1 favourite. That will be followed by a 13 February card headlined by Efe Ajagba v Charles Martin. Martin, a 6-to-1 underdog, will be 40 years old in April and has won only two fights over the past six years. Ajagba, 31, lost his one step-up fight (against Frank Sanchez). These are not “exciting young prospects”.Sheikh set a high standard for the quality of Riyadh Season and Ring fight cards. These fights fall short of that standard.“Do you realize what a bad look this is,” asks a promoter who does business with Sheikh. “Max Kellerman calls Dana White the greatest combat sports promoter of his lifetime and [WWE president] Nick Khan the most effective executive he’s ever known and says that boxing was saved the dayTurki al-Sheikhwas born. And then, for its launch, Zuffa Boxing has Callum Walsh against Carlos Ocampo as the main event with Diego Torres against Jose Valenzuela and Efe Ajagba against Charles Martin after that. Come on!”Meanwhile, there are signs that the relationship between White and Sheikh is fraying.“His Excellency and Dana White both have big egos,” a promoter who knows both men says. “Those egos aren’t getting any smaller. And they’re clashing.”Be that as it may, White insists Zuffa Boxing is in this for the long run. He has a substantial war chest and believes that fans who support UFC will support the Zuffa Boxing brand once the proposed amendments to the Ali Act become law.And the same promoter warns, “The Saudis have a substantial equity interest in Dazn and substantial influence over what it does. Most of the major promoters have been pushed to Dazn and are now dependent on it. What happens to these promoters if Dazn exits from boxing and isn’t there for them? Most if not all of these promoters will be out of business and it will be just Zuffa. Dana has built UFC at the expense of the fighters. And once Zuffa has control, he’ll do the same thing here. Anybody who thinks differently, doesn’t have a clue. It’s UFC 2.0. That’s the plan. You can see it.”With that in mind, another promoter who has done business with Sheikh says: “I don’t like what Zuffa is doing. They’re throwing the baby out with the bath water. They might change a few things for the better. But what they’re planning will destroy the best parts of boxing culture and wipe out some of boxing’s best traditions. And there’s another thing that bothers me. Competition is good. I like that Zuffa is bringing competition to change the business. The problem is, once Zuffa changes the business, it will want to kill all the competitors.”And once the competitors are gone, fighters’ purses are likely to get smaller.Zuffa currently pays 17% to 20% of its revenue to UFC combatants. In the NFL and NBA, the players receive 50%. In boxing at the elite level, the number is often in the neighbourhood of 80%, although that percentage is diminished by the share paid to a fighter’s manager and trainer, sanctioning-body fees and other costs. Also, there are far more poorly paid club fighters than there are well paid elite ones.That said, the long-term outlook for boxers under a Zuffa Boxing regime isn’t good.“Trust me,” an executive who has done business with TKO says. “The boxers will be treated the same as UFC fighters when it comes to the financial split. Anybody who thinks differently doesn’t know what they’re thinking about. Zuffa’s main business is UFC. And Dana isn’t about to jeopardize the UFC business model that made them all rich.”As noted above, without admitting wrongdoing, UFC recently paid $375m to settle an antitrust class action brought against it by fighters who alleged that they had been illegally exploited by the company. A second class action that raises similar issues is pending. That, coupled with the proposed Zuffa Boxing contract, doesn’t sound like an organization that puts fighters first.During the past year, the dominant political forces in the US have systematically enriched their wealthy patrons by tearing apart the safety nets that protect vulnerable Americans. If the proposed boxing legislation currently before Congress is enacted, the next beneficiaries of this largesse will be TKO Group Holdings and its equity partners. The long-term victims are likely to be boxing fans, other promoters and professional boxers.Thomas Hauser’s email address isthomashauserwriter@gmail.com.

The US president has recently threatened to take Greenland by force and called Europe“weak” and “decaying”.Goretzka, who hopes to make the Germany squad for the World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico this summer, toldDie Zeit: “Of course, I’m aware of the political debates. I still expect it to be a great tournament – it will promote football there, and show many people want an incredibly exciting game.Donald Trump makes us feel not only German but also European.”Removing US as World Cup host would be eminently sad – and entirely justified | Alexander AbnosRead moreThe Bayern Munich midfielder is convinced Europe can show where the power lies on the pitch in June and July. “In the most important game in the world, we are still ahead of all other continents,” he said. “Far from being left behind, Europe will show everyone what it’s made of on the pitch.”Trump lashed out at Europe in December, threatening to stop supporting Ukraine and also saying: “If it keeps going the way it’s going, Europe will not be … in my opinion … many of those countries will not be viable countries any longer. Their immigration policy is a disaster.” In January, he threatened to annex Greenland and said inDavos last weekthat he would not use force. “All the US is asking for is a place called Greenland,” he said. “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember.”The 30-year-old Goretzka has previously spoken out on racism, diversity and the climate crisis, but has become more careful in his public statements in recent years. “When you speak out as a sportsperson you take a risk,” he said. “You have to be winning, otherwise these commitments count against you, are deliberately misunderstood or misquoted.”Germany face Curaçao in Houston, Côte d’Ivoire in Toronto and Ecuador in New Jersey in the World Cup group stage. Goretzka is back in the team after the coach, Julian Nagelsmann, dropped him forEuro 2024on home soil. “A discussion [with the coach] was necessary, it was the basis for further cooperation,” he said. “I don’t need to mention how hard that missed opportunity hit me.”View image in fullscreenLeon Goretzka during Bayern Munich’s 2-1 home defeat against Augsburg at the Allianz Arena last Saturday.Photograph: S Mellar/FC Bayern/Getty ImagesThe former Schalke player has six months on his Bayern contract and is considering a move abroad, having only ever played inGermany. “It would be exciting to go abroad during my career,” he said. “I’m in my comfort zone in Munich. Taking a step out of that would also be a step towards my personal development. Getting to know something new would enrich my life.”The Premier League could be an option, he says: “There are a lot of people who think my style of football would be a very good fit for England. I will listen to everything and weigh it up carefully. I am looking forward to the talks.” Goretzka is not ruling out staying in Munich, having regained his place under Vincent Kompany.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026GermanyWorld CupDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

All over the place during a wretched first half, an inspired comeback hadChelseacelebrating at full time. They had looked to Palmer for inspiration and, although the attacker was kept in reserve until the second half, he did enough during his time on the pitch to show why Chelsea have responded to suggestions that their main man is pining for a return to Manchester by branding him untouchable.It was a cutting cameo from the player whose virtuoso brilliance downed Paris Saint-Germainin the Club World Cup finallast summer. Introduced with Chelsea 2-1 down against Napoli and staring at the prospect of a two-leg playoff to reach the last 16 of the Champions League, Palmer was minimalistic but impactful. The 23-year-old’s presence alone was enough to restore order and, even if he is still not in peak condition, his first assists of a season disrupted by an array of niggles were a reminder of what Chelsea have been missing while their best player has been recovering from nagging groin and thigh complaints.‘A great marker’: Rosenior lauds young Chelsea side for comeback win at NapoliRead morePalmer’s cameo was notable for its poise, calm and accuracy. He was involved when Chelsea pulled it back to 2-2, drifting in from the right to tee up João Pedro for a ­barnstorming equaliser.Napoli, who needed a win to avoid a humiliating early exit, were stung. They left themselves open as they chased a third goal and were caught out again when Palmer slid a beautiful pass through to João Pedro, whose second goal of the night ensured that Chelsea finished the league phase in sixth place.It was not straightforward. For Antonio Conte, though, Napoli’s elimination was a continuation of his dreadful European record. The Italian champions tired in the second half and Conte, the last manager to lead Chelsea to the Premier League title, had no way of responding when Rosenior made a series of smart alterations.Quick GuideChampions League: draw dates and playoff pathsShowPlayoff roundThe teams ranked 9th-24th will contest the playoff round, with Friday's draw determining which team from each pair below will go into which path. There are no national exclusions so, for example, Monaco will be drawn against either PSG or Newcastle, with Qarabag playing the other team.Silver path:(21) Monaco or Qarabag (22) v (11) PSG or Newcastle (12)(19) Club Brugge or Galatasaray (20) v (13) Juventus or Atlético (14)(23) Bodø/Glimt or Benfica (24) v (9) Real Madrid or Inter (10)(17) Dortmund or Olympiakos (18) v (15) Atalanta or Leverkusen (16)Blue path:(22) Qarabag or Monaco (21) v (12) Newcastle or PSG (11)(20) Galatasaray or Club Brugge (19) v (14) Atlético or Juventus (13)(24) Benfica or Bodø/Glimt (23) v (10) Inter or Real Madrid (9)(18) Olympiakos or Dortmund (17) v  (16) Leverkusen or Atalanta (15)Potential last 16 tiesAfter the playoffs are completed on 24-25 Feb, the last 16 draw will take place on 27 Feb. It will work in a similar way, with each playoff winner paired with a team who qualified automatically by finishing in the top eight. The path to the final in Budapest on 30 May will then be set.Silver path:Monaco/Qarabag/PSG/Newcastle v (5) Barcelona or Chelsea (6)Brugge/Gala/Juve/Atlético v (3) Liverpool or Tottenham (4)Bodø/Benfica/Madrid/Inter v (7) Sporting or Manchester City (8)Dortmund/Olympiakos/Atalanta/Leverkusen v (1) Arsenal or Bayern (2)Blue path:Qarabag/Monaco/Newcastle/PSG v (6) Chelsea or Barcelona (5)Gala/Brugge/Juve/Atlético v (4) Tottenham or Liverpool (3)Benfica/Bodø/Madrid/Inter v (8) Manchester City or Sporting (7)Olympiakos/Dortmund/Leverkusen/Atalanta v (2) Bayern or Arsenal (1)Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Rosenior had bungled his starting lineup. He matched Conte’s 3-4-2-1 system and explained that he wanted to go man for man but Chelsea were confused before half-time. Wesley Fofana was the only recognised centre-back in the team – a curious decision given that Rosenior had four defenders on the bench – there was plenty of space behind Chelsea’s wing-backs during the first half.Pedro Neto and Malo Gusto struggled. Behind when Juan Jesus handled a Reece James free-kick and Enzo Fernández put Chelsea in front from the spot in the 19th ­minute, Napoli responded in style. They swept forward and equalised through a fine solo goal from Antonio ­Vergara, who held off a challenge from Moisés Caicedo and turned beyond Fofana before driving a low shot past Robert Sánchez.View image in fullscreenAntonio Vergara (second right) scored a superb solo goal to equaliser for Napoli.Photograph: Ciro De Luca/ReutersIt was Napoli’s first goal from open play in the competition this season. Conte had said they were in a state of emergency because of their injury problems. They have lacked creativity without Kevin De Bruyne, absent since October with a torn hamstring, but they repeatedly picked Chelsea apart. Scott McTominay was dominant in midfield and was not the only former Manchester United player who caught the eye. Rasmus Højlund was also in the mood and put Napoli in front when he darted beyond Fofana to turn Mathias ­Olivera’s cross in from close range.Chelsea were arguing among themselves when the first half ended. Rosenior responded by replacing Neto with Palmer. Napoli sat back in an attempt to protect their lead. There was a lot of possession for Chelsea at the start of the second half but the challenge was making it count in the final third.There was no sign of an improvement from the visitors as the hour approached. It felt as if Rosenior was owning up to a tactical error when he removed Gusto for Trevoh Chalobah, who moved alongside Fofana in ­central defence. Jamie Gittens was also introduced on the left. Andrey Santos, the young Brazilian, made way in midfield. The setup felt more conventional. Estêvão moved to No 10, ­Fernández dropped next to Caicedo in midfield and Chelsea found their flow. Palmer stirred. His flick found João Pedro and the ­forward drew Chelsea level by ripping an ­outrageous shot past Alex Meret from 25 yards.Mohamed Salah back among the goals as Liverpool thrash QarabagRead moreThe goal meant Napoli were on their way out. They had to push again. Romelu Lukaku, just back from a long-term injury, came on to face his old side. Yet Chelsea would not be haunted by their past.They waited for Napoli to commit players forward. Their patience was rewarded when Palmer released João Pedro, who raced away, swerved right and ­finished emphatically.Sánchez denied Lukaku a late equaliser. Napoli were beaten at home for the first time since December 2024.Chelsea, with their first away win at this level since October 2022, had silenced some of the noise about their inexperience.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal819242Bayern Munich814213Liverpool812184Tottenham Hotspur810175Barcelona88166Chelsea87167Sporting86168Man City86169Real Madrid891510Inter Milan881511PSG8101412Newcastle8101413Juventus841314Atletico Madrid821315Atalanta801316Bayer Leverkusen8-11217Borussia Dortmund821118Olympiacos8-41119Club Brugge8-21020Galatasaray8-21021Monaco8-61022Qarabag FK8-81023Bodo/Glimt8-1924Benfica8-2925Marseille8-3926AE Pafos8-3927Union Saint Gilloise8-9928PSV80829Athletic Bilbao8-5830Napoli8-6831Copenhagen8-9832Ajax8-13633Eintracht Frankfurt8-11434Slavia Prague8-14335Villarreal8-13136FC Kairat8-151Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNapoliChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They will now enter the knockout phase in the last two weeks of February, as had always seemed likely, to face either Qarabag or Monaco. More surprisingly,Paris Saint-Germainwill join them there after some late score-ticker malarkey nudged them out of the top eight.Champions League: goals and action from all 18 matches in league phase finale – liveRead moreHowe will take great heart from this performance, as a weakened team recovered from a start that suggested the ceiling might be about to fall in. As for PSG, the rest of Europe will look at the reigning champions with a little less fear. Vitinha remains a wonderful midfield controller, but the furious full-court press that marked last season’s post-Christmas run was absent here. Newcastle were compact, quick in the transitions, and really could have won this game in the second half.Paris had been a lovely deep languid grey all afternoon, the only city that looks better in drab, sad January light. By kick-off the Parc des Princes was the usual inferno of choreographed noise. But this was a confusingly poised final group phase game at the start, neither fully alive nor fully dead.Quick GuideChampions League: draw dates and playoff pathsShowPlayoff roundThe teams ranked 9th-24th will contest the playoff round, with Friday's draw determining which team from each pair below will go into which path. There are no national exclusions so, for example, Monaco will be drawn against either PSG or Newcastle, with Qarabag playing the other team.Silver path:(21) Monaco or Qarabag (22) v (11) PSG or Newcastle (12)(19) Club Brugge or Galatasaray (20) v (13) Juventus or Atlético (14)(23) Bodø/Glimt or Benfica (24) v (9) Real Madrid or Inter (10)(17) Dortmund or Olympiakos (18) v (15) Atalanta or Leverkusen (16)Blue path:(22) Qarabag or Monaco (21) v (12) Newcastle or PSG (11)(20) Galatasaray or Club Brugge (19) v (14) Atlético or Juventus (13)(24) Benfica or Bodø/Glimt (23) v (10) Inter or Real Madrid (9)(18) Olympiakos or Dortmund (17) v  (16) Leverkusen or Atalanta (15)Potential last 16 tiesAfter the playoffs are completed on 24-25 Feb, the last 16 draw will take place on 27 Feb. It will work in a similar way, with each playoff winner paired with a team who qualified automatically by finishing in the top eight. The path to the final in Budapest on 30 May will then be set.Silver path:Monaco/Qarabag/PSG/Newcastle v (5) Barcelona or Chelsea (6)Brugge/Gala/Juve/Atlético v (3) Liverpool or Tottenham (4)Bodø/Benfica/Madrid/Inter v (7) Sporting or Manchester City (8)Dortmund/Olympiakos/Atalanta/Leverkusen v (1) Arsenal or Bayern (2)Blue path:Qarabag/Monaco/Newcastle/PSG v (6) Chelsea or Barcelona (5)Gala/Brugge/Juve/Atlético v (4) Tottenham or Liverpool (3)Benfica/Bodø/Madrid/Inter v (8) Manchester City or Sporting (7)Olympiakos/Dortmund/Leverkusen/Atalanta v (2) Bayern or Arsenal (1)Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A draw could have taken both teams through automatically, albeit pending a vast number of variables elsewhere. There are so many referred problems when you mess with the robustness of a format, and once again this rejigged first phase had been a meander towards a wildly convoluted final night. Straight-line jeopardy is too much to expect. But it should at least be possible to understand what’s going on before the whole thing falls on your head in the final wash-up like the contents of an over-stuffed cupboard.Howe made five changes here fromSunday’s defeat against Aston Villa, the net effect of which was a switch to a back three. And PSG swarmed all over Newcastle from the start. With 45 seconds gone they were awarded a penalty. Lewis Miley chased Bradley Barcola back towards goal. The ball bobbled up and hit Barcola’s elbow before brushing Miley’s hand. This was deemed a penalty after a screen check. Ousmane Dembélé’s kick was well saved by Nick Pope. It felt right. The penalty was a very soft call.With seven minutes gone it was 1-0 all the same. The goal was made by a thrust down the right from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who danced Dan Burn around a little before easing a pass inside to Vitinha, who had time to ease to his left, gently sit Lewis Hall down, then curl a shot into the corner.View image in fullscreenNick Pope saved Ousmane Dembélé’s early penalty.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPADembélé might have added a second four minutes later as Newcastle’s backline was repeatedly picked apart by some fine-point passing. For a while they looked horribly porous on the right, where Barcola and the roving Dembélé presented a nightmarish prospect for Miley in a try-it-and-see wing-back role.With 20 minutes gone Newcastle had settled. Nick Woltemade had a first real chance on 40 minutes but failed to make contact with a header after a long throw (meet: the Premier League). And it was a similar aerial route that led to Newcastle’s equaliser just before half-time. The ball was pumped into the box by Sandro Tonali, headed up in the air awkwardly by Marquinhos, flicked back by Burn and nodded in neatly by Joe Willock.Newcastle looked the more dangerous team at the start of the second half. Miley showed huge resilience to settle and find his angles on the right. PSG seemed to stall a little. Without the full three-man midfield press they lack a little fury and craft. Barcola did his Barcola thing, dancing, gliding, pirouetting through the Newcastle defence, then spanking a shovel-footed shot towards the upper tiers.Howe sent on Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes with 22 minutes to go and Newcastle standing ninth in the mega-table on current scorelines, PSG still just inside the magic eight. Howe’s front five pressed really high at times. Woltemade dropped deep between Barnes and Gordon and showed his best qualities as a gangling link-man, beanpole playmaker, No 10 manque.Luis Enrique had spoken before the game about Newcastle’s physicality, but only in terms of how this makes it even more vital to control the game, take the ball away, meet muscle with craft. Here though Newcastle were compact and smart on the break as this half-alive final game began to throb with late-breaking vigour.Towards the end PSG found themselves fumbling for the throttle again as news seeped through of late goals for Inter that dropped them into the playoff spots. Vitinha spanked the ball just over the bar. Overall PSG had 25 shots to Newcastle’s seven. But they left the pitch to whistles from the home crowd, and with a notable case of aura-depletion in the air.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal819242Bayern Munich814213Liverpool812184Tottenham Hotspur810175Barcelona88166Chelsea87167Sporting86168Man City86169Real Madrid891510Inter Milan881511PSG8101412Newcastle8101413Juventus841314Atletico Madrid821315Atalanta801316Bayer Leverkusen8-11217Borussia Dortmund821118Olympiacos8-41119Club Brugge8-21020Galatasaray8-21021Monaco8-61022Qarabag FK8-81023Bodo/Glimt8-1924Benfica8-2925Marseille8-3926AE Pafos8-3927Union Saint Gilloise8-9928PSV80829Athletic Bilbao8-5830Napoli8-6831Copenhagen8-9832Ajax8-13633Eintracht Frankfurt8-11434Slavia Prague8-14335Villarreal8-13136FC Kairat8-151Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He had to take a later flight to make thisChampions Leaguegame and he was plainly determined to make his mark on it.Kolo Muani was once a hero to the Eintracht fans, scoring prolifically for them in the 2022-23 season. They were not happy to see him back and booed his every touch. The best one was that with which he broke the deadlock just after half-time to set Spurs fair for another win in this competition and a fast track to the last 16.Champions League: goals and action from all 18 matches in league phase finale – liveRead moreThomas Frankleft his domestic troublesin London. The under fire manager can reflect with pride at his team’s performances in Europe – even if Frankfurt were dismally off-colour. They are in crisis after a run of poor form led them to sack their manager, Dino Toppmöller. Things have not improved under the interim Dennis Schmitt. Eintracht already knew they had no chance of qualifying for the playoff round. They played like it. The difference in physical terms between the teams was stark.Kolo Muani’s goal was a well-taken volley; the loanee’s only other goals for Spurs were the twohe scored against his parent club, Paris Saint-Germain, earlier in the competition. The result never felt in doubt. Spurs were far superior and Dominic Solanke, who Frank used as a substitute to manage his load, made sure of it towards the end with a low finish into the far corner.Frank has fought fires on so many fronts and he went into battle here with only 11 established outfield players. It was difficult to argue the case for Spurs having made advances on the medical side as nine players were out injured. A further clutch were ineligible in Europe; a consequence of uneven recruitment.View image in fullscreenDominic Solanke doubles the lead for Tottenham.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/ReutersThere was snowfall in the countdown to kick-off, the temperature around freezing and the Eintracht diehards were keen to turn up the volume. Their support was non-stop and magnificent. Spurs cut through it all. It was a performance of control, Frank sticking with his 3-4-2-1 formation, having asked the fit-again João Palhinha to play at right centre-half, and being rewarded.What is it about Europe? Frank had suggested last week that the aura of a Champions League night might lift his players. “It’s still a little bit under the floodlights, the Champions League, everything,” he said. “Sometimes it can be more tricky to really hit the same wherever it is … away from home … where it’s not as exciting.”Quick GuideChampions League: draw dates and playoff pathsShowPlayoff roundThe teams ranked 9th-24th will contest the playoff round, with Friday's draw determining which team from each pair below will go into which path.

Spurs have faced some mediocre opposition and Eintracht were arguably the worst. They had conceded three goals in each of their previous five matches and it was easy to see why. They were so lax, errors scarring their game. There was a weakness about them in the duels. Spurs had an open invitation to play.The Eintracht midfielder Hugo Larsson did run through in the 45th minute to rattle the crossbar but it was an isolated burst and Spurs might have been out of sight by then. Djed Spence and Destiny Udogie pushed high from the wing-back positions, sometimes into inside forward areas while Xavi Simons was dangerous with his dribbles.Simons had an early goal ruled out for an offside against Udogie in the buildup, Palhinha worked Kauã Santos with a header and there were a flurry of chances around the half-hour. Kolo Muani crossed for Udogie, who failed to connect with the header in front of goal – a glaring miss. Wilson Odobert hit the post from outside the area and there was the moment when Simons nipped onto a risky Santos pass only to want too many touches.View image in fullscreenTottenham players congratulate Randal Kolo Muani for his breakthrough.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/ReutersThe breakthrough had been advertised and it felt as though the identity of the scorer was somehow written. It was a smart finish from Kolo Muani after Cristian Romero had nodded a Simons cross over to him from beyond the far post. It was incredible to see how much time and space Romero had. Or maybe not considering the overall sweep of the Eintracht performance.Eintracht almost snatched an equaliser when Ellyes Skhiri floated a ball in and Aurélio Buta could not direct the volley when unmarked in front of goal. But it was not a night when Spurs would suffer. Kolo Muani had gone close before the Buta miss and, after it, Santos would save from Pape Sarr. Solanke’s goal came after a terrible back header from another replacement, Mahmoud Dahoud.Spurs’ final placing of fourth almost demands an exclamation mark given the Premier League form andthe narrative around Frank. He could enjoy the moment.“Seventeen points, fourth in the group, six clean sheets, it’s very impressive,” Frank said. “I was very happy with how we progressed with the ball, we were quicker up the pitch and we created a lot. The 3-4-3 has also looked good in the last three games.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueEintracht FrankfurtTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

To extend the mixologist’s analogy, his team are enjoying life with a few margaritas in theChampions League.Slot’s side cruised into the last 16 for the second successive season with a demolition of Qarabag at Anfield. Mohamed Salah was among the goalscorers for the first time since accusingLiverpoolof throwing him under the bus, while Alexis Mac Allister, Florian Wirtz, the potent Hugo Ekitiké and substitute Federico Chiesa were also on the scoresheet.João Pedro’s double dumps out Napoli as Chelsea avoid playoff with late winRead moreThe biggest victory of his Liverpool reign plus a clean sheet were the perfect tonic for Slot following defeat at Bournemouth. Avoiding next month’s two-legged playoff is an added bonus given his mounting injury problems. Six wins out of eight in the Champions League group, including against both Madrid clubs and Inter, serve as a reminder of the pedigree that Liverpool possess but have failed to show consistently in their troubled title defence.“We’re happy to be going straight into the last 16, especially as only two years ago we were playing in the Europa League and went out in the quarter-finals to Atalanta,” said Slot, whose team will play either Juventus, Atlético Madrid, Galatasaray or Club Brugge in the last 16. “Now we are two seasons running in the top eight of the Champions League and we are hungry for more this season.”Slot’s night did not get off to the best start. Already shorn of defensive options and needing Ryan Gravenberch to deputise for Ibrahima Konaté in central defence, Liverpool lost Jeremie Frimpong to injury in the second minute. The full-back pulled up while pursuing aQarabagclearance down his right flank. Credit to the visiting captain, Abdellah Zoubir, for putting the ball out of play immediately for the full-back to receive treatment. Frimpong has previously sustained two hamstring injuries during his debut season at Anfield and was distraught when limping off. Slot could only confirm this was a muscle injury.View image in fullscreenAlexis Mac Allister scores his second goal of the evening.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe thought went to Slot’s pre-match press conference, when he defended withdrawing Frimpong against Bournemouth on the basis the Netherlands international was tired and his workload needed managing carefully. “If people knew the struggles we and I are facing, they would be more understanding of the decisions I make,” the head coach had said.Frimpong’s exit and Wataru Endo’s arrival left Liverpool with a back four comprising two defenders and two midfielders. Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson and Milos Kerkez were the only fit, recognised defenders available to Slot although he is hopeful Konaté will return from compassionate leave against Newcastle on Saturday. Joe Gomez could also be back from a hip problem.Quick GuideChampions League: draw dates and playoff pathsShowPlayoff roundThe teams ranked 9th-24th will contest the playoff round, with Friday's draw determining which team from each pair below will go into which path.

Slot’s team took the lead from a set piece, much to his delight. Dominik Szoboszlai’s corner flicked off the defender Kevin Medina and was met at the back post by Van Dijk. His header bounced up for Mac Allister to nod over the line before Mateusz Kochalski could claw clear.It was soon two when Ekitiké held up Robertson’s ball and spun away from two Qarabag players before squaring inside to Wirtz. A chasm opened up in the middle of the visitors’ defence, giving the Germany international time and space to pick his spot in the bottom corner.Brave Newcastle fall short but Willock leveller sends PSG to playoffs tooRead moreThere was no let-up for Qarabag after the interval. In a role reversal of their free-kick routine at Bournemouth, Szoboszlai back-heeled the ball for Salah to sweep a similarly emphatic finish into the top corner. It was the Egypt international’s 49th goal in the Champions League, his first in any competition for Liverpool since 1 November and, notably, his first sincethatinterview at Leeds. Salah pointedly marked the moment by facing the Kop and thumping the Liver bird on his chest.Ekitiké got the goal his performance deserved when beating one Qarabag central defender after the other to a long clearance out of the Liverpool penalty area. Having sprinted away from both Bahlul Mustafazade and Medina, the striker swept a clinical finish past their goalkeeper.The visitors’ display was by now disintegrating and Mac Allister claimed his second goal of the night when Matheus Silva sliced a Szoboszlai pass into the path of the Argentina midfielder. Mac Allister duly waltzed around Kochalski and tapped into an empty net. Chiesa completed the rout when Van Dijk surged out of defence and found the Italian striker in space inside the area.“If we improve in both boxes it is going to be very hard for any team to play against us,” Slot said. “But one game is not enough. We have to do it more often.”PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal819242Bayern Munich814213Liverpool812184Tottenham Hotspur810175Barcelona88166Chelsea87167Sporting86168Man City86169Real Madrid891510Inter Milan881511PSG8101412Newcastle8101413Juventus841314Atletico Madrid821315Atalanta801316Bayer Leverkusen8-11217Borussia Dortmund821118Olympiacos8-41119Club Brugge8-21020Galatasaray8-21021Monaco8-61022Qarabag FK8-81023Bodo/Glimt8-1924Benfica8-2925Marseille8-3926AE Pafos8-3927Union Saint Gilloise8-9928PSV80829Athletic Bilbao8-5830Napoli8-6831Copenhagen8-9832Ajax8-13633Eintracht Frankfurt8-11434Slavia Prague8-14335Villarreal8-13136FC Kairat8-151Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueLiverpoolQarabagmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

An eighth successive victory means Mikel Arteta’s side have become the first team to end the league phase with a 100% record since it was introduced last season, with only a consolation goal in injury time denying them the distinction of winning all by a two-goal margin.Whether that can translate into silverware in a competition thatArsenalhave infamously never won and in which they have reached only one final remains to be seen. But even with a second-string side that once again showed the strength in depth at Arteta’s disposal, completing the job against the bottom side, Kairat, was never in doubt even when the Kazakh champions equalised after an early goal from Viktor Gyökeres.Champions League: Benfica keeper’s last-gasp header sends side into playoffsRead moreThe £64m striker endured another frustrating evening as he somehow failed to add to his tally after that despite numerous opportunities. It was a different story for Kai Havertz, who sparkled on his first start for almost a year owing to a series of injuries. He scored the second either side of setting up Gyökeres and Gabriel Martinelli to help establish Arsenal’s supremacy before the break. The Germany forward was withdrawn at half-time with the damage done. Having a player of such quality available again will be crucial as Arsenal’s quest for a quadruple remains alive.“He’s going to give us so much,” said Arteta. “The team knows how important Kai is for us and how he can help take the team to a different level. So the fact that he was able today to do that after such a long time is very impressive.”Quick GuideChampions League: draw dates and playoff pathsShowPlayoff roundThe teams ranked 9th-24th will contest the playoff round, with Friday's draw determining which team from each pair below will go into which path. There are no national exclusions so, for example, Monaco will be drawn against either PSG or Newcastle, with Qarabag playing the other team.Silver path:(21) Monaco or Qarabag (22) v (11) PSG or Newcastle (12)(19) Club Brugge or Galatasaray (20) v (13) Juventus or Atlético (14)(23) Bodø/Glimt or Benfica (24) v (9) Real Madrid or Inter (10)(17) Dortmund or Olympiakos (18) v (15) Atalanta or Leverkusen (16)Blue path:(22) Qarabag or Monaco (21) v (12) Newcastle or PSG (11)(20) Galatasaray or Club Brugge (19) v (14) Atlético or Juventus (13)(24) Benfica or Bodø/Glimt (23) v (10) Inter or Real Madrid (9)(18) Olympiakos or Dortmund (17) v  (16) Leverkusen or Atalanta (15)Potential last 16 tiesAfter the playoffs are completed on 24-25 Feb, the last 16 draw will take place on 27 Feb. It will work in a similar way, with each playoff winner paired with a team who qualified automatically by finishing in the top eight. The path to the final in Budapest on 30 May will then be set.Silver path:Monaco/Qarabag/PSG/Newcastle v (5) Barcelona or Chelsea (6)Brugge/Gala/Juve/Atlético v (3) Liverpool or Tottenham (4)Bodø/Benfica/Madrid/Inter v (7) Sporting or Manchester City (8)Dortmund/Olympiakos/Atalanta/Leverkusen v (1) Arsenal or Bayern (2)Blue path:Qarabag/Monaco/Newcastle/PSG v (6) Chelsea or Barcelona (5)Gala/Brugge/Juve/Atlético v (4) Tottenham or Liverpool (3)Benfica/Bodø/Madrid/Inter v (8) Manchester City or Sporting (7)Olympiakos/Dortmund/Leverkusen/Atalanta v (2) Bayern or Arsenal (1)Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asked whether Arsenal had laid down a marker by winning all eight games, he added: “The players need to acknowledge that and feel even more conviction about what we’re able to do.”There was a reminder of Arsenal’s achievements so far in this competition on the pre-match programme, which featured images from each of their seven previous victories over illustrious names like Bayern Munich, Atlético Madrid and Inter. Unsurprisingly, Arteta opted to make 11 changes from the disappointing defeat to Manchester United at the weekend as Havertz was deployed in an advanced midfield role behind Gyökeres.Kairat were without Dastan ­Satpaev, the 17-year-old who is due to join Chelsea this year, owing to injury and only named five outfield players on their bench. They have travelled more than 50,000 miles in a Champions League campaign that began in July and had picked up a solitary point in the league phase. There was still a sizeable contingent in the away end who made themselves heard at every opportunity.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres performs his trademark celebration after opening the scoring.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAMost would have feared the worst when Gyökeres slammed home from the edge of the area inside two minutes after a brilliant through-ball from Havertz. But Arsenal’s lead was short-lived as Riccardo Calafiori – back in the side after a month out with a hip problem – was adjudged to have tugged Jorginho’s shirt inside the area and the Kairat captain stroked home for the spot to the audible delight of the travelling supporters.That was as good as things got for them until almost the final kick of the match. A brilliant individual goal from Havertz after he latched on to Ben White’s long pass and then cut inside to curl past Temirlan Anarbekov restored Arsenal’s advantage. Gyökeres, who seemed determined to cash in after Gabriel Jesus was preferred against Inter and United, could have had a hat-trick before half-time but spurned two gilt-edged chances. The Sweden striker thought he finally had a second when he got a touch on Havertz’s cross that was heading in, only for Martinelli to cheekily pinch it on the line and notch up his sixth goal of this year’s competition. It was all too much for poor Kairat.Luckily for them, Havertz was withdrawn at the break and replaced by Martin Ødegaard. The Arsenal captain tried to keep up the intensity and saw his shot from distance palmed away to safety before directing a header straight at the goalkeeper. Jesus replaced Gyökeres with 20 minutes remaining and had a goal disallowed for offside. Arteta handed senior debuts to the midfielder Ife Ibrahim, who signed his first professional contract this week, and the winger Brando Bailey-Joseph.Kairat’s supporters were still ­celebrating Ricardinho’s late header well after the final whistle as they managed to double the number of goals Arsenal have conceded in the league phase. For Arteta, there will be much bigger challenges to come.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal819242Bayern Munich814213Liverpool812184Tottenham Hotspur810175Barcelona88166Chelsea87167Sporting86168Man City86169Real Madrid891510Inter Milan881511PSG8101412Newcastle8101413Juventus841314Atletico Madrid821315Atalanta801316Bayer Leverkusen8-11217Borussia Dortmund821118Olympiacos8-41119Club Brugge8-21020Galatasaray8-21021Monaco8-61022Qarabag FK8-81023Bodo/Glimt8-1924Benfica8-2925Marseille8-3926AE Pafos8-3927Union Saint Gilloise8-9928PSV80829Athletic Bilbao8-5830Napoli8-6831Copenhagen8-9832Ajax8-13633Eintracht Frankfurt8-11434Slavia Prague8-14335Villarreal8-13136FC Kairat8-151Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalKairat Almatymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There,Anatoliy Trubin’s 98th-minute headersqueezed Benfica into the playoffs and helped keep Real behind City. The goalkeeper’s presence in the area had been initially puzzling.“We were all there so we didn’t know Benfica needed a goal to qualify so when the goalkeeper goes up, we say: ‘Why you go?’ But it was a good strategy for José,” Guardiola said.City will face one of Real Madrid, Inter, Bodo/Glimt or Benfica in the last 16. The draw to determine their opponents is on 27 February, with ­Guardiola’s side guaranteed to be at home in the second leg.The victory came from Erling ­Haaland’s opener and Rayan ­Cherki’s second, each before the break. Yet a sour note came with Jérémy Doku’s injury on 36 minutes, after a tussle with Davinson Sánchez, and the winger is likely to miss the trip to Tottenham on Sunday. “I think so,” Guardiola said. “He is a calf [problem] – he felt something.”View image in fullscreenRayan Cherki (centre) wheels away in celebration after doubling the home side’s lead.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAOf what was a patchy display againstGalatasaray, he said: “The first half was better than the ­second.

Guardiola was furious and with ­Osimhen forcing Gianluigi ­Donnarumma into a low save, City’s second goal was welcome. Doku, zipping about everywhere, popped up on the left, squared to Cherki, and in space in the area beat Cakir to the goalkeeper’s right with ease.View image in fullscreenRayan Cherki celebrates scoring Manchester City’s second goal with Matheus Nunes and fellow goalscorer Erling Haaland (right).Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersAfter half an hour City had risen to seventh place. Yet Guardiola, ­without the suspended Rodri and having again dropped Phil Foden, was unhappy – Cherki the focus of his ire. When Doku limped off after the tussle with Sánchez Foden entered, but when the ball broke to Matheus Nunes from a Cherki corner the defender dawdled and allowed Osimhen to charge towards goal. An anguished Guardiola watched as Nunes recovered but here was further sloppy football from City.Better was Rayan Aït-Nouri’s slaloming run that took him along the left: he picked out a free Foden but he scooped over and at the whistle for the break Guardiola strode off.Scores elsewhere meant City began the second half in the princely place of fourth – yet in the same odd mode, an Aït-Nouri high ball smashed back from halfway for some reason, the latest jarring sight.When Nathan Aké’s distribution proved equally aimless, Guardiola delivered a verbal volley, and a period yet to have any rhythm was disrupted by three pitch invaders holding flags.Buruk’s team were on top. A foray down their left claimed a corner, Gabriel Sara dipped it in but ­Osimhen’s header was simple for Donnarumma. A ­Turkish goal and City would be jittery and the visitors, in burgundy and orange, enjoyed the control to force one.When Cherki dropped deep and passed around the corner to Omar Marmoush along the left it was a rare attack from City – a quaint state of affairs for Guardiola’s team. So, too, a hopeful long ball up to ­Haaland. The centre-forward found Marmoush who, if his touch was better, might have scored City’s third.Instead, Osimhen nearly cut the deficit – his shot had Donnarumma repelling smartly and Guardiola brought on Tijjani Reijnders for Marmoush.Nico González replaced Cherki for the closing minutes yet a clumsy ­Haaland pass caused Guardiola, again, to hold his head.A strange evening, then, for City and one that Guardiola will surely use to lecture his charges on what not to do.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal819242Bayern Munich814213Liverpool812184Tottenham Hotspur810175Barcelona88166Chelsea87167Sporting86168Man City86169Real Madrid891510Inter Milan881511PSG8101412Newcastle8101413Juventus841314Atletico Madrid821315Atalanta801316Bayer Leverkusen8-11217Borussia Dortmund821118Olympiacos8-41119Club Brugge8-21020Galatasaray8-21021Monaco8-61022Qarabag FK8-81023Bodo/Glimt8-1924Benfica8-2925Marseille8-3926AE Pafos8-3927Union Saint Gilloise8-9928PSV80829Athletic Bilbao8-5830Napoli8-6831Copenhagen8-9832Ajax8-13633Eintracht Frankfurt8-11434Slavia Prague8-14335Villarreal8-13136FC Kairat8-151Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityGalatasaraymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We are very together at the moment. We’re connected on the pitch. We’re doing things with a lot of discipline.”Corinthians’ 1-0 defeat of Gotham FCin the first Champions Cup semi-final earlier in the day had provided an upset at Brentford’s Gtech stadium but there was no risk of Africa’s Champions League winners doing the same to their European counterparts – the developmental gulf is just too big.This was the first time an African women’s club had met a European club in a competitive official match and the Moroccan side were worthy representatives, their qualification for the Champions Cup thanks to a steady development that has led to them winning two Champions League titles in four years.“Compliments to the opposition,” said Slegers. “Of course, it was a hard game for them tonight, but I think the way they presented themselves and the way they represented football in Morocco and as the champions of Africa, it was very inspirational.“What they’re doing is inspiring so many people, hopefully so many young girls see the opportunities to play football and that this is possible.”This was the next step and, regardless of a run of five wins in a row prior to the meeting with England’s most decorated side, they set up accordingly, a back five and four in the ­middle with Sanaa Mssoudy their lone target up front.View image in fullscreenMariona Caldentey (No 8) with her teammates after scoring Arsenal’s third.Photograph: Alastair Grant/APDespite that defensive shape, they were quickly undone by their opponents, who opened the scoring in the eighth minute when Blackstenius nodded the ball over the line before it was hooked clear by Aziza Rabbah and goalline technology confirmed it had crossed.Four minutes later Arsenal had a second via Maanum who converted as she spun round to face goal, the club’s much-changed but still potent and experienced starting XI delivering the efficient performance needed before the final on Sunday and then an important Women’s Super League game against the leaders Manchester City next week.Ultimately, this is a tournament Arsenal could have done without, at this stage of the season at least, with the pressure about to ramp up when Champions League football restarts in two weeks’ time, but a trophy is a trophy and with a chunk of a £1.7m prize pot available the incentive to take it seriously was there.The third goal arrived courtesy of a Zineb Redouani handball in the box, picked up by the video assistant referee, and Caldentey converted from the spot before Olivia Smith provided the fourth. Russo entered the fray at the hour mark and two goals within 10 minutes followed soon after.“Now we’ve earned the right to play in the final, that’s one step closer to being history-makers and that’s what we want to be,” said Slegers. “Full respect to Corinthians and what they did against Gotham, that was very impressive, so it’s going to be a tough game.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Champions CupArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

City also have matching rights to buy the Norwegian back should a fee be agreed for his sale in future.An identical agreement allowed City to bring back James Trafford fromBurnleylast summer for the amount Newcastle had agreed to pay for the goalkeeper. Trafford left City for Turf Moor in July 2023.Bobb, a wide forward, has struggled to establish himself under Pep Guardiola since his debut as a substitute in the 5-1 league win over Fulham in September 2023. Bobb sustained a fractured leg in training before last season’s league campaign, ruling him out until April, and made only two more appearances after a hamstring problem. He has played 15 times for City this season including nine starts.Flamengo have concluded their pursuit ofLucas Paquetáby agreeing to sign the West Ham midfielder for €42m (£36.3m) from West Ham. Paquetá has been pushing for a return to Brazil and negotiations concluded on Wednesday after Flamengo had three offers rejected.West Ham are in a relegation battle and tried to convince Paquetá to stay. They initially indicated they would sell the Brazil international only if Flamengo loaned him back for the rest of the season. But Paquetá has grown disillusioned with life in England and was desperate to secure an immediate move to his former club.The 28-year-old has struggled under the emotional strain of being accused of spot-fixing three years ago. Paquetá faced the possibility of a lifetime ban and was denied a move to Manchester City after the Football Association’s investigation came to light. He wascleared of the chargeslast summer.View image in fullscreenLucas Paquetá has been determined to return to Brazil this month.Photograph: Action Plus Sports Images/Action Plus/AlamyWest Ham stood by Paquetá during the investigation and felt let down when he asked to leave this month. Yet they have accepted that there was little to gain from making him stay. Paquetá asked to be left out of the FA Cup win over Queens Park Rangers this month and was absent for their last two league games with a minor back problem.“Lucas has made it clear that, for personal and family reasons, he wishes to return home to Brazil and make a fresh start after being cleared in July 2025 of FA misconduct charges that took two years to be resolved – a situation that caused him significant mental strain,” West Ham said. “Despite the club doing everything possible to persuade Lucas to stay, he has remained adamant that his wish is to leave. Therefore, the head coach and the club have reluctantly agreed to accept his transfer request.”West Ham signedAdama Traoréfrom Fulham for a small undisclosed fee on Wednesday, and their midfielderJames Ward-Prowsehad a medical at Burnley with a view to joining on loan for the rest of the season.View image in fullscreenAdama Traoré first played under West Ham’s manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, at Wolves.Photograph: WHUFCWard-Prowse has been out of favour at West Ham sincethe appointment of Nuno Espírito Santoas manager in September. The former Southampton player was cut from the first-team squad and has not featured under Nuno. Ward-Prowse had a similar experience during a loan at Nottingham Forest last season. He quickly dropped out of Nuno’s plans and was sent back to West Ham early.Nuno left Forest last September and was hired by West Ham later that month. His arrival at the London Stadium was bad news for Ward-Prowse, who was immediately told that he would not be involved with the first team.The 31-year-old, a popular presence at the club, has mostly trained away from the main group. It was not viewed as a U-turn by Nuno when he included Ward-Prowse in a matchday squad for the first time for thewin over Sunderland last Saturday. Sources pointed out that a space on the bench had to be filled after West Ham agreed to let Guido Rodríguez join Valencia on the night before the game. It was too late for an academy player to be added to the main group because the Under-21s had played on Friday night.Burnley hope the experience of Ward-Prowse,a £30m West Ham signing from Southamptonin 2023, can help them in their relegation fight. West Ham have also allowed the midfielders Andy Irving and Rodríguez to leave.Traoré is understood to have signed until June. Nuno, who worked with the winger at Wolves, is rebalancing his squad with a view to keeping the club in the Premier League. Igor Julio’s loan from Brighton has been cut short, allowing West Ham topursue temporary movesfor the Tottenham goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky and the Chelsea defender Axel Disasi.Aston Villa have completed the loan signing ofDouglas Luizuntil the end of the season. The Brazilian returns to Villa Park for a second spell, joining from Juventus after his loan at Nottingham Forest was cancelled. The deal includes an option to buy.The 27-year-old is a much needed addition for Unai Emery amid an injury crisis in midfield, with Youri Tielemans ruled out for up to 10 weeks.Villa sold Douglas Luiz to Juventus for £42.35m in 2024.

The 31-year-old winger was the club’s highest earner but has been out of favour since the summer of 2024. Sterling had 18 months left on a deal worth £325,000 a week.Sterling struggled to produce his best form after joining from Manchester City in 2022. He was the first player to arrive under the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownership and was hailed as a marquee signing.However Sterling’s time atChelseahas been a disappointment. He was inconsistent during his first two seasons and was loaned to Arsenal last season. Chelsea were keen to move him on after a shift in transfer policy led them to target young players on heavily incentivised long-term deals.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sterling’s wages and reluctance to move to a team away from London made him difficult to sell. He has not played this season and has trained away from the first team. Fulham, Crystal Palace and West Ham have shown interest this month but Sterling is now understood to be open to leaving London.It has been a sad decline for one of the most prominent players in English football’s recent history. The Liverpool academy graduate won multiple honours at City and played a key role in Gareth Southgate’s revival of the England team. Sterling scored three times at Euro 2020 as England’s men reached the final of a major tournament for the first time since 1966. He has also been a major voice in the fight against racism and was awarded an MBE in 2021.He has not played for England since the 2022 World Cup and he was told he had no future at Chelsea in the summer of 2024. The club have looked for solutions for Sterling but none appealed.Chelsea said: “We thank Raheem for the contribution he made while a Chelsea player and wish him well for the next stage in his career.”Explore more on these topicsRaheem SterlingChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a grand slam, it’s always very difficult against Novak. Let’s see what’s coming.”Sinner’s 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 quarter-final victory over the seventh seed extended his commanding record against Shelton to 9-1, with Sinner winning 22 consecutive sets since the 23-year-old American won their first meeting. Such dominance over one of the best young players indicates just how far ahead Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are of the rest of the field.Novak Djokovic survives at Australian Open as Lorenzo Musetti retires hurt while two sets upRead moreSince a brief hiccup in histhird-round match against Eliot Spizzirriwhen he suffered from cramps in hot conditions, Sinner has not put a foot wrong. The second seed’s stratospheric level marks a stark contrast to Djokovic’s, who was trailing by two sets against the fifth seed, Lorenzo Musetti, beforethe Italian was forced to retireat 6-4, 6-3, 1-3 due to a thigh injury.Sinner has not lost to Djokovic since saving triple match point in their 2023 Davis Cup semi-final, winning five matches in a row and clinching their past three meetings in straight sets: “I lost to him I think four or five in a row” said Djokovic. “He’s just playing on such a high level right now, along with Carlos. They’re the two best players in the world.”“Hopefully I can deliver my A-game for that matchup, because that’s what’s going to be needed to have a chance. I wasn’t playing close to my best today, so I’m going to have to change that.”View image in fullscreenBen Shelton has lost his past nine matches against Jannik Sinner.Photograph: Fred Lee/Getty ImagesThe victory extended a number of records for Sinner. He is the fifth player in the open era to reach six consecutive grand slam semi-finals and the 24-year-old is on a 20-match winning streak, the second-longest of his career. As the two-time defending champion, he has won 23 consecutive matches at theAustralian Open.For Shelton, this tournament represented another positive step forward as he reached his fifth grand slam quarter-final. Despite his disappointment, he believes he can close the gap on Sinner and inflict real damage on the four-time grand slam champion.“I’m getting to the point now where I’m getting stopped up by the toughest challenge in the game for the most part and I’m close to bringing it all together,” he said. “It’s just going to take that one time where I do it to get me over the hump. It’s always been that way for me.“Certainly not discouraged from a performance like this, but I want to see myself get out in front and see what I can do from there in a match rather than falling behind because I know how I feel when I get out in front at slams. I feel like I’m untouchable. I guarantee the other guys at the top feel the exact same.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenJannik SinnerNovak DjokovicAustralia sportTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Furyannounced his retirement a year agoafter successivedefeats to Oleksandr Usyk, but has been training in Thailand for his return to the ring. A venue has yet to be announced for the fight, but it will take place in the UK, making it Fury’s first contest here sincehe overcame Derek Chisorain 2022.“Well it’s official I’m back doing what I [heart emoji] to do,” Fury posted on Instagram. “I’ve brought the biggest network along with me. Netflix, this is going to be astronomical. Blessed by God.”Zuffa Boxing says it will save the sport – but the fine print shows that fighters might pay the priceRead moreFury added: “Excited to be back. Heart’s always been and always will be in boxing. Someone go tell the king that the ace is back!”The Russian-born Makhmudov is a 6ft 6in Canada-based fighter who boasts a 21-2 record and strengthened his credentials by dominating Britain’s Dave Allen in his most recent fight. “I am thrilled about the opportunity,” he said. “I’m coming to deliver a war.Tyson Furyhas been a big champion. I will be more ready than ever to leave with a massive W.”Fury announced on 4 Januaryhe would return to boxing. “Been away for a while but I’m back now, 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face and get paid for it.”His career has brought 34 wins in 37 fights and two stints as world champion. Fury had been expected to build towards a long-awaited fight against Anthony Joshua, but the British former heavyweight champion’s future is uncertain aftera car crash in December, in Nigeria, when two of his close friends and team members, Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele, were killed.It will be Fury’s first fight on Netflix, although last year he completed filming of the second season of At Home with the Furys that will be released in the spring. He follows Joshua, who made his Netflix debut when heoverwhelmed YouTube star Jake Paulin six rounds in Miami in December.Joshua has returned to light training, but there is uncertainty over his future with the promoter, Eddie Hearn, saying he will not be rushed into making a comeback.The WBO champion, Fabio Wardley, who upgraded his interim title when Usyk vacated instead of making a mandatory defence, is another option, with Fury open to a summer showdown with his British rival. Fury has outlined his plan to fight three times this year.Usyk is the heavyweight king after twice becoming undisputed champion, first by toppling Fury in May 2024 and then byovercoming Daniel Duboislast July. The 39-year-old Ukrainian gave up the IBF and then WBO belts after those victories and remains the only fighter to have beaten Fury, who has enjoyed two spells as world champion sinceoutpointing Wladimir Klitschko in 2015.Explore more on these topicsTyson FuryBoxingAnthony JoshuanewsShareReuse this content"

Bundee Aki and Hugo Keenan, key members of the British & Irish Lions tour to Australia last year, should have been involved against France next Thursday, but they are facing spells on the sidelines for contrasting reasons.Aki has not travelled to Ireland’s training camp in Portugal after a “misconduct complaint” relating to an alleged post-match incident with match officials after Connacht’s URC game against Leinster on Saturday.The veteran centre will now face an independent hearing on Wednesday with the Irish Rugby Football Union confirming he is staying at home for disciplinary reasons. “The IRFU does not tolerate any form of disrespect shown towards match officials and does not condone actions that fall below the standards expected of players representing Irish rugby,” read a statement.The Breakdown | So much at stake and Six Nations just the start in ‘massive year for rugby union’Read moreThe 35-year-old Aki, who has won 68 caps for Ireland, was an early temporary replacement in the game last weekend and was aggrieved after he was struck in the face by Charlie Tector’s head in the first half. Any suspension would inevitably affect his tournament participation, with Ireland due to face the defending champions France in Paris in the opening game. The uncapped Ulster centre Jude Postlethwaite has been added to the squad in Aki’s place.In a second significant blow, Keenan is now a major injury doubt amid reports he has sustained a broken thumb in training. The full-back, the try-scoring hero of the Lions’ series-clinching win over the Wallabies in Melbourne, had been expected to start against France despite not having played since the Lions tour after undergoing hip surgery.With Ireland already missing several injured props and doubts still surrounding the fitness of Tadhg Furlong, it makes life significantly trickier for the head coach, Andy Farrell, as he contemplates his starting XV for Paris. Jacob Stockdale could now slot in at full-back with Stuart McCloskey at inside-centre.View image in fullscreenUlster’s Stuart McCloskey is expected to start at inside centre for Ireland in France.Photograph: Geraint Nicholas/Inpho/ShutterstockFrance, meanwhile, are also having to come to terms with the loss of their giant prop Uini Atonio, who has been advised to retire from rugby with immediate effect after a heart attack. The 35‑year‑old, a linchpin of France’s scrum for many years, remains under surveillance in intensive care. His condition is described as stable but his club La Rochelle have indicated that his recovery will require a lengthy period of convalescence.To say the 145kg Atonio will leave a massive hole in the French pack is an understatement and, when combined with the current surge of injuries to top-level props in Ireland and England, it raises the question of whether the increasing pace and physical intensity of the modern game might be a factor.England’s head of team performance, Phil Morrow, says the demand on props “is high” these days in a sport which increasingly requires players of all shapes and sizes to be more dynamic athletes. However, he believes it is too early to tell whether there is a problem that goes beyond a few individuals in the same position being unavailable at the same time.“I’m always really conscious that if you take a snapshot sample you could jump to the wrong conclusion,” said Morrow, who was at Saracens for years. “There was one year at the club when we had six broken arms after not having a broken arm for 10 years. We hadn’t changed anything.“Everyone at the time wanted to find out why, but I would say over the long term it averaged itself out.“We’ll keep analysing it and seeing whether the trend continues but we don’t want to jump to conclusions.”Explore more on these topicsIreland rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Traditional linear viewing of the Saturday and Sunday evening highlights programmes had declined by 770,000 to 6.88 million average weekly views last month compared with December 2024, but MOTD has gained 1.52 million viewers by making highlight clips available on iPlayer and its website at 8pm on Saturdays for the first time.The combined viewing figures for MOTD on iPlayer covering the evening programmes and highlights clips had risen to 61.9 million by the end of December, a big increase on the 45.4 million views by the same period last season. The digital consumption of MOTD has almost doubled since the 2022-23 season, when the total figure by December was 33.1 million.TheBBCannounced its 8pm ­digital highlights at the start of a new four-year deal with the ­Premier League in August, describing it as a “­gamechanging way to stay immersed in the action”, and has been pleased by the public’s response. The corporation’s sports team are increasingly invested in clip rights, particularly in football, and have signed highlights deals with La Liga and the Bundesliga this season.The 10% drop in viewing figures for MOTD’s Saturday and Sunday evening highlights programmes on BBC One and BBC Two follows thedeparture of Gary Linekeras Saturday presenter last summer after 26 years. The BBC opted not to sign a direct replacement for him, with Mark Chapman, Gabby Logan and Kelly Cates sharing presenting duties.The BBC declined to comment, but sources said the decline in linear viewers was consistent with trends in live TV. It was not possible to obtain MOTD viewing figures in isolation for the Saturday programme, so any effect of Lineker’s departure is hard to assess.Explore more on these topicsFootballSport TVMatch of the DayTelevisionSports rightsBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

There has long been a desire to settle bragging rights between the WSL andNWSLas arguably the world best domestic women’s leagues and there was some desire for, though not expectation of, a Gotham v Arsenal final. Instead, Corinthians have upset the odds and they want more.“It’s a momentous moment but we are planning for the final regardless of who we face and we want to leave England with the trophy,” Piccinato said.The Gotham manager, Juan Carlos Amorós, said: “We wish them all the best. They came with a gameplan they executed, it worked for them and they won the game. On our side I think we also executed everything that we prepared. We dominated the game on every aspect but as we all know football is about goals, you need to score goals. If you don’t then you normally get punished and unfortunately that was the case.”View image in fullscreenGabriela Zanotti’s strike beats Ann-Katrin Berger.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersIt was hardly teaming with fans on the way to Brentford’s Gtech Stadium for the semi-final double header, but a far from insignificant posse of Corinthians supporters made their presence known, arriving together in full voice before filing in to watch their Copa Libertadores winners take on the Concacaf Champions Cup winners.The action on the pitch was far from thrilling, but that was to be expected with both teams in pre-season, Gotham’s brought forward to accommodate the tournament and Corinthians’ preparations well under way with their season kicking off on 7 February in the Supercopa do Brasil against Palmeiras.With a place in the final at stake against theEuropean Champions League winners, Arsenal, or the African Champions League winners, AS Far, alongside a bigger share of the $2.3m (£1.7m) prize pot, this is a tournament being taken seriously despite the logistical nightmare it has presented for those involved.Quick GuideTransfer spending up 83.6%ShowThere was an 83.6% increase in  spending on international transfer fees in women’s football in 2025 compared with 2024, according to the latest report released by Fifa.A total of $28.6m (£20.8m) was spent on international transfers, with a record high  135  women’s clubs paying a transfer fee. Fifa’s data excludes  deals between  teams from the same country, such as Arsenal’s landmark £1m move to sign Olivia Smith from Liverpool.The figures continue a  trend of rapid inflation in transfer fees across the women’s game. In 2023 Fifa reported a  spend on international transfer fees of $6.1m, less than a quarter of that spent two years later.The vast majority of international transfers – 81.4% – still involve end-of-contract moves, and the average contract length was 16.3 months.Fifa revealed that London City Lionesses’ purchase of the France midfielder Grace Geyoro from Paris Saint-Germain involved the largest  fee of any international deal  in 2025 and that the promoted WSL club were the second-biggest spenders on international transfers fees.Chelsea led that chart, having been involved in two of the five biggest international moves, signing the United States duo Alyssa Thompson and Naomi Girma.Fifa’s report also drew attention to the relatively low salaries that many players receive: in 2025, the median annual fixed salary  for a player  making  an international transfers was  $19,800, although more than a fifth of players involved receive more than $50,000 a year.Tom GarryWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The players have given absolutely everything they have,” Amorós said. “Everyone has, from ownership to the last staff member. They’ve put a lot of time and effort and sacrifice to make sure that we were prepared to win. For us, obviously the time of year is a bit challenging because it’s in the middle of our off-season. But we always say that we don’t look for excuses at Gotham, we look for solutions.”Gotham began on the front foot, but Corinthians were far from playing second fiddle in a tight encounter and a strike by their Uruguay international Belén Aquino that slipped narrowly wide from the edge of the box inside 10 minutes was the first sign of their threat.Gotham asserted their authority in the second half and had the better chances, with Emily Sonnett’s header blocked on the line.View image in fullscreenThe Corinthians celebrations begin at the final whistle.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAAs extra time loomed, threateningly for two teams that had not played a competitive fixture in two months (Gotham) and four months (Corinthians), the Brazilian champions dealt a hefty blow to their profligate opponents, whose decision-making in the final third was just that bit too slow, when Zanotti brought the ball down on the edge of the box before scoring past Ann-Katrin Berger. The block of Corinthians fans erupted, staff and substitutes joyous on the edge of the pitch.Gotham pushed, and there was controversy at the close when a Gotham free-kick on the edge of the area provoked scenes which led to a red card for a member of the Corinthians staff. The American side could not find the equaliser from their final kick though, the effort wide of the post and the whistle blown straight after.Huge credit has to be given to a battling and organised Corinthians, who had three key players unable to start after they were able to travel only on Sunday owing to visa issues. However, Gotham will rightly be left frustrated by a tournament that did not give them a fair chance, the American side not looking mentally or physically ready, and Fifa will be left wondering about the cost of the compromises made to shoehorn this competition into the calendar.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Champions CupCorinthiansNWSLWomen's footballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Chile goalkeeper Ryann Torrero came out to stop Bethune, who was rushing at the goal alone, but the strike got past her.Trinity Rodman stays in NWSL, signing record contract with SpiritRead moreJoseph, who plays for the Chicago Stars, earned her first start for the US and scored in the 26th minute.Sams, serving as captain, made it 3-0 in the 33rd minute with a goal off a cross from Sears.The US made it 4-0 just 28 seconds into the second half with a goal from Sears that went to the far post and into the upper corner. Rodman scored in the 68th minute.Midfielder Riley Jackson and defender Ayo Oke both appeared in their first international match. Three players – forwards Reilyn Turner and Maddie Dahlien and midfielder Sally Menti – made their US debuts against Paraguay.The roster did not include US players based in Europe because they are in the middle of their seasons. It also did not include Gotham FC players, who are in London for the semi-finals of the Fifa Women’s Champions Cup.The match against Chile concludes the US team’s January training camp, as Hayes looks to solidify her player pool for the upcoming SheBelieves Cup, which begins in March, and Women’s World Cup qualifying at the end of the year.“I don’t think you can really look at this camp as like ‘They didn’t do their job, they’re not as good as we think they should be,’ because after all we’re coming off an offseason of a lot of players not playing, some players playing, a bunch of new faces,” Rodman said. “I stayed fit and ready in the offseason because of the injuries I’ve dealt with, and I felt really good out there.”The last meeting between the US and Chile was a 3-0 US victory at the 2019 World Cup. Chile, ranked No 47 in the world, has made just one World Cup appearance.The US previously held a training camp at UC Santa Barbara’s Harder Stadium ahead of the 1991 World Cup, which included scrimmages against the Gauchos and a West Coast all-star team.

About 2% of the genome tells cells how to make proteins, the building blocks of life. The rest orchestrates gene activity, carrying the crucial instructions that dictate where, when and how much individual genes are switched on.The researchers trained AlphaGenome on public databases of human and mouse genetics, enabling it to learn connections between mutations in specific tissues and their impact on gene regulation. The AI can analyse up to 1m letters of DNA code at once and predict how mutations will affect different biological processes.The DeepMind team believes the tool will help scientists map out which strands of genetic code are most essential for the development of particular tissues, such as nerve and liver cells, and pinpoint the most important mutations for driving cancer and other diseases. It could also underpin new gene therapies by allowing researchers to design entirely new DNA sequences – for example, to switch on a certain gene in nerve cells but not in muscle cells.Carl de Boer, a researcher at the University of British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved in the work, said: “AlphaGenome can identify whether mutations affect genome regulation, which genes are impacted and how, and in what cell types. A drug could then be developed to counteract this effect.“Ultimately, our goal is to have models that are so good we don’t have to do an experiment to confirm their predictions. While AlphaGenome represents a significant innovation, achieving this goal will require continued work from the scientific community.”Some scientists have already begun using AlphaGenome. Marc Mansour, a clinical professor of paediatric haemato-oncology at UCL, said it marked a “step change” in his work to find genetic drivers for cancer.Gareth Hawkes, a statistical geneticist at the University of Exeter, said: “The non-coding genome is 98% of our 3bn base pair genome. We understand the 2% fairly well, but the fact that we’ve got AlphaGenome that can make predictions of what this other 2.94bn base pair region is doing is a big step forward for us.”Explore more on these topicsGeneticsBiologyMedical researchAI (artificial intelligence)DeepMindGoogleComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Approaching 40 years on, a rebellion is brewing among himself and a community of like-minded activists and developers.“We can fix the internet … It’s not too late,” he writes, describing his mission as a “battle for the soul of the web”.Technology isn’t neutralBerners-Lee traces the first corruption of the web to the commercialisation of the domain name system, which he believes would have served web users better had it been managed by a nonprofit in the public interest. Instead, he says, in the 1990s the .com space was pounced on by “charlatans”.“The Americans were very keen about commercialising the internet … crossing the boundary from being an academic thing to being a commercial thing,” he tells Guardian Australia from Brisbane.The pursuit of profit soon became a driving force in how the internet was designed. But it wasn’t until 2016 – the same year he won the Turing award – that the US elections showed Berners-Lee just how toxic the web could be. Two years later, he told Vanity Fair he was “devastated” by the abuses of the web.View image in fullscreenBerners-Lee hopes to change the way data is held on the web. It’s a project rooted in people power – not unlike the first years of the web.Photograph: Elise Amendola/APFor 35 years, Berners-Lee has written what he considers to be the world’s first blog. One post, published in June 2024, is dominated by a crowded map of “everything on the internet”. It is a reminder of the web’s overall beneficence – from email and Zoom to health, podcasts, collaboration, creativity and digital sovereignty, the diagram shows the web is, for the most part, good.But to the left of the diagram is a cluster of red, including X, Snapchat, YouTube, “feed manipulation for engagement”, addiction, polarisation, disinformation and mental illness. This corner of the web, its creator says, has been “optimised for nastiness”. It is extractive and surveillance-heavy.“It’s only a small part of the whole internet … but the problem is that people spend a lot of time on [social media websites] because they’re addictive,” he says.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailGiven it was always supposed to be human-like in its sprawling connectivity, perhaps its darker sides were inevitable.“Yes and no,” Berners-Lee says. “There used to be a sort of mantra that technology was neutral and people are good and bad. But actually, that’s not true of things on the web.“The way you design a website, like Reddit or Pinterest or Snapchat, can be explicitly good.” Or, designed with engagement as a priority, its algorithm can be explicitly bad.Collaboration and compassionCompounding the problem is monopolisation. Facebook and Google’s dominance is bad for innovation and bad for the web, he says, because monopolies get in the way of building systems that are truly pro-human. How many companies, after all, hold your (identical) data in non-transparent and incompatible systems?Since Berners-Lee’s disappointment a decade ago, he’s thrown everything at a project that completely shifts the way data is held on the web, known as the Solid (social linked data) protocol. It’s activism that is rooted in people power – not unlike the first years of the web.This version of the internet would turbocharge personal sovereignty and give control back to users.“When people are excited, they get a twinkle in their eye and they start coding just because of what they can imagine,” he says of developers who “get” the concept.View image in fullscreenBerners-Lee is not convinced social media bans for under-16s can fix the internet’s problems.Photograph: Rick Friedman/The GuardianHe likens Solid “pods” to backpacks of data that are securely held by each individual, allowing them to choose what to share with certain people, businesses and organisations. Department of Education data could be shared with an AI tutor; medical data with a cousin, doctor and nutritionist. The Flanders government in Belgium treats data as a national utility and is already using Solid pods for its citizens.The Facebooks and Xs of the world need not join in– the new systems will be so empowering, collaborative and compassionate, he believes, that parts of today’s web will become obsolescent.“The existing systems will fade to a certain extent, because people will get more excited in new systems,” he says.“Being able to collaborate across the world with friends and family and colleagues will be something that they end up getting addicted to – a much better form of addiction.”He’s not the only person wanting to fix these problems.Australia’s world-first social media ban– which blocks under-16s from using a host of sites including Snapchat, X, Facebook and YouTube – is one attempt at a solution. Although Berners-Lee is not convinced.“I’m interested to see how it goes down in Australia, becausethere are people in the UK who are proposing itin a similar way, and others may follow on,” he says.“The first question is whether kids should be using those particular social media sites. I think you have to recognise that things like messaging services are useful.”Instead, he’s in favour of smartphones that are especially designed for children, blocking access to harmful sites. He points to the Other phone, designed in collaboration with Mumsnet users, as an alternative to devices that allow unfettered access to social media.The AI ‘horse is bolting’It’s on the subject of artificial intelligence that his optimism plummets.Berners-Lee has long seen AI – which exists only because of the web and its data – as having the potential to transform society far beyond the boundaries of self-interested companies. But now is the time, he says, to put guardrails in place so that AI remains a force for good – and he’s afraid the chance may pass humankind by.“The horse is bolting,” he says of reining in AI’s unchecked development and growing intelligence.View image in fullscreen‘I would like to see a Cern for AI … where the scientific community gets to look at the AI and to decide whether it is safe or not.’Photograph: Renee Dominguez/SXSW/Getty ImagesBerners-Lee created the web, HTML and HTTP atCern, the home of the Large Hadron Collider, on the outskirts of Geneva. Cern’s scientific, non-commercial approach was key to the way the technology was shared.“I would like to see a Cern for AI, where all the top scientists come together and see whether they can make a super intelligence. And, if they can, they contain it into a system where it can’t just go out and persuade people to let it run the world.”Right now, though, given the division sown in part by that red corner of the web, we are “very, very far from a Cern for AI”, he says.“We have got AI being done in these huge companies, but also in these huge silos. They’re not looking over each other’s shoulder. They’re just sitting there, inside their own company, looking at their own system, trying to make it smarter.“I don’t see a way that we can get to a point where the scientific community gets to look at the AI and to decide whether it is safe or not.”Sir Tim Berners-Lee will be speaking at theBrisbane Powerhouseon Thursday 29 January and theSydney Opera Houseon Friday 30 JanuaryThe headline on this story was amended on 29 January 2026 to clarify that Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web, the service that runs on the internet infrastructure, not the internet itself.Explore more on these topicsInternetTim Berners-LeeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Many see it as the next frontier of civilisation, and are in competition with each other, andChina, to get there. In May, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, told a US Senate committee on AI that the “race between the United States and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover”.Many in Washington have internalised these fears. The US-China economic and scurity review commission hasrecommendedthat Congress “establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an artificial general intelligence (AGI) capability”. The Manhattan Project was a second world war-era research operation to produce nuclear weapons.In China, many saw Wu’s speech as articulating the vision of a bold, singular tech company, but not one that represented China’s overall AI industry.“China certainly has research groups working towards AGI. But most AI companies are working towards better applications,” said Ya-Qin Zhang, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research and former president of the tech company Baidu.A combination of limited computing power, a pragmatic approach to technology and a keen awareness of the present day potential of AI has steered China’s national AI policy towards real-life applications rather than frontier research.In August, the Chinese government published its highly anticipated “AI+ strategy”. The policy document outlined how AI could turbocharge China’s development goals, such as by using AI to improve medical diagnoses and make supply chains more efficient. But it made no mention of AGI.View image in fullscreenAlibaba’s Zhejiang cloud computing datacentre in Hangzhou, China.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images“The Chinese government is intently focused on reaping the benefits of AI in the here and now and in the near future through diffusion and application of AI across the economy, society, defence, and other areas,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior director for China and Taiwan at the White House national security council. “Despite its goal to ‘catch up and surpass’ the United States, we shouldn’t assume that the Chinese Communist party has bought into the idea that AGI is imminent.”“If you’re just looking at what has been officially published … there is no clear acknowledgment of AGI at all,” said Selina Xu, a China tech analyst. Xu noted that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, had a history of preferring the physical economy to more intangible forces.“It’s a very different narrative from the AGI race as a lot of people in DC see it,” Xu said.One of the biggest factors guiding this strategy is the fact that US sanctions have prevented Chinese companies from acquiring the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, which are needed for advanced AI research.Washington has banned the sale of hi-tech microchips to China in an effort to rein in the country’s AI development.Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, then developed more basic semiconductors specifically for the Chinese market. In December, Washington approved the Nvidia’s second-most advanced chips, the H200s, for sale in China. But Beijing has reportedly told custom agents that the chips cannot be imported into China, as the government seeks to break the country’s reliance on overseas technology.China insists that “necessity is the mother of invention” and points to the success of companies such as DeepSeek as proof that the US restrictions will merely spur innovation. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, is one of the few Chinese tech leaders who, like Alibaba’s Wu, has openly expressed an interest in AGI.But until China is able to produce its own advanced semiconductors at scale, most tech companies feel it is more profitable to use the hardware they already have to focus on AI applications rather than AGI.Another factor guiding the US-China tech competition is the availability of datacentres and the energy to power them. In November, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said China would “win the AI race” in part because of its energy subsidies for datacentres.The subsidies were reportedly introduced after Chinese tech companies complained of higher electricity bills caused by the domestic semiconductors they are obliged to use, which are less efficient than Nvidia’s. In a sign of how determined China is to break its reliance on imported technology, Reuters reported that any datacentres in receipt of state funds could only use domestic chips.Such measures would reduce Nvidia’s competitive advantage in China and boost domestic chip producers, such as Huawei.Since 2021, China has reportedly poured $100bn into support for AI datacentres.But there are signs that the boom may have been overzealous. A recent report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said that nationwide, the utilisation rate for AI datacentres was 32%.In a recent op-ed in China Economic Weekly, Rao Shaoyang, the director at the China Telecom Research Institute, wrote that in some regions of China, the computing power industry was operating in a similar fashion to China’s beleaguered property sector: build first, find buyers later. He cautioned against “blindly building intelligent computing centres” and said local computing power demand should be considered before building new datacentres.Despite the surplus in more general computing power, many experts believe China still does not have chips that are sophisticated enough to explore frontier research in AGI. But analysts note that the mood could change quickly.“The current status quo is highly fluid, and Xi Jinping has explicitly declared an ambition to lead the world in AI,” said Gewirtz. “So the fact that China construes that goal one way at this snapshot moment in time does not give me any comfort that in a year they’re going to construe it the same way.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAI (artificial intelligence)AlibabaComputingNvidiaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This would be around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other and shortly before Musk turns 55 on 28 June.The FT also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $50bn – valuing it at $1.5tn – compared with previous reports that it was looking for $25bn at an $800bn valuation. Last week, it was reported that the rocket company was considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanleyfor leading roles in the share sale.View image in fullscreenElon Musk’s $680bn fortune would be turbo-boosted by a SpaceX flotation.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPAMusk, whose $680bn fortune would be turbo-boosted by aSpaceXflotation, said last year the company’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa. The billionaire owns about 42% of SpaceX, as well as nearly 17% of the electric carmaker Tesla, where he is chief executive. He also owns more than three-quarters of the social media platform X.SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service.If the flotation goes ahead it would involve a bigger initial fundraising than the IPO of the oil company Saudi Aramco, which raised $29bn in 2019, although for a larger total valuation of $1.7tn.The chief financial officer of SpaceX, Bret Johnsen, has held talks and video conference calls with existing private investors since December to explore a mid-2026 IPO, the FT added.Musk has reportedly been swayed by the idea of a SpaceX float because of its growing valuation and the success of Starlink.Global financial markets are anticipating a year of significant US listings, with the artificial intelligence companies Anthropic and OpenAI alsolaying early groundwork for potential IPOs.A rebound in the US equity capital market activity began in 2025 after three years of limited activity, partly as the result of volatility and geopolitical tensions. Space technology is a tightly held sector but is sought after by investors keen for exposure in light of rapid development prospects, analysts have said.Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said the mooted $1.5tn price tag was a “monster premium”.He added: “A valuation that big reflects not just a tech and AI premium but Elon Musk’s stardust and a frothy market, plus a heck of a lot of media narrative around this. It is to some degree a kind of bet on the future space economy.”SpaceX has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsIPOsSpaceXElon MuskStock marketsNasdaqnewsShareReuse this content"

Admittedly, he then repeated these sentiments in a post on X, in the time-honoured manner of parents solemnly lecturing children to do as we say, not as we do.Yet Macron is not wrong. Thebacklash building upagainst social media now is unmistakable, as guilt over all those hours wasted scrolling meets growing alarm at the ugly and dystopian world big tech has helped create. Only last week the Labour MP Jess Asato,a government adviseron violence against women, described how an X user had created an AI-generated video of her being chloroformed and prepared for rape. Who wants their 14-year-old daughter hanging out somewhere that happens? Though teens mostly prefer TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat to X, it’s the grim excesses of the platform under Elon Musk that have shaken many adults out of complacency.Parents arebeguiled by tales of Australian kidsrediscovering bike rides and board games, after under-16s were banned from social media just in time for the antipodean summer. Teacherssick of dealingwith the fallout from adolescent social media beef, or the inevitable after-effects of kids staying up all night on their phones, want action. The surest sign of which wayLabour winds are blowing, meanwhile, is that the health secretary, Wes Streeting,recently invitedthe pro-ban campaigning author Jonathan Haidt in to address officials, while the thwarted leadership hopeful Andy Burnham suggests a crackdownmakes sense to him. Yet Downing Street has hesitated, leaving Kemi Badenoch totake advantage, for once, of an open goal. The Conservatives haveamended the children’s wellbeing and schools billgoing through the House of Lords in order to put the idea of a ban on the table, and will use an opposition day debate this Wednesday to hammer their point home, somewhat awkwardly for Labour MPs who broadly agree with the idea but don’t want to see the Tories take the credit.Personally, I wasn’t convinced for a long time of the case for a ban. What changed my mind was realising how gen Z, now old enough to reflect on growing up in a social media free-for-all, feels about it. Half of 16- to 24-year-olds wish they’d spent less time on their phones and three-quarters want tougher regulation to protect young people from social media,according to recent pollingfor the thinktank The New Britain Project. When teenagers themselves say that they’d keep their own future children away from it for as long as possible, alarm bells should be ringing. And, though some will of course find enterprising ways around a ban, in itself that’s not an excuse for doing nothing; there’s a booming trade in fake ID for underage drinkers, but we don’t just give up and let 14-year-olds drink until they black out. Legislating on teenage harms is less about prohibition than setting social norms until they’re old enough to regulate their own intake, and protecting them from industries otherwise only too ready to exploit them.That said, the ongoinggovernment consultationon teens and social media should be given the time and space to consider more serious objections. Ian Russell,whose daughter Molly tragically killed herself after viewing endless images of self-harm on Instagram, hasmade a thoughtful casethat the Online Safety Act (designed to outlaw the most egregious material) should be given a chance to work. Children’s charities,including the NSPCC, are worried about teenagers banned from the big platforms experimenting with riskier alternatives, and about the cliff-edge potentially created for kids let loose at 16 on social media with little experience of it. (Though the more countries follow Australia’s example, the greater the incentive for platforms to do what the former Meta executive Nick Clegg advocatedwhen I interviewed him, and create teen versions of their product. Companies tend to innovate remarkably quickly when facing an existential threat to the business model.)The most powerful argument against a ban, however, is that it’s not the easy answer to a teenage mental health crisis some want it to be. The evidence is still so mixed that it’s unclear whether being glued to a phone makes children miserable, or whether miserable teens spend more time online seeking comfort. New research from the University of Manchester,tracking 25,000 children, finds no evidence linking heavier social media use or gaming in one school year with increased anxiety and depression the next.Yet the researchers didn’t conclude that social media was harmless: more that teenagers are complicated, and that adults should pay more attention to what they’re doing both on and offline. Age limits for social media could fit alongside properly funded children’s mental health services, more things for teenagers to do away from a screen – the recent government announcement offunding for youth clubswas a start – an honest reckoning with what else threatens children’s wellbeing, from poverty to academic stress, and some uncomfortable questions about parenting. If a four-year-old is already so online that they try toswipe a bookrather than read it, as a survey of reception teachers for the charity Kindred Squared recently reported, that’s not big tech’s fault.A ban is not, then, a panacea. But it ought to be part of a broader national mission for happier childhoods, which recognises that as a society we have for some time been asleep at the wheel. It’s not too late, even now, to wake up.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Amazon employs about 1.5 million workers worldwide.Most job cuts are expected to be in the US, although some roles in the UK may also be affected.The company said the “additional organisational changes” were designed to “strengthen our organisation by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy”, according to ablogpost to stafffrom Beth Galetti, the senior vice-president of people experience and technology.Galetti said some teams had not been affected by the job cuts announced in October, but this was not the beginning of regular waves of layoffs. “Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan,” she wrote.US-based employees who are affected will be offered 90 days to find a new role internally, with the timing for applying for new roles varying in other countries.Galetti saidAmazonwould continue to hire new staff and invest in “strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future”.The official announcement came just hours after workers at Amazon Web Services (AWS) received an online meeting invitation from a top executive on Tuesday for the following day – subsequently cancelled – that also contained a draft email revealing the cuts.The message erroneously said that affected employees in the US, Canada andCosta Ricahad already been told they had lost their jobs.It was signed by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice-president of applied AI solutions at AWS, while the layoffs were referred to in the email as “Project Dawn”.“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Aubrey wrote in the email, which was seen by multiple news outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organisation and AWS for future success.”The email referred to a separate message from Amazon’s human resources boss, which did not appear to have been sent.Amazon has been trying to reverse a pandemic hiring spree in an effort to cut costs and slim down its vast operation.Its chief executive, Andy Jassy, has previouslywarned white-collar workersat the company that their jobs could be taken by AI in the next few years.The news of fresh Amazon layoffs came as the US delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS) said it wouldcut up to 30,000 jobs this year, adding to last year’s staff reductions, as it focuses on higher-margin shipments.UPS has been working to cut millions of low-value deliveries it carries out for Amazon, which is its largest customer but increasingly also a delivery rival. UPS has called its business with Amazon “extraordinarily dilutive” to margins.It is understood that a few hundred of the job cuts are expected to be in UK corporate offices in London and Manchester, with warehouses unaffected.Additional reporting by Sarah ButlerExplore more on these topicsAmazonJob lossesE-commerceCanadaCosta RicanewsShareReuse this content"

Burner phones, for example, are routinely used by No 10 on some trips abroad – at G20 the summits in Brazil in 2024 and South Africa in 2025, for example – though not on visits to allied nations or Five Eyes intelligence partners.For visits to China these precautions have been standard for at least a decade, such is the expectation that Beijing will eavesdrop and monitor.When she was prime minister, Theresa May was warned ahead of her trip to Beijing in 2018 to get dressed under the duvet to ensure that spy cameras would not film her without any clothes on. It was advice that was passed on generally by officials to all those travelling on the trip eight years ago.View image in fullscreenTheresa and Philip May with Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at a tea ceremony in Beijing in 2018.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/EPAConcerns about peeping tom surveillance are particularly relevant to those in the official entourage or business and press delegations staying in hotels. “There was a well-worn routine in places like Shenzhen that foreigners from the west would be assigned the same rooms so they wouldn’t have to move the equipment,” a former senior British intelligence official said. Those with time on their hands would try to find the concealed bugging devices for fun.The Guardian view on Keir Starmer in China: engagement is necessary, caution is vital | EditorialRead moreWhen Gordon Brown visited China in 2008, an aide was victim of a honey trap. The male aide met a Chinese woman at a lively hotel disco in Shanghai and left with her. The next day, he reported that his BlackBerry phone was missing. He was reprimanded, though No 10 said there had been no security compromise.Part of the standard security guidance given to ministers and their aides reflects this incident. “The rest of the advice,” the senior security official said, “was warning middle-aged men that if an attractive young Chinese woman appeared interested in you, she probably wasn’t”.Michael Gove, writing in the Mail last year, recalled being given similar warnings before being dispatched on a ministerial trip in 2010: “I was also told that if anyone from the opposite sex who approached me was out of my league they had only one thing on their mind – and it wasn’t comparing notes on Confucian philosophy.”View image in fullscreenMichael Gove, Vince Cable, George Osborne and David Cameron at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during a two-day trip in 2010.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PADavid Cameron visited Beijingas prime minister in December 2013. A former aide recalled that China insisted on supplying a personal protection officer “over six-and-a-half-foot tall” to follow the British prime minister and his team as closely as reasonably possible.The practice, again, is relatively standard, but it offered an obvious possibility for low level information gathering. “At the end of the trip after pretending he couldn’t speak or understand, at the plane he said goodbye and safe travels in perfect English,” they recalled, presumably as a reminder they were being watched.General guidance, according to one British official who visited Beijing, “is that everything is bugged” and the only area for sensitive or secret conversations and debriefs is the secure compartment in the British embassy.Similar considerations apply when meeting Chinese leaders or officials – at international summits – or when visiting the country’s diplomatic premises in London or elsewhere.When James Cleverly was foreign secretary, a former adviser recalled that during the UN general assembly in New York, he and his team refused to take their mobiles into the Chinese consulate. The handsets were all stored in a lead-lined bag in the hands of officials who did not go inside the diplomatic building.One of the consequences of this abundance of caution is that ministers are out of ordinary contact in China, meaning their families cannot easily get in contact, having instead to communicate via a private secretary or other close aide.It can also cause other political issues, as happened to Vince Cable in 2014. The Lib Dem, who was then business secretary, was visiting China and did not have his mobile phone with him. Back in the UK, an old ally, Matthew Oakeshott, launched a coup attempt against the then party leader, Nick Clegg – but the plot struggled for momentum and quickly collapsed with Cable uncontactable.“I wasn’t part of this plot. It all broke in the middle of the night in China and not surprisingly we were not rushing to the phone,” Cable said.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerChinaAsia PacificInternational tradeTrade policyEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

By the time he bought a Tesla in 2023, BEVs were no longer a complete oddity inTurkey, making up 7% of new car sales.Fast-forward two years and electric cars are selling so fast that Turkey has caught up with the EU in its rate of adoption. Its market is now the fourth largest in Europe, behind Germany, the UK and France.“A premium product is a thing that makes you happy but that not everyone can have,” said Astarcıoğlu, a mechatronic engineer from Istanbul and the developer of an app to find charging stations. “My Tesla has become an ordinary car over here.”BEVs made up 16.7% of new car sales in Turkey in 2025, just behind the EU’s 17.4%, registration data published on Tuesday shows. While uptake is lower than in the Netherlands or the Nordics, where BEVs make up 35% to 96% of new cars sold, sales in Turkey have raced ahead of almost every country in southern and eastern Europe.Its electric vehicle surge is part of a global trend in which emerging markets from Uruguay to Vietnam are spurning fossil fuel-burning cars at surprising speed. The latest data comes as Turkeyprepares to hostthe UN climate summit, and one month after the EUwatered downits 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.Analysts attribute the boom to a disparity in Turkey’s special consumption tax, which has left electric cars only slightly more expensive than comparable petrol cars. Sales remained high even after the government raised taxes on electric vehicles in August.“Practically speaking, Turkish people don’t buy electric vehicles because it’s eco-friendly,” said Ufuk Alparslan, an analyst at the climate thinktank Ember, saying that running costs were lower for electric cars. “The motivation is purely economical.”Electrifying car fleets is seen as a crucial step to decarbonising the transport sector and reducing pollution, but efforts in many regions have run into roadblocks. In the EU, where planet-heating emissions from cars have risen by 17% since 1990, attempts to phase out combustion engines have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile industry.The Turkish government does not have a dedicated electric vehicle strategy but has championed a domestic carmaker, Togg, which in 2024 overtook Tesla as the country’s leading EV seller. In an interview with Bloomberg HT last week, Togg’s board chair, Fuat Tosyalı, announced plans to increase production from 40,000 cars in 2025 to 60,000 in 2026.Togg’s entry into the market, which was buoyed up by tax support and zero-interest credit from state-owned banks, has helped normalise electric vehicle adoption, said Berkan Bayram, the founder of the Turkish Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. “It gained the heart of Turkish buyers.”Foreign carmakers who must contend with import duties have benefited from the Togg-friendly tax system, with manufacturers including Tesla reducing motor power in Turkey to fall into the same favourable tax bracket. China’s BYD is also jostling for a greater share of the market and plans to build a $1bn factory in Turkey.In addition to the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuel vehicles, the transition to electric mobility could be a geopolitical boon for countries that do not produce oil themselves. Turkey’s car fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2053, sending demand for oil imports soaring, according to areportby InstitutDE, a Turkish diplomatic thinktank in Brussels.While imports will rise in all scenarios studied, a failure to run more cars on electricity would heighten Turkey’s exposure to external shocks, price volatility and geopolitical risks, the report found.However, the recent increase in BEV sales may not herald a systemic shift away from fossil fuel cars. The tax incentives are “very fragile” and can change easily, said Baki Kaya, an economist and former diplomat who co-wrote the InstitutDE report.“It’s not the result of a strategic decision,” he said. “And I’m personally not that optimistic [it will continue].”Analysis from Ember found the overall tax burden on electric cars remained high, with the total tax applied to electric cars in the lowest bracket reaching 50%, and rising to 86% in a higher bracket. Without changes, inflation and exchange rates could soon shrink the number of affordable BEVs, Alparslan said.“Although electric cars have started to become widespread in Turkey, there is still a large, untapped potential to reduce energy imports through renewable energy and electric vehicles,” he said. “Tax policies that keep electric vehicle prices at more affordable levels could accelerate this momentum.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAutomotive industryTurkeyMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

Is AI an existential threat, or an epochal opportunity? Those are the questions top of mind for a new documentary at Sundance, which features leading AI experts, critics and entrepreneurs, including Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, with views on the near-to-midterm future ranging from doom to utopia.‘The world is hurting right now’: politics and protest hit the Sundance film festivalRead moreThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, directed by Daniel Roher and Charlie Tyrell and produced by Daniel Kwan (one half of The Daniels, the Oscar-winning duo behind Everything Everywhere All At Once), delves into the contentious topic of AI through Roher’s own anxiety. The Canadian film-maker, who won an Oscar in 2023 for the documentaryNavalny, first became interested in the topic while experimenting with tools released by OpenAI, the company behind the chatbot ChatGPT. The sophistication of the public tools – the ability to produce whole paragraphs in seconds, or produce illustrations – both thrilled and unnerved him. AI was already radically shaping the film-making industry, and proclamations on the promise and peril of AI were everywhere, with little way for people outside the tech industry to evaluate them. As an artist, he wondered, how was he to make sense of it all?Roher’s anxiety only increased when he and his wife, fellow film-maker Caroline Lindy, learned that they were expecting their first child. “It felt like the whole world was rushing into something without thinking,” he says in the film, as his excitement for parenthood collided with dread over the unknown variable of AI, which in just a few short years went from proprietary experiment to public good.The AI Doc thus arises out of Roher’s most pressing question: is it safe to bring a child into this world? Alongside Kwan, Roher convened a series of experts to both explain the mechanics of the tech – and clarify some nebulous, alienating terms – and search for an answer. (It is both comforting and a little disturbing, for example, that no one seems to have a clear answer to the question “what is AI?”). In individual sit-down interviews, leading machine learning researchers including Yoshua Bengio, Ilya Sutskever and DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg all agree that there are aspects of AI models that humans cannot and will never be able to understand. Standard AI models are trained on “more data than anyone could ever read in several lifetimes”, as one machine learning expert puts it. And the pace of machine learning exceeds that of precedent – or film. “Any example you put in this movie will look absolutely clumsy by the time the movie comes out,” Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and a prominent voice in the apocalyptic 2020 Netflix documentaryThe Social Dilemma, tells Roher.View image in fullscreenCharlie Tyrell and Daniel Roher at Sundance.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty ImagesThe film first hears from a series of doomerists, or people concerned AI – and in particular Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a still-theoretical form of AI whose capabilities exceed those of humans – could lead to the extermination of humanity, including Harris, his Center for Humane Technology co-founder Aza Raskin, Ajeya Cotra, an AI risk adviser, and Eli Yudkowsky, an AI alignment pioneer. Such figures warn that humans could very easily lose control of super-intelligent AI models, with little to no recourse. Yudkowsky’s 2025 book is bluntly titled If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.AI companies, they say, are unprepared for the consequences of reaching AGI, which could “become superhuman maybe in this decade”, says Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety. Should humans no longer be the most intelligent beings on Earth, they warn, it is possible that AGI would view the species as irrelevant. Connor Leahy, co-founder of EleutherAI, compared the potential future relationship of super-intelligent AGI and humans to that of humans and ants: “We don’t hate ants. But if we want to build a highway” over an anthill – “well, sucks for the ant.”Several in the doomer camp, many of whom do not have children, react discouragingly to Roher’s question about parenthood. “I know people who work on AI risk who don’t expect their child to make it to high school,” says Harris, in a line that drew gasps from a preview audience in Park City.On the other side are optimistic figures such as Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPRIZE Foundation trying to extend human life, who claims that “children born today are about to enter a period of glorious transformation”; Guillaume Verdon, a leader of the “effective accelerationism” movement in Silicon Valley; Peter Lee, the president of Microsoft Research; and Daniela Amodei, the co-founder and president of OpenAI rival Anthropic. So-called “accelerationists” see AI as a potential cure to a myriad of seemingly intractable issues afflicting humanity: cancer, food and water shortages for an ever-growing population, insufficient renewable energy and perhaps most pressing, climate emergency. Without AI, they argue, countless future lives would be lost to drought, famine, disease and natural catastrophes.Development of AI, however, relies on computing power, which requires vast amounts of energy. A final group of interviewees, critics and observers largely outside the tech world – including Karen Hao, a journalist and author of the book Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI, and Liv Boeree, the Win-Win podcast host – connect AI to the tangible, physical world, such as the datacenterssucking up water in the American west, leaving residents with sky-high electricity bills and drained reservoirs. The current narratives around AI, according to Emily M Bender, a computational linguistics professor, exclude and dehumanize the people it is already affecting, and will continue to disrupt.View image in fullscreenDaniel Kwan, Jonathan Wang, Daniel Roher, Shane Boris, Charlie Tyrell and Ted Tremper at Sundance.Photograph: Mat Hayward/Getty Images for IMDbRoher eventually arrives at the five most powerful people – all men – currently leading the AI arms race: Altman; Elon Musk, the xAI CEO; Dario Amodei, the Anthropic CEO; Demis Hassabis of DeepMind and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg. Altman, Amodei and Hassabis sit for interviews that more or less defend their companies’ respective positions. According to the film, Zuckerberg declined to participate; Musk agreed but then got too busy.Altman, who at the time of the interview was expecting his first child, insists that he’s “not scared for a kid to grow up in a world with AI”. He and his husband Oliver Mulherin welcomed their son via a surrogate in February 2025, an event Altman latersaid“neurochemically hacked” his brain, leading people in his life to think that he would “make better decisions” for OpenAI and ChatGPT when it comes to “humanity as a whole”. The 40-year-old CEO went on to say that both his and Roher’s child would probably “never be smarter than AI” which “does unsettle me a little bit, but it is reality”.At one point, Roher asks Altman if it is indeed impossible to reassure him that everything in regards to AI is going to be OK. “That is impossible,” Altman affirms, though he does say that OpenAI’s lead in the AI arms race allows it to spend more time on safety testing.The AI Doc ultimately lands somewhere in between doomerism and optimism – apocaloptimism, as they call it, searching for “a path between the promise and the peril”. That path should include, according to numerous film subjects: significant, sustained, paradigm-shifting international coordination, akin the mid-century frameworks and agreements introduced to moderate the development of atomic weapons – more corporate transparency for AI companies, an independent regulatory body to police AI developers, legal liability for the companies’ products, such as ChatGPT, mandatory disclosure of genAI use for media and a willingness to keep adapting the rules for rapidly shifting tech.Whether or not the US government and companies, let alone the world, can do it remains an open question, with differing opinions on first steps. But if there is one thing the many subjects all agree on, it’s that there’s no going back to a time before AI. As Anthropic co-founder and CEO Amodei puts it: “This train isn’t going to stop.”The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist is screening at theSundance film festivaland will be released on 27 MarchExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026Sundance film festivalAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Launching a new game is an artform in itself – do you go for months of slowly building hype or a sudden shock reveal, simultaneously announcing and releasing a new project in one fell swoop? The latter worked incredibly well for online shooterApex Legends, which remains one of the genre’s stalwarts six years after its surprise launch on 4 February 2019. What you don’t do with a new release, is something that falls awkwardly between those two approaches. Enter Highguard.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This new online multiplayer title from newcomer Wildlight Entertainment has an excellent pedigree. The studio was formed by ex-Respawn Entertainment staff, most of whom previously worked on Titanfall, Call of Duty and the aforementioned Apex Legends. They know what they’re doing. But the launch has been … troubled.The game was revealed via a rather oblique trailer that closed last December’s lavish Game Awards event. Most viewers were expecting the ceremony to end with something huge – a major new announcement from Hideo Kojima, perhaps, or maybe a GTA 6 song and dance number. What they got was a short look at a fantasy-themed online shooter that no one had heard of – andit didn’t go down well.It turns out that Wildlight hadn’t planned to reveal the game before its 26 January launch – they were going to pull another Apex Legends shadow drop – but Game Awards organiser Geoff Keighley played the game, liked it and offered them a free slot at his show. The team couldn’t turn it down. Although perhaps, with hindsight, they should have.View image in fullscreenChoose your hero … Highguard.Photograph: Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.Now it’s out in the open and it’s actually pretty interesting. Combining elements of an online shooter and a Moba (multiplayer online battle arena game), players get into two teams of three, select from a group of differently skilled hero characters and then try to destroy the other side’s base before their own is destroyed. The action comes in phases – first you fortify your castle, then you explore the landscape for loot and power-ups, then the fighting begins. Each part sort of feels like a different game and as I played the first few rounds, I was constantly thinking “ooh, that’s a bit like Rainbow Six Siege” and “ooh, this bit’s like Fortnite”. But the game does have an identity of its own, thanks to its fantasy/mythological styling – you get to ride a sort of spirit horse around the landscape, while different heroes throw lightning bolts or erect walls of ice.However, they also carry shotguns and assault rifles, so that it feels like a weird cross between Call of Duty and a Ray Harryhausen movie. What Respawn has always done well is design incredibly smooth kinetic playspaces, where traversal is rarely impeded. This is a trait that Wildlight Entertainment has inherited – in Highguard you can run, slide, climb and leap in seamless movements, rarely getting stuck on the scenery.But sadly, the game’s disproportionately opulent reveal at the Game Awards has caused some issues. Almost immediately after launch, negative reviews started streaming on tothe game’s Steam page, with players complaining about visual performance issues and long queues to get a match – which doesn’t feel that fair for a game that had only been online for a couple of hours. You have to wonder how destructive that unexpected Game Awards teaser was – the gamer community can be incredibly judgmental and they have long, bitter memories.Highguard did attract around 100k players on day one, not a bad start for a newcomer to the crowded online multiplayer space, but there’s a lot of work to do. The last couple of years has been a battlefield for online blasters, the scarred landscape strewn with the skeletons of failed competitors from Concord to Hyenas and Battleborn. On top of this, Valve, the company behind Steam, has its own Moba-inspired online team game, Deadlock, in development and reaction to the closed beta tests has been positive. Valve is not a rival anyone really wants to go up against.And there’s a reason everyone wants to be in this space – Fortnite is making around $5bn a year, andBattlefield 6was one of the bestselling games of 2025. But considering the risks (hundreds of millions of dollars in development and marketing costs) and the volatile, unpredictable market, I can’t help but feel worried for the Highguard team. They’re banking on players staying around for months, building a community of adoring fans, maintaining huge concurrent player numbers. But it’s going to take a lot to get over the hurdle of that botched reveal.Besides, I have a feeling the next mega hit online shooter won’t be a Frankenstein’s monster of a game, sewn together from the recognisable body parts of previous hits. It’ll be something wild and fresh and new – a Godzilla, emerging from the depths of the game-development ocean, unexpected and bizarre and covered in seaweed. And whatever it is, it won’t get the end slot at the Game Awards, we’ll never see it coming.What to playView image in fullscreenRoute to the summit … Cairn.Photograph: The Game Bakers“Is this another one of your masochist games?” asked my partner, somewhat warily, watching me playmountain-climbing gameCairnthis week. (He is well aware of my affection for extremely difficult video games; he’s witnessed me struggle through so many of them.) Cairn is a game about extreme mountaineering, in which you must move storied climber Aava’s individual limbs to find hand and footholds in the forbidding cliff faces of Kami, a mountain that has never been summited. Aava is obstinately determined to be the first person to get to the top, and as the game progresses, I began to question that obsession (and my own obsession with playing it). It is thoughtful, beautiful, and not always easy, and has provoked a lot of reflection.

In each case there’s a way you think the game should go, and then the designers use your own gaming literacy to challenge those expectations. Can you say more about this small wave of games?”This is also a favourite mini-genre of mine, as someone who for both professional and personal reasons has played really alotof video games. One of the first games like this I ever played wasShadow of the Colossus. Go kill the big monster, the game tells you, as hundreds of games had before. Then you find the first colossus, and it’s just peacefully wandering around. You climb it and slay it, and there’s no fanfare for you. The creature crumples and dies. I felt a little bit sick.Spec Ops: The Linewas also famous for doing this: telling the player to kill, then inviting them to feel awful about it.

It has its work cut out for it. Trump didn’t pull the triggers that killedRenee GoodandAlex Pretti, but he bears political responsibility for having greenlighted the agents’ regularly lawless conduct.Good and Pretti should not have been killed. As far as can be seen in the ample video evidence that has emerged, neither posed a threat to the agents at the scene or anyone else. Their sole “offense” was to take a stand against the deportation raids. Yet trigger-happy agents needlessly shot them – Good as she was turning her carawayfrom the agents, Pretti while he wasrestrainedby agents on the ground. There was no plausible self-defense to justify these killings.Masked government thugs snuffed out Alex Pretti’s life in broad daylight | Moira DoneganRead moreYet the Trump administration has been reflexively defending deportation agents whenever they use lethal force. In each of the 16 times since July that they have fired shots, either while detaining people or at protesters, Trump officials have declared their actionsjustifiedwithout waiting for investigations to be completed, sometimes in blatantcontradictionof video evidence.The killing of Pretti is illustrative. Stephen Miller, the deputy national security adviser who is directing the deportation sweeps from the White House, pronounced Pretti a “domestic terrorist”. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary who oversees the raids, said Pretti was responsible for “domestic terrorism”. Yet video analysisshowsthat Pretti posed no danger to the officers who killed him. These senior Trump officials blamed the victim for his death.Sensing public hostility, Trump has nowremovedGregory Bovino, the border patrol commander who had been directing the deportation operations in Minneapolis. But Trump still has not repudiated the statements of Miller and Noem. He should fire them both for encouraging such lawlessness by defending the indefensible.The signal from senior Trump officials is that even the unjustified use of lethal force will be treated with kid glovesTrump himself has been no better. His initial response to the killing of Pretti was to castigate Democrats for creating “chaos” by refusing to cooperate with the deportation sweeps. Yet the video evidenceshowsthat it was federal agents who needlessly escalated the situation, “shoving bystanders”, “showering them with pepper spray at close range”, giving “muddled” directives and passing up opportunities to de-escalate, as the New York Times reported.To make matters worse, the Trump administration has avoided initiating a criminal investigation. So far, it isconductingonly a “use of force” “review” of Pretti’s killing rather than a criminal investigation into whether he was murdered. Similarly, the FBI supervisor in Minneapolis who tried to investigate the killing of Goodresignedafter her superiors in Washington pressed her to discontinue the inquiry. Again, the signal from senior Trump officials is that even the unjustified use of lethal force will be treated with kid gloves.Trump’s supporters have been no better. Fox NewsblamedPretti for his own death because if he hadn’t shown up to protest, he wouldn’t have been killed. “He should not have been there,”saidFox & Friends co-host Charlie Hurt on the network’s flagship show. So much for the first amendment right to protest!Othershave noted that Pretti waslawfullycarrying a gun, as if that might justify his killing, even though the video evidenceshowshe never drew it or removed it from his holster, and it appears to show agents taking it from him before shooting him as he lay restrained and helpless on the cold ground. This blame-the-victim argument has even outraged Trump’s second amendmentsupporters. Since when does lawfully carrying a gun – never brandishing it, never using it in a threatening manner – permit federal agents to summarily shoot you?The real “weapon” that Pretti held that seemed to outrage Trump’s agents – the same tool being used by Good’s wife at the time of her killing – was a mobile phone camera. Opponents of Trump’s raids have regularly used their phones, as the first amendmentpermits, to film agents in action to document any misconduct. That is largely how we know that Trump officials’ cover stories for the killings of Good and Pretti were fictitious.We will never know precisely what went through the minds of the federal agents who needlessly shot Good and Pretti to death, but it is hard to discount the role of their frustration at thevideo recordingsthat stood between their apparent tough-guy instincts and their quest for impunity.Back when he still lived in Trump Tower in New York City, Trump liked tosaythat his supporters were so loyal that he could descend to Fifth Avenue and shoot someone without losing any votes. There has been a disturbing degree of truth to that observation, because so many of his supporters seem to admire his willingness to buck the system, even when that involves crossing legal lines.But most Americans don’t like a police state, which is what Trump seems to be trying to impose on Democratic-run cities. The raids are bad enough. But if Trump’s deportation agents can kill with impunity, if the instincts of Trump and his senior officials are to exculpate lawlessness rather than to hold officials to the law, then Trump deserves theplummetingpolls that now face him. Let’s hope that for the safety of US city dwellers, his notorious quest for public approval leads to a change of direction.Kenneth Roth is a Guardian US columnist and visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs, and former executive director of Human Rights Watch.

They are economic warfare with civilians as collateral damageKenneth MohammedIn the Caribbean and Latin America, the lived reality of these measures – presented in the language of diplomacy – is starkSupported byAbout this contentWed 28 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 07.53 ESTShareAcross borders, cultures and faiths, most ordinary people want the same things: the ability to earn a living, put a roof over their heads, feed their families and watch their children grow up with a future. These are not radical ideas, but they are today routinely sacrificed on the altar of geopolitics.When power and profit take precedence, governments abandon the everyday realities of those they claim to protect and serve, especially when domination of another country’s resources, markets or political direction is at stake.In 2026, the pattern is unmistakable. War is not only waged with bombs and soldiers, but through its quieter sibling: sanctions. These encompass a broad range of coercive measures, including trade and investment restrictions, financial controls, banking blacklists, asset freezes, and visa and travel restrictions.Sanctions are sold as targeted … In practice, they function as broad blocks on trade and finance that ripple through populationsDeployed under the language of democracy, they are routinely weaponised against weaker states that fall outside the western orthodoxy of governance and market capitalism, with devastating consequences for societies that often pose no threat but refuse political subordination. Sanctions are not benevolent tools for guardians of human rights; they are a means ofeconomic warfare, with civilians as collateral damage.Sanctions are sold as “targeted” – aimed at elites, corrupt officials or illicit industries. In practice, they function as broad blocks on trade and finance that ripple through populations.Empirical researchconfirms that sanctions in Latin America and the Caribbean significantly reduce economic growth, worsen income inequality and amplify poverty, with financial and trade restrictions among the most damaging.For more than four decades, governments from Washington to London and Brussels have wielded sanctions as instruments of pressure, presented as principled diplomacy. The lived reality across the Caribbean and Latin America is stark. In Cuba, Haiti,Nicaragua, Venezuela and beyond, sanctions have become mechanisms of sustained economic strangulation – deepening poverty, stalling development and entrenching dependency.It is tempting to seeUS foreign policyas oscillating between hawks and doves – from Reagan to Trump. Yet from Managua in 1985 to Caracas this year, the pattern is one of sanctions as strategic leverage, justified alternately by anticommunism, the “war on drugs”, the “war on terror”, human rights or, more recently, geopolitical competition with Russia and China.The Reagan administration’s embargo on Nicaragua in 1985 laid this bare. By prohibiting trade and transport, it severed economic lifelines, bringing recession and hardship. The measures were so sweeping that the international court of justice ruled they breached bilateral treaty obligations. In Nicaragua, the legacy of embargo and isolation under successive sanction regimes has contributed to economic stagnation and dependency on remittances – which today make up a quarter of GDP – whilepolitical repression has only deepened.Haiti exposes the moral incoherence of sanctions … punished not for defying global order but for being too weak to complyIf Nicaragua reveals how sanctions operate as overt confrontation,Cubashows what permanent economic siege looks like. The US has maintained its embargo since 1962, tightening it further through the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act and the 1996 Helms-Burton legislation. Estimates suggest the cumulative cost to Cuba reaches to hundreds of billions of dollars.The consequences are visceral: Cuba’s prolonged economic contraction – with its chronic blackouts, shortages of food and medicine, and declining tourism revenue – have all been tied tosanctions.Venezuela, once one of the wealthiest oil exporters in Latin America, illustrates how sanctions compound suffering. Assets worth billions have been frozen in western banks, curtailing the government’s ability to pay for imports, fuel andservices. In January 2026, this coercion culminated in the kidnapping of the Venezuelan president and his wife, escalating economic siege into extraterritorial force.The impact is most perverse inHaiti. Crippled by centuries of debt and external interference, Haiti exposes the moral incoherence of sanctions. Framed as driven by humanitarian or security concerns, the imposition of financial restrictions, banking de-risking, diplomatic isolation and travel advisories have further severed Haiti from global trade. Sanctions deepened poverty, decimated state capacity and accelerated displacement. Haiti has been punished not for defying global order, but for being too weak to comply.View image in fullscreenThe rubbish-strewn streets in Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, in 1994, when the US intensified sanctions in a bid to restore Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.Photograph: T Belizaire/AFP/GettyOutside the Caribbean, sanctions on Iran confirm a parallel. Sweeping restrictions on oil, banking and trade have slashed export revenues, driven chronic inflation and sharply reduced living standards while failing to deliver the political outcomes promised by their architects. As in Cuba,Venezuelaand Haiti, sanctions have functioned less as precision tools against elites than as blunt instruments of economic attrition.The rationale for sanctions has shifted over time. During the cold war they were tools to counter Soviet influence; today they are wielded to deter states in the global south forming ties with China and Russia. As Washington attempts to reassert hemispheric dominance by resurrecting the colonial Monroe doctrine, countries have responded by diversifying their foreign relations and deepening exchanges withChina, Russia and others– a move that sanctions seek to punish.Sanctions are frequently defended as a humane alternative to war, a moral instrument for advancing democracy … History suggests otherwiseThis has real economic consequences: sanctions can create a chilling effect on investment, dissuading international banks from engaging with small economies for fear of secondary sanctions, thereby driving up costs, and widening financial exclusion. In the Caribbean, where oil and gas, mining and other industries depend on foreign capital and global supply chains, thisde-risking has measurable impacts.Rather than pressure elites into political reform, it is ordinary citizens who pay the heaviest price – through rising poverty and forced migration. Economic sanctions are a key driver of migratory flows from Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. When economies are throttled and survival becomes untenable,people vote with their feet. Visa restrictions and freezing of assets are often portrayed as peripheral, but in aggregate they compound exclusion. They limit tourism – a lifeblood for many Caribbean states – and deter diaspora engagement via remittances and investment.Sanctions are frequently defended as a humane alternative to war – a moral instrument for advancing democracy and human rights. History suggests otherwise. In US interventions, from Grenada to Panama, coercion has repeatedly been cloaked in the language of liberation while leaving long-term instability in its wake. From Reagan’s cold war interventions to Trump’s naval seizures in the Caribbean targeting Venezuelan oil, the machinery offorce and economic coercionhas barely paused.‘History will tell’: as US pressure grows, Cuba edges closer to collapse amid mass exodusRead moreThe US has been the most interventionist power in modern history.Researchshows that from the start of the 19th century, when Haiti became the second country in the Americas to gain independence, until 2022 the US carried out approximately 477 military and political interventions, with 114of these after 1989.From theCaribbeanand Latin America to the Middle East and Africa, where dozens of interventions have taken place, regime-change efforts have followed a grimly consistent pattern: short-term coercion, long-term sanctions and destabilisation, and decades of economic and institutional damage. When this cumulative record is considered, the question emerges: who are the real terrorists in the modern international order?If the aim were genuine human security, expanding humanitarian exemptions, financial access for food and medicine, and supporting multilateral global development would be more effective than prolonged embargos. Instead, sanctions remain tools of geopolitical leverage, wielded disproportionately by powerful states.For millions across the Caribbean and Latin America, the real war is not against terrorism or doctrines and ideology, but against the slow attrition of economic opportunity and dignity that accompanies sanctions. If western powers truly seek stable, democratic and prosperous neighbours, they must pursue engagement grounded in shared prosperity rather than domination and greed.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentOpinionUS foreign policyTariffsCaribbeanAmericasCubaHaiticommentShareReuse this content"

Let’s stop falling for his geopolitical clickbaitCatherine De VriesWhether he’s targeting Greenland, tariffs or Iran, Trump’s agenda is to distract – because a Europe that is always reacting is never planningWed 28 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 10.29 ESTShareWhen Donald Trump reassured the world that hewould not, after all, use forceto acquire Greenland – after days of threatening as much – he was doing what he does best: turning geopolitics into a spectacle. Whether Trump ever truly believed the US should acquire a vast Arctic territory belonging to a Nato ally is secondary to the fact that, once again, he ensured that Europe and the rest of the world were focused on his agenda.Trump is not a politician who responds to events – he seeks to make them. Not because he is deeply invested in policy detail, but because he understands a defining feature of contemporary politics: attention is power. In an era of information overload, there is no scarcity of data or analysis; what is lacking is attention. And whoever controls that controls the debate.Steve Bannon once described Trump’s domestic strategy as “flood the zone with shit”. In other words, create so many scandals that opponents no longer know which ones matter. The media chases everything, the opposition is perpetually outraged and no one has the mental space to set their own priorities. This logic and the accompanying tactics are now also being deployed by the US in its foreign policy.Trump’s threats towards Denmark andGreenlandwere not isolated provocations, but a form of geopolitical clickbait. Their purpose was to dominate the news cycle, push other governments into reactive mode and crowd out longer-term strategic thinking. Greenland was perfect for this. It is strategically important – located in the Arctic, between North America and Europe – yet remote enough that few voters have much detailed knowledge about it. That made it ideal for attention capture: dramatic enough for headlines, vague enough for endless speculation.It also triggered genuine anxiety. Greenland touches on Nato solidarity, Arctic security and the vulnerability of a semi-autonomous territory. Denmark has alreadyincreased its military presencethere, backed quietlyby other European states.Yet the core issue throughout this episode was not whether Trump would act, but thatEuropewas forced to respond. As governments issue statements and coordinate positions, Trump moves on to the next provocation (tariffs, Iran, Venezuela, Nato, migration), leaving behind a trail of diplomatic distraction. European leaders become minor characters or extras in a political theatre whose script is written in Washington.Each Trump provocation lands differently across the continent – it produces disunityBehind the spectacle, however, lies a coherent agenda. Trump’s second-termnational security strategymakes clear that Europe is no longer regarded as a partner in a rules-based order. Instead, it is portrayed as a declining, elite-driven liberal bloc that constrains nationalist forces on the rise. Support from Washington is framed not as a mutual interest, but as a transaction. Leaders who are ideologically aligned with Trump are promised preferential treatment, while others face pressure.By this logic, Greenland is not merely a territory. It is a lever: a way to signal to Denmark, and to the EU more broadly, who sets the terms of engagement. And Europe is particularly exposed to this type of pressure because its attention is so easily fragmented.Each Trump provocation lands differently across the continent. Arctic threats worry Scandinavia. Trade disputes hit exporters. The Ukraine war matters most in eastern Europe. And so on. Each episode produces a different coalition of concerned states. What it does not produce is sustained strategic unity.View image in fullscreenA Danish navy vessel patrolling near Nuuk, Greenland, on 15 January 2026. European countries increased their military presence in the territory in response to Trump’s threats.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APThat is the vulnerability Trump exploits. A Europe that is always reacting is never planning. Every issue feels urgent. The price of having your attention captured is strategic short-termism.What, then, should Europe do? It needs a two-track response. First, it must respond to Trump’s provocations in a calm, collective and disciplined manner. When a US president questions the territorial integrity of a Nato ally, Europe cannot ignore it. But European leaders should avoid the response Trump seeks: emotional, fragmented and uncoordinated. The goal should be a message that is delivered with consistency and purpose.Second, Europe must invest in its own long-term security strategy, independent of the daily churn of Trump’s politics. That requires accepting a difficult reality: US domestic politics is no longer a temporary disruption to transatlantic stability. Trump has demonstrated how easilyUS foreign policycan revert to transactional nationalism. Europe must plan accordingly for key priorities such as security and geo-economic resilience. Poland’s Donald Tusk stands out, for example, in keeping Warsaw focused on EU coordination on Ukraine and defence, rather than reacting to every Trump provocation.Europe does not lack answers –reports by former Italian prime ministers Enrico LettaandMario Draghiattest to that – but it lacks the capacity to act.The central lesson of Trump’s second term is not that global politics has become chaotic, but that attention itself has become a strategic battlefield of international politics. And attention wars are not won by reacting faster. They are won by deciding what deserves focus. Europe does not need to out-post Trump on social media. It needs to outplan him.Catherine De Vries is vice dean and professor at IE School of Politics, Economics and Global Affairs at IE University in MadridExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionEuropeGreenlandDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropean UnionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

I suppose I miss the days when watching the toxic right was more of a cod-psychoanalytical pastime: when you could watch the Goodwin of 2024, preaching the superiority of Hungary in openly anti-migrant terms, compare him to the Goodwin of the mid-2010s, when he was an adviser to the coalition government ontacklinganti-Muslim hatred, and say, “wow, this guy’s been on a journey”. What were the waypoints of his slide from “just asking the questions”, throughdog-whistle racism, to brazen ethno-nationalism? What could have been the trigger events? Which bad crowd has he fallen in with?The author James Bloodworth, whomapped Goodwin’s journey rigorouslylast summer, considers him the intellectual mascot of the politics of resentment. He quoted Goodwin thus: “I just spent four days in Hungary, a conservative country criticised by elites across the west. I saw no crime. No homeless people. No riots. No unrest. No drugs. No mass immigration. No broken borders. No self-loathing. No chaos. And now I’ve just landed back in the UK.” These talking points are all commonplace on the hard and far right; migration is situated asa wellspring of social ills, from crime and disunity, through drug use and housing crises, and it is stated with so much confidence, so little evidence or logic, that it’s really more of a muster point than an opinion held in good faith.Yet if you were talking to the Goodwin of 2014, the young academic in a hurry, who wrote densely researched books on the BNP and Ukip, you would have a few follow-up questions, like: how exactly does one measure self-loathing at a national level? Some kind of poll, I would guess, but it’s unclear how you’d pose the question (“do you, considering yourself a part of Hungary, hate that self and by extension, hate Hungary? No? Great news!”). You’d want to know this wasn’t bare assertion, you’d want to know its methodology.Even as recently as last year, there was a trace of relief and exhilaration, when the intellectuals of the hard right said the quiet part out loud, whether it was Goodwin, orDouglas Carswell’s skin-crawling“from Epping to the sea, let’s make England Abdul free”. At least you knew you weren’t imagining it, and other people could hear it too. The Goodwin of 2025 blamed the Huntingdon train stabbings on “mass uncontrolled immigration” and, confronted with the fact that the suspected perpetrator was British, went on to opine “So were all of the 7/7 bombers. It takes more than a piece of paper to make somebody ‘British’.” Again, there was time when you’d have been itching to go back in time a decade, and ask the same Goodwin what he thought Britishness was, if not being born and raised here: was it colour coded? What the hell other kind of code did he have in mind?To borrow the phrase du jour, the time for talk is over. There is absolutely no ambiguity about Goodwin’s views. He makes no attempt to hide or resile from them. And that ethno-nationalist outlook aligns with Nigel Farage’swould-be policy platform: abolish indefinite leave to remain; deport hundreds of thousands of people.In announcing Goodwin’s candidacy, Reform has turned this byelection into a battle about race and belonging. Inevitably, many will find comfort in poll-watching, minutely tracking the data and persuading themselves and one another that Manchester is too diverse, too unified, too sophisticated for a twin-track politics in which citizens’ legitimacy is contingent upon on their skin colour. But the other parties in this fight cannot afford to lull themselves into this kind of security, and have to start thinking beyond the parameters of their own advantage and victory; any move they make in this byelection will signal how serious they are about fighting toxicity in politics.Predictably, Keir Starmer has already urged voters to unite around the Labour candidate, billing this person, as yet unannounced, as the only one who can beat Reform.The lesson of Caerphilly, only three months ago, is that voters will figure out for themselves who the only realistic victor is, and will not have it dictated to them. In that case, it was Plaid Cymru, whose swing was less pronounced than Reform’s (19 points v 34), but who ultimately lifted more of Labour’s disaffected voters and won the seat. Labour has also put out itsfirst attack video, and predictably, it’s not against Reform. It’s against the Greens.The Greens, also in the middle of choosing a candidate, have gone in hard onwhat they call Goodwin’s anti-Muslim record, and emphasised their own politics of unity and hope. Even while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives were nowhere in this seat in 2024 (4% and 8% respectively), the Greens will need to borrow votes from everywhere to be in contention, and choosing prejudice as their enemy is broad but might work.One other party has announced: George Galloway’s Workers party is fielding Shahbaz Sarwar, a local councillor. Funnily enough, Galloway’s obnoxiously masculinist, strong-man positioning probably means this party is pitching at the same voters Reform is, for all their differences on Islamophobia.The spectacle might be depressing, but it’s not familiar; the hard right has evolved. Any strategy from its opponents that doesn’t recognise that will fail.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But for a country shaped by booze, it does pose questions about what comes nextWed 28 Jan 2026 10.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 13.35 ESTShareIt’s November 2024 and my puritanical American children are attending their first autumn fair at their new English primary school. There’s a laser show and hotdogs and a raffle. There’s also a bar for the parents, which makes my two pull up short. Newcomers to this country experience many cultural differences but perhaps none as striking as this: “Is that alcohol?” says my child, scowling up at me like a tiny member of the Taliban. “At a school thing?” I’m two Baileys hot chocolates in at this point and give her a smile 10% broader than necessary. Yes, my darlings; welcome to Britain.Or at least, welcome, possibly, to the last vestiges of how Britain once was. For a while now we’ve known anecdotally that people in this country are drinking less than they were. My own generation X is deep into middle age and many of us – save for the odd life-saver at a school event and the biggest occasions – have given it up. Where the anomalies fall more glaringly is in the generations below us, among young people whose behaviour differs from our own at their age. This week, official confirmation came in the form of a survey of 10,000 people commissioned by the NHS that found almost a quarter (24%) of adults in England hadnot drunk alcoholin 2024, an increase from just under a fifth (19%) in 2022.The top line, of course, is that this is a good thing. Not for the drinks industry, obviously, but for theNHS, and also for people trying to maximise their life expectancy, which is all of us. Rigorous self-optimisation via application to the data is how we spend our leisure time these days, on the strength of which, after reading a piece about cancer-reducing foods this morning, I bought a “wheatberry, lentil and green vegetable salad” that I’m almost certainly not going to eat. What even is a wheatberry? Nobody knows. The point is we’re trying.If I sound sarcastic, I don’t mean to. I love not drinking. And it’s important not to join the ranks of those people in the generation above mine who, in the 1990s, whensmoking banstook hold across the US, wrote long pieces arguing that cigarettes represented the buccaneer spirit of the country and, as a result, smokers were more interesting than people who drank “green juice”. These were, objectively, the worst people in the world and, while no one likes a teetotaller, it’s important to resist turning into them.My interest is more in what youth culture will look like without alcohol. The new survey results, which were commissioned as part of the Health Survey for England, found that women are slightly less likely to drink than men and that across the age groups young people are the most abstemious. In the2022 NHS survey, gen Z reportedly contained the lowest proportion of people who drank frequently (10%), compared with 34% among 55 to 64-year-olds and 37% of 65 to 74-year-olds. Some of this is cost-of-living related, but most of it is likely to be cultural. It’s just not cool to be wasted.Why are saunas suddenly everywhere? I think it’s to do with booze | Zoe WilliamsRead moreIn my own case, the calculation to cut back had less to do with cultural trends and more to do with the sudden, sad collapse of my metabolism, plus the fact I changed primary-care physicians. During the intake interview a few years ago, my new doctor made a note of what everyone in my family going back three generations had died of, before giving me a very stern look. “If I were you I wouldn’t drink,” she said. “At all.” This was harsh, but she was right.And yet, still my imagination falters. I look at my two and wonder what, when they’re 25, a Saturday night out will look like if it doesn’t terminate in them lying half off the sofa crying to Elaine Paige doing the big ballad from Chess. Where will their war stories come from? (Actual war, probably, but let’s not think about that.) What will they reminisce about when they are my age?There’s nothing funny about my friend who threw up into a heating vent and, for the rest of her tenancy, couldn’t expunge the smell of sick from her flat. Standing, swaying gently, in the middle of a busy A-road trying to work out a strategy for getting to the other side that didn’t involve putting one foot in front of the other isn’t funny, either. I told my children this story and they were horrified. “You could’ve DIED,” they said, which was precisely the teachable moment I was after.Meanwhile, the new findings aren’t anything to grow complacent about, since, even with these reduced numbers, we’re still sufficiently a nation of alcoholics to cost the NHS in England£4.9bn a yearin alcohol-related illness. In the spirit of which: I’m actually quite looking forward to eating my salad. I’m going to put an egg in it because, while not drinking is extremely good for you, as everyone knows it’s actually protein that will save us.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAlcoholOpinionNHSHealthYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

The smart move is to waitGreg JerichoOh no, inflation went up in one month – we need rates to do something! But first, let’s take a closer look at those figuresFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastWed 28 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 18.01 ESTShareThere is a kind of sickness in Australia’s coverage and discussion about the economy – an obsession that interest rates need to do something. Go up, go down – anything! Unemployment fell, interest rates must do something (apparently fewer people being out of a job is bad and needs to be cured). Oh no, inflation went up in one month – we need interest rates to do something!!We see this as well with investors – or let’s be honest, speculators – who are determined that interest rates will go up next week.Even before theDecember CPI figures were released, investors were betting (and that is all it is) that there was a 58% chance the Reserve Bank of Australia would increase rates on 3 February:If the graph does not display click hereAfter the figures were released, showing inflation rose from 3.4% in November to 3.8% in December, the market moved to price in the chances of a rate rise at closer to two chances in three.The Australian dollar also had a bit of a bump. This is because international investors who think rates will go up need to buy Australian dollars in order to buy Australian bonds and other financial instruments that will start getting higher interest returns.So, when more people want Australian dollars, the “price” (or exchange rate) goes up. Since the December unemployment figures showed a big drop in unemployment to 4.1%, investors have been betting a rate rise is coming.If the graph does not display click hereThe December inflation figure of 3.8% would suggest this as well – especially as in December alone, inflation rose a pretty huge 1%:If the graph does not display click hereBut let’s look at that 1% jump.If you are thinking that seems a bit big – perhaps even bigger than you experienced – well, you are probably right. International holidays and travel accounted for 71% of all of the inflation in December, and domestic holidays accounted for another 26%.If the graph does not display click hereSo large was the contribution of holiday prices, that if you removed those from the overall figures, inflation in December rose just 0.02%, and the annual growth of inflation would have remained steady:If the graph does not display click hereNow, that does not mean that the RBA will put its feet up and decide things are sweet. Even without holiday travel, inflation of 3.3% is higher than it would like. But it does suggest that the bank really should not get too excited about these figures.Over the past year, the big driver of inflation was international holidays and also electricity. However, while electricity accounted for about 10% of all the increase in inflation in the past year, almost all of it was due to the removal of energy subsidies in Perth and Brisbane.If the graph does not display click hereElectricity prices in Brisbane in December 2025 were 456% higher than they were a year earlier – because in December 2024 the state energy subsidies were in place. Similarly, in Perth, apparently electricity prices rose 75%, whereas again it was just the impact of the state subsidies.Removing the big erratic items of holidays and electricity, annual inflation peaked in October at 3.1% and in both November and December it steadied at 3.0%.Now obviously you can play around with the numbers to get whatever result you like, but it does show the danger for the RBA (and any speculators) being fixated on the overall number and not looking more closely.The Reserve Bank will examine the old quarterly figures as well. These showed CPI in the December quarter rise a modest 0.6%, while the trimmed mean (or underlying) inflation rose 0.9%. The annual figures for both increased, but again this was due to electricity subsidies – as the old figures included them; the latest ones do not.So what will the RBA do next week? The easy thing is to raise rates. There are plenty of economic and financial chin scratchers around who love the idea of higher interest rates. If they raise rates they will get little criticism – after all the market wants them to raise rates.But there is no sign that wages are taking off, even though unemployment is below 4.5%. Indeed, the latest job vacancy figures suggest that it is getting harder to find work, not easier – and that suggests wage growth will also keep slowing.If the graph does not display click hereThe easy thing for the RBA to do is raise rates, point to the overall inflation figures and hope no one looks any further. The smart move is to look closer, and wait.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist at the Australia InstituteExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsInterest ratesInflationReserve Bank of AustraliacommentShareReuse this content"

What is the appropriate response here? Decry and sue? Shrug and move on? I ponder the question as I stroll through my local supermarket, where the mackerel fillets are wreathed in metal security chains and the dishwasher tabs have to be requested from the storeroom like an illicit little treat.On the way home, I screenshot and crop a news article and share it to one of my WhatsApp groups. In another group, a family member has posted an AI-generated video (“forwarded many times”) of Donald Trump getting his head shaved by Xi Jinping while Joe Biden laughs in the background. I watch the mindless slop on my phone as I walk along the main road, instinctively gripping my phone a little tighter as I do so.Increasingly, by small and imperceptible degrees, we seem to live in a world defined by petty theft; petty not in its scale or volume but by its sense of entitlement and impunity. A joke, a phone, an article, theisland of Greenland, the entire canon of published literature, a bag of dishwasher tablets: everything, it seems, is fair game. How did we get to this point, and where does it lead us?Perhaps we should start on the internet, where technology has essentially legitimised and embedded stealing into our shared digital culture. Aggregator websites, viral meme accounts, screenshots, copy and paste, the abundance and ubiquity of the feed: all these serve to blur the relationship between the creator and creation, sweeping up our ideas, thoughts and pictures into a common buffet. It feels frictionless, victimless, even empowering. The rewards for virality are high and the penalties almost nonexistent.And so when the first generative AI models started training themselves on billions of items of scraped content – copyrighted writing, music and art – in a sense they were simply following in an established tradition. There was, writes Karen Hao in her book Empire of AI, “a culture among developers to view anything and everything as data to be captured and consumed”. John Phelan of the International Confederation of Music Publishersdescribes itas “the largest intellectual property theft in human history”.But there are no police on the scene, no screaming sirens, no bounties and “wanted” posters. If big tech wants your stuff, and governments around the worldwant to let them have it, there is no emergency number to call, just a fog of obfuscations and plaintive wailing about the viability of the business model. Please, my family is starving. My family loves to eat private photos and personal data. Also, my family is allergic to copyright law.But, of course, the internet did not invent all of this. Theft itself is as old as time, perhaps one of the oldest human behaviours of all: a strategy of adaptation and learned imitation driven above all by asymmetries of power, wealth and opportunity. Often it gets justified in the same terms. Inequality creates thieves on both sides, not just one. It cements thievery as one of the defining principles upon which society is run. The street thief and the colonial empire-builder are thus bound by a common understanding of the rules of play, a kind of anti-honour code, in which acquisition is rebranded as a form of victorious conquest.Perhaps it is no surprise that this culture is defined most strongly by a US president who boasts of his ability to grab whatever he wants, from a Venezuelan oil tanker, to classified documents, to a frozen Atlantic island, to a woman’s private parts. Donald Trump represents the doctrine of coercive acquisition as a kind of founding principle. His plan for the Vegas-style reconstruction of Gaza, unveiled by Jared Kushnerat Davos last weekand rich in AI imagery, reads like a kind of kleptomaniac wet dream.Naturally he has been abetted by the fact that on a global level, the taboo over naked territorial land grabs – from Crimea to the West Bank – has largely been eroded. In a world of heightened securitisation, the theft of land can simply be spun as a tool of survival. For Trump and many of his fellow autocrats, the new age of neocolonial expansionism is simply an extension of natural law, the spoils of being strong in a world of the weak.In these small learned increments, a world is remade along stolen lines. And on a deeper level the age of theft seems to express something vital about how we see others as fellow members of a species, about how we regard rules and conventions when our leaders appear to find them less relevant than ever. When entire countries are built on stolen labour, when entire peoples are forced from their land so it can be turned into something resembling a casino, suddenly watching Everton v Leeds United on a pirated stream feels like a comparatively innocuous crime.In some of my more idle dystopian daydreams I used to wonder what might happen ifGoogleor WhatsApp simply decided one morning to take all your emails and messages hostage, and demand a life-altering ransom for their release. Does this seem so dystopian now? If personal boundaries are now a chimera and ownership is simply hard power by another name, at what point does mass theft begin to resemble an unanswerable business case?“[A] great embarrassing fact [that] haunts all attempts to represent the market as the highest form of human freedom: that historically, impersonal, commercial markets originate in theft.” A great line, albeit one stolen from David Graeber, whom I like to think would have appreciated the irony. In the meantime, all we can really do is grip our phones a little tighter, put watermarks and firewalls around our creative output, vote for parties that will address inequality rather than aggravate it. And in a small polite voice, ask the shop assistant if they wouldn’t mind unlocking the mackerel fillets when they have a moment.Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIntellectual propertyOpinionAI (artificial intelligence)InternetGooglecommentShareReuse this content"

Admittedly, he then repeated these sentiments in a post on X, in the time-honoured manner of parents solemnly lecturing children to do as we say, not as we do.Yet Macron is not wrong. Thebacklash building upagainst social media now is unmistakable, as guilt over all those hours wasted scrolling meets growing alarm at the ugly and dystopian world big tech has helped create. Only last week the Labour MP Jess Asato,a government adviseron violence against women, described how an X user had created an AI-generated video of her being chloroformed and prepared for rape. Who wants their 14-year-old daughter hanging out somewhere that happens? Though teens mostly prefer TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat to X, it’s the grim excesses of the platform under Elon Musk that have shaken many adults out of complacency.Parents arebeguiled by tales of Australian kidsrediscovering bike rides and board games, after under-16s were banned from social media just in time for the antipodean summer. Teacherssick of dealingwith the fallout from adolescent social media beef, or the inevitable after-effects of kids staying up all night on their phones, want action. The surest sign of which wayLabour winds are blowing, meanwhile, is that the health secretary, Wes Streeting,recently invitedthe pro-ban campaigning author Jonathan Haidt in to address officials, while the thwarted leadership hopeful Andy Burnham suggests a crackdownmakes sense to him. Yet Downing Street has hesitated, leaving Kemi Badenoch totake advantage, for once, of an open goal. The Conservatives haveamended the children’s wellbeing and schools billgoing through the House of Lords in order to put the idea of a ban on the table, and will use an opposition day debate this Wednesday to hammer their point home, somewhat awkwardly for Labour MPs who broadly agree with the idea but don’t want to see the Tories take the credit.Personally, I wasn’t convinced for a long time of the case for a ban. What changed my mind was realising how gen Z, now old enough to reflect on growing up in a social media free-for-all, feels about it. Half of 16- to 24-year-olds wish they’d spent less time on their phones and three-quarters want tougher regulation to protect young people from social media,according to recent pollingfor the thinktank The New Britain Project. When teenagers themselves say that they’d keep their own future children away from it for as long as possible, alarm bells should be ringing. And, though some will of course find enterprising ways around a ban, in itself that’s not an excuse for doing nothing; there’s a booming trade in fake ID for underage drinkers, but we don’t just give up and let 14-year-olds drink until they black out. Legislating on teenage harms is less about prohibition than setting social norms until they’re old enough to regulate their own intake, and protecting them from industries otherwise only too ready to exploit them.That said, the ongoinggovernment consultationon teens and social media should be given the time and space to consider more serious objections. Ian Russell,whose daughter Molly tragically killed herself after viewing endless images of self-harm on Instagram, hasmade a thoughtful casethat the Online Safety Act (designed to outlaw the most egregious material) should be given a chance to work. Children’s charities,including the NSPCC, are worried about teenagers banned from the big platforms experimenting with riskier alternatives, and about the cliff-edge potentially created for kids let loose at 16 on social media with little experience of it. (Though the more countries follow Australia’s example, the greater the incentive for platforms to do what the former Meta executive Nick Clegg advocatedwhen I interviewed him, and create teen versions of their product. Companies tend to innovate remarkably quickly when facing an existential threat to the business model.)The most powerful argument against a ban, however, is that it’s not the easy answer to a teenage mental health crisis some want it to be. The evidence is still so mixed that it’s unclear whether being glued to a phone makes children miserable, or whether miserable teens spend more time online seeking comfort. New research from the University of Manchester,tracking 25,000 children, finds no evidence linking heavier social media use or gaming in one school year with increased anxiety and depression the next.Yet the researchers didn’t conclude that social media was harmless: more that teenagers are complicated, and that adults should pay more attention to what they’re doing both on and offline. Age limits for social media could fit alongside properly funded children’s mental health services, more things for teenagers to do away from a screen – the recent government announcement offunding for youth clubswas a start – an honest reckoning with what else threatens children’s wellbeing, from poverty to academic stress, and some uncomfortable questions about parenting. If a four-year-old is already so online that they try toswipe a bookrather than read it, as a survey of reception teachers for the charity Kindred Squared recently reported, that’s not big tech’s fault.A ban is not, then, a panacea. But it ought to be part of a broader national mission for happier childhoods, which recognises that as a society we have for some time been asleep at the wheel. It’s not too late, even now, to wake up.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Even when relations with the host country are tricky, as Britain’s are withChina, the dignifying protocols of statecraft make a beleaguered politician feel valued.Next comes the phase where missions overseas feel dangerous because plotters can organise more openly against absent leaders.Keir Starmer is in transit between those two zones of decline. His position is not yet imperilled by therow over Andy Burnham’s thwarted ambitionto run in the Gorton and Denton byelection. But he will be glad that a flight to Beijing puts thousands of miles between him and Labour MPs petitioning to reverse the party’s national executive committee ruling against the Greater Manchester mayor’s candidacy.Starmer justifiably thinks thefirst visit by a UK prime minister to China since 2018is a bigger deal than some story about weaponisation of the party rulebook to block a potential challenger. He would be unwise to neglect how much this stuff matters in Labour.He is unusual in having reached the top of the party with little experience of the culture, the lore, the unintended consequences that can spiral out fromprocedural combat.There was plenty of machination to consolidate Starmer’s position in opposition, marginalising the left and stitching up candidate selections to recruit a cadre of future loyalists. But that was outsourced to Morgan McSweeney, the leader’s chief of staff.Once installed in No 10, Starmer felt no obligation to care about internalLabourpolitics. Nor did he cultivate relationships with those new MPs who would, he assumed, dutifully enact government policy.New ministers were disappointed by how little they saw of the prime minster. Officials have been surprised by his lack of interest in politics, and not just measured by obsessional Westminster standards. It isn’t his thing. He cannot be drawn into discussion of ideas. People who have tried say he treats abstraction as indulgence; a bit “wanky”.That helps explain why Starmer quickly came to like the foreign side of his job. International summitry puts pragmatism in the foreground. Whether the mission is resetting relations with theEuropean Union, making nice with Donald Trump or, as this week, building bridges with Beijing, there is not much advantage in turning up with ideological baggage.To a man who sees himself as a master problem-solver, the current global disorder looks like a puzzle consisting of overlapping pieces that might calmly and methodically be arranged to fit the national interest.This gives him an answer to critics who wish he would challenge leaders who are doctrinally opposed to democracy, such as Xi Jinping, or just despise it casually, such as Trump. Starmer dismisses the call for “performative” condemnations that would achieve only loss of influence with a superpower.The prime minister did eventually feel compelled to criticise Trump last week, for demanding Greenland with menaces and belittling the role of UK armed forces in Afghanistan. But he never connects individual offences into a broader critique of the US president’s authoritarian agenda.Likewise, Starmer can find some diplomatic formula that implies a rebuke to China over espionage, support for Vladimir Putin, the dismantling of civil rights in Hong Kong and other repressions, but without sounding confrontational.To the extent that the UK government has a foreign policy doctrine, this is it. Beyond the theatre of war in Ukraine and the enmity with Putin, principles are to be declared, but not as obstacles to cooperation.Starmer spelled this out in aspeech last December. He would use engagement on every front to maximise Britain’s interests. He refused to accept that there would sometimes be conflicting priorities. “We don’t trade off security in one area for a bit more economic access somewhere else,” he said.He observed that the rest of this century will be dominated by “the US, the EU and China, all interacting with each other” and that “our future will be determined by how we navigate this dynamic”. But here, too, he did not envisage hard choices or sacrifices. Partnership with everyone will bring prosperity for all.Starmer has often insisted that Britain doesn’t face a geopolitical dilemma when it comes toalignment with Washington or Brussels. Now he says the same about the risk of US displeasure at his courtship of China. “I am often invited to simply choose between countries,”he said in an interviewahead of his trip to Beijing. “I don’t do that.”Like any balancing act, this works until force is applied from one side or the other. Starmer is already hitting the limit to what can be achieved with the EU from a position of mid-Atlantic ambivalence. Negotiations grind slowly on over topics already agreed in principle – defence cooperation, agricultural imports and so on. But there is not much bandwidth in Brussels for fiddling at the margins of the existing Brexit settlement and vanishing confidence that Starmer has the will to do much more.On the US side, Trump’s threat of tariffs as punishment for siding with Denmark over Greenland and the derision he heaped on a previously agreed deal over the Chagos Islands serve as a warning: the fruits of sycophancy can be discarded in a presidential tantrum. Constructive cooperation with China is only ever one big spy scandal away from angry decoupling.Pragmatism is necessary in pursuit of any policy. But for Starmer itisthe policy. It is an end in itself – the paramount virtue, held up as superior to rigid dogma, which is fair, but also, less convincingly, as the riposte to any demand for clarity of principle or purpose.There is a pattern here. Starmer’s promise to Labour when he first sought the leadership was ecumenism between factions. He didn’t think he would have to choosebetween left and right. Only once he was persuaded that Corbynism was toxic to swing voters did he license its extirpation by the party machine. Even then, he didn’t really win an argument in terms of what was right in principle, he shut it down on the basis of what was electorally practical.In the 2024 general election campaign, Starmer told voters they could have national renewal without painful fiscal choices. Then he spent a year inflicting pain, saying it was necessary, without describing a cause to make it feel justified.This approach has failed on the domestic front. It will run out of international road, too. In an age of power bloc rivalries, pragmatic engagement in every direction is a denial of strategic dilemmas, postponing crises not averting them. But that is the Starmer way. He is the politician who avoids politics, the problem-solver who hates to name a problem, the leader whose first choice is never to choose.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourForeign policyChinaAndy BurnhamEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Albanese’s leadership has been marked down but it’s the former Coalition that has taken the broader political hit.If a federal election was held tomorrow, to which party would you give your first preference vote in the House of Representatives (lower house)?One Nation now has a legitimate claim as Australia’s second party, breaking 20% for the first time and creating real headaches for calculating a two-party preferred vote.For Albanese, there is no sugar coating these numbers either; the Labor primary is down and his 53% disapproval (up eight points from December) is lower than after the 2023 voice referendum, the last time our nation’s capacity for empathy was put to the test.Guardian Essential poll: One Nation’s primary vote soars to record high amid Coalition chaosRead moreThat loss forced a recalibration in his leadership style, eschewing the big picture of national identity as an indulgence and deferring to a retail incrementalism that focused on the hip pocket. It was a wildly successful pivot.The discomfort Albanese experienced in the immediate wake of Bondi was a direct result of these strategic choices not to confront the difficult bigger issues of nationhood.First, his failure to differentiate antisemitism from legitimate criticism of the Israeli government’s response to the October 7 massacre breathed life into what was a straw man erected to minimisegenocide.Second was the decision to receive but not actively engage with his antisemitism envoy’s report which sought to intervene in universities and cultural institutions. This allowed the issueto drift.Third, the government’s failure to advance theAustralian Human Rights Commissionnational anti-racism framework meant that when the unthinkable happened on Bondi beach, the PM was on shifting sands with nothing to anchor his response.If this was the end of the story, Albanese would now be in dire political trouble; instead, things have worked in his favour in surprising ways.The naked exploitation of this tragedy from some conservative politicians and a pro-Israel lobby, especially Benjamin Netanyahu’s outrageous intervention linking Australian recognition of Palestine with the attack,has not been broadly embraced.Meanwhile the belated decision to call a federal royal commission, the tightening of gun laws and criminalising of hate speech have been met with broad public approval. Like most moments of national crisis, the public simply wants government to act.To what extent do you support or oppose the following initiatives as a result of the December 2025 terrorist attack at Bondi beach?Where the royal commission would have sucked up much of the political oxygen over the coming months, the collapse of the Coalition and the rise of One Nation will serve as its own morality play on the politics of division.Way before Bondi, Albanese had identified kindness as his aspirational operating principle in government – indeed it was a centrepiece of his final pitch to the nation before the 2025 election. The challenge is that “kindness” is both a noun (our kind) and verb (to act with generosity of spirit, the empathy to see our common humanity).One Nation would love the political debate to centre around the noun; a rallying cry to mobilise around immigration, law and order and general disdain for minority groups. In its weakened state the former Coalition parties will inevitability be dragged into this vortex.For Albanese to truly lead with kindness requires not just asserting, but defining the verb. There have been a few attempts to build some sort of kindness index, notably a one-off a few years ago by abread company, but most of the indicators seem to be about manners rather than broader values.When asked to rate the nation’s kindness, Australians like to think of ourselves as displaying the characteristics of kindness, assuming others have good intentions, caring for those doing it tough, being aware of our impact on others.To what extent do you agree or disagree that Australians exhibit the following qualities?But there are also contradictions; on all the key indicators we see ourselves as being kinder than others, which itself betrays a kindness deficiency.These findings are an illustration of what Dutch philosopher Rutger Bregman identifies in his bookHumankindas the “Golem effect” where negative expectations of others become a self-fulfilling prophecy, the malign opposite to a placebo.The Liberals’ fatal flaw was becoming Nationals-lite. Here’s how they can come back from the brink | Tony BarryRead more“Every day, we make each other smarter or stupider, stronger or faster, weaker or slower”, he writes. “My expectations of you define my attitude towards you, and the way I behave towards you in turn influences your expectations and therefore your behaviour towards me.”Such a position is neither mawkish nor milquetoast: this politics is harder, and riskier too, because it involves trusting the public’s better angels; a mutual respect without reverting to the identity politics that magnifies our differences.A politics of kindness could breathe fresh life into a broader policy agenda that looks beyond our own material wellbeing to encompass the plights of those who are struggling, both here and abroad, and recognising that improving their plight makes us stronger, not weaker.With a massive electoral buffer and a broken opposition, Albanese has the rare opportunity to lead by moving beyond the tedious default of binary politics to something more inclusive, that sees the good inside of us all rather than spending all our energy in conjuring up the bad.Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that undertook research for Labor in the last election and conducts qualitative research for Guardian Australia.

But did she get too cosy with the worlds of fashion and advertising?Philip OltermannWed 28 Jan 2026 11.36 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 12.26 ESTShare‘Idon’t know what you want to know,” says Anne Imhof, three-quarters of the way into our interview. Her cautious smile, between curtains of jet black hair, changes into a sceptical pout. I have just quoted a headline at Imhof, one of Germany’s most important contemporary artists, that described her 2025 New York show as“a bad Balenciaga ad”.Just a few years ago, Imhof was the hottest ticket on the international art circuit: a Golden Lion winner at the 2017 Venice Biennale, whose transformation of the German pavilion into a sinister, S&M-flavoured “catwalk show from hell” had masses scrambling to join the queue. Imhof was a cultural polymath whose shows combined etchings, paintings, dance, live music and film; a muse to fashion designers whose sporty goth aesthetic – Adidas tracksuit bottoms, chunky trainers, black leather – beseiged the clubs of Berlin and beyond.‘I built a fence around the house the Nazis built – and let dogs piss on its steps’But her last sprawling mega-show, at the Park Avenue Armory in New York, was met with mixed reviews in US broadsheets and proper drubbings in hipster online journals such as Hyperallergic and Spike. Suddenly the next generation seemed all too eager to cancel her membership of the cool club. Still, I had expected she would rise to me bringing it up. Instead, the shutters come down. The arms she enthusiastically waved across the screen minutes earlier are now locked across her chest. My questions become longer, her answers shorter. “Do you want to say I’m dated as an artist?” she asks when I say that the music she has just released for herdebut albumreminds me of 1990s grunge. “Actually, this is getting quite exhausting,” she says and soon after ends our call (though she later agrees to continue the interview via email).View image in fullscreenCritical moment … last year’s Doom: House of Hope, which was called ‘a bad Balenciaga ad’.Photograph: George Etheredge/New York Times/Redux/eyevineWhat most likely caused the annoyance wasn’t the criticism as such, more the fact that it wasn’t direct enough. Because open conflict is something Imhof, now 48, always seemed to thrive on. Educated at private schools in Germany and Britain, she was suspended from a boarding school in Bath on the grounds –in her telling– that she had an “evil eye” and was bewitching other girls. While studying art in Offenbach and Frankfurt, she moonlit as a bouncer at the Robert Johnson nightclub. The first entry in hercatalogue raisonnéis a performance she put on at a red-light bar, where two boxers had to fight each other until a band in the other corner played their last note.Later, in her 30s, Imhof was commissioned to fill the German pavilion at Venice, a building re-designed by the Nazis in 1938. “I decided to make things visible that are obviously problematic in my country,” she explained at the start of our interview. “I built a fence around the house that the Nazis built, and I let dogs piss on the staircase leading up to it.”Called Faust, the work did not just showcase Imhof’s taste for conflict, but also her gift for conjuring up images that obliquely capture the spirit of our age. Once visitors got past the menacing dobermans patrolling outside, they found themselves walking across a raised glass floor that spanned the building and unsettled its occupants. The feeling was exacerbated by a crew of dead-eyed performers in black sportswear, who roamed among and below the crowd, playing thrash metal or sulkily hovering over their phones.In front of my eyes, Faust became something the audience createdAll the cultural preoccupations of the 2010s were there: the militarisation of physical borders on land, the melting away of barriers in the digital sphere, tech surveillance and Apple Store aesthetics. Imhof says she was living in Frankfurt at the time, home to the European Central Bank, which played a key role in the decades of sovereign debt crises. “Their buildings are mostly made of glass,” says Imhhof. “That transparency is supposed to unite the inside and the outside. But glass creates separation as much as it does visibility.”Faust was also one of the first major art shows that seemed to be specially designed for Instagram. “It was the height of social media becoming a new way of communicating,” says Imhof. “In front of my eyes, Faust turned from something I created into something the audience created. They were coming up with their own edits, their own iconography.”The trouble with art that captures the zeitgeist, of course, is that the zeitgeist moves on, relentlessly. Entitled Doom: House of Hope and performed underneath a giant ticking doomsday clock, Imhof’s three-hour New York show swapped out some cultural signifiers – out went the Germanic guard dogs, in came high-school jocks, cheerleaders and grunge kids. But it featured many of the same performers as the Venice show and reprised a feeling of existential exhaustion: “We’re fucked, we’re doomed, we’re dead / I think I made you up inside my head.” That was one of the choruses chanted by Imhof’s roving cast. Hyperallergic’s critic called it “excessively pessimistic about the future” and “comically apolitical”.View image in fullscreenIn at the deep end … the pool from Fun is a Steel Bath.Photograph: João MorgadoHer dalliances with the world of fashion, too, have invited a backlash, which might explain her bristling at the “Balenciaga ad” dig. After years of serving as a semi-official muse for Balenciaga’s former creative director Demna, she designed a moody show for Burberry during lockdown in 2020. Last year, she put on a “battle of the bands” performance sponsored by Nike, including a special-edition football top with “Imhof” written on the back.This winter, she and her new partner, US ballet dancer Devon Teuscher, were photographed in a hotel bed dressed in Valentino, for the Italian fashion brand’s new campaign. German newspaper Welt said her career was starting to resemble a cautionary tale of what happens to artists who get into bed with the fashion industry: “One front-row appearance is one too many.”How has Imhof bounced back from this? Does she now feel pressure to be more politically explicit? “I think I have a responsibility towards my work,” she says, “but also towards the people I work with, not to make political statements just to make pieces more desirable. It’s not that I think art isn’t political – on the contrary. It’s about creating a space you share, in which you show moments of love and care, as extremely skilled people give everything. My goal is not to politicise my art, or to justify it in that context, to monetise or profit on that. Revolutions don’t happen inside a museum space.”I don’t think the future of art lies in making it into some elite bubbleThe title of Imhof’s latest exhibition, Fun ist ein Stahlbad, or Fun is a Steel Bath, could be read as her answering her critics on the politics point. Showing at the Serralves Foundation in Porto, it cites the philosopher Theodor Adorno, for whom naive hope has no place in modern art: at best, artists can create works that expose how deeply damaged our world has become.While previous Imhof shows were emphatically immersive, this one is filled with sculptures designed to be uninviting: in the courtyard, Imhof has built an empty swimming pool out of black metal, the literal steel bath of the title. Elsewhere, there is a grid of crowd-control barriers. “The viewer confronts a sculpture that already embodies control rather than being guided through it,” she says. “The body becomes a site of thought, movement a form of intelligence – that is inherently political.”In another corner, a four-channel film overlays footage of the New York show with a passage from Australian science-fiction writer Greg Egan’s novel Diaspora, about a dystopian, proto-fascist future in which software births genderless beings without parents. Pessimism, she seems to be saying, can be political too.“A lot of things have changed since I made Faust in 2017, when maybe we were at the height of social media,” she says. “Perhaps now it is not about the presence of bodies, or about being seen. It’s more about sheltering a certain artistic autonomy and having to mimic something to be not taken in by it.”View image in fullscreenZebra crossing … a still from a video work for Wish You Were Gay.Photograph: Anne ImhofDoes it all add up? Adorno was a firm believer that artistic autonomy could only be sheltered in high-modernist art, and that all entertainment was essentially a form of cultural coercion. But Imhof makes art that wants to be autonomous and popular, pulling in anything from painting to graffiti, from rock to rap, from modern dance to classical ballet. This debut album WYWG (short for “Wish You Were Gay”) contains songs she mostly wrote in the early noughties, bearing the influence of hard-to-digest acts like Genesis P-Orridge and Black Flag. Yet some songs, Brand New Gods for instance, also bring to mind the Velvet Underground: austere but surprisingly catchy. “I think there is a need or a desire of mine to make my work accessible,” she says. “I don’t think the future of art lies in making it into some elite bubble.”Artists who design football shirts may be breaking out of the art world bubble, but if they make that shirt for Nike, are they still “mimicking something in order not to be taken in by it”? Or are they just making lifestyle consumer products, pure and simple?“When I talk about mimicry, I mean a strategy for staying alert within powerful systems, including social structures, as a means of survival,” she says. “Fashion and art are not separate moral systems. They both involve labour, production, and circulation that aren’t fully transparent. For me, the question is more about agency: who makes decisions, who is involved, and whether the work can maintain its critical position while moving through these systems.”Adorno might be the patron saint of her Porto show, but would he have approved of her work for Nike? “My interest is not in claiming moral purity, but in remaining aware of the conditions of production – who is involved, how labour is treated, and what choices I make as an artist. Collaborating with fashion or popular culture doesn’t surrender autonomy.”Fun ist ein Stahlbad is atFundação de Serralves, Porto,until 19 April;WYWGis out on Pan RecordsExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPerformance artSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Grisa now lived there alone with his 120 ducks and other animals. The two other remaining residents were murdered by a farmer from a neighbouring village’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 28 Jan 2026 10.09 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 12.26 ESTShareThis was taken in a village in rural Moldova that no longer exists. Thirty years ago, Dobrușa had a population of 200, and was typical of settlements found across the country after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. When this man Grisa moved there in 2000 to start a sheep farm, the population had declined to 70. When this was taken, in July 2019, he was the sole resident of the village. He was 65.A few months before I took it, the only other remaining residents – a couple in their 40s – were murdered by a farmer from a neighbouring village. Their half-naked bodies were found on the ground. They’d been beaten to death. It was a very dark story and, after this terrible incident, Grisa told me he no longer felt safe living alone there. He was thinking about moving to a bigger village.He presented me with a glass of wine, which was how he started his dayHe had a lot of animals so was not completely alone: turkeys, geese, chickens, pigeons, bees and 120 ducks, many of them in the picture. His day began at 4am. When I went to photograph him for an assignment on the rural areas of Moldova for the New York Times, I wanted to start the day as he did, at sunrise. He offered me a cup of coffee when I arrived – then he presented me with a glass of wine, which was how he started his day. He would then tend to his animals, pick his vegetables and collect his honey, which he sold at a local market. Later, he would go back to make food for himself. He lived a very simple life. He showed me pictures of when he was a soldier in the Soviet army.I don’t know what it’s like to live like this, but in my photographs, I try to bridge the gap between different places or cultures. I see photography as a way to connect people, despite their differences in culture, upbringing or social class. I photograph intimate moments that offer a glimpse into scenes we all recognise: a mother waking her child, a couple having a walk in silence, a family dinner or birthday celebration. These very ordinary moments reveal something extraordinary about our shared humanity, its unique beauty. Next month, at my solo show Tribute to Odesa, I will present the work I made on assignment during the conflict in Ukraine that shows an unseen side to the war.Grisa said loneliness kills you slowly – but he also found deep joy in solitude and quiet. He enjoyed reading books, he had friends who still came to visit. Grisa had little income – he was living with almost nothing – but there was still beauty in this place. He called it a little heaven. He loved walking on his land and spending time with his animals, in the peace and the quiet. So this is a tribute to what one man can do, to the magical place he created.This was taken at the end of the day, at sundown. It captures that reflective, charged moment, when you pause and look back and realise what you’ve achieved and feel content. I could imagine the same moment. I think everyone has these feelings at the end of the day or the year. Grisa’s little heaven was revealed in that moment.Tribute to Odesa is atOxo gallery, London, 11-18 February;vanconlaetitia.comView image in fullscreenLaetitia Vançon.Laetitia Vançon’s CVBorn:France, 1979High point:“My Prix Pictet nomination in 2025 for work made in Ukraine – all the hard work for so many years being recognised and acknowledged.”Top tip:“Be curious.

Its founders and key acts recall gigs, plays and pranks on the NMEDaniel Dylan WrayWed 28 Jan 2026 11.08 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 11.16 ESTShare“Things were getting grim,” says Gary Cavanagh, reflecting onBradfordin the early 1980s. “There was a hell of a lot of unemployment, and people were thrown on the scrap heap.”Cavanagh was working for Bradford’s claimants union in 1981, helping the city’s poor and unemployed get benefits, when a government report stated that one in 12 dole recipients were defrauding the state. So he and some friends reclaimed this statistic – which they thought was ludicrous – as an identity. “We became the 1 in 12 Club,” he says.Initially it was a nomadic club, putting on gigs and leftwing political meetings in the upstairs rooms of pubs. Unemployed people could see bands such as New Model Army cheaply, form camaraderie and support the club’s anarchist principles of self-management, co-operation and mutual aid. The club was built around the words liberty, equality and solidarity, and 45 years on, they remain painted on a mural on the building it has called home since 1988 – a space that took two years of voluntary work to convert.You’d have sweaty black water dripping on you on stage –  but the atmosphere was great!Alice Nutter, ChumbawambaAs part ofBradford’s year as the 2025 UK City of Culture, and in collaboration with cultural history organisation Home of Metal, a new book and three-part podcast tell 1 in 12’s story, with contributions from members and bands including Lankum, Chumbawamba, Therapy? and Neurosis. “Some gigs were so hot and ridiculous, with eight of us on that tiny stage,” Chumbawamba’s Alice Nutter tells me. “You’d have sweaty black water dripping on you but the atmosphere was great.”View image in fullscreen‘A place where there is always someone to have a pint with’  … inside the 1 in 12.Photograph: Ila Desai/Courtesy the 1 in 12E, a trustee, has been coming to the club for the last 15 years, since he was a young teen. “I’d never seen a space like this before,” he recalls of his first visit. “I remember a bunch of teenagers – along with punks, hippies, all sorts – all spilling outside into the street. I’m from a Traveller background but nobody looked at you wrong or assumed anything about you. It quickly became a home from home and I wanted to put back into a place that had always given me a space.”Over its three floors – each plastered with leftist stickers and posters – it has a cafe, members’ bar, games room and extensive library. Its 90-capacity gig room has welcomed countless shows and booming raves, with everyone from Pulp to Bikini Kill playing there over the years.1 in 12 battled enemies in the early days when the National Front was prominent. “We were always fighting fascists,” says Cavanagh. “We were threatened but we always took on those people.” Politics are not forced on people at the club, however. “We aren’t a summer school for Marxists,” Cavanagh adds. “We’re not browbeating people with political dogma. We just encourage people to think for themselves.” E says that “not everyone here would define themselves as an anarchist”, and he would simply describe it as “an intersectional or leftist space – just somewhere you can go to be yourself”.We aren’t a summer school for Marxists. We just encourage people to think for themselvesGary Cavanagh, co-founding memberInclusivity and egalitarianism are key to the club’s ethos but it has also responded playfully to outsiders. When the Canadian post-hardcore band Fucked Up arrived to play at the club in 2008 with the NME in tow, members came out with a giant cardboard box structure of a Trojan horse that had “NME Out of Our Scene” written on it. They then smashed it to bits.View image in fullscreen‘There would be punks, hippies, all sorts – all spilling outside into the street.’Photograph: Sherman Rabbit1 in 12 is entirely independent and volunteer-led, with the income from the bar – along with the odd grant – keeping the wheels in motion, and it has numerous collectives within it. “It’s always been more than a venue,” says Nutter, who as well as having been in Chumbawamba is alsoa TV writer and playwright. “I’ve been part of reading groups there, the peasant collective [which provides free communal meals with food from the club’s allotments] and my partner used to play on the football team. The bar is great too – it’s a place where there is always someone to have a pint with who isn’t a wanker.”‘We never had much fun – we were angry’: Eve Libertine on life with anarcho-punk pioneers CrassRead moreNutter’s first play was performed there. “There was always an opportunity to use the space,” she says. “If you have the creativity, they will facilitate it. No one said no. If you were willing to put the work in, you could use the building – they would give you the keys.” She soon understood how much of a “special place” it was as her writing career evolved into traditional theatres: “I realised it costs thousands to put a play on. The first one we did, everyone did it for nowt.”Despite the celebratory milestone, book and podcast, it has also been a sad time, as the club recently lost “vital” and “instrumental” founding member, Tony Grogan. Cavanagh, the sole remaining founder, is still going and attending gigs, and his daughter is now a member. “Part of the longevity is that there’s still a need for us,” he says, as the St George’s flag-waving far right becomes emboldened once more in the city. “It upsets me that we’re still fighting the same battles, but we’ve got a strong cultural resistance in Bradford and we’re part of that. Liberty, equality, solidarity. That’s what we started with and that’s what we’re still trying to do.”The 1 in 12 Club book and podcast series are out now viaHome of MetalExplore more on these topicsMusicPunkExperimental musicBradfordWest YorkshireYorkshireUK city of culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the favouritism is justified in this strong field.The record of the year winners tend to be those who combine huge commercial success with the more nebulous sense of having defined the year in pop. Despite being popular, none of Carpenter, Eilish, Gaga or Roan’s songs truly dominated the zeitgeist. Manchild was huge, but still no Espresso.After teeing herself up withthe best live performance of last year’s ceremony, Doechii got her true commercial breakthrough with Anxiety and is up for five awards this year – though for all its huge virality, it heavily samples, and so rather sits in the shadow of, the 2013 winner in this category: Gotye and Kimbra’s Somebody That I Used to Know.APT. has a big chance, as a globe-dominating multi-billion streamer that sent nursery schools, cocktail bars and wedding dancefloors into equal levels of pandemonium thanks to its multiple earworms (even if it’s basically theTing Tings’ That’s Not My Namewith a Hollywood budget).But Luther spent 13 weeks at US No 1, making it one of the most commercially successful R&B and hip-hop songs ever, and – with a typically keeningSZAchorus melody – a demonstration of the artistic chemistry between two all-time American greats.Will winKendrick Lamar & SZAShould winKendrick Lamar & SZAView image in fullscreenSZA and Kendrick Lamar perform during the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show.Photograph: George Walker IV/APAlbum of the yearBad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosJustin Bieber – SwagSabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendClipse – Let God Sort ‘Em OutLady Gaga – MayhemKendrick Lamar – GNXLeon Thomas – MuttTyler, the Creator– ChromakopiaShorn of the type of bloodless Grammy-bait that has pockmarked this category in recent years – where musicianship seems to be prized over songwriting rigour, eg Jacob Collier or Jon Batiste – there isn’t a truly duff album here. The weakest are Tyler, the Creator’sChromakopia, eclipsed by his much more nimble Don’t Tap the Glass last year, andJustin Bieber’s Swag, which contains a handful of his best ever songs (the minimalist marvel Yukon deserves to win best R&B performance) but features some cringeworthy skits and lyrics. Rap devotees will split their votes between the equally good Kendrick and Clipse, and again, Gaga’s and Carpenter’s albums didn’t feel as culture-defining as earlier ones.Instead, the year has very much been defined byBad Bunnyand his outrageously accomplished sixth album. Weaving between reggaeton, salsa, plena and myriad other Latin styles, it is a torrent of pure musicality, and while DTMF may not be big enough on its own to win in song categories, he could triumph here.The closest this category has to Grammy catnip is rising funk and soul star Leon Thomas, who could create an upset: his success has been built on classic songcraft and old-school touring, and his self-deprecating songs about being ruled by his own desires will appeal to Recording Academy members who remember Curtis Mayfield and James Brown as much as those who love neo-soul and hip-hop.Will winBad BunnyShould winBad BunnySong of the yearBad Bunny – DTMFSabrina Carpenter – ManchildDoechii – AnxietyBillie Eilish– WildflowerHuntr/x – GoldenKendrick Lamar & SZA – LutherLady Gaga – AbracadabraRosé & Bruno Mars – APT.Given that casual observers often wonder what the difference between record and song of the year is – and the Grammys themselves make it vague, calling the latter merely “a songwriter(s) award” – it feels especially redundant that this list replicates the record of the year nominees, except with Golden by the fictional band fromKPop Demon Huntersswapped in for Chappell Roan.As a fantastically executed pop-cultural phenomenon, Golden has a good chance despite its hackneyed lyrics. Golden or APT. would be a first bilingual winner in the category – and Bad Bunny’s Spanish-language DTMF would be the first non-English one. His lyrics about absent friends who have emigrated from their Puerto Rico home are affecting and magnificently musical, but could easily lose out to APT.: absolute fluff nonetheless bolstered by solid construction, plusBruno Marshas won this award in previous years for the knowingly silly That’s What I Like and Leave the Door Open.But don’t discount Lamar and SZA, nor indeed Eilish, who has been nominated in this category in six of the last seven years, winning twice. Wildflower was released in May 2024 but theGrammysjustify their Eilish obsession (nine wins, 34 nods) by claiming it “came to prominence” in the eligibility period, as if it weren’t prominent enough being on her huge hit album, Hit Me Hard and Soft. No matter. It is masterful songwriting, full of the unease of the subject matter: falling for someone who broke the heart of someone else you care about.Will winHuntr/xShould winBad BunnyBest new artistOlivia DeanKatseyeThe MaríasAddison RaeSombrLeon ThomasAlex WarrenLola YoungThis is the first year since 2018 to have no British artists in the record, album or song of the year categories, but there are two in this other “big four” category: Olivia Dean andLola Young, each of them essaying affairs of the heart as well as anyone in pop history. The timing is perfect for Dean, who is now enjoying a huge upswing of popularity, enough to edge out Leon Thomas (who will surely pick up at least one R&B category win), with her album The Art of Loving likely to feature heavily in 2027’s nominations.Also in the running are “global girl group” Katseye, and Addison Rae, who may not be a commercial juggernaut but as the favourite of pop musos will have fans in the Academy. Perhaps Sombr has an outside chance: his well-turned tales of miserable yearning, sung from between pop’s sharpest cheekbones, have rightly generated hundreds of millions of streams, though he was surprisingly shut out of the pop categories.Will winOlivia DeanShould winOlivia DeanBest pop solo performanceJustin Bieber – DaisiesSabrina Carpenter – ManchildLady Gaga – DiseaseChappell Roan – The SubwayLola Young – MessyCarpenter deservedly won in this category last year for Espresso, and while Manchild isn’t in the same songwriting league, Carpenter has an unmatched ability to sell a song. Her grip on pop may secure her a win, though you could say the same forChappell Roan, whose vocals on The Subway – half Elizabeth Fraser, half Broadway belle – pack more power.Bieber tends to go home empty-handed from the Grammys, even in the pop fields – only two wins from his 23 nominations prior to this year – and Daisies isn’t distinctive enough in this company. Gaga is in magnificently hammy form on Disease, though it’s not seen as A-grade Gaga material by most listeners.The best performance, and the biggest hit on streaming, is Lola Young with Messy, which achieves the near impossible feat of expressing the emotionally disorientating rhythm of a domestic argument while still being a perfect pop song – but she is a relative outsider in this company.Will winChappell RoanShould winLola YoungBest rock performanceAmyl and the Sniffers – U Should Not Be Doing ThatLinkin Park– The Emptiness MachineTurnstile – Never EnoughHayley Williams – MirtazapineYungblud – Changes (Live from Villa Park, Back to the Beginning)This is the category’s most impressive lineup since 2021, when all the nominees were women or female-fronted. In terms of pure performance, there is a clear winner:Yungblud’s takeon Ozzy Osbourne’s Changes, performed at Black Sabbath’s final concert (backed by members of Anthrax and Sleep Token, and with a splendid Nuno Bettencourt guitar solo). It is a masterclass in rock singing: pure and corrupted all at once.His greatest contenders are Linkin Park, who overcame the death of frontman Chester Bennington to release one of the most successful rock singles in years. The Emptiness Machine is exhilaratingly exacting, peeling back the skin of a rotten relationship. It’s also a terrific performance, especially by new vocalist Emily Armstrong, who points the song’s loathing inward and outward all at once.Will winLinkin ParkShould winYungbludView image in fullscreenMalice (left) and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreBest rap performanceCardi B – OutsideClipse – Chains & Whips (ft Kendrick Lamar and Pharrell Williams)Doechii – AnxietyKendrick Lamar – TV Off (ft Lefty Gunplay)Tyler, the Creator – Darling, I (ft Teezo Touchdown)Lamar has won in seven of the last 11 years in this category, and with two mentions here, could well win again – although TV Off may pale next to last year’s awards-sweeping Drake diss song Not Like Us, excellent though it is. As usual Cardi B provides pure entertainment and mic mastery on Outside but her second album was long delayed, stalling momentum: this just doesn’t feel like her year.Tyler’s track feels rather stuck in his 80s-funk comfort zone. Doechii lost out in 2025 with Nissan Altima – arguably the most technically astounding track in this field for years – but Anxiety is a bigger hit and a more rounded song. And yet Clipse will probably triumph. Not only is Lamar involved, but the story ofthe returning prodigal sonsis irresistible, and Chains & Whips has it all: a tangy hook, and verses filled with Clipse’s trademark amused malevolence, as if they’re wandering around a foe who is being dangled upside down.Will winClipseShould winClipseBest country solo performanceTyler Childers – Nose on the GrindstoneShaboozey – Good NewsChris Stapleton– Bad As I Used to BeZach Top – I Never LieLainey Wilson – Somewhere Over LaredoAnother one where Grammy voters have clear favourites: Stapleton has won five of the six times he’s been nominated in the flagship country category, including the last two years, so he’s the obvious winner. But while Bad As I Used to Be has an engaging tune, Stapleton is more at home singing of his flaws and foibles, and just doesn’t have the necessary danger for outlaw country like this. Shaboozey couldn’t beat him last year despite having one of country’s biggest ever hits in A Bar Song (Tipsy), so the pale stomp-clap of its follow-up Good News won’t be enough in the rematch. Childers’ Nose on the Grindstone is excellent – his Snipe Hunter will surely win best contemporary country album – but is possibly too moody and pared back for a win in a category where traditionalism reigns. Lainey Wilson’s sumptuous punning ballad has a good chance but Zach Top could clinch this: I Never Lie was a big hit and as well as being old school down to the pedal steel, his performance, wryly affecting not to be bothered about his ex’s new man, is pure charm.Will winZach TopShould winZach TopExplore more on these topicsGrammysPop and rockRapCountryK-popAwards and prizesBad BunnyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a triumph of storytelling – and a masterclass in actingLucy ManganWed 28 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 11.45 ESTShareWe are back in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you feel fatigue stealing over you already, banish it! It’s going to be OK. Even though Wonder Man is (by my incredulous reckoning) about the 30th MCU series produced by MarvelTelevisionand companions – from the dizzying heights of WandaVision to … well, She-Hulk – it is a little gem.And it is quite little, in MCU terms. Not only are the eight episodes only around half an hour long but they also eschew spectacle in favour of storytelling. It’s a radical idea, but you never know, it might catch on.The story is that Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who plays the DC Comics’ character Black Manta in the Aquaman films) is an actor who has been trying to make it in LA for the last decade. Alas, his inability to stop overthinking a role makes him an utter pain on set and gets him fired even when he does manage to land a part. But he has loved the Wonder Man character all his life and when the chance comes to audition for a role in a superhero film about him, Simon leaps at it. There he is befriended by Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley, who plays Trevor in various MCU films, a washed-up, drug-addled actor who is hired by Iron Man 3’s baddie to play “the Mandarin”, who is the terrorist leader of the Ten Rings – do keep up).Always beware befriending an actor. Trevor is the cat’s paw of the Department of Damage Control, the shadowy government organisation set on protecting the public from supernatural threats with a modern prison to fill before its budget is cut. And the DODC has been tracking our man Simon since he was 13 and emerged unscathed from a house fire that should have killed him. It is not, we gather, just his love for the shonky Wonder Man films he watched as a child with his father that draws him to the role. Ignorant of the DODC’s existence, Simon still keeps his powers hidden because in this Hollywood, people with such abilities are forbidden to work after an on-set disaster that is the subject of an entire episode (beautifully done, even if it interrupts the momentum) about halfway through the series.View image in fullscreenAltogether wonder-ful … Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Ben Kingsley in Wonder Man.Photograph: Marvel TelevisionThe real meat of the thing, however, is not the superheroics, repressed or otherwise. It lies in two things. First, in the meticulous and moving examination of the growing friendship between the men. Trevor’s pose as a mentor becomes increasingly real as, with shades of Olivier’s advice to the very method actor Dustin Hoffman, who exhausted himself during the making of Marathon Man (“Dear boy – why don’t you just try acting?”) and Noël Coward’s advice to all actors (“Speak up, and don’t bump into the furniture”), he teaches the less experienced man to get out of his own way and improve his career and, by extension, his life.Second, we get a meditation on the film industry and a masterclass – several, really – on the art of acting. No, this is not a sentence I thought I’d be writing about a dusty piece of MCU intellectual property either. But what a joy to be doing so! We follow Simon as he puts together audition tapes, talks about character choices, finds different spins, stories and intonation, and watch as he/Abdul-Mateen puts them together. And we have Trevor/Kingsley advising him on alternative techniques, discussing his options, showing us what having a supportive line reader off camera can do, and demonstrating the difference a lifetime of immersion in the stage as well as screen can make. At one point, the actor-characters simply sit and trade some of their favourite speeches – from Shakespeare toAmadeus’s Salieri– and the boundaries between them, between the actor-characters and the actors and us, begin to blur. It’s as neat a demonstration of art and its powers as you could find.For those who want more of the superhero stuff, Wonder Man will disappoint. There are moments when we see Simon’s rumbling powers build and occasional scenes when they are unleashed. But the strength of this show lies in its depiction of the relationship between the leads and its interrogation of the effects of art and how it gets corrupted. Forgive me, but it’s a rather clever, tender and altogether wonder-ful thing.Wonder Man is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMarvelBen KingsleyDramaSuperhero TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here is Richard Linklater’s impeccably submissive, tastefully cinephile period drama about the making of Godard’s debut 1960 classic À Bout de Souffle, that starred Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo as the star-crossed lovers in Paris. Linklater’s homage has credits in French and is beautifully shot in monochrome, as opposed to the boring old colour of real life in which the events were actually happening; he even cutely fabricates cue marks in the corner of the screen, those things that once told projectionists when to changeover the reels. But Linklater smoothly avoids any disruptive jump-cuts.It’s a good-natured, intelligent effort for which Godard himself, were he still alive, would undoubtedly have ripped Linklater a new one. (WhenMichel Hazanavicius made Redoubtable in 2017about Godard’s making of his 1967 film La Chinoise, the man himself called that “a stupid, stupid idea”; Hazanavicius wasn’t even making a film about Godard’s first and biggest hit.)Yet Linklater is unconsciously creating a stylistic homage – not to Godard, however, but to his much more emollient, accessible and Hollywood-friendly collaborator François Truffaut. Truffaut wrote the basic story for Breathless and thereby gave Godard his commercial success; it was based on a sensational true-crime story about a tough guy who shoots a cop and gets an American girlfriend on the run, grabbing at love and romance while he can, existentially aware that a cop-killer’s days are numbered.The real-life characters of the Breathless story, from the most famous to the most obscure (this latter category being treated with rigorous superfan respect) are introduced with static portrait shots, gazing at the camera with their names flashed up on screen; even in the action itself, these people are often addressed by their full name with an awestruck sentence about their importance so we know where we are.Godard himself, a Cahiers du Cinéma gunslinger-critic yearning to graduate to film-making, is played by newcomer Guillaume Marbeck, incessantly dropping epigrams and wisecracks and shruggingly dismissive pouts on the subject of cinema – and perhaps Godard was like this, at least some of the time. Linklater mischievously allows the audience to wonder if Godard will ever remove his sunglasses and get a “beautiful librarian” moment, or at least a moment to confess that you shouldn’t watch movies through dark glasses. Aubry Dillon plays Belmondo and Zoey Deutch is Seberg, forever breaking into fluent and Ohio-accented French. Adrien Rouyard is Truffaut, Matthieu Penchinat is the brilliant cinematographer Raoul Coutard whose news background in covering wars made him an inspired choice for Godard’s guerrilla film-making adventures, Benjamin Clery is Godard’s first assistant director Pierre Rissient and Bruno Dreyfürst is Godard’s longsuffering producer George “Beau Beau” Beauregard – whose disagreements with Godard over money lead to an undignified physical scuffle in aPariscafe.‘I have Yes tattooed on my foot!’ Zoey Deutch on playing Jean Seberg in a joyous celebration of Godard classic BreathlessRead moreThe shoot begins, extended by Godard’s haughtily capricious delays to accommodate authentic inspiration, as the actors amusingly say whatever they like to each other and the tyrannical director while the camera is turning, because everything is to be dubbed later in the studio. Continuity supervisor Suzon Faye (Pauline Belle) crossly tells Godard that his cavalier disregard for matching the eyelines in successive shots mean a problem in the edit; a hint of the imminent revolution in film grammar, perhaps, though Linklater’s Godard has the humility to say he didn’t invent jump-cuts.By the end, Linklater’s Godard is as opaque and essentially imperturbable as he was in the beginning, seething with competitive anguish at the success of Truffaut’s The 400 Blows in Cannes and struggling to get into parties and film sets; and again, none of this is inaccurate. But it’s all very smooth: a slick Steadicam ride through a historic, tumultuous moment.Nouvelle Vague screened at theCannes film festival2025 and is out in Australian cinemas now and in UK and Irish cinemas from 30 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekRichard LinklaterDrama filmsComedy filmsBreathless (A Bout de Souffle)ParisCannes film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

At the outset of his 1988 pieceBrandenburgs, with the dancers in tight green velour beaming beatifically out at us, the hardened viewer may be thinking: this is a bit twee, a bit dated. Twenty-five minutes later, after a hurricane of leaping and spinning and tightly honed technique, you’re thinking how joyful it is to be alive.Taylor was one of the most prominent and popular figures in American modern dance, leading his company for more than 60 yearsuntil his death in 2018. The company first visited the UK in 1964, but has not been to London in 20-odd years. (In this short run they’re also dancinga second programme, including Taylor’s final workConcertiana, from 2018.)View image in fullscreenRecognisable, readable … John Harnage and Maria Ambrose in Paul Taylor’s Brandenburgs.Photograph: Ron ThieleAs it is in Brandenburgs, set to two of Bach’s eponymous concertos (No 3 and No 6), Taylor’s dance is often buoyant and bravura, clearly delineated in its sleek angles, and unafraid to entertain. It’s sprightly and full of postcard moments – a snapshot at any point would reveal dancers in lovely open positions, or leaping with huge expanses of air between their feet and the floor. Every step is recognisable, readable, digestible, musical. Despite the sprint speeds and a dizzying number of turns, this is dance that harks back to simpler, analogue times, not the current age’s onslaught of everything.The women wear green Grecian-style dresses and it does feel a bit Olympean: there’s a scene that brings to mind Apollo and his muses, some Euclidean geometry at play. The dancers look like the athletes of the gods,to slightly misquote Martha Graham, although the god to whom they are in thrall may be Bach.View image in fullscreenJazz beats … Lee Duveneck and Alex Clayton of Paul Taylor Dance Company in Under the Rhythm by Robert Battle.Photograph: Ron ThieleThe company now has resident choreographers making new work, as well as preserving Taylor’s archive. The newest of them isRobert Battle, former artistic director of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. His piece Under the Rhythm is intended as a tribute to Battle’s mother and the power of dance to see us through life; it feels like a toast to the glories of African American jazz and modern dance, from the riotous rhythm of a Harlem dancefloor, to two dancers in red tailcoats, a little like theNicholas Brothers, hamming it up to Ella Fitzgerald’s scat. You could infer a nod to Ailey, and is it just me or was that Carlton’s dance from The Fresh Prince? There is an undercurrent of some of the pain and prejudice that lies beneath those stories, but there is also pure virtuosity and showmanship.There are no smiles in Taylor’sPiazzolla Caldera(1997), only seriously smouldering looks. It’s a feisty tango-inspired piece that plays into expectations of Buenos Aires’s seedy underworld. All those sexily furrowed brows indicating the heights of ecstasy start to look rather effortful, yet it’s never not easy to watch. This is dance that wants its audience to enjoy themselves, and it would be hard not to.AtLinbury theatre, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsDanceBalletRoyal BalletRoyal Opera HouseJS BachreviewsShareReuse this content"

But later this yearHarry Potter and the Cursed Childwill only be staged in London as a shortened, single production running 175 minutes.The new format is in line with the other versions of the hit play presented in the US, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan. Its producers announced on Monday that a one-part production would make it more accessible, “allowing even more audiences to experience the story with one ticket and one visit to the theatre”.Currently, in London, theatregoers purchase separate tickets for each part of the play, with the cheapest total cost coming to £30. The two parts (which each have an interval) can be seen on the same day, with a couple of hours’ break in between, or on different days. Prices for the new version, which has one interval, are yet to be announced. The two-part production will run at the Palace theatre until 20 September. The one-part version will open at the Palace on 6 October.The play – which is the eighth story in novelist JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series – had its world premiere in London in 2016 and won a record-breakingnine Olivier awards. Rowling, who collaborated with writerJack Thorne and director John Tiffanyon the production, originally said that it was split into two parts because of the “epic nature of the story” which is set 19 years after the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.View image in fullscreen‘Deep affection for these characters’ … Naana Agyei-Ampadu as Hermione, Thomas Aldridge as Ron and David Ricardo-Pearce as Harry.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThe producers of the play, Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, said on Monday: “As newHarry Potterfans discover these stories every day, drawn in by their enduring power and the deep affection for these characters, we felt this milestone moment was the right time to make the production more accessible than ever before. Now running at under three hours, the reimagined production retains its scale, illusions and theatrical magic, and emotional depth, while allowing more audiences to experience the story in a single visit.”Tom Felton to reprise role as Draco Malfoy in Harry Potter and the Cursed ChildRead moreThe trimmed runtime should also appeal to theatregoers bringing young children (the show is recommended for over-eights) and those – not just children – who have shorter attention spans. But even at 175 minutes, the new Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will still be longer than many West End plays. Theatre impresario Rosemary Squire said last summer thataudiences were put off by long running times“because they’re starting to panic and think ‘I’ve got to get up for work tomorrow’, and ‘When will I get the last train?’, et cetera … As an industry, we need to listen to that.”It is not just an issue for theatres.Earlier this month, Clare Binns, the creative director of Picturehouse Cinemas, said: “I look at a lot of films and think: ‘You could take 20 minutes out of that.’ There’s no need for films to be that long.” Binns suggested that epic running times have deterred audiences returning to the cinema after the Covid-19 pandemic. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opened on Broadway in the two-part format. When US theatres reopened after the Covid pandemic, the streamlined one-part production took its place.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndHarry Potter and the Cursed ChildHarry PotterJK RowlingJack ThorneJohn TiffanynewsShareReuse this content"

TikTok videos don’t count towards US chart positions, but viral trends drive listeners towards songs on streaming services that do count.Lover, You Should Have Come Over is an acoustic ballad in which Buckley laments a broken relationship and longs for the lover of the title to return and forgive him. “All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter … she’s the tear that hangs inside my soul for ever,” runs one particularly heartfelt section.The track features on Grace, Buckley’s sole studio album, released in 1994. The album only reached No 82 in the US but was a touchstone for college students and hopeless romantics, eventually becoming a platinum seller.Remembering Jeff Buckley: 'People would listen with their mouths open'Read moreTragically, Buckley never followed it up. He died in 1997, accidentally drowning while swimming in the Mississippi River. Sketches for songs he had been working on for a second album were released the following year as the compilation Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. In 2016, another compilation of unheard material was released: You and I, chiefly containing cover versions he’d recorded in 1993, including songs by Bob Dylan, the Smiths and Led Zeppelin.Buckley is not the only 90s-alternative name to belatedly get a chart hit thanks to TikTok: Radiohead’s song Let Down, from 1997’s OK Computer, charted for the first time in 2025.In December, TikTok’s Year in Music report claimed that eight of the 10 US No 1 singles of 2025 “had a viral moment on TikTok first”, and that all of the year’s 13 UK No 1 singles went viral on the platform at some point.Explore more on these topicsJeff BuckleyPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

It will premiere on 11 April at the Swan theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon.It is the first theatre work by Placebo, who had a series of major hits in the late 1990s onwards with their muscular gothic rock and sometimes sexually provocative songwriting, including the Top 5 singles Nancy Boy, Pure Morning and You Don’t Care About Us. They have steadily released eight studio albums, with the most recent, Never Let Me Go, giving them their highest ever album chart placing at No 3.The band’s Brian Molko and Stefan Olsdal said they were “very honoured and excited” by the collaboration, adding: “Thematically, this cautionary tale from history feels more urgent and prescient than ever, and its relevance to today’s world is very chilling. The creative process for this project was very different for us, sometimes akin to shooting arrows in the dark. So we tried to connect with the psychology of the outsider, as well as taking inspiration from themes of power, alienation and moral decay – which are at the core of this play.”The production’s director, Seán Linnen, described Placebo’s score as “glitteringly expansive, darkly seductive and deeply theatrical”.View image in fullscreenMark Gatiss in a promotional image for The Resistible Rise of Arturo UiLinnen also highlighted the play’s resonances with today’s political reality. “As the threat from the far-right grows daily at home and abroad, it is our job as artists to speak up and out. There is no other play that interrogates the political moment we are living through more than this one.”Despite being written in 1941, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui wasn’t premiered until after Brecht’s death, in 1958. Recent productions have includedone with Lenny Henryin the title role at London’s Donmar Warehouse in 2017.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockTheatreMark GatissRoyal Shakespeare CompanynewsShareReuse this content"

A judge then threw out significant sections of the suit, before Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood’s attorney fees.One case against Manson, alleging sexual assault and domestic violence between 2009 and 2011,was dismissed in January 2025after a years-long investigation, again because it fell outside of the statute of limitations.Last year the first UK concert of his One Assassination Under God Tourwas cancelled after pressure from campaign groups and an MP.Explore more on these topicsMarilyn MansonLos AngelesPop and rockMetalnewsShareReuse this content"

It also misses the point: rather than being one of the last avatars of a liberal order that has crumbled around our ears, Bowie prophesied the mayhem that has replaced it.In his later years, he thought that we had entered a zone of chaos and fragmentation. This is what allowed him to be so prescient about the internet – not its promise, but its menace. There is no plan and no order. There is just disaster and social collapse. Those looking for reassurance should not listen to Bowie (please listen to something, anything, else). His world, from Space Oddity through to the background violence ofThe Next DayandBlackstar, was always drowned or destroyed or incinerated: “This ain’t rock’n’roll, this is genocide” as he exclaims at the beginning of Diamond Dogs.Bowie prefigured Trumpworld in countless ways. Just listen to Under the God on the much-maligned Tin Machine in 1989: “Washington heads in the toilet bowl / Don’t see the supremacist hate / Rightwing dicks in their boiler suits / Picking out who to annihilate.” The only detail Bowie got wrong were the boiler suits. We live in a world of heathens, as Bowie hinted in the title of hisbrilliant 2002 album. Bowie did not want to lead a heathen existence.Whatever meaning God and religion might have now has to be measured against this vision of collapse. Strangely perhaps, this is exactly how Bowie saw it. Rather than running scared like a jittery liberal, he saw something else “at the centre of it all”, as he says repeatedly on Blackstar. This is what he called “a formidable mystery”: the mystery of transience, of the fact that we are dying, indeed, as he puts it in Diamond Dogs,we are the dead.Which brings me to Ormerod’s book. I was wrong about it. Because I have loved Bowie with an unwaning passion for 54 years, I’ve read too much about him and grown rather blase about his biography. Thus, when I began reading, it all felt a tad familiar. Ormerod tells the story of Bowie’s life and music through the lens of religion, which is absolutely terrific as a central theme, as Bowie was essentiallya religious artist.Ormerod deals with Bowie as text; as the occasion for close reading, which is what his work, like all good art, deservesBeginning with the Anglicanism of St Mary’s Church in Bromley, where Bowie sang in the choir, continuing with his immersion in Tibetan Buddhism in the late 1960s and on to the occultism of Aleister Crowley, Ormerod unpacks the religious preoccupations of Bowie’s art in compelling prose. But still, it all seems rather straightforward and the little stabs at philosophy (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and so on) feel a tiny bit Wiki.But the book takes on a growing velocity when analysing Bowie’s later work, particularly in the chapter on Heathen (I’ve not read anything as good on that album). This momentum develops into fine, detailed discussions of The Next Day and Blackstar, and also Lazarus, his stunning final experiment with musical theatre. What makes these sections so good is that Ormerod deals with Bowie astext;as the occasion for close reading, which I think is what his work, like all good art, deserves.By the end Ormerod had me singing in the choir with him. The book closes with the compelling argument that what drives Bowie’s work – and Ormerod is very good on the centrality of the concept of drive – flows from two essential sources: life and love. When asked whether he had a devotional practice, Bowie answered, “Life. I love life very much indeed”.For much of that life, his work was counterpointed, indeed contradicted, by a certain incapacity to love. This was expressed in his music as an incredibly painful yearning and the experience of isolation which is perhaps the most common theme of his work. Happily, he found love both in the simplicity of family life and in the distension of existence that can, if you are lucky, coincide with ageing and dying.As Ormerod points out, there is an apophaticism to Bowie’s art – that is, a persistent tendency to negate any proposition (not this, not that, and not that either). This can be heard all over his work, but listen to his final song, the last track on Blackstar, I Can’t Give Everything Away, which is subtly devastating in its merging of deep emotion with refusal: “Saying no but meaning yes / This is all I ever meant / That’s the message that I sent.” This tendency to negation, to what Simone Weil called “decreation”, puts him in the company of medieval Christian mystics, like Marguerite Porete.And there is an odd neo-medievalism to Bowie fandom. He was not some messiah rock god (although he played that role in the persona of Ziggy). But he did function as a kind of saint, and it is irresistibly tempting to see his extraordinary archiveat the V&A Eastas a vast reliquary that inspires that most medieval of practices: pilgrimage. Ormerod, like me, is a convert (1996 for him, 1972 for me) and listening to Bowie is church. Religion does not just influence Bowie’s music. It is the music. It is its moving essence. It is at the centre of it all.Simon Critchley is a philosopher and author of On Bowie. David Bowie and the Search for Life, Death and God is published by Bloomsbury Continuum (£20).

After finding this seam of gold, miner Michael dreams that his son will be able to go to school, rather than join the other children who work in the mine, like “blind, bald rodents unearthing themselves in search of scraps of candlelight”. In the novel, which won the 2023 Betty Trask prize, everything closes in on Michael: lungs clog, tunnels collapse, horse-drawn narrowboats are attacked by robbers in the sooty dusk. It’s a vivid reminder of the cost, in bodily suffering, of resource extraction.The Puma, Wiles’s second novel, is also a serious and intense historical novel about a father with limited resources who attempts to break a cycle of violence. In the early 1950s Bernardo, a more morally ambiguous figure than Michael, has brought his young son James across the Atlantic from England to the house in the Patagonian woods where he himself grew up. James chatters blithely about becoming a footballer, but Bernardo is distracted. He thinks he sees “shadows of his family walking in and out”, reminding him of a childhood in which “his eyes were wide and hurt by the twilight and he was barefooted and emptyhearted”.From here, the plot presents a challenge to a reviewer. It’s difficult to summarise the subtle movement between present and past, between Patagonia, Liverpool and France, that gradually reveals the violence Bernardo fled and the violence – as a civilian in the blitz and a British army medic in Normandy – that he walked into. In the present storyline, a sudden tragedy splits the slim book, replacing Bernardo’s search for an idea of home with a search for revenge.The displacement of hurt on to landscape can feel like a powerful critique of 20th-century masculinityIn the first part, makeshift father-son domesticity is recounted with enough tension to make the reader twitchy with anticipation. The second part, in which Bernardo hunts an elusive puma, I found less gripping. There are pages of brush and bramble, rocks and mountain ridges, smells and scrapes on tree bark, blood and pus and shivers, and the making of fires. Bernardo measures out his life in dwindling bullets. “The Puma had become his sole possession in this world and his sole purpose. It sustained him in body and mind.” The obsession takes on a life of its own.It’s clear that the nonhuman world is a victim of Bernardo’s inability to deal with his difficult human feelings. The displacement of hurt on to the landscape can feel like a powerful critique of 20th-century masculinity, as when the novel draws imagistic parallels between a man shot through the eye on a French battlefield and an innocent puma cub seen through a rifle sighting. For a brief while, Bernardo is accompanied on his mission by a Mapuche man. The Mapuche resisted Spanish colonisation in Chile, and the passage establishes a contrast between capitalist destruction and more sustainable indigenous livelihoods. To spell out the point, Bernardo comes across other hunters and is outraged by their outlook: “Those cruel bastards. They do not kill the Huemul [deer] to survive, they are only money to them.”But sometimes the book itself strays close to an escapist fantasy of retreat from the complications of society into the elemental “wilderness”. Bernardo is described as transforming into “a new person, all that had come before stripped away by what was. His eyes like globes red with desire.” At this point I was reminded, uncomfortably, of the hormonal imagery of an advert for men’s fragrance.The voice of The Puma is more uneven and free-floating than the compelling Black Country dialect of Mercia’s Take. The prose here is stylishly elliptical: “The massive stretch of metamorphic rock, old and scarred and capped a thin white like flashes of bone amongst skin.” This composite of scientific precision and elegant simile is the dialect of literary fiction rather than of an individual character in a particular time and place. The Puma is less distinctive than Mercia’s Take. But it extends Wiles’s sincere ambition to explore marginalised histories with viscerally affecting storytelling.The Puma by Daniel Wiles is published by Swift (£14.99).

It is a taut, tough suspense thriller in black-and-white, leading to a sensationally grim final shot. It is in fact a B-movie, one of the support features that once made up a complete evening’s entertainment: a cheap’n’cheerful genre which, though often awful, sometimes liberated talented people to create terrific, unheralded work, and whose importance to film history has beenvaluably elucidated by critic Matthew Sweet. A character in this film in fact, about to go out to the cinema, talks about the importance of seeing the full programme.Griff (played by Derren Nesbitt) leads a trio of robbers who raid a suburban bank just as it is about to shut up shop for the bank holiday weekend. In a horribly cynical touch, Griff poses as a postman to gain entrance using his dead father’s old uniform. Having manhandled the straitlaced manager Mr Spencer (Colin Gordon) and his demure secretary Miss Taylor (Ann Lynn) down into the basement to get them to open up the strongroom with all the cash, they lock the two employees in there and make their getaway.But a queasy, grisly fear settles on the criminals, as they crouch in their van weighing up the next move. What if no one notices the two are missing and they are left to die of suffocation in the vault? Nothing is said out loud but they realise they could swing for this, manslaughter or not. Murder was a capital offence when this movie was released and there was often not much delay between conviction and execution. Their spasm of pseudo-conscience sets in train disastrous consequences. Time is running out – and as well as the chill of horror at their crime there is an amazingly real, delicately managed almost-romance that seems to grow between Mr Spencer and Miss Taylor. They are forced to loosen their clothing in the stultifying heat and their inhibitions dwindle along with the air supply – though of course in the most poignantly reticent, platonic way – as they realise they might be about to die.The movie delivers a couple of big shocks, with the biggest saved for just before the closing credits, and everything is briskly wrapped up inside 80 minutes. The performances are stagy and yet robust in the manner of British cinema of those days, but always plausible and watchable. Nesbitt has a swarthy kind of non-handsomeness; in the same year he was the unforgettably nasty blackmailer-hoodlum inBasil Dearden’s Victim. Audiences both in 1962 and 2026 might assume a kind of redemption is on the way, along with a crime-doesn’t-pay moral. But no.Strongroom is in UK and Irish cinemas from 30 January; it is on Blu-ray from 23 February and on BFI Player from 23 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are memories shared about how things used to be, and some older characters refusing to keep up with digital progression, while there are eye-rolls from the younger generation, poking fun at those losing touch with how the world now operates. I’d argue that the theme is often a little overplayed, a classic case of writer-director Segan – a frequent Rian Johnson collaborator – telling rather than showing. But his film makes a convincing case for the old, a brisk throwback to a 70s-era character-led thriller, made with borrowed flair from yesteryear.Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass review – silly, scattershot Hollywood comedyRead moreThe title is itself partly borrowed from a Simon and Garfunkel song and speaks to a protagonist of a dying breed, a pickpocket who prides himself on the old ways; though he might swipe smartphones, he doesn’t own one. He’s played byJohn Turturro, an actor who hasn’t enjoyed many a lead role of late – his last was in the ill-received Big Lebowski “sequel” The Jesus Rolls and that’s only because he wrote and directed it himself. But this is a welcome step up, or step back up, for someone deserving of something more substantial to tear into. Fittingly, he’s someone who would have arguably had a more prominent career as a leading man in a different time.His character, Harry, might be straight from a dog-eared crime novel you could fit in your coat pocket – works alone, sticks to his routine, makes for a better thief than he ever did a father – but part of the film’s pleasure lies in the familiar. Nostalgia can become a crutch for so many film-makers but there’s also real sincerity here.Harry sticks to mostly simple steals, operating on the subway, living in the Bronx but finding most of his work in Manhattan. He sells to an old friend, pawnbroker Ben (fellow Coens collaborator Steve Buscemi), and spends his downtime caring for his wife, who has a degenerative disease that renders her mute and motionless. As is often the case with a character of this ilk, Harry makes the mistake of stealing from the wrong person, the bratty offspring of a connected crime family (rising star Will Price, believably obnoxious), and has to find his way out of a dangerous spot before the day is through.It’s pretty much the film one expects but it’s engaging enough and tight at 88 minutes. So often, what was once taken for granted – in what Harry would affectionately remember as the good old days – can now feel like a miracle and, as one would hope given the title, this is very much an on-location, recognise-and-point New York film, and one of the best I’ve seen in a while. Harry’s life might be in danger but there’s a charming hangout movie breeziness to his travels around the city, having to find his way without Google Maps. Even though a reunion with his estranged daughter might seem a little too schematic, it allows for a wonderfully effective performance from Tatiana Maslany, who brings decades of anger and sadness into a single scene. She also tells Harry he looks like shit, maybe the film’s most far-fetched moment, given how great Turturro is looking at 68 – a cool but not overstyled man about town – and he’s such a likable, if morally dubious, companion that I would have gladly spent longer with him, stealing from New Yorkers and complaining about prices to anyone who’ll listen.Segan’s script is not quite as whip-smart as he sometimes seems to think it is and there’s some doubling back “oh you thinkthishappened” explanations that are less fiendishly clever and more goofily contrived. There’s also a surprise last-act cameo from an Oscar-winner that’s a bit too jolting to work given their particularly outsized persona, although Segan does manage a satisfyingly bittersweet ending. It’s an earnest tribute to a lot of things – a city, a time, a genre, a mentality, an actor in Turturro – and while we’ve definitely been here before, it’s nice to come back.The Only Living Pickpocket in New York is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewJohn TurturroCrime filmsSundance film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Outside, Storm Chandra keeps the streets jumpy. Inside Belfast’s Limelight, a sold-out crowd sits on fold-up seats for a show shifted from Mandela Hall at short notice, the room oddly calm for a venue known for sweat and shoving.Williams is a lodestar in the broad galaxy of music still calledAmericana, and two days after turning 73, she has the authority of a multiple Grammy winner who writes with urgency. She is living with the after-effects of a stroke, stepping on and off stage with care, yet once she’s behind the mic she radiates resolve. If anything, the voice sounds newly burnished; the phrasing more deliberate, the vibrato catching the light.She opens with the title track from her just-released 16th album, World’s Gone Wrong, and it lands as protest carried on groove: harmonies locked, slide guitar set like a slow warning. “We the people … people have the power,” she adds, nodding to Patti Smith, and the band answers with patient force. Ex-Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford plays blues lines with slow-bend eloquence that never crowds her phrasing. Brady Blade steers the set, his cymbals creating a washed, phased shimmer as the music tilts skyward.The best moments come when the writing trusts small detail. Right in Time turns the everyday into charged intimacy – kettle boiling, jewellery coming off – before she smiles: “I guess some of my songs are a little suggestive.” Car Wheels on a Gravel Road burrows into memory via smell and radio, its simplicity doing the damage. Later, You Can’t Rule Me is a peak, delta boogie pushed into double-time. There is a slight sameiness in the run of new protest songs about economic strain, racial injustice, and who gets to wield power, granted, but Williams persuasively argues these issues are “at the forefront,” and everyone needs relief.A cover of Neil Young’s Rockin’ in the Free World turns the room into a bellowed closing singalong. Williams, delighted, catches herself: “It’s great to be in Dublin … oh wait – Belfast.

And visitors are being asked to help …Oliver BalchWed 28 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 28 Jan 2026 04.32 ESTShareOur induction into tree-planting comes from Pietro, an Italian hydromorphologist charged with overseeing our group of 20 or so volunteers for the week. We’re standing in a makeshift nursery full of spindly willow and poplar saplings just above theVjosa River, a graceful, meandering waterway that cuts east to west across southern Albania from its source 169 miles away upstream in Greece.Expertly extricating an infant willow from the clay-rich soil, Pietro holds up the plant for us all to see. Its earthy tendrils look oddly exposed and vulnerable. “The trick is not to accidentally snick the stem or break the roots,” he says. Message registered, we take up our hoes and head off in pairs to follow his instructions.Map of Vjosa River, AlbaniaThe volunteering week is the brainchild of EcoAlbania and the Austria-basedRiverwatch. Back in 2023, these two conservation charities succeeded in persuading the Albanian government to designate the River Vjosa as Europe’s first “wild river national park”. It was a timely intervention. According tonew researchco-funded by Riverwatch, Albania has lost 711 miles (1,144km) of “nearly natural” river stretches since 2018 – more, proportionally, than any country in the Balkans. Now, the question facing both organisations is: what next?On our first evening, Riverwatch’s chief executive, Ulrich (“Uli”) Eichelmann, gives a presentation setting out his answer. But before he does, we have a dinner of lamb and homegrown vegetables to work through. The traditional spread is a speciality of theLord Byron guesthousein Tepelenë, a small town in the heart of the Vjosa valley and home to EcoAlbania’s field office – our base for the week.View image in fullscreenItalian hydromorphologist Pietro, left, with volunteers wading across a shallow stretch of river.Photograph: Joshua LimToday, Tepelenë houses a slightly dilapidated castle and little else, but two centuries ago it formed the political centre ofAli Pasha, a local potentate in the early 19th century. Under the then Ottoman empire, Pasha administered a large swathe of what is modern-day southern Albania and mainland Greece – hence, the visit (in 1809) of the guesthouse’s eponymous namesake.Uli makes for a fitting heir to the famously belligerent Ali Pasha. Armed with slides and statistics, he offers a hard-hitting overview of the threats facing Europe’s embattled river network. His opprobrium is particularly reserved for the thousands of dams now stymying the continent’s once free-flowing rivers, which he blames for causing irreversible damage to fish stocks and freshwater ecosystems.Tourism is like fire,’ says the director of EcoAlbania. ‘You can prepare your soup with it, but it can also burn your house down’As one of the last wild rivers in the Balkans, the Vjosa in Albania has been spared a similar fate, he asserts. But that’s not the end of it. “Although the river looks beautiful,” he says, “there are critical things missing.” High on his list are trees, a large proportion of which have been lost to fires, logging, road building and aggressive grazing. The result: high levels of erosion and, as a consequence, greater risk of flooding.Buoyed up by Uli’s presentation, we approach our replanting the next day with redoubled efforts. Our number includes a London-based book illustrator inspired byDavid Attenborough’s Oceandocumentary, a US geospatial analyst with the noble hope of creating an “Albania where Albanians might want to stay” (a reference to the country’s1.2 millionemigres now overseas), and an Italian university student interested in eco-tourism, to name a few.View image in fullscreenVolunteers have been focusing on planting trees as part of the plan for reversing years of damage to the river and its surroundings.Photograph: Joshua LimOver lunch on the second day, I get chatting to Aida, a tour guide from Tirana who wants to better acquaint herself with the Vjosa region. Visitors rarely come to this part of Albania, she says. “Perhaps they might pay a quick visit to Gjirokastër,” referring to a historic honeypot town on the neighbouring Drino River, “but, otherwise, they drive straight through.”Looking out over the river, with its braided islets and rugged mountain backdrop, we both agree that such oversight is a shame. The region has a rich cultural and religious history (Albania became officially atheist in 1967), an interesting gastronomic tradition (“perhaps not that sophisticated, but somehow tasty”), and a genuine surfeit of natural attractions, she tells me.A large proportion of trees have been lost to fires, logging, road building and aggressive grazing. The result: a greater risk of floodingThat night, it starts raining. Proper rain. Torrents of water pour down from angry, thunderous skies. The next morning, word comes from Pietro that the planting zone is now several feet underwater. With our planting temporarily suspended, I join some of the volunteers on an impromptu sightseeing expedition. Equipped with a list from Aida, we head upstream, stopping first at the slow-food town of Përmet (“Except for the Sea,” the town’s cocksure slogan reads, “We have Everything”). Next up is the delightful Orthodox church of St Mary, a gem of a place hidden up in the hills, where the local shepherd doubles as the doorkeeper. Last, we go for a hike up the Langarica canyon, which, despite the dreadful weather, we achieve without troubling the widely advertised emergency services (“ambulance”, “police”, “fireworks”).The next day, it’s still raining hard. Briefly, I consider going rafting or kayaking, two popular options on the Vjosa, but the river has now grown into a swollen torrent. Instead, I take a soggy hike up the nearby Peshtura gorge to see a noted waterfall, which, drunk on so much rainfall, is positively bursting from the hillside. In the afternoon, I decide to see if Gjirokastër is all it’s cracked up to be. A visit to its illuminating ethnographic museum and imperious clifftop castle persuade me it very much is.View image in fullscreenOliver Balch hiked up the Peshtura gorge to see a waterfall.Photograph: Joshua LimLater that night, I share my joys at discovering what the Vjosa region has to offer with Olsi Nika, executive director of EcoAlbania. Happy as he is at my enthusiasm, I can see he’s also concerned. He is not against tourism, he wants me to know, but, as a conservationist (he recently won the prestigiousGoldman Environmental prize), the prospects for the park worry him. Albania’s coastline is already busy with package holidaymakers and anairport is being builtin the river’s delta despite it being a designated protected area. And so, while he is happy that a spanglynew visitor centre is being builtin Tepelenë, he is anxious to see the government fulfil its ownmanagement planfor the park – something it has so far been slow to do. “Tourism is like fire,” he says. “You can prepare your soup with it, but it can also burn your house down.”Olsi’s words are still ringing in my ears the next day as I drive back towards Tirana. I stop just to the north of the river’s mouth at the archaeological site of Apollonia, an ancient Greek trading community later colonised by the Romans. The hilltop spot is entirely devoid of other tourists, allowing me a magical couple of hours to wander alone among the extraordinary ruins.If Herodotus is to be believed, Apollonia used to sit on the Adriatic coast, but centuries of silt from the Vjosa have seen it retreat miles inland. Over the same time, the river’s route has also altered. But nothing stays still, especially hydrology. Change is once more coming to the Vjosa. What it will bring remains uncertain, but, as a national park, she will hopefully continue to flow, untamed and unbroken.The trip was funded byPatagonia, which supportsEcoAlbania. EcoAlbania will arrange hotel, food and transport from Tirana to Tepelenëforabout £700 for the week. Volunteers need to arrange their own transport to Tirana.

Infused oil has countless uses – drizzle it over carpaccio, pasta or salad, use it to marinate meat, fish and vegetables, or simply as a dip for chunks of sourdough – and some of my favourites include lemon rind, garlic skin and rosemary; star anise, cacao and orange rind; and makrut lime leaf, lemongrass husk and coriander stems, which I found especially delicious drizzled over some noodles and pak choi. Freshly infused oils of this sort aren’t suitable for long storage, however, so use them up within a day to two.Kitchen scrap-infused olive oilAs I look around my kitchen, I’ve got a two-year-old jar of remarkably tasty chillies gathering dust, a bowl of clementines (I think of citrus rinds as harbingers of incredible flavour, rich in essential oils and highly aromatic terpenes) and a small jar of long pepper, a pungent, complex spice that’s been sitting on my kitchen shelf for years without a purpose. When put together, however, and left to bubble gently on the hob, they fill my kitchen with a wildly aromatic and exotic aroma.Like many of my recipes, this one is simply a starting point to provide a bump of inspiration for you to get inventive and creative in the kitchen. Dig around in your cupboards and see what flavours are hiding in there just waiting to be revealed.Makes250mlAssorted kitchen scraps– skins and offcuts from garlic, onion skins, chilli seeds, the outer leaves of leeks, celery leaves, spring onion tops, unwaxed organic orange and lemon peel, a sprig of thyme or rosemary1-2 tsp whole spices(eg, star anise, cloves, cardamom; optional)250ml extra-virgin olive oilPut a saucepan on a very low heat and add the kitchen scraps you’d like to infuse, ideally choosing a simple combination of two, three or four flavours that work well together, as well as the optional whole spices.Pour over the extra-virgin olive oil and leave to heat up just until it begins to bubble gently. Keep the oil warm on the heat for about 15 minutes, to infuse without frying the solids, then take the pan off the heat and leave to cool. Decant into a clean bottle or jar (sieve the oil first, if you like) then seal and use immediately or refrigerate for up to two days (it will solidify slightly but will return to liquid at room temperature); alternatively, freeze for up to three months. Don’t be tempted to keep it longer, however, because it can become unsafe.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteSauces and graviesSaladfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I love the romance and cosiness of creamy European soups drunk straight out of a mug around a fire in November, but in the icy tundra that is January I need something with more heat and intensity, something sustaining, spicy, gutsy and textured, so that I need a fork or chopsticks to eat it, rather than just a spoon. These punchy soups are simply rapture in a bowl, and make for extremely satisfying slurping.Khao swe (pictured top)Khao sweis a Burmese noodle soup with hot coconut broth, springy noodles and a madness of garnishes, from boiled eggs to peanuts or crisp shallots. Feel free to swap out the poultry for vegetables such as pumpkin or tofu, or seafood such as prawns.Prep15 minCook40 minServes42tbsp neutral oil, such as groundnut or avocado1 stick cinnamon1 star anise2 red onions, peeled and sliced into very fine half-moons3 fat garlic cloves, peeled and finely crushed2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated1 long red chilli, finely chopped2 lemongrass sticks, white parts only, finely chopped6 makrut lime leaves, stalks removed, leaves finely chopped1tsp kashmiri chilli powder1tsp turmeric3tbsp gram flour400ml chicken stock400ml coconut milk8 skinless and boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces2tbsp fish sauceJuice of1 juicy lime1tbsppalm sugar, or light brown sugar250g flat rice noodles, or egg noodles, cooked according to packet instructionsTo garnish (optional)4tbspcrisp shallots40g chopped roasted peanuts1 handfulfreshly chopped coriander4 chopped spring onions4 hard-boiled eggs,halved4lime wedges,Heat the oil in a large, deep saucepan or casserole.

Stir in the stock and coconut milk, bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. Add the chicken and simmer over a low heat until it’s cooked through and tender.Stir in the fish sauce, lime juice and sugar, taste and add more lime, sugar or fish sauce if needed. Divide the noodles between four bowls, ladle the khao swe over the top and serve with your chosen garnishes.Sweet-and-sour peanut dal with pappardelleView image in fullscreenGujaratidal dhoklais one of my ultimate comfort foods, and this dish takes inspiration from that, except the dhokla (or pasta) part, which is normally made from scratch but which I’ve swapped here for pappardelle.Prep20 minCook1 hrServes4200g toor dal(AKA split pigeon peas), washed very well1 long red chilli, cut into thick rings (pith and seeds discarded if you prefer less heat)1tsp turmeric40g raw peanutsFor the tempering2tbsp coconut oil1 heapedtsp mustard seeds1 pinch asafoetida15–20 fresh curry leaves1tsp cumin seeds1 cinnamon stick, broken up2 cloves1tbsp grated ginger3garlic cloves, peeled and blitzed2 green chillies, finely blitzed (pith and seeds discarded if you prefer less heat)1 heapedtsp tomato puree2 ripe tomatoes, pureed1tbsp tamarind paste2tbsp grated jaggery, or soft brown sugarSea saltJuice of1 limeTo garnish250g fresh pappardelle, cooked according to packet instructions1 handfulfinely chopped coriander1 small red onion, peeled and finely choppedPut the toor dal, chilli, turmeric, peanuts and a litre and a half of water in a large saucepan, bring to a boil, then simmer over a low heat for 40-45 minutes, until soft and mushy.In a second pan, heat the coconut oil, then add the mustard seeds and, as soon as they pop, stir in the asafoetida and curry leaves. Once the leaves crackle, add the cumin, cinnamon and cloves, fry briefly until fragrant, then stir in the ginger, garlic and chillies, and fry until cooked and fragrant.Add the tomato puree, pureed fresh tomatoes, tamarind and sugar, let the pan come to a bubble, then simmer for five minutes. Pour the tomato mix into the cooked lentils, add some water to make it soupy, then season with salt and cook for 10 minutes more. Finish with lime juice.Divide the cooked pappardelle between four bowls, then ladle the dal on top, sprinkle over the coriander and red onions, and serve.Cheat’s dumpling soupView image in fullscreenThis has all the big flavour of a dumpling soup, minus all the hard work and effort.Prep10 minCook25 minServes4For the broth1 litrechickenramenbroth(such as the one byItsu)50ml light soy sauce3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced into thin matchsticks3 spring onions, trimmed and cut into 5cm lengthsFor the dumpling filling200gshiitake3tbsp roughly chopped coriander2 spring onions, trimmed and roughly chopped2tsp grated ginger2tsp sesame oil300g minced porkSalt and black pepper24 dumpling wrappers,cut in half diagonallyChilli oil, to servePut all the ingredients for the broth in a large saucepan, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to cook gently.Meanwhile, make the dumplings.

Add the halved dumpling wrappers to the pot, cook for a further 30 seconds, or until al dente, then ladle into bowls and serve with your favourite chilli oil.Explore more on these topicsWinter food and drinkSoupFoodNoodlesPastaVegetablesBeans, pulses and legumesrecipesShareReuse this content"
