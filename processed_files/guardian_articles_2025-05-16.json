Possibly even himMarina HydeSeveral strongly worded X posts, a bungled Albanian scheme and the ghost of Enoch Powell. Once again, he’s smashed itFri 16 May 2025 08.04 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 12.42 EDTShareOn Friday morning, Keir Starmer wasposting without compromise. “If you’re one of the smugglers putting people in small boats across the channel,” ran the prime minister’s communique on X, “we’re coming after you.” Imagine the fear that would have struck into the hearts of all those people smugglers who follow his account.Alternatively, you could consider the above as a performance for the benefit of people other than those to whom it appears to be addressed – which would certainly make it of a piece with Starmer’s entire shtick for “immigration week”. Because that really has been quite a performance – and one the critics are already calling unconvincing, excruciating and wooden. On several occasions the prime minister was outperformed by his lectern.Monday was the big speech, which it is already clear will be remembered chiefly for Starmer’s “island of strangers” soundbite. Listening to any Starmer speech simulates the feeling of incarceration in a medium-security prison, and in this case it was like sharing a cell with a Chinese restaurant’s Enoch Powell impersonator. Starmer plays this hardline stuff about as plausibly as Elijah Wood played a football hooligan in thatterrible movie, which I would still have preferred to watch again over the spectacle of the prime minister droning unconvincingly about the “incalculable” damage immigration had done to his polling numbers. Sorry, to the country.For the left, the problem was what he said; for the right, the problem was the absurdity of it being him saying it. These days Starmer can’t encounter two stools without falling between them, with the problem entirely of his own making. I once read a hideous story about a Kansas woman who had sat on a loo seat for so long she had become stuck to it, and I fear something similar might have happened here with a fence. Starmer has sat on one for so long, on so many different issues, that it has become fused to his form. We are now watching a live fence-ectomy, and it is painful.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer with Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, at the Kryeministria in Tirana, Albania, 15 May 2025.Photograph: Leon Neal/APWhatever the clinical bodyshock diagnosis, the vibes-based one is clear: the British public has never loved Starmer, and never will. On the rare occasions he reveals things about himself, they often in fact seem to be the absence of things. Starmerdoesn’t dream, we learned during his general election pitch last year, and couldn’t name a favourite book. There is something of the slight to him, and he knows it – in fact, he knows it so powerfully that these days all his big speeches contain frequent and plaintive tells. Specifically, phrases like: “I believe in this”, or “I am doing this … because it is what I believe in.” If things were going convincingly, believing in the things you were saying and doing would surely be axiomatic.But things aren’t going convincingly, and so it is that we have a new gotcha question that Labour MPs – and indeed the prime minister himself – must most fear being asked. Namely: what is aKeir Starmer? The answer is – and I’m sorry to use a term that I know many people do find offensive, but accuracy matters – a lawyer. A Keir Starmer is an adult human lawyer, as capable of advocating for this side or that, or even both at once. And so it is that we have to listen to speeches like Monday’s, in which the PM decries the “incalculable” damage of immigration at the same time that the Tories are posting videos from about 10 minutes ago in which Starmer is gurning “we need to make the positive case for immigration”. Again: what is a Keir Starmer? Can a Keir Starmer have both these views? Of course he can and of course he does.The counterpoint take is that the prime minister has a split personality where both the personalities are somewhat insufferable. A legal manager in the sheets; a legal manager willing to talk tetchy in the streets. Strangely, the more Starmer tries to flesh out his immigration plan, the more the logic suggests that the only thing that could make coherent sense of it would be the UK leaving the European convention on human rights. Yet at the same time, how could it, because the one thing the prime minister convincingly and consistently believes in is the primacy of lawyers.Meanwhile, an incredibly wide spectrum of people find they can’t really believe in what Starmer’s saying. His speech contrived to unite Alf Dubs (“I don’t think it’s what he actually believes in”) with Robert Jenrick (“It looked like a hostage situation where he was reading out words someone else had written for him”). The “somebody else’s opinions” stuff is becoming a recurring theme, recalling that BBC Question Time moment during the general election campaign last year when a member of the public put it to him that he came across like a “political robot”.By Thursday, he had travelled to Albania, and by most accounts, he was blindsided live on air by that country’s prime ministerruling out the very ideaof hosting processing hubs for asylum seekers. Perhaps it could be spun as a blessing in disguise for Mr Consistency. Arguably the only thing worse than a defunct Rwanda scheme the taxpayer has paid hundreds of millions of pounds for is a notional Albania scheme that the taxpayer will get stung for, only for it to run into the same problems. But instead, No 10 is trying to convince everyone that no Albanian hubs was the plan all along. Can you believe it? As with most things about Keir Starmer … no, would increasingly seem to be the answer.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionImmigration and asylumLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Bring on the innuendo!Michael HoganFri 16 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 16.41 EDTSharePomp and pageantry. People from different nations wearing camp costumes. A tense buildup before the winner is announced. But enough of the papal conclave. It’s time for May’s other main event: theEurovisionsong contest.The eccentric extravaganza’s 69th edition – expect that number to be the subject of cheap innuendo – is being held in Basel, Switzerland. An audience of 160 million is expected to tune in for the usual heady mix of geopolitical point-scoring, cheesy sentiment and surreal performances.The prelude to the annual Europop party has seen complaints about several songs’ lyrics and debates over Israel’s inclusion. On Saturday night at 8pm, though, it’s time for the squabbling to stop and the spectacle to begin. We’ve hand-crafted your ultimate viewing guide to the contenders, the coverage and the controversies. Altogether now: good evening, Europe – and good morning, Australia. This is Eurovision calling …The favouritesView image in fullscreenHot in here … Sweden’s KAJ perform sauna-based anthem Bara Bada Bastu.Photograph: Harold Cunningham/Getty ImagesEurovision results are notoriously tricky to predict but let’s try anyway. Of Saturday night’s 26 acts, France’s Louane – whose tearjerking Maman is addressed to her late mother – is the biggest on social media, with 1.2 million Instagram followers and 1.3 million on TikTok. Sweden’s entry, however, has the most popular song:Bara Bada Bastu– a sweaty ode to saunas by trio KAJ, joined by dancers in skimpy towels – has the most Spotify streams and YouTube views. It’s currently the bookies runaway favourite to make it a record eighth win for the Swedes.Another hot tip is Austria’s JJ, who hopes to emulate his compatriot Conchita Wurst’s 2014 triumph with opera-meets-techno mashup Wasted Love. Iceland’s foil-clad siblings Væb have been dubbed, worryingly, “the Viking Jedward”. Their hyper electro-rap dittyRóa– which is about actual rowing, oar fans – was a chart-topper in their country and could be the sort of novelty that appeals to voters.Also much fancied is San Marino’s Gabry Ponte withTutta L’Italia, an infectiously naff EDM celebration of all things Italian, composed by one of the “brains” behind Eiffel 65’s Blue (Da Ba Dee). “The Mona Lisa laughs but she’s in Paris,” he sings. Riiight.The wild cardsWe can look forward to some amusingly bananas dance bangers. Finland’s dominatrix diva Erika Vikman delivers a smutty paean to sexual emissions in gay disco homage Ich Komme which, ahem, climaxes with her soaring into the air astride a massive gold microphone that sprays sparks across the stage. Subtle.Another Scandi-pop contender is Denmark’s Sissal, whose Euro-bop Hallucination sounds like a David Guetta thumper with guest vocals from an Adele tribute act. She’s flanked by dancers wearing what appear to be gimp suits. Enjoy, fetish fans.Luxembourg is gunning for a sixth win with Laura Thorn’s La Poupée Monte le Son. It’s a response to France Gall’s 1965 winner Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son, which was about a “fashion doll” operated by songwriting saucepot Serge Gainsbourg. Thorn’s empowered lyrics – “If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mummy” – are followed by a nagging “na na na” chorus. Textbook Eurovision nonsense.The controversiesView image in fullscreenHey there, disco lips! … Malta’s Miriana Conte performs the shamelessly camp Serving.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APLike last year, there have been calls to end Israel’s participation amid the ongoing war in Gaza. A ban on spectators waving Palestinian flags has been overturned, while Israeli fans have been warned about potential protests and antisemitic attacks. Their entrant is 24-year-old Yuval Raphael, who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova festival in Israel. The lyrics of her gutsy ballad New Day Will Rise seem to refer to the tragedy.Malta’s Miriana Conte was forced to hastily rewrite her shamelesslycamp numberafter complaints about swearing. It was originally titled Kant, the Maltese word for singing, which sounded like a certain C-word in the chorus about “serving kant”. She’s woven the kerfuffle into the cleaned-up version, meaning it now features an unlikely sample from BBC economics editor Faisal Islam in a Newsnight report on the story.Estonia’s infernally catchyEspresso Macchiato– performed by Tommy Cash, a viral rapper who once appeared on a Charli xcx record – has been accused of insulting Italians with its stereotypical references to coffee-sipping, chain-smoking mafiosi. It also features the profound lyric “Life is like spaghetti, it’s hard until you make it”, all delivered in an accent worthy of a Dolmio ad.The host nationView image in fullscreenLumo arrives for the opening ceremony of the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesThe contest takes place in Switzerland following fluffy-jacketed Nemo becoming the first non-binary winner last year with operatic banger The Code. The venue is St Jakobshalle, a 12,000-capacity brutalist-style sports hall in Basel. Our hosts inside the arena are “slam poet” (yikes) Hazel Brugger, ex-model Michelle Hunziker and singer Sandra Studer, who represented her country in 1991 and finished fifth. Expect her to mention this rather too many times.This year’s Swiss entry is Zoë Më with breathy balladVoyage. A young Céline Dion represented Switzerland in1988 and won. She sent a video message in Tuesday’s semi-final and has been in talks about returning for a surprise guest performance on Saturday which would be, well, titanic.For the first time, the contest has a mascot: a heart-shaped monstrosity called Lumo. Its ginger curls and trout-pouty lips have seen it compared to the love child of Michael Fabricant and Mick Hucknall.The UK’s hopesView image in fullscreen‘A little bit of yee-haw’ … the UK’s country-tinged girl group Remember Monday perform What the Hell Just Happened?Photograph: Martin Meissner/APLe Royaume-Uni’s entry is girl group Remember Monday – confusingly, competing on a Saturday – with playful power-pop balladWhat the Hell Just Happened?The country-tinged trio describe themselves as “pop girlies with a lil’ bit of yee-haw”. Translation: they occasionally wear cowboy boots. They previously entered spinny-chaired contest The Voice, where they were mentored by Jennifer Hudson but didn’t win. An omen, one fears. They’re the first girl band to represent the UK since Precious in 1999. Nope, us neither.UK fortunes have “done a Brexit” in recent decades. It’s 28 years sincewe won(arise, Katrina and your Waves). Since 2000, we’ve got the wooden spoon five times. Sam “Space Man” Ryder – half-Jesus, half-golden labrador – bucked the downward trend by finishingrunner-up in 2022.

As is traditional, Eurovision will be broadcast live on BBC One and iPlayer with Graham Norton on commentary duties. When the late, great Terry Wogan retired in 2008 after an epic 35-year stint, Norton seamlessly slipped into his loafers as our tongue-in-cheek guide. “This is Marmite – if everyone hated Marmite,” he memorably said of Germany’s act in 2021, before adding about Serbia’s pop trio: “Less Destiny’s Child, more Destiny’s Inappropriate Aunt.”We’d suggest popping on the subtitles for maximum enjoyment of the nonsensical song lyrics. If you want to assault your own eardrums but spare your eyeballs, Scott Mills and Rylan helm coverage on Radio 2 and BBC Sounds. Proceedings kick off at 8pm and are scheduled to finish at midnight but often overrun. Stock up on snacks, strap in and pace yourself.As a timey-wimey warm-up, it’s preceded at 7.10pm by a Eurovision-themed episode of Doctor Who, titledThe Interstellar Song Contest. Action unfolds at the 803rd edition of a galaxy-wide singing competition, with cameos from Graham Norton and Rylan, plus other surprise Eurovision alumni. The Time Lord connection was due to continue during the contest itself, but sadly Ncuti Gatwa was forced to pull out of being UK spokesperson due to “unforeseen circumstances”. Instead, the British jury’s scores will be announced by kitchen disco diva Sophie Ellis-Bextor.

It has won three times since its 2003 debut and is the only country to qualify for the grand final every year it has competed.Cyprus is the least successful nation, having competed 40 times without winning. Norway have the most flops, finishing last 12 times, four of those with nul points.Eurovision rules state that songs must not be longer than three minutes and no more than six people are allowed on stage.

Two decades on, she’s building bonds with a new generation of stars – and going viral with a gravity-defying chair trickFri 16 May 2025 08.20 EDTShareBackstage at April’s Coachella festival, beyond the influencers, branded content and celebrity PDAs, a viral moment was brewing. R&B superstar Ciara was dancing on a chair – not just any dance, but a gravity-defying move that involved laying stomach-first on the chair’s back, arms locked, feet wiggling to the music. She wasn’t alone either; friends Cara Delevingne, Victoria Monét and Megan Thee Stallion were all doing the move too. The soundtrack was Ecstasy, the sultry new single from Ciara’s forthcoming eighth album, CiCi. The dance became a trend on TikTok, with even a 75-year-old grandma from Miami successfully giving it a go.When I suggest trying it in our interview, Ciara’s face lights up with enthusiasm. “You can do it,” she says, her American optimism making me believe she’s right. “What kind of chair are you sitting on right now?” I show her my cheap Ikea number and her enthusiasm dips somewhat. She’s sitting in the back of a plush-looking car at a New York airport, waiting to fly to Atlanta, her phone held close to her face so she can see better. It’s not the chair I’m worried about, I tell her, but my general fitness. “You do need a little strength in your arms,” she says, sitting back as if to say: “Let’s not risk it.”Ciara wasn’t just in the California desert to test out chair choreography. She also made a surprise appearance during Megan Thee Stallion’s set, performing Roc Steady – a track that heavily samples Ciara’s own 2004 breakthrough hit Goodies. That debut single announced her arrival on the global stage, reaching No 1 in the US and UK, and briefly earning her the title “First Lady of Crunk’n’B”, the energetic subgenre that fused hip-hop with club music’s sweat-soaked pulse.View image in fullscreenCiara performing at Coachella in April this year.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for CoachellaThat smash was followed by a string of hits that defined mid-00s pop-R&B: the Missy Elliott collaborations 1,2 Step and Lose Control; the gender-flipping anthem Like a Boy; 2018’s comeback hit Level Up; and sultry slow jams such as Oh, Ride and Body Party. Now, the artist who once cited Michael and Janet Jackson as influences is herself being namechecked by a new generation, including Megan Thee Stallion, Tinashe, Tate McRae and Normani. “It’s so inspiring,” she says of this torch-passing moment. “I think more than those artists know. Meg was sharing some really kind words to me after the performance and I was taking it all in.”Inspiring it may be, but does being an influence to younger artists make her feel, well, old? She lets out a genuine laugh. “Listen, I got a birthday coming up and so I’ve yet to cross a certain mark in my life,” says Ciara, 39, deliberately avoiding using a certain F-word. “I don’t want to say the age – that’s how significant it is to me. But my point is, I feel like I’m just getting started. I’m much wiser than I was yesterday. But, you know, CiCi is still tapped in, so I don’t feel old yet.”I was offputting to some because they couldn’t convince me to think what I didn’t thinkShe will aim to prove that when she headlines south London’s pop-leaning queer festival Mighty Hoopla. Such is her busy life – she’s a mother of four; runs her own record label, Beauty Marks; and is a part owner of US soccer team the Seattle Sounders alongside her husband, NFL star Russell Wilson – that she says she’s still learning about the festival. “I know that everyone loves to come out at Mighty Hoopla,” she smiles. “People want to live their best lives, be free, have fun, dance, leave happy. So that’s my goal: to make people experience all of that.”Ciara’s positive disposition – nearly every answer is given through a megawatt smile – has been tested over the years. Born “a proud military brat” in Austin, Texas and raised mainly in Atlanta, her mum was in the air force while her dad was in the army. “I didn’t have a lot growing up, to be honest,” she says. “But I had a big dream and I was very convinced in my vision of what I saw life like for myself.” It was a transient early life. At one point the family were stationed in east Germany, with Ciara enrolling in a school in Giessen. She can still remember the food – “I did have bratwurst, but I don’t like sauerkraut so much” – and a tiny bit of the language. “I used to say German curse words, mainlyscheisse,” she laughs.View image in fullscreenField position … Ciara with her husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, at Coachella in April.Photograph: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for YouTube MusicAfter settling in Atlanta, where she briefly joined a girlband, she was discovered by record producer Jazze Pha, and eventually signed by LA Reid. She already had Goodies in her back pocket. “I believed in that song so much that I held it close by my side,” she says. “I rode in my car, my little Honda Element back in the days, and I would just drive with the instrumental playing, trying to perfect every line.” Having her name on the credits from the off was important to her in a 00s music industry that didn’t necessarily celebrate the input of young Black women. “I really didn’t think I was bound by my ethnicity, or my gender,” she says. “Then as I got older I realised: ‘Oh that really was a different kind of war I was fighting,’ and I had no idea I was, and why I was. I was just this young girl with big ambition and big confidence. I was offputting to some because they couldn’t convince me to think what I didn’t think.”While the hits kept coming, by 2010’s Basic Instinct, the relationship with her label had disintegrated. For the album’s third single, Gimme Dat, Ciara spent $200,000 of her own money on the video and marketing. “I’m always going to bet on myself,” she states. It’s why she set up her own label: “I’ve just never believed in leaving my career in someone else’s hands. I never have, never will.” There were other battles. Feuds were created left, right and centre, with the media pitting Ciara against Beyoncé and Rihanna (a testy Twitter exchange in 2011 with the latter was blown up into a feud, which the pair “ended” by posing together at the Met Gala earlier this month), while a remix of Keri Hilson’s 2008 Turnin’ Me On was thought to include attacks on Ciara. “In our industry there was this thing, especially back in the day, where executives and teams liked to make girls be separate and not engage with each other,” Ciara says. “It’s so funny because I watch my husband in [American] football and it’s incredible to see how much the boys show each other so much love. And that’s how I’ve always lived my life. I’ve never been a clique person. I always say I’m my own clique.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When Ciara discusses her ability to fashion eye-popping choreography for even her slowest of ballads, she casually refers to the songs collectively as “baby-making music”. Don’t tell your husband that, I joke. “Oh, he knows,” she smiles. Does he try to put your songs on in the bedroom? “Oh my lordy, Michael!” she screams, before getting serious. “We both love the idea of our family growing, to be honest. [Wilson] always quotes the Bible; be fruitful and multiply. But I love being a mom. It’s my favourite job of all.”Seemingly, the only thing she loves more is the UK; her 2016 marriage to Wilson took place in a castle in Cheshire. “I’m obsessed with the people in the UK,” she says in a dodgy British accent, “with the energy, the culture. I love the food.” When I tell her I’m surprised by the latter she clarifies that she loves the Japanese food she often eats in the UK. And Nando’s (her order: spicy chicken, sweet potato mash, corn on the cob).All this talk of Britain returns us to Mighty Hoopla, where the chair-dancing will undoubtedly make a reappearance. With the setlist still up in the air, I suggest she perform 2013’s Overdose, a near-immaculate slice of loved-up dance-pop that should go down a storm. “Oh OK,” she smiles. “That’s some good feedback.” I sense she’s just being nice; if there’s one thing the last 21 years has taught Ciara it’s to follow her instincts.Ciara playsMighty Hoopla,Brockwell Park,London,31 May; CiCi is released11 July.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockR&BfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The survey, conducted by publisher HarperCollins and book data company Nielsen, also found that less than half of parents find reading to kids fun.With this in mind, we asked parents to share recommendations of books they enjoy reading aloud. Add your own suggestions to the list in the comments below.Photograph: PuffinMy Cat Likes to Hide in BoxesEve Sutton and Lynley DoddMy Cat Likes to Hide in Boxes is fantastic for children who might not like sitting still for long. We started reading the story to my daughter from when she was about 18 months old. Each cat in the book does something the child can copy, from playing the violin to flying an aeroplane and getting stuck in a doorway. When she was four, my daughter had a pyjama party with some nursery friends for her birthday, and all the children loved joining in when we read it.Rebecca, BirminghamMini Rabbit: Not LostJohn BondMini Rabbit: Not Lost by John Bond was such a favourite for my first child when they were two. The character of Mini Rabbit jumps off the page, and makes it so easy to come up with an appropriate voice and rhythm that adds so much energy to the book. The final page sting, where Mini Rabbit has lost interest in the very thing he has been questing for is a perfect way to end the book and gets a laugh every time in its abruptness. Bond has given a real gift to parents who may struggle with comedic timing (often necessary in the funniest kids books) by making it flow so naturally from the writing and matching art style. He has also given my family many giggling fits over the years.Matthew, 39, LiverpoolNature TrailBenjamin Zephaniah andNila AyeMy daughter Iris, two, loves Nature Trail by Benjamin Zephaniah, illustrated by Nila Aye. It’s about the wonderful world of gardens and green spaces, from creepy-crawlies to snails and owls, animals big and small. It appreciates the beauty of the everyday, and it rhymes. Even on my most tired nights, I can remember it by heart, and read it as the light dims.Miranda, 40, Newcastle upon TyneSleepTight, Disgusting BlobHuw AaronI’m a primary school teacher with two children under three at home. As a reception teacher I spend a lot of time reading children’s books out loud. With my own children I like a book that is calm and gives me something as well as them. Sleep Tight, Disgusting Blob by Huw Aaron is my new favourite: Lovely, relaxed rhymes with a touch of sci-fi and horror thrown in. Children who can read or appreciate the pictures love the idea of a “scary” bedtime story, and those who can’t, get the rhythm and time with a happy, giggling parent.Patrick Clark, LeedsHow to Train Your DragonCressida CowellView image in fullscreenA still from the film adaptation of How to Train Your Dragon.Photograph: Dreamworks Skg/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe How to Train your Dragon books by Cressida Cowell get better and better for both the child and adult reader, and finish with the most perfect, satisfying ending. The characters are brilliant, especially Hiccup , the unlikely hero, and Toothless. It was my younger daughter who first got into them when she was five and we finished them when she was eight-and-a-half (about 24 hours after the last book was published). These books meant we kept reading together for longer than we might have done as even my older child, aged 11, was captivated.Kathy, East Lothianskip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I’ve used it while teaching in a classroom and at bedtime with my son and it has always been a hit. The point of the book is that the adult reading is forced to read the words in the book “no matter what”. Therefore, they are “forced” to say silly things such as: “My head is made of blueberry pizza.” The more drama and faux-reluctance the reader can bring the better in my opinion!Helen Black, HastingsGruffalo to return with first new book in more than 20 yearsRead moreThe GruffaloJulia Donaldson andAxel SchefflerThe Gruffalo is by far one of the best books to be read aloud to children. It’s such a dynamic read and as the parent you don’t have to think about how you’re going to get around it. It has been done for you. Just let yourself be carried by the words. I have probably read it more than 200 times and unlike other books, I’m still not tired of it and neither is my son.Clementine, 38, LondonPhotograph: TemplarThe Pirates Next DoorJonny DuddleI have two small children who are two and five. We found a book called The Pirates Next Door by Jonny Duddle and both of my children have separately fallen in love with it. The premise is that a pirate boy named Jim Lad and his family move next door to Matilda in a charming seaside town. Their strange ways annoy the neighbours – fixing their ship on the driveway, eating horrible food, turning up to school without uniform. They are nice but misunderstood, and Matilda makes friends with Jim. It’s incredibly fun to read for parents as each neighbour has their own voice.Jack, 38,Clonakilty, IrelandMost parents don’t enjoy reading to their children, survey suggestsRead moreWonder BearTao NyeuWonder Bear by Tao Nyeu might be a bit of an odd choice considering that it has no words. But as we found with our children when they were three and five, that is what made it so great. The first time I “read” it, they could see there wasn’t any writing. They stared quizzically back and forth from the book to my face as they realised that I was making up the story. Each time we read it, which was often, I continued to hit on the primary narrative points that I had established from that first reading, but I added just a bit more here and there. There is enough going on in the beautiful illustrations to do so. The author cleverly includes enough connections between pages to carry a plot, but also leaves many possibilities for you to interpret and develop the story yourself.Jed, 49, Seattle, the USCompiled by Alfie PackhamExplore more on these topicsChildren and teenagersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is whyJonathan FreedlandThe president’s Middle East tour made one thing clear – he will betray his one-time ally in a heartbeat. He is already doing itFri 16 May 2025 11.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 13.39 EDTShareIt’s come to something when the Palestinians’ best hope for relief rests on a man who dreams of emptying Gaza of its people and turning the place intoa beach resort. And yet the clearest, and perhaps only, way out of the current agony lies with Donald Trump – and his growing impatience with an ever-more isolated Israel.If this were any of Trump’s predecessors, you would be hailing the past week as confirmation of a radical, even epochal shift inUS foreign policy. But because it’s Trump, you can’t be sure it’s not a passing whim that will be undone in another equally drastic shift a matter of weeks, or even hours, from now.Still, taken at face value, Trump’s tour of the past several days signifies a sharply different approach to the Middle East and especially to the country that, for decades, Washington saw as its chief ally in the region. The most basic fact is also the most telling: the US president did not even visitIsrael.That could have been explained away but for what Trump said and did on his travels. In Saudi Arabia, he did not merely greet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman warmly, he gushed with adoration. “I like you too much,”he said to Prince Mohammed, asking the de-facto ruler once snubbed by Washington for hisreliance on the bone sawif he ever found time to sleep, given how energetically he had transformed his kingdom.The two men agreed a deal that will see Saudi Arabiaacquire $142bn of US arms. Until this week, a cornerstone of the US-Israel relationship was a US guarantee that Israel would always enjoy military superiority over its neighbours. That looks much less certain now. Indeed, Trump declared that the US has“no stronger partner”than Saudi Arabia, a status that used to belong to Israel alone.What’s more, Trump showed Riyadh all this love with none of the previous strings attached. None of it was conditional on Saudi “normalisation” of relations with Israel. Trump said Prince Mohammed could do that when he was good and ready, free of US pressure.And this was the pattern throughout. Strikingly, in a shift that would have garnered huge attention had it been any other president but which, because it was Trump, was just one more turn of the news cycle, Trump welcomed Syria in from the cold. He lifted US sanctions and praised the country’s new leader as“attractive” and a “fighter”. Given that until December Ahmed al-Sharaa was on a US list of wanted terrorists over his links to al-Qaida, and had a$10m bounty on his head, this is quite the turnaround. Confirming that one of Trump’s great weaknesses as a negotiator is his tendency to give something for nothing, Trump handed all this to Sharaa without even raising the security assurances sought by Israel.Trump is now in the business of cutting the deals he wants, regardless of the needs of the US’s one-time key ally. He agreed a separatepact with the Houthis in Yemen, which prevents them attacking US shipping but leaves them free to keep raining rockets on Israel. He said he is “very close” to a nuclear deal with Iran, waving aside the decades-long conviction of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Tehran’s nuclear ambitions will only be halted by force. Trump made nice with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, unfazed by the latter’s hostility to Israel and close ties to Hamas. He even dealt with Hamas all but directly, securing the group’s release ofEdan Alexander, a dual US-Israeli citizen, a move that Netanyahu only heard about once it was done.As loudly and clearly as he can, Trump is telling Netanyahu that he is no longer No 1 and that he will not get in the way of whatever Trump decides best serves US, and his own, interests. Part of this is born of frustration with Netanyahu for failing to play his part in getting the Middle East to the stability, and therefore prosperity, that Trump thinks is possible and potentially profitable for the US. Put simply, what Trump wants from Netanyahu is to get the war on Hamas wrapped up and off the world’s TV screens – and the Israeli PM is not delivering.You could hear that frustration in the remarks ofTrump’s personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, to hostage families in Israel this week: “We want to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war. Israel is prolonging it.”In fact, polls show huge majorities of the Israeli public keen, if not desperate, to see animmediate end to the war. But Netanyahu is defying his citizens for wholly selfish reasons. On trial for corruption, he can only be sure to stay out of prison if he remains in the PM’s chair. To do that, he has to keep his ruling coalition in place, including the two ultra-nationalist extremists, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. Those men want the war to go on and on, dreaming of a Gaza cleared for the return of Jewish settlements. Thinking only of his own survival, Netanyahu bows to their demands and keeps the fires of war burning – no matter the human cost.Which is how you end up with the atrocity of an Israeli government using starvation as a weapon of war, blocking the entry of all aid into Gaza since 2 March. This is not an accusation against the government; it is a boast made by them. The defence minister, Israel Katz,spelled it outlast month: “Israel’s policy is clear: no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza.” He described the blocking of aid as “one of the main pressure levers” on Hamas.Israeli officialsdefend airstrikessuch as those that killed scores this week by saying they’re aimed at Hamas military sites or commanders, including the group’s leader in Gaza, Mohammed Sinwar. But they can make no such claim for the use of mass hunger, which is indiscriminate by its very nature. It is legally a war crime and morally unconscionable. And yet it is the stated policy of this despicable Israeli government.Too little attention is paid to the convergence of circumstances that created this catastrophe: the fact that the heinous Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023 occurred on the watch of an Israeli governmentshaped by Kahanistsand a prime minister ready to cross every red line to stay out of jail and save his own skin. That combination has brought us to this terrible moment, when the suffering and killing seem as if they will never end.There may be only one man who can call a halt. Trump could continue what he started this week, making deals across the Middle East that cut out Israel, but that also do nothing for Palestinians. Or, following hisadmission as he left the regionon Friday that people in Gaza are “starving”, and his promise that “we’re going to get that taken care of”, he could use the muscle he has and force Netanyahu to accept the bargain that has been on the table for months: the release of all remaining hostages and an end to the war. Of course, what dozens of stricken Israeli families and millions of shattered, starving Palestinians need are new leaders, willing and capable of shaping for themselves a better destiny for both peoples, ideally together. Until that day, their lives are in the hands of Donald Trump.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Not for the first time, organisers of theCannes film festival, the ritziest and most photographed in the industry’s calendar, have decreed that various outfits will not be allowed on the red carpet this year.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.An official statement released earlier this week stated that for “decency reasons” there will be “no naked dressing” – and no oversized outfits either – “in particular those with a large train that hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theatre”.Encouraged instead are cocktail and black dresses, and – perhaps with US guests in mind – “a dark-coloured pantsuit”. After some back and forth over high-heeled shoes in recent years, anything goes, as long as they are “elegant”. As for the men, it’s simply tuxedos or dark suits.While the rules only apply to those attending evening screenings at the Grand Théâtre Lumière, five days into the 12-day festival, it became clear that the memo had not reached every suite at the Carlton. Halle Berry, Eva Longoria and Heidi Klum all arrived wearing gowns of some girth, while a handful of lesser known names – Miss Universe 2016, Iris Mittenaere, the makeup artist Meredith Duxbury and the actor Blanca Blanco – revealed a bounty of flesh that arguably broke the code. As for the men, Jeremy Strong, a member of the jury, flouted rules by wearing a hot peach tux.Barely there gowns have been titillating Cannes since the 1970s. Blame the weather or fashion or both, but who could forget Jane Birkin’s hip-slit gown in 1974, or 2024 when Bella Hadid flashed her nipples in a Saint Laurent gown in sheer chocolate organza. Or indeed Madonna, who wore Jean Paul Gaultier underwear in 1991.View image in fullscreenMadonna in underwear by Jean Paul Gaultier appears at Cannes in 1991.Photograph: Gilbert Tourte/APFor a trend that carries an awful lot of subtext for something that involves very little material, it has become a lightning rod over the continued policing of women’s bodies in the public sphere. “If fashion can be a mechanism of social control, it also offers a means of transgression and empowerment,” writesEinav Rabinovitch-Foxin Dressed for Freedom, which claims, among other things, that women have the right to reclaim their own sexuality through sexy clothes.Natasha Walter, the feminist and author of Living Dolls, is not a fan of the whole naked trend, which she says “bolsters objectification and hyper-sexualisation of women in the public eye”. But equally, she feels banning it is counterproductive. “It’s like school uniforms for girls. The tiny skirt becomes an act of rebellion.”The diktat has been seen wildly at odds with the festival itself, which has little or no rules about the amount of nudity on screen, and suggests that while it is acceptable for women to strip off for the sake of art, when it comes to doing the same thing on her own terms, it somehow contravenes good taste. Also: what about the men?“It does feel like a backward step,” says Walter. Concern that the red carpet might divert attention away from the film is also at odds with its very existence, which is primarily as a photo call. “We are in a cultural moment where we talk about freedom but what you get is that it falls back into what looks suspiciously like objectification.”Walter says that while there are lots of actors who do not buy into the fashion side of things – and therefore do not get our attention – speaking more broadly, “there is an uncertainty about how women should be seen in the public eye” and that regulations over what they wear is simply “another push towards the conservative”.More straightforwardly controversial is the rule surrounding big dresses. “Saying what [women] can’t do won’t solve the issue [because it] suggests that the only way women can get our attention is by wearing huge clothes,” Walter says. It simply boosts the idea that “women are not appreciated for their talent so they feel the need to take up space in other ways”.Who tested the new rules?Heidi KlumView image in fullscreenHeidi Klum’s pink organza gown.Photograph: Lionel Hahn/GettyNo one knows why the former Victoria’s Secret Angel, reality fashion competition host and model-who-once-dressed-as-a-7ft-worm-for-Halloween goes to Cannes, but we are where we are.

This is why | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreEarlier on Friday,Donald Trump acknowledged that people are starving in Gazaand claimed the US would have the situation in the territory “taken care of”.The US president told reporters in Abu Dhabi: “We’re looking atGaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.”But discussions on the longer term future of Gaza have faltered. On Thursday, Trump described his desire to turn Gaza into a “freedom zone”, a possible reiteration of aplan he put forward in Februaryfor the US to take control of the Palestinian territory to allow for its reconstruction as a luxury leisure and business hub.map of GazaThere had been widespread hope that Trump’s visit to the region could lead to a fresh pause in hostilities or a renewal of humanitarian aid toGaza.Instead, the raids and bombardmentover the past 72 hourshave raised the levels of violence higher than for several weeks, with the death toll coming close to that seen in the first days of Israel’s renewed offensive in Gaza aftera fragile ceasefire collapsed in March.Gaza’s civil defence agency said strikes on Friday killed 108 people, mostly women and children, and some officials in the Palestinian territory put the number killed by Israeli attacks in recent days as high as 250 or 300.At least 48 bodies were taken to the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza, and 16 to Nasser hospital after strikes on the outskirts of the central town of Deir al-Balah and the southern city of Khan Younis, health officials said.In Jabaliya, a neighbourhood in the north of Gaza that has seen heavy bombardment for weeks, women sat weeping beside 10 bodies draped in white sheets that were lined up on the ground amid rubble.Umm Mohammed al-Tatari, 57, said she had been awoken by a pre-dawn attack on northern Gaza.“We were asleep when suddenly everything exploded around us … everyone started running … there was blood everywhere, body parts and corpses,” she said.Israel’s military said its air force had struck more than150 “terror” targetsacross Gaza.Hamas still holds 57 of about 250 hostages seized in its October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.Israel says the blockade and intensified bombardments since mid-March are intended to put pressure on the militant organisation to secure the release of the hostages. Fewer than half are believed to be still alive.Israel’s retaliatory military offensive has killed about 53,000 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the health ministry there.A ceasefire that came into effect in January broke down in mid-March after Israel refused to move to a scheduled second phase that could have led to a definitive end to the war.0:55CCTV footage captures moment Israeli airstrike hits Gaza hospital – videoSome of the heaviest Israeli strikes earlier this week were aimed at the current commander of Hamas in Gaza, who, Israeli officials said, was sheltering in tunnel systems under a big hospital complex in Khan Younis. Hamas has denied repeated Israeli accusations that it uses civilians as human shields.Israel has called up tens of thousands of reservists for the new offensive, in which troops will hold on to seized territory and which will lead to a significant displacement of the population,Benjamin Netanyahu has said. Israeli ministers have spoken of “conquering” Gaza.Hamas on Mondayfreed Edan Alexander, the last living US citizen it held, after direct engagement with the Trump administration that left Israel sidelined.As part of the understanding with Washington regarding Alexander’s release, Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, said the group was “awaiting and expecting the US administration to exert further pressure” on Israel “to open the crossings and allow the immediate entry of humanitarian aid”.Israeli officials have consistently denied the tight blockade imposed on the devastated territory more than 10 weeks ago has caused hunger and Trump’s comments will be seen as further evidence of tensions between Netanyahu and Israel’s closest ally.Israel, which claims Hamas systematically loots aid to fund its military and other operations, has put forward a plan to distribute humanitarian assistance from a series of hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops.The US has backed the plan, which has been described as unworkable, dangerous and potentially unlawful by aid agencies because it could lead to the mass forced transfer of populations.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, on Thursday acknowledged the criticism and said Washington was “open to an alternative if someone has a better one”.The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been set up to manage the scheme, announced on Wednesday that it would begin operating by the end of the month and that it had asked Israel to lift its blockade to allow aid to reach the territory immediately.Aid agencies have warned that any delay will cost lives, and that cases of acute malnutrition, particularly among young children, are soaring.UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said on Friday that time should not be wasted on the US proposal to deliver aid to Gaza, saying the UN has a proven plan and 160,000 pallets of relief ready to enter the Palestinian enclave now.“We have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself,” he said. “We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.”Polls in Israel show widespread support for a new ceasefire to secure the hostages’ release, but local media reports quoted statements from anonymous Israeli and regional officials downplaying any likelihood of a breakthrough.Israel’s main group representing the families of hostages still being held in Gaza said on Friday that Netanyahu was missing a “historic opportunity” for them to be released.Recent days have seen violence intensify in the occupied West Bank and new launches of missiles at Israel by the Yemen-based Houthi militia.Israel struck Yemen’s Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Salif on Friday, continuing its campaign to degrade Houthi military capabilities.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warHamasMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

TheEuropean Unionhave understood from the beginning those red lines,” she said.“I am ambitious for our future. This isn’t a one-off. There will be things that we achieve, some concrete outcomes on Monday, but there will also be a step towards where we want to go next between our countries.“And I see that as a journey, not that what happens on Monday is the end; there will be future areas where we can do more.”Her remarks go further thanKeir Starmer’s in the Guardian last week, when he said he would not “start speculating” beyond a deal that was yet to be agreed, but added: “We can be ambitious. I do think that we can have a successful reset.”On Friday, Starmer told European political leaders meeting in Albania that the UK would not “respond by turning inwards” at such a great time of uncertainty but “by taking its place on the world stage, strengthening our alliances, supporting freedom and peace in Europe”.More than 60 Labour MPs have already urged the government to go further than its plans at Monday’s summit – including on a youth mobility deal where a time-limited version is now under discussion.They also suggested further Brexit trade barriers could be removed through a Canada-style deal involving a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) on conformity assessment, allowing standards of goods to be tested in the UK before export. That change has been strongly backed by UK business groups.But the strong performance in the May local elections of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK – currently leading the polls – means any close alignment is fraught with political risk.Tense negotiations, on even the most basic issues, are expected to continue until the final hours before the highly anticipated summit at Lancaster House between Starmer and senior EU figures, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Key conflicts inlcude a rejection by EU member states of UK positions on fishing and fees for EU students.It remains likely that Monday’s summit will secure a defence and security agreement, but that is not expected to allow Britain access to a new €150bn (£125bn) European defence fund.Instead, government officials say they expect Monday’s deal to pave the way for future talks on British companies being able to bid for money from the loan facility known as Security Action for Europe.“Monday is not about access to the defence fund,” the defence secretary, John Healey, said during a meeting of European defence ministers in Rome. “This is a big step, but it’s a first step, and the negotiations won’t end on Monday.”Easing of trade restrictions are expected to be stated ambitions rather than sealed. Members states have criticised UK plans not to exempt EU students from foreign tuition fee rates, a red line for the government.The economic potential of closer ties with Europe is far greater than the two deals clinched so far; 41% of UK goods exports still go to the EU, more than to the US, India and Indo-Pacific combined.But Reeves said those deals struck with India and the US had already delivered growth and saved jobs.“People said you had to choose, and Keir was really clear that we weren’t going to choose,” she said.“I was at Rolls-Royce on Thursday – their engines going to the US will be zero tariffs. The prime minister was at Jaguar Land Rover last week, where it could have been to announce a package to support redundancies. Instead, it was marking a trade deal which means they can start exporting again.”Reeves, now the second longest-serving finance minister in the G7, said the deals were coming as a result of a ferocious effort and the UK’s relative stability in a tumultuous world.“We worked really hard. And also, crucially, put the country first, not the party first,” she said.“And that’s probably more so with Europe than anywhere else, because our economy is being held back by the last government that put the Tory party first, never the country first, because of their ideological issues about Europe.“They were unwilling to do what was necessary to support British businesses, British jobs and families in the UK.”Reeves dismissed suggestions that negotiations were in trouble because of fraught briefings from both sides over the difficulty of reaching consensus in the final hours on fishing, security and student fees.“Last Tuesday, we weren’t certain we were going to be able to announce the India deal that day, and same on Thursday with the US deal. There are tough negotiators on both sides. But we’ve worked really hard to re-establish that trust.”All three deals – the US, India and the EU deal to come – have been the subject of significant criticism from both the Conservatives and Reform. Reeves said she acknowledged the government had a job to do to explain how international trade would benefit British jobs.But she said the Conservative attacks had been “extraordinary” – especially Kemi Badenoch’s vow to rip up any forthcoming EU deal.“If you want to pull up the drawbridge and withdraw from the rest of the world, you’re not going to make people better off, and you’re going to be selling Britain short,” she said.“Look at the deal that we secured with the US, and massive opportunities for steel, car exports and aerospace as well. That’s what I want to secure with Europe as well.”Reeves and Starmer are set to face a challenging fortnight after the EU summit as a significant rebellion grows in the party overwelfare cuts, including a private letter warning against the government’s reforms signed by more than 100 MPs.The chancellor struck a conciliatory tone towards MPs, while defending the plans to cut disability benefits for some claimants.“We’ve got more work to do to show that what we’re doing is the right and fair thing to do,” she said.“Obviously, I listen to my colleagues and hear their concerns, and they speak to voters every week in their own constituencies. But there’s not a single Labour MP that I’ve met that thinks that the system we inherited is working.“I want to lift people out of poverty, particularly I want to lift children out of poverty, and of course, we’ll set out more plans to do that.Explore more on these topicsEuropeTrade policyRachel ReevesEconomicsBrexitEuropean UnionForeign policyShareReuse this content"

However,a recently declassified memoshowed US intelligence agencies rejected a key claim the administration made to justify invoking the wartime law – that Venezuela’s government was orchestrating the gang’s operations.The supreme court case stems from a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Texas, challenging Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. At issue is whether people must have the opportunity to contest their removal from the United States, without determining whether Trump’s invocation of the law was appropriate.“We recognize the significance of the government’s national security interests as well as the necessity that such interests be pursued in a manner consistent with the constitution,” the justices said in an unsigned opinion.In a statement, Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel, said: “The court’s decision to stay removals is a powerful rebuke to the government’s attempt to hurry people away to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador. The use of a wartime authority during peacetime, without even affording due process, raises issues of profound importance.”At least three federal judges have said Trump was improperly using the AEA to speed deportations of people the administration says are Venezuelan gang members.On Tuesday, a judge in Pennsylvania signed off on the use of the law.The court-by-court approach to deportations under the AEA flows from another supreme court order that took a case away from a judge in Washington DC and ruled detainees seeking to challenge their deportations must do so where they are held.The justices said in April that people must be given “reasonable time” to file a challenge.The court has rejected the 12 hours the administration has said would be sufficient, but has not otherwise spelled out how long it meant.The US district judge Stephanie Haines ordered immigration officials to give people 21 days in her opinion in which she otherwise said deportations could legally take place under the AEA.In its opinion, the supreme court pointed to the case ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident the administration admitted itwrongly deportedto a notorious prison in El Salvador as a result of an “administrative error”. The president and other high-ranking administration officials have repeatedly said Ábrego García would never be allowed back in the US, despite a supreme court order instructing the government to “facilitate” his return.Venezuelans deported by Trump are victims of ‘torture’, lawyers allegeRead moreHighlighting the administration’s argument that it was “unable to provide for the return of an individual deported in error to a prison in El Salvador”, the court concluded that the “detainees’ interests at stake are accordingly particularly weighty”.“Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process right to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster,” the justices wrote.However, the court also made clear that it was not blocking other ways the government may deport people.The decision comes one day after the courtappeared troubledby an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office that seeks to endbirthright citizenship, which contradictsprecedentupholding the plain text of the 14th amendment as granting citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States”.Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtUS immigrationTrump administrationVenezuelaUS politicsAmericasLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

This is currently not a criminal investigation, but we will follow the evidence as our inquiries continue.“We will continue to have officers at the scene for a number of days to ensure the public remain safe.“The fire and rescue service is still at the scene, dampening down the fire. Once the scene is safe, our investigators will be able to carry out inquiries at the location.”Two further Oxfordshire fire and rescue service firefighters suffered serious injuries and are in hospital, Oxfordshire county council has said.Tim Metcalfe, assistant chief constable at Thames Valley police, said: “This is an absolute tragedy and my thoughts, and the thoughts of everyone at Thames Valley police, are with the families, friends and colleagues of Jennie Logan of the Oxfordshire county council fire and rescue service, Martyn Sadler of the London fire brigade, and member of the public David Chester, who have died in this incident.”Bicester Motion, home to more than 50 specialist businesses focused on classic car restoration and engineering, is located at the site of RAF Bicester, a former bomber station.A spokesperson for the business park said everyone there considered Chester “part of the fabric of our estate and a friend to us all”.Chester was the proprietor of a family-run fencing and groundworks company, Chester & Sons.The Bicester Motion spokesperson said: “Whenever you had a question, you would ‘just ask Dave’, not just him but his whole family as they all cared about this place just as much as we do.“Our whole community used to say that ‘Dave always had our back.’ Yesterday, he was doing just that – the epitome of his selfless spirit.”People laid flowers at the scene on Friday. One bunch was left by a family with a note that read: “Sending all our love to those who lost their lives and to those who did not think twice about making that sacrifice to help others.“Thinking of the fire service, their families, friends and the wider community and all those services who came to help. Rest easy.”View image in fullscreenFloral tributes are seen outside Bicester fire station after a fire at Bicester Motion, the site of a former RAF base in Oxfordshire.Photograph: Emily Smith/PAAnother said: “Thank you for your service.”Amy Angeletta said she had laid flowers out of a sense of community. “People have lost their lives and it’s quite a close-knit community here,” she said.“It’s just to pay your respects.

The bravery of our firefighters is astounding. Hoping those in hospital make a full and swift recovery.”Ten fire and rescue crews were called to tackle the fire, which started on Thursday at 6.39pm and prompted a major response and warnings for residents to stay indoors.The fire was under control on Friday morning, the council said. Other support appliances remained on scene, including a hydraulic platform, a water carrier, a command unit and a high-volume pumping unit.Map of areaThe commissioner of London fire brigade, Andy Roe, said: “This is clearly an incredibly difficult time for us all; we have lost a well-respected and much-loved colleague who exemplified courage and selflessness in the service of others.“Our thoughts are with all the families, friends, and colleagues impacted by this tragedy. We are doing everything we can to provide support to Martyn’s family and colleagues.“It has been an incredibly challenging day for the UK fire and rescue service. This incident highlights the high-risk nature of the service we provide every day.”Vikas Talwar, 40, who lives near Bicester Motion, could see the fire from the street corner outside his house.He said: “There was a lot of smoke yesterday. Lots of people were gathering here on the corner but a lot of smoke was coming out.“There was flames on the roof, on the top of the roof, and a huge big cloud of smoke in the air. I could see it from this corner near my house.”Speaking of those who died in the fire, he said: “It’s so sad. It’s very heartbreaking. We have sympathy with the people involved.“I can see there was a quick reaction by the fire brigade and ambulance teams when they came in.

Although I am not religious, I was concerned to see the clumsy criticism of those whose objections to the bill are thought to be centred in their religious beliefs.”View image in fullscreenKim Leadbeater on the phone to Dame Esther Rantzen in the Houses of Parliament.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PARantzen, alongtime supporter of assisted dying, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in 2023. She was thought to have just weeks to live, but last year started using a “wonder drug” that helped her survive against the odds.Her daughter revealed in March thatthe former Childline founder’s drugs were no longer working. It meant she was no longer well enough to travel to Dignitas in Switzerland.Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the legislation, said she had not seen Rantzen’s recent remarks, and argued the changes would make the bill more workable and strengthen its protections. She said assisted dying must be legalised to avoid terminally ill people acting out of desperation or making traumatic trips to Switzerland.Its supporters say the bill has returned with strengthened safeguards after being amended in committee earlier this year.But opponents have complained the bill does not have enough protections and has been rushed through, with the criticism coming days aftertwo royal medical colleges voiced their doubts on the legislationin its current form.View image in fullscreenFlorence Eshalomi, a Labour MP, speaks in parliament.Photograph: HoCSome MPs are also unhappy about what they see as the chaotic way the legislation has been debated. Many MPs who tabled amendments did not get the chance to speak, and in the end only two amendments were put to the vote.The first amendment exempting healthcare workers passed, and a second amendment put forward by the Tory MP Rebecca Paul was rejected. This would have prevented employees from providing assisted dying while working for an employer that has chosen not to take part in the process.The eating disorder amendment was not chosen for a vote, but Leadbeater said she accepted it in principle and it would be supported at a later stage.Naz Shah, a Labour MP and opponent of the bill, had proposed the amendment, and was unhappy at the process, saying: “Unbelievably I wasn’t told by the sponsor that my amendment would be accepted until we were sitting in parliament. There was ample opportunity for me to be told and I had no knowledge of any proposed changes in advance. This bill is profoundly important and this chaos does a disservice to parliament and to our constituents. We shouldn’t be playing games with people’s lives like this.”Another MP said the votes on Friday were “just skirmishes” and the showdown that makes clear whether any support has ebbed away from the bill is still weeks away. But they said many MPs were exasperated at the process that meant they felt issues were not getting sufficient time for debate.View image in fullscreenNaz Shah is an opponent of the bill.Photograph: HoCMike Reader, a Labour MP, said: No matter your views on the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, also known as assisted suicide or assisted dying, people must agree that the time that’s been allocated to debate the proposed amendments to the bill is not adequate. I’m disappointed that there appears to be a campaign to rush this through, backed by some significant and well-funded lobby groups.”The debate was marked by protests on both sides, with more than 100 people gathered outside parliament with placards.Addressing a group in parliament, including Dame Esther’s daughter Rebecca Wilcox, Leadbeater became emotional, saying she gets upset “when we get obsessed with parliamentary procedure, when this is actually about human beings, and that’s what I find upsetting, because I think it’s not about a green book, or it’s not about a piece of paper”.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEsther RantzenHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Moscow rejected this, appearing to stick to its maximalist demands, including sweeping restrictions on Ukrainian sovereignty.Images from the meeting, held at the Dolmabahce Palace, were stark: a row of Russian delegates in dark suits sitting opposite Ukrainians wearing their trademark green camouflage combat fatigues.View image in fullscreenThe Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan (C), chairs a meeting between delegations from Russia (R) and Ukraine at Dolmabahce palace in Istanbul.Photograph: Murat Gok/APThe only tangible result of the talks, which lasted less than two hours, was that the two sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, the largest prisoner swap of the conflict.While the meeting appeared to achieve little toward ending the conflict, it represents a symbolic win for Putin, who refused to accept the 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine and its European allies had demanded as a prerequisite for talks.The Russian leader has been engaged in a delicate balancing act with the US president, appearing to support peace talks to stay in Trump’s favour, while pushing for terms that in effect amount to Ukraine’s capitulation.The outcome is likely to be seen as a setback for Zelenskyy, coming after his bold gamble ofchallenging Putin to a direct meetingin the hope of winning favour with Washington and exposing what Ukraine describes as the Russian leader’s hollow promises to end the war.Vladimir Medinsky, the ultra-conservative head of Russia’s delegation, said Moscow was satisfied with the results and was prepared to keep talking to Kyiv.Both sides said they discussed organising a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, who have met only once, in 2019.The stalemate appears to pave the way for a US-Russia summit, after Trump undercut the talks on Thursday by saying that “nothing is going to happen” until he meets Putin personally. On Friday, the US president, who had grown increasingly impatient with the slow pace of negotiations, said he would meet his Russian counterpart “as soon as we can set it up”, raising fears in Kyiv that they could be sidelined while others decide their fate.Zelenskyy has spent the last few weeks accommodating various US demands to demonstrate his willingness to pursue peace. But Trump’s latest remarks – framing a US-Russia summit as the only path to resolving the conflict – underscored his failure to influence the US president’s thinking.Expectations were already low for the talks, with US officials playing down hopes and Moscow showing little willingness to compromise.Russia stuck to its maximalist territorial demands, insisting that Ukraine surrender areas that Moscow does not even control, according to a source in the Ukrainian delegation cited by Reuters on condition of anonymity.Ukraine’s western allies, alongside Zelenskyy, were quick to denounce Russia’s position. Keir Starmer, who was in Albania for a European summit, said the UK, France, Germany and Poland had agreed that the Russian position in peace talks was “unacceptable” and had discussed the matter with Trump. A photograph showed the country’s leaders, alongside Zelenskyy, on the phone to Trump after the failed talks.View image in fullscreenEuropean leaders speaking with Donald Trump on the phone in Tirana, from left to right: Donald Tusk, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer and Friedrich Merz.Photograph: Steffen Kugler/Bundesregierung/ReutersStarmer said: “We just had a meeting with President Zelenskyy and then a phone call with President Trump to discuss the developments in the negotiations today. And the Russian position is clearly unacceptable, and not for the first time. So as a result of that meeting with President Zelenskyy and that call with President Trump we are now closely aligning our responses and will continue to do so.”Zelenskyy renewed his calls for sanctions on Moscow if it failed to agree to a ceasefire. “Our position – if the Russians reject a full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings, tough sanctions must follow,” Zelenskyy said on X. “Pressure on Russia must be maintained until Russia is ready to end the war.”Hopes in Kyiv and among its European allies that Trump would impose tough sanctions after the failed talks were dampened by the US president indicating he wanted to meet Putin – leaving Moscow with little incentive to compromise inTurkey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, he sent a mid-level delegation, which led Zelenskyy to question Moscow’s seriousness, dismissing the Russian representatives as mere “theatre props”.Zelenskyy, who arrived in Ankara on Thursday, ultimately gave in to US pressure to proceed with the talks and agreed to send a delegation to Istanbul led by Ukraine’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov.0:35Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls for immediate, unconditional ceasefire – video“Unfortunately, [the Russians] are not serious enough about the negotiations … Out of respect for President [Donald] Trump and [the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan, I have decided to send our delegation to Istanbul now,” Zelenskyy said.Behind the brinkmanship lies a fundamental and, for now, irreconcilable divide in Zelenskyy and Putin’s approaches to peace.Ukraine has consistently demanded a full 30-day ceasefire before entering substantive negotiations. It has indicated it may be willing to accept a freeze of the frontlines and drop its attempt to join Nato, but only in return for increased western military and economic support, and security guarantees that could include European troops on the ground.Zelenskyy on Friday reiterated that his number one priority was “a full, unconditional and honest ceasefire. This must happen immediately to stop the killing and create a solid basis for diplomacy.”Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a time of battlefield advances by Russian forces.The Kremlin instead has sought to frame the meeting on Friday as a continuation of the fruitless talks held in March 2022. At the time, Russia’s demands included drastically scaling back Ukraine’s armed forces, blocking it from rebuilding with western support, and imposing other sweeping restrictions on Ukrainian sovereignty. Kyiv has repeatedly rejected those terms.Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation in Turkey, is a hawkish Kremlin aide and former culture minister who has repeatedly questioned Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent nation. During the meeting, the self-styled historian, often criticised for historical revisionism, reportedly invoked Tsar Peter I’s 21-year war against Sweden as a warning to Ukraine, suggesting Moscow would outlast it in a prolonged conflict and urging Kyiv to settle on Russia’s terms.Ruth Michaelson in Istanbul contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinTurkeyEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

This is the main reason why Fifa has lost its social licence. Instead of calling out the Trump administration on its pernicious policies, Infantino has become part of his travelling entourage. Infantino claimed these were vital meetings with Trump and Gulf leaders, but why would that take priority over the congress, the only annual opportunity for national associations to feed into football governance? The fact he couldn’t be bothered to show up shows a papal conclave has more accountability than a congress.”Uefa did not expand on Friday onits explosive statement, with insiders suggesting “the point was made”. But there remains anger within European football’s governing body, with executives describing Infantino as following Trump “like a puppy” and his treatment of the congress as “disrespectful and arrogant”. One senior figure told the Guardian: “The guy has lost it.”Some figures within Uefa even sense Infantino’s actions have jeopardised his prospects of a fourth term in office when Fifa’s next election comes around in 2027, although his position is currently shored up by a significant level of global backing.Victor Montagliani, the head of Concacaf, which oversees football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, told reporters he did not support the walkout. “Two wrongs don’t make a right,” he said. On Friday the South American football confederation, Conmebol, said it was to name a new extension to its hotel complex in the Paraguayan capital, Asunción, the Infantino tower.A Fifa meeting scheduled for Miami in June, in the month the controversial Club World Cup is to kick off in the US state, could be the next flashpoint, with some European nations saying they are working on how to drive forward the issue of governance within Fifa by then.At congress Infantino apologised on stage for his absence several times and said it was important he represented football at the meetings. “As president of Fifa my responsibility is to make decisions in the interests of the organisation,” Infantino said. “I felt that I needed to be there to represent football and all of you.”Fifa has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsGianni InfantinoFifaDonald TrumpFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He soon became its crime correspondent, quickly establishing himself as one of the most authoritative and respected journalists covering the beat. He was also elected chair of the Crime Reporters Association for several years in the 1990s and won the Bar Council’s newspaper journalist of the year award in 1992.In 1997, Campbell successfully defended himself against a libel claim brought by police officers in Stoke Newington, east London. The case was seen at the time as a test of the media’s ability to investigate alleged police corruption.View image in fullscreenCampbell talking to a police officer at a demonstration in the 1980s.Photograph: Supplied by Duncan CampbellFive officers had sued the Guardian over two articles by Campbell, in January 1992, which they claimed suggested they were involved in drug dealing. After the case, Campbell described it as “an extremely important verdict both for national and local newspapers who want to honestly report investigations into alleged corruption”.A House of Commons motion, signed by 40 MPs, described it as “a landmark victory both for responsible journalism and for the maintenance of public confidence in the police”.Campbell’s sister Fionna described him as a “much loved brother, special uncle and great uncle and special to many other young people as well”.Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor in chief, said: “Duncan was one of the great Guardian journalists, beloved of the newsroom, and a peerless crime correspondent. His reporting on police corruption was courageous and groundbreaking, as was his pursuit of cases of miscarriages of justice.“During his career he was also a news editor and a distinguished foreign correspondent. He brought expertise and charisma into all these roles. He will be greatly missed by his many friends here and former colleagues. We were all in awe of Duncan’s journalism, his kindness and his cool.”Duncan Campbell obituaryRead moreCampbell said he developed a fascination with crime during his days playing football against a prison side. In his first year at Edinburgh University, he failed every subject apart from criminal law. It was also there that he found journalism, editingthe university newspaper, the Studentand running features on abortion and homosexuality, which were both illegal at the time.John Lloyd, a university friend and fellow journalist, described Campbell as “sharply observant, helpful and supportive” from his earliest days. “Duncan was a rare being in Edinburgh University in the 1960s,” he said. “He was educated at a posh school, but seemed at home among the many comprehensive school-educated, of which I was one on the alert for condescension but finding none.“He had little ‘side’, approaching all in a friendly and open way. His style was respectful, and the opposite of solipsistic. He was a rare man.”View image in fullscreenCampbell with his long-term partner, the actor Julie Christie, at an awards ceremony in 1999.Photograph: Alan Davidson/ShutterstockWhile covering the case of Fred and Rose West, Campbell was the reporter selected to look around the killers’ home, having to remember the details for a pooled report shared with other journalists. He said he had never worked on a case in which “so many people said they did not or could not read what I had written”.In 2016, he reported on theHatton Garden burglary, featuring the kind of criminal characters he had spent a career reporting on. Reflecting on the case, he said he feared crime reporting was “disappearing in a world of tweets, budget cuts and 24-hour news”.He alsospoke in favour of the release of the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, stating that his “main offence is publishing the shameful secrets of the US government and its armed forces”. He went on to write several books on journalism and crime, includingIf It Bleeds, (2009), The Paradise Trail, (2008), Underworld (1994) and That Was Business, This Is Personal (1991).Hélène Mulholland, a friend and former Guardian colleague, said Campbell “stood against social injustice and had the courage to stand up for what he believed, something he did without bluster”.Alan Rusbridger, a former editor of the Guardian and current editor of Prospect magazine, said Campbell managed to build contacts among former bank robbers as easily as he could among judges, lawyers and police. “Only Duncan could assemble such a cast of friends and contacts because only Duncan, among crime correspondents, was universally liked and trusted,” he said.Campbell’s long-term partner is the actor Julie Christie. The pair had been together since the late 1970s and married in 2005.Explore more on these topicsThe GuardianNewspapersNational newspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was previously one of Merseyside’s most-wanted criminals over his part in a plot to import £19m of cocaine in shipments of corned beef from Argentina.Saunderson, known to criminal associates as Jesse Pinkman after a character in the television series Breaking Bad, had started a relationship with Pegg when she was a governor at HMP Kirkham inLancashire, to where he was moved as he came to the end of a previous 10-year sentence for drugs conspiracy and money laundering.11:57Can the UK fix its broken prison system? – videoPegg’s case is the latest in a string of convictions of corrupt prison officers, several of whom have entered into inappropriate relationships with inmates.Toni Cole, 29, was jailed for 12 months in February, after she admitted to sharing thousands of texts and calls with a 28-year male inmate at HMP Five Wells; in January Linda De Sousa Abreu, 31, was jailed for 15 months after she was filmed having sex with a prisoner in his cell at HMP Wandsworth; and in March, Katie Evans, 26, who had boasted to a former prison officer that she had performed oral sex on an inmate, was jailed for 21 months by a judge who said she had been “manipulated by an experienced criminal”.In March, a female prison officer, was suspended from her job at HMP Feltham in London over claims of an inappropriate relationship with an inmate.And in April, another prison officer was charged with having relationships with two serving prisoners, and conspiring to bring drugs into the category B HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.Cases such as these are evidence of a Prison Service in crisis, experts have said, with poor vetting, high turnover and low morale contributing to a situation in which hardened criminals often have more control than staff.“The majority of prison staff who work within prisons are honest, hard-working and conscientious,” Mick Pimblett, the deputy general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said. However, problems with staff retention, the recruitment process and training were leading to increased corruption, he said.“When I joined the Prison Service in 1991, I had to do an exam, I had to attend an interview and it was only then that I was successful in my application,” Pimblett said. “What happens now is it’s all done online, and prison managers or governors cannot create a real good impression of people just by online application. So we’d like to see that changed.”He said the training prison officers received was “basically inadequate. I initially did two weeks’ training in an establishment and then I did a nine-week training course. What happens now is that they do, I think, five weeks in total. The new prison officers now are going into the Prison Service, and they are just not prepared for what they are going to face.”He said new staff were also “overstretched” and “not given any time to work on their skills and how to develop relationships with the prisoners without being manipulated”.John Podmore, a former governor of Belmarsh prison and an honorary professor at Durham University, said although there had been an increase in reported corruption cases, “I still think it’s tip-of-the-iceberg stuff”.He said many more cases were probably going undetected, adding: “Until you sort out the staffing crisis, you’re not going to get anywhere.”At Five Wells, a private prison that opened in March 2022 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, Podmore said: “The first year or so they employed 750 prison officers. Two years later, they were left with 200 – they are not staying.“I’ve worked all around the world, and prison officer training in England and Wales is the worst in the world; it is the shortest in the world.”In some countries, he said, training could last for two years, in some cases with qualifications at degree level, “but here, what have they done? They’ve made it shorter and shorter.”Like Pimblett, he highlighted problems with online recruitment: “You can become a prison officer just by filling in a form.”He said recruitment and vetting was poor, which risked allowing in those “who want to join for criminal purposes”, while “the vast majority will be so badly trained, so badly led, so badly supported, it’s like throwing the sheep to the lions”.Podmore said: “The power balance needs to be with the prison officer and, increasingly, with inexperienced staff and sophisticated, serious, organised criminals and drug dealers, the power balance is with them. And I think we’re increasingly seeing that power balance manifests itself in corrupt activity.”In 2019, the then justice secretary, David Gauke, set up a counter-corruption unit, with specialist staff working alongside the police to support their investigations.A Prison Service spokesperson said: “While most prison staff are honest, we are catching more of the minority who break the rules through our corruption unit and stronger vetting. Where officers fall below our high standards, we do not hesitate to take robust action.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceLancashirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, according to chefs, supermarket insiders and social media, 2025 is gearing up to be the summer of the posh crisp.Jay Ledwich, a crisp buyer at Waitrose, said demand for premium and unusual flavoured crisps was “soaring”. This week, the shop became the exclusive British supermarket stockist of what it is tipping to be the next viral hit in crisps – a fried-egg flavour from the Spanish specialist Torres. It follows other savoury sensations from the brand, including black truffle, caviar, and sparkling wine flavours.View image in fullscreenBalenciaga offers a range of crisp-themed accessories.Photograph: PR Image/BalenciagaCrisps’ popularity isn’t limited to the snack aisle. The fashion brand Balenciaga is selling a£1,450 glossy “salt and vinegar” leather pouchand a £625“spicy chili” crisp charm. It follows Anya Hindmarch’s sequinned Walkers crisps bag, originally released in 2000 andnow housed in the V&A. This week the US brand Lay’s released its new campaign that stars football legends including Lionel Messi munching on its classic salted crisps.Elsewhere, at parties, traditional blinis are out. Instead at-home cooks are whipping up crisp canapés – such as Pringles topped with a dollop of sour cream and caviar. Millennials have swapped the customary bottle of bubbles for the host for a£26 tin of Bonilla’s sea salted crisps. Online, there are viral recipes for chocolate biscuits topped with salty crisp crumbs. The American chef Alison Roman suggests serving marinated anchovies with Kettle-style crisps, while the Spanish chef Ferran Adrià proposes folding plain crisps into whisked eggs for a speedy take on a tortilla Española.At hipster-filled bars, natty orange wines are served with bowls of salted crisps topped with Serrano ham. The Greek-inspired restaurant Oma and its sister restaurant Agora in Borough Market, south-east London, feature homemade hot crisps on the menu. The chef/owner David Carter, who fries agria potatoes in rapeseed oil before flavouring them with everything from garlic to kombu dashi,said the idea stemmed from wanting “something a bit naughty when you sat down”. After trying out fava and chickpeas, he settled on “the humble crisp”, which he said ticked the salty, spicy and crunchy boxes.Over at Toklas restaurant on the Strand, its take on mussels escabeche features crisps instead of bread. The head chef, Chris Shaw, described the British as having “a sort of love affair” with crisps. He argued it played into nostalgia. “We’ve all had them as part of a packed lunch. Or as a kid on holiday. There are good crisps [and] shit crisps. But they all bring you back to a moment.”At £4.95 for a 125g packet, Torres sits at the upper end of the upmarket crisp market but flavours beyond the standard ready salted are booming across the crisp category. Marks & Spencer recently introduced a black truffle version (£3.75 for 125g) to its own label collection. Kettle’s latest range includes asriracha mayo versionand dill pickle and jalapeño (£2.40 for 125g). At Tyrells, you can pick from Wensleydale and cranberry to roasted chicken and sage (from £2.75 for 150g). There are also specialist snack sites that stock smaller British brands, such asTaste of Game, which does a smoked pheasant and wild mushroom crisp.Natalie Whittle, the author ofCrunch: An Ode to Crisps, said the trend reflected a wider cost of living challenge: “Crisps have always had a kind of chameleon ability to be high or low in the supermarket food aisles.”For those dining out less, Whittle said crisps offered an opportunity to enjoy “something a bit more cheffy” at home. The writer sometimes invited a friend over for just a bag of posh crisps and a glass of wine. “It is fun to break the monotony and rigid doctrine of making meals all the time,” she said.However, for some, tradition would always trump the novel. While Shaw said he enjoyed “the strange sulphur” flavour from Torres fried-egg crisps, his favourite was still “an acidic numbing” packet of pickled onion Monster Munch.Explore more on these topicsSnacksFoodFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Three are dead – and one is accused of their murderRead moreAs was made clear on the first day of Patterson’s triple murder trial, there is no dispute that the beef wellingtons she made for her lunch guests on 29 July 2023 contained these mushrooms. What is in question was whether she meant to use them, and, if she did, what her intention was when she did so.Patterson, 50, has pleaded not guilty to three charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder relating to the lunch she served at her house in Leongatha,Victoria, about 135km south-east of Melbourne.She is accused of murdering her estranged husband Simon’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt Heather Wilkinson.

For a 70 kilogram adult?” Lenthall asked.“It’s about 50 grams, or three tablespoons, if we can put it in common terms,” Gerostamoulos said. “But it will depend on how much of the toxins are there, the species of the particular plant.“These estimates are derived from studies that have been conducted in mice, rats and dogs. They’re not studies that have been directly derived from humans, for obvious reasons, but they are very toxic compounds.”Location of Korumburra and Leongatha relative to Melbourne in AustraliaGerostamoulos also gave evidence about a 2017 German study that included a table outlining the severity of amatoxin poisoning, from grade 1, being least severe, to grade 4. The study noted that “other persons who have eaten the same meal may develop higher severity grade” symptoms.He went on to say the factors which could influence this included the amount the person had eaten, their weight, their general health and their toxic response.When asked directly by Lenthall what he expected the outcome would be in a case where two people, neither with pre-existing health conditions, ate the same meal and one died, he said they were likely to be “adverse” – though the severity of them could vary.He pointed to a seperate and unrelated case in Victoria last year where two people ate the same meal containing amatoxin, but only one died. It was an apparent reference to a case mentioned earlier in court this week, where a mother who picked mushrooms from the front of her property for a meal she shared with her son died, but her son survived.View image in fullscreenErin Patterson’s family tree.Illustration: Guardian DesignThe jury heard in the prosecution’s opening to the case on 30 April that it alleged Patterson did not consume death cap mushrooms at the lunch and pretended she was suffering the same type of illness as the lunch guests “to cover that up”.Colin Mandy SC, in the defence opening, made clear to the jury that Patterson becoming unwell after the lunch was one of the issues in the trial.“The prosecution says that Erin Patterson was pretending to be sick and that’s an issue in this trial. The defence case is that she was not feigning illness, she wasn’t pretending to be sick.“The defence case is that she was sick too, just not as sick. And the defence case is that she was unwell because she’d eaten some of the meal.“So you’ll need to focus on the evidence as to how that could happen. Is it possible, on the evidence, that she ate some of the meal and not be as sick as the other guests?”The court heard this week that Patterson told a child protection worker she decided to make beef wellingtons from a RecipeTin Eats cookbook because she wanted to cook something special.5:55Australia's mushroom trial: the evidence, witnesses in Erin Patterson's murder trial so far – videoThe worker, Katrina Cripps, said Patterson told her that Gail and Don were like the parents she never had, given her own had died, but she felt as if they were being isolated from her by Simon amid a dispute over child support payments.Cripps told the court Patterson said of this dispute that “as a husband he’d been mean but he’d never been nasty, and she felt that was the time that he’d become nasty”.Patterson had said “Don and Gail had been like the parents she never had, her parents had died some time ago … but that relationship had changed recently as well” as “she felt that [Simon] was isolating her from his family”, Cripps told the court.The further illumination of the relationship between Patterson and her in-laws went to something else – something that lingered over the trial after it ended its third week and heard from its 39th witness and something that, as the prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC told the jury, could remain unresolved at the very end of the trial: the question of motive.Rogers said the prosecution did not need to establish Patterson’s motive in order for the jury to find her guilty. But Mandy said in his opening that in order to resolve the “fundamental issue” of whether Patterson intended to kill her lunch guests, the jury had to consider it.“Donald and Gail Patterson were the grandparents of Erin’s children, Ian was the pastor of the church that she attended, Heather Wilkinson was part of the extended family and the church community.View image in fullscreenColin Mandy SC for the defence arrives at Latrobe Valley magistrates court.Photograph: James Ross/AAP“So as you listen to the evidence, you should consider, when it comes to that fundamental issue of Erin’s intention, did she have a motive to kill these four family members?“What was her relationship with them, especially Don and Gail Patterson? What relationship did her children have with them? That issue, the issue of intention, is the critical issue in this trial.”There is now one less juror who will decide on that issue, after Justice Christopher Beale discharged Juror 84 from the case.Beale told the jury he received information that the juror had “been discussing the case with family and friends, contrary to my instructions, and I was of the view that it was at least a reasonable possibility that the information I’d received was credible.“I want to remind you of my directions that you should only discuss the case with your fellow jurors in the privacy of the jury room; not discuss it with anybody else. It is vital to the administration of justice.“I hasten to add that I have not made a positive finding that juror number 84 discussed the case with family and friends but neither could I dismiss the possibility that he had. As I said … I was of the view that it was at least a reasonable possibility that he had breached my instructions.”Beale told the jury at the start of the trial that jurors had previously been imprisoned for breaching the judge’s directions.On Friday, as the jury rose for the weekend before returning for the fourth week of the trial on Monday, he warned them again: “I don’t want to sound like a broken record”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsVictoriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a poetry-slam of pain and autobiographical outrage, recounting a writer’s journey towards recovering the raw material of experience to be sifted and recycled into literary success.The present day catastrophes of failed relationships, drink and drugs are counterpointed with Super-8 memories and epiphanies of childhood with extreme closeups on remembered details and wry, murmuring voiceovers. It borders on cliche a little, but there is compassion and storytelling ambition here.Kristen Stewart says Donald Trump’s effect on the film industry is ‘terrifying’Read moreLidia herself, well played by Imogen Poots, is a young woman who was abused in her teenage years by her clenched and furious architect father (Michael Epp) – along with her sister (Thora Birch) who often sacrificed herself to their father’s loathsome attentions to divert him away from Lidia – and their mother went into depressive denial throughout.Lidia throws herself into being a fanatically focused swim team champ which gets her a college scholarship that she messes up through booze and coke. The film shows how in the water she feels free; swimming laps against the clock gives her a purpose and an escape – a cancellation of identity.But now Lidia has a terrible secret: it is not merely that she is an abuse survivor – she masturbates incessantly thinking about it, and utterly despises her weak-beta male boyfriend (Earl Cave) for being nice and gentle. (That, and being spanked by her swim coach, is also a complicating factor for her interest in BDSM.)So when her artistic opportunity arrives, so does a toxic crisis of daddy issues. Her attempts at writing get her the chance to participate in an experimental collaborative novel being masterminded by the counterculture legend Ken Kesey (Jim Belushi) whose interest in her appears unsettlingly like her father’s. Is history repeating itself? Is degradation the price you pay for success in writing – or swimming – or anything? Her own writerly evolution is shown by the books she reads herself – Vita Sackville-West’s biography of Joan of Arc as a kid, William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury as a student, and then, as a young writer, Kathy Acker’s Empire of the Senseless.These personal stories and their movie versions have been undermined recently bynotorious fake memoirist JT LeRoy– whose alter ego Savannah Knoop was actually played by Kristen Stewart in a screen version of her troubled life.But for all that, and some callow indie indulgences, this is an earnest and heartfelt piece of work, and Stewart has guided strong, intelligent performances.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsKristen StewartreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is by virtue of its moderate script and by the unvarying stolid pace over its hefty running time which might have suited a 12-episode streamer.Eddington is a fictional small town in New Mexico in the US, bordering Native American territory; we join the story as the Covid lockdown begins (though Trump is oddly unmentioned in all the news programmes and viral TikToks everyone’s watching) and Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) and Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix) are at loggerheads – interestingly taking opposite sides to their counterparts in Spielberg’s Jaws on the personal liberty issue.Here, the mayor insists on restrictive mask-wearing and Sheriff Cross refuses to wear his and is resentful of the mayor supporting construction plans for a giant new “online server farm” – gobbling up resources and symbolically sowing discord via the internet – and this complicates existing tensions.Watch the trailer for Eddington.The mayor once had emotional history with Cross’s wife Louise (Emma Stone) who now suffers from hysteria and depression and whose mother Dawn (Deirdre O’Connell), now uncomfortably “bubbled up” with them in the family home, is a querulous conspiracy theorist and social media addict – although the problem of how to make these particular things funny or interesting is one the film never solves.Garcia’s insufferable teen son Eric (Matt Gomez Hidaka) is dating social justice warrior Sarah (Amélie Hoeferle) who is cartoonishly convulsed with guilt at her white privilege and at having dumped Michael (Micheal Ward) because he is now a cop, working for Sheriff Cross, and a gun enthusiast – though he is a person of colour.The atmosphere of feverish resentment and wholesale offence-taking worsens with the George Floyd outrage and Louise and her mom take an interest in charismatic cult leader Vernon Jefferson Peak (Austin Butler) who has recovered memories of child abuse and encourages his followers to do the same.So Sheriff Cross fights back against everything by running for mayor himself and winds up encouraging the townsfolk to get their guns ready for the coming showdown.View image in fullscreenMano-a-mano … Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal in Eddington.Photograph: Courtesy: Cannes Film FestivalThis idea of a mano a mano political contest between these two grizzled alpha males promises some comedy – and the film does deliver one actual laugh with Mayor Garcia’s outrageously sugary TV ad, recounting his tough emotional courage raising his boy as a single dad.And there is some divertingly acid, nasty satire on the odious attitudes on show in the sheriff’s department. One cop says sagely that blacks hate Hispanics because they are “fake minorities who are taking their coupons”. And when Native American cop Butterfly Jimenez (William Belleau) intervenes in an investigation, a white cop sneeringly asks if he shouldn’t be looking into an “alcoholic domestic dispute at one of your casinos”.But it all feels secondhand – and a scene showing a fractious town meeting on zoom is weirdly like the legendary online council meeting inHandforth, Cheshire. There is no accumulation of drama or tension or intellectual revelation and the setpiece shootout is ultimately valueless. What exactly is it saying that we didn’t know already? The wait for Aster to recover his directorial form goes on.Eddington premiered at theCannes film festival.

Now we need to decide who will play the other elemental forcesFri 16 May 2025 09.21 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 12.56 EDTShareSome actors are lucky and manage to immediately luck into a perfect role. Others have to struggle for years, sometimes even decades, before eventually finding a part that completely encapsulates their personality.Jeremy Ironsis one of them. But the good news is that his number has just come up, because Jeremy Irons has just been cast as the sea.According to Variety, Water People: The Story of Us, the first documentary feature by acclaimed artist Maya de Almeida Araujo has just cast Irons as the voice of the ocean. Which just makes perfect sense, doesn’t it?Seriously, don’t even try to do better, because you can’t. The sea is powerful and intimidating, aloof and angry. It can look pleasant enough from a distance, but up close is unbelievably contemptuous of everything that surrounds it. In short, the sea is always looking for a way to murder you, and as such it should definitely sound like Jeremy Irons.Who else could you possibly pick? Kevin Hart? Too squeaky. Jack Black? Too overblown. Olivia Colman? Perhaps a smidge too silly. In his day, you could guarantee that Orson Welles would have loved a shot at playing the sea, but nobody wants to hear a large body of water be that pleased with itself. Any other actor? Also no.There’s no telling how well Water People: The Story of Us will do. But the best case scenario is that it will be a smash hit and open the doors to a wide spectrum of The Story of Us offshoots based on various elements and entities. They will all need to be cast as well, so let’s get ahead of the jump and figure out who should play these things.Cloud People: The Story of UsFirst, let’s get one thing straight. A cloud is not just the sea in the sky. Jeremy Irons might be a perfect sea, but he’d be a terrible cloud. If you can’t see that I’m not sure I can help you. A cloud should be lighter and prettier, but the actor who plays it should also have enough range to be able to completely ruin your day. Would Emily Blunt make a compelling cloud? I think so.Tree People: The Story of UsAny idiot can voice a tree. John Rhys-Davies did it in Lord of the Rings, playing Treebeard. Linda Hunt played Grandmother Willow in Pocahontas. Vin Diesel played Groot in the Guardians of the Galaxy films. But to play trees as a concept, as Irons has with the ocean, is a different matter entirely. To do that, you need a voice that exists outside of recognisable frequencies. Your voice must be almost unfathomably untroubled by the time demands of ephemeral humans. In other words, slow. The obvious choice would be Morgan Freeman, but let’s be imaginative here. Let’s go with the American comedian Joe Pera or, better yet, Flash the Sloth from Zootopia.Tectonic Fissure People: The Story of UsTo be a volcano is to play two different extremes. For most of the time, a volcano is a quiet, passive thing that holds an air of menace. And then there’s the inevitable eruption, loud and showy and violent. Very few actors can pull off this juxtaposition well. And that’s why I’d like the volcano to be played by Al Pacino. Or, more accurately, AI representations of Al Pacino. When the volcano is dormant, I’d like it to sound like Pacino from the first bit of The Godfather, charismatic but diffident. When it erupts, though, I’d like to use an AI model of his final scene from The Devil’s Advocate, because that’s how I assume volcanoes sound up close.The Blank Infinite Nothingness of Space: The Story of UsThe final film in the series should be an exploration of space, in all its terrifying expanse. This is maybe the hardest to voice, because it needs to be cold and indifferent. It needs to be booming but precise. It needs to somehow encompass all of life as we know it, but also doesn’t seem to like it very much. It should be the sort of voice that groans with repressed anguish whenever Katy Perry tries to penetrate it. You’ll have spent the last 90 words thinking “Just shut up and say Werner Herzog”, and you’re right.Explore more on these topicsFilmJeremy IronscommentShareReuse this content"

The Englishman will inevitably be fined after a foul-mouthed tirade during his second round of theUS PGAChampionship was picked up on live television coverage.Hatton was within a shot of the lead when reaching the tee at the 18th, his 9th. Hatton’s drive found a water hazard. What happened next was rather typical for a player prone to tempestuous moments on golf courses. The 33-year-old bawled out “piece of shit” before adding a c-word insult, apparently towards his driver. Hatton’s mood hardly improved as he slumped to a triple-bogey seven.US PGA Championship 2025: golf updates from second round – liveRead more“It wasn’t my finest moment on the course,” said Hatton of his outburst. “I was running hot in that moment. I’m pretty good sometimes at saying the wrong thing.”The strange thing is Hatton’s refusal to moderate his behaviour. Perhaps he thinks he does not need to. Maybe last year’s move to LIVGolfhas loosened his inhibitions even further. Rebel tour, rebel antics.At the Dubai Desert Classic in January, Hatton plunged a club right through a tee marker. By Sunday, Hatton was holding the trophy. Hatton was widely condemned for ranting, raving and club snapping at another Dubai event last November. He needs to tone it down a couple of notches, if simply on the basis of example-setting. He remains a fantastic player; there is no need for the histrionics.Shane Lowry summoned his inner Hatton as he whacked the turf in anger on the 8th, having found a horrible lie on the fairway on his way to missing the cut. “Fuck this place,” added the 2019 Open champion for good measure. What an intemperate scene.View image in fullscreenJhonattan Vegas of Venezuela is a surprise frontrunner after round two, having never had a top-10 finish in a major.Photograph: George Walker IV/APMud balls,a theme in this US PGA, have troubled Hatton, albeit to a lesser extent than that drive. “You do your job off the tee, you hit a good shot then all of a sudden you are missing a green by 10 yards with an eight iron because there is mud on the ball,” Hatton said.“It is a bit harsh and so inconsistent, it’s not like the ball always does the same thing. I don’t like the fact it is a bit of a wild guess. I was surprised it wasn’t pick-up-and-place with how wet it was here on Wednesday. But it is the same for everyone.”Hatton’s 73 left him at one under, seven shy of Jhonattan Vegas. The Venezuelan added a 70 to Thursday’s 64. To portray this as strange would be huge understatement; Vegas has reached the age of 40 without posting a major top-10 finish. He surely cannot keep up his form around Quail Hollow … can he?The first meaningful sign of nerves arrived at the last, where he slumped to a double bogey, after three birdies on the back nine. Vegas enjoyed an outrageous piece of fortune on the 17th, where his wayward tee shot rebounded from a bunker rake and on to the green. Otherwise, it was 20 yards wide.Rory McIlroy secured a spot for the weekend despite a bogey, bogey finish; theMasters champion is one-over, just above the cut line, following a second round of 69. McIlroy did not stop for post-round media duties, meaning he could not address a report which claimed he had to change his driver head on Tuesday.McIlroy’s original driver has been reported as non-confirming, a scenario which can routinely occur through wear and tear and apportions no blame whatsoever to a golfer. McIlroy’s poor driving performance in round one as widely highlighted; the truth is it has not been particularly strong all year.

Matt Fitzpatrick’s welcome return to form continued, his 68 enough to equal Pavon’s total. The Yorkshireman has rediscovered his touch in a fiendishly tough environment. Scottie Scheffler is in close proximity, naturally.Si Woo Kim blasted into contention with a hole in one at the 6th. Max Homa’s 64 means a five-under aggregate at halfway. Bryson DeChambeau lurks with intent. The reigning US Open champion’s 68 moved him to three under. DeChambeau’s position would be even better but for a messy bogey at the 9th, his final hole.“It is a great test,” said DeChambeau of this Charlotte venue. “It was a weird day. I felt like I was playing good, just didn’t get anything out of it. I got some weird breaks out there. That’s what this golf course does to you. I’ve just got to have my putting a little more on and keep playing the way I am. I easily could be seven or eight under right now or I could be even par. I think a 65, 64 is out there. I almost shot it today and I definitely saw it out there, I just didn’t accomplish it.”It would be a surprise if DeChambeau is not part of the round four equation. Quail Hollow typically rewards those with the Californian’s driving power. This is a major that has still to burst into song.Dustin Johnson comfortably missed the cut after rounds of 78 and 76. Cameron Smith’s strange slide towards golfing oblivion continued with a third major early exit in a row. Justin Rose, who pushed McIlroy so close at the Masters only last month, was a surprise departure at plus nine.Justin Thomas, who won the US PGA here in 2019, Ludvig Åberg and the 2015 winner, Jordan Spieth, also found themselves on Friday evening planes out of Charlotte.Explore more on these topicsUS PGAPGA TourGolfUS sportsNEC NijmegenShareReuse this content"

So infectious was the joy that one home supporter even charged on to the pitch before the match was done. Call his solo pitch invasion passion or stupidity; it was just that kind of feeling.Konsa and Kamara see off Tottenham to maintain Aston Villa’s top-five pushRead moreFor 71 minutes Chelsea had toiled, struggling to find a way past a dismalManchester Unitedteam that have now not won in the Premier League for eight matches. But then came salvation: a sumptuous Reece James pirouette, his beautiful dinked ball to the far post and a powerful header from the floppy-haired Spaniard. Who needs effective attackers when full-backs can provide such delightful goods?With only a visit to Nottingham Forest remaining, Chelsea are guaranteed to occupy a Champions League spot heading into the final day. The battle for Europe’s premier competition is going to the wire.“The win was very important,” said Enzo Maresca. “I think tonight we struggled on the ball because we didn’t expect them to be so aggressive man to man. They surprised us a little bit with that. But we created enough chances to win. From the first to the second half, we deserved to win the game.”So, the overriding positive: Chelsea’s top-five fate remains in their hands with this victory matching that of anAston Villa team who beat Spursbut have a far inferior goal difference.The concern for a season-defining final-day fixture at the City Ground was the almost entire absence of attacking spark on display.Shorn of the suspended Nicolas Jackson for the remainder of the campaign, nor with any senior back-up striker fit and ready for action, Maresca was forced to hand a firstPremier Leaguestart to Tyrique George. Leading the line, the 19-year-old managed just 14 touches all match, failing to generate even a sniff of the United goal, although Maresca insisted he was pleased with George’s performance.The closest the teenager came, on the hour, was when tumbling to the ground under the force of the onrushing André Onana, prompting Chris Kavanagh to point to the spot. Onana was aghast, the referee was sent to the screen and justice prevailed when replays showed a clear goalkeeper glove on the ball.View image in fullscreenMarc Cucurella heads Chelsea’s second-half winner.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesFor all that they dictated vast swathes of the game, the hosts rarely prompted any elevation in Onana’s heart rate, Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke desperately endeavouring – but not managing – to create amid a worrying absence of potency in front of goal. That Madueke failed to double Chelsea’s lead, driving wide when sent clean through with only Onana to beat, spoke volumes.Thankfully Chelsea could call upon their full-backs. James’s pinpoint cross for the goal came without so much as a glance up to check where the delivery was required, while Cucurella’s header was unstoppable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People like to write us off and call us young, but it’s an experienced Manchester United team and we did what we needed to do.”So what of United? An 18th league defeat of the season is their worst tally since 1973-74, and they managed just one shot on target all match.That statistic does not include the solitary time they did have the ball in the Chelsea net 16 minutes in. The game was goalless at that point when Harry Maguire, displaying his newly developed penchant for masquerading as a centre-forward, expertly turned Bruno Fernandes’s inswinging cross goalwards. Replays showed his shoulder was a couple of inches offside as the ball was delivered.Of course, United’s dreadful season rendered this match little more than a sideshow for them before Wednesday’s Europa League final with Tottenham. Unlike Ange Postecoglou – who fielded an almost entirely second-string Spurs side in the defeat at Villa – Ruben Amorim risked naming perhaps the strongest XI at his disposal here in a change of tack from thedefeat by West Hamlast time out.“If I put some players out it would be 10 days without a game,” he explained. “I don’t like that. I think the best way to prepare for the final is just to compete. We are Manchester United so we need to compete in every game.”They barely did here, but his players all departed Stamford Bridge with a clean bill of health, which is of far greater importance for now.

TheAston Villagoalkeeper was visibly moved as he waved to supporters upon leaving the pitch and was in tears as he headed down the tunnel. Afterwards Unai Emery, mindful of the power of those profitability and sustainability calculations, did not exactly extinguish suggestions this could have been Martínez’s final game at Villa Park.Martínez played his part in a huge win for Villa in their attempt to qualify again for the Champions League, though they may still require favours. Emery checked his phone as he entered his post-match press conference to see confirmation ofChelsea’s win over Manchester United.Chelsea close in on Champions League after Cucurella sinks Manchester UnitedRead more“We are winning but it’s not in our hands,” the Villa manager said. Asked if this could be Martínez’s final home match, Emery replied: “I don’t know, we will see about the team, the players … we will see about everything, how we are going to try and get better for the new season.”For Postecoglou, it was another unedifying defeat and as preparation for Wednesday’s Europa League final against Manchester United goes, this was another demoralising takeaway. By the end the early promise of their fit-again captain, Son Heung-min, had fizzled out. At this point it is intriguing to consider quite how many bruising results Spurs can stomach in one season. This was their 25th defeat of the campaign in all competitions, equalling the club record for a single season, set in 1991-92, and Tottenham have now lost eight of their past 11 top-flight matches.Postecoglou made three changes from Sunday’sdefeat by Crystal Palacebut Son and Wilson Odobert, who filled in for the injured Dejan Kulusevski, may be the only ones to start both here and in Spain. The January signing Antonin Kinsky again deputised for Guglielmo Vicario, who was on the bench, and the defensive trio of Destiny Udogie, Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven trained at Spurs’s base rather than travelling to Villa Park, a decision Postecoglou defended.“They stayed at home, did a really strong session and come Wednesday they are all available and that is the most important thing,” the Spurs manager said. “When those guys play, with Vic in goal, our chances of success significantly improve.”View image in fullscreenUnai Emery said he ‘didn’t know’ if this would prove to be Emi Martínez’s last game at Villa Park.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThat soundbite was a damning if unsurprising indictment for the rest of them, including Sergio Reguilón, who was drafted in for his first Premier League start of the season and his first for Tottenham since April 2022, when Antonio Conte was in charge. His last appearance came in theFA Cup third round at Tamworthand since Spurs were taken to extra time there it has felt like a never-ending sticky patch. There seemed more bad news when Pape Matar Sarr departed early in the second half with a back problem but Postecoglou said his withdrawal was precautionary.Until scoring Villa appeared a touch fraught, a little too keen to record a win that moves them level with Newcastle. Spurs also had a couple of decent chances, Martínez making a superb save with his foot after 16 minutes to repel Odobert’s flicked effort. Moments earlier Martínez fumed at how far Odobert was allowed to carry the ball before locating Son, who sent a powerful shot against a stanchion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Emery waved his players forward and hopped on the touchline. Then Kevin Danso blocked an Ian Maatsen shot and at the subsequent corner Villa sparked into life. John McGinn sent the ball towards the back post, where Ollie Watkins directed a header towards the six-yard box and Ezri Konsa, after eluding his marker, Mathys Tel, sent a shot in through the legs of the Spurs substitute Yves Bissouma. Konsa credited Villa’s set piece coach, Austin MacPhee. “We worked on that specific corner and it came off,” the England defender said.Postecoglou, arms folded, swivelled in the dugout wearing that familiar despondent face. Things could have spiralled for Spurs but a minute later Kinsky made a smart save after the ball trickled through to Watkins. Villa’s home form has been imperious, their sole league defeat in another sparkling campaign coming against Arsenal here in August, and they assumed total control.Spurs were shot and on 73 minutes Boubacar Kamara sidestepped Bissouma on the edge of the box before rattling a low shot past Kinsky. At the time Spurs were readying a double change. Dominic Solanke and Rodrigo Bentancur entered and Brennan Johnson, a former Villa target, was later introduced off the bench. Postecoglou has to pray that potentially wholesale changes on Wednesday will bring a happy ending to an otherwise truly torrid season. It has been that way for a while.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Will Hughes strolls across the car park to get some photographs taken. As it happens, the man emerging from the gym at that very moment is theCrystal Palacemidfield-partner whose praises Hughes has just been lavishly exalting.“Just added about £20m to your fee in that interview,” Hughes shouts at Adam Wharton as they pass. “You can have half,” Wharton retorts. All delivered with a knowing smile, for this is the Palace of Oliver Glasner, where – as Hughes puts it – “there’s egos, but good egos”. No arrogance, none of the blame culture he sees elsewhere. “You watch other teams and hands are in the air, there’s moaning,” he says. “But I honestly don’t see any of that here.”It’s the week of the FA Cup final and there’s a frisson in the air. But Hughes is happy to talk about anything and everything:the good, the bad, the ridiculous. What the first trophy of his career would mean. How a wispy teenage No 10 turned into one of the Premier League’s toughest, most reliable midfielders. Why VAR is “shit”. Whether he was ever as good as everyone said he was. Why he doesn’t really watch football.The last point, dropped in casually near the end of the interview, is perhaps most startling of all. Were Hughes not playing in theFA Cupfinal, it’s not entirely certain he would be watching it. “I don’t watch any football,” he says. “I used to when I was younger. Now I like to switch off away from the game. I like EastEnders.”But then this has always been a player built slightly different. The private-school kid forged in a tough Derby County dressing room, the elegant passer who adores a crunching tackle, the guy groomed as the next star of English football, but who doesn’t even do social media.There is a YouTube video from 2012 entitled “Will Hughes – The Next Great English Midfielder.” Hughes was 17. By this point he had already made his Derby debut, played for England Under-21s and was being compared to Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Jack Wilshere. Glasner alluded to this recently when he said: “I was told that when Will was 19 he was one of the best passers in English football. I don’t know what happened between.”So what happened between? Was he actually as good as that? How much of the hype was just hype? “I don’t want to put myself down,” he says, “but I never did anything to warrant that. People say I’ve not achieved what I should have. If I’d scored 10-15 goals for three consecutive seasons, then I could hold my hands up. But there was nothing that warranted that sort of hype.“I’m very self-critical. One of my strong points is I know what I’m good at and what I’m not good at. [Eberechi] Eze and [Michael] Olise, they can do things with a ball that I could never do in a million years. But I was trustworthy on the pitch. That’s the most important thing for a manager.”At which point it feels like an appropriate moment to talk about Wharton: another left-footed midfield boy-king tipped for greatness. “On the ball, frightening,” Hughes says. “Levelsabove what I am. Some of the things he does – how he’s seen that? There’s no stats for some of the stuff he does: breaking up play, passing through the lines. The most important thing is he’s humble. As long as he keeps that, he can go to the very top.”In a way Hughes was lucky. At Derby he was steeped in a culture of humility and hard work, surrounded by senior players who would give him a rattle if he ever started to believe his own hype. “Unfortunately, for a lot of young players now, that’s not the case,” he says. “A lot of people will tell them what they want to hear.View image in fullscreenWill Hughes (left) in a typically tenacious tackle with Tottenham’s Mathys Tel.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters“I don’t like the limelight. But the game moves on, generationally. Younger players are on social media, which is absolutely fine, but you’ve got to remember the priority is football. There’s those who get caught in that blurred line, and want to be a celebrity first. Which I think is sad. I don’t want to sit here and be miserable about it. But the game I fell in love with when I was a young kid is completely different.”An old-school character, then, on and off the pitch. At Watford and then at Palace, Hughes gradually adapted his game, moved further back, started getting his hands dirty. “I’ve always had that grit,” he insists. “It’s gone out of the game a bit now, it feels like every tackle now is a potential booking. But that’s on players as well, making a meal out of every single foul.” Eleven bookings this season suggests as much, although as Hughes adds with a smile: “Some of those were necessary.”‘If it had been a film, we’d have won’: former Palace finalists share Cup memoriesRead moreTalk of discipline brings us on to the over-officiating of the game, the way VAR slows every tackle down in microscopic detail. “I hate it, I absolutely hate it,” he says. “I just think it’s ridiculous when an official has to look at it 10 times. There’s obviously a line of endangering the opponent, but I think 90% of them [red-card tackles] are subjective. Referees talk about ‘progressivity of tackles’, which I just can’t get my head around. It’s an aggressive game.”What if footballers felt empowered to challenge the status quo? To organise, to mobilise, to declare with one voice that VAR is … “Shit?” Hughes replies. “But there’s many players that think it’s a good thing. That it protects them. Obviously there’s a line. But I think generally fans want to see that intensity, the back and forth of the game.”Which, coincidentally, is a pretty good way of describing Glasner’s Palace: an aggressive 3-4-3 that will fight you all over the pitch, that can cut you open with speed, transition and width. “I’ve learned things under this manager that I’ve never seen in my career,” Hughes says. “The level of detail, on and off the ball, is so clear. If I was to play left wing-back I wouldn’t begood, but I’d know the role.”By way of example Hughes thinks back tothe equaliser Nottingham Forest scoredat Selhurst Park a couple of weeks ago, a scruffy deflected shot from 20 yards. “I should have been two or three yards closer to the edge of the box, which would have stopped the goal,” he laments. “It’s not obvious on TV that it’s my fault. But everyone in the team and on the management staff would know. These are the details many people don’t realise.”View image in fullscreenWill Hughes: ‘People don’t realise that in football, longevity is a massive thing. You see so many players that do well for a year or two.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianHughes is now 30, a player of 181 appearances in the Premier League and none for England. While Wharton and Eze and Marc Guéhi and Dean Henderson jet off for international breaks, he looks forward to a little family time. “Again, without putting myself down,” he says, “there are a lot better players than me in that England squad. You wish you could. But there’s not one part of me that thinks I should.”Go back through the England Under-21 teams that Hughes was part of a decade ago and while some of the players involved shot to fame – Harry Kane, Jack Grealish, John Stones – others sank without trace. So how does Hughes measure his career? Did he fulfil the talent he actually had, rather than the talent everyone assumed he did? “It’s a good question,” he says after a pause for thought. “Yeah, I think I have. People don’t realise that in football, longevity is a massive thing. You see so many players that do well for a year or two.”What would really seal the deal is a trophy at Wembley. Hughes has had a bite of this cherry before: in 2019 his Watford team reached the FA Cup final against Manchester City, only to getblown away 6-0. “Some teams you play against just suit you,” he says. “For us, the last couple of years, I think it’s been [Aston] Villa. Watford and City just wasn’t a good combination. And their squad was just frightening. So a mixed day. Pride to get to the final, but losing by that amount, there’s a tint of embarrassment.”View image in fullscreenWill Hughes after the 2019 FA Cup final when his Watford team were thrashed 6-0 by Manchester City.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesHughes has no idea whether he’s starting on Saturday. Either way, he’s ready. An old-school player who has always measured his career by enjoyment rather than engagement, by metres run rather than milestones ticked off, now has a chance to achieve something tangible. Something that will last for ever. Or as he puts it: “Getting to the final is one thing. Winning … it’s a completely different ball game.”How Ried, Lask, Wolfsburg and Frankfurt forged fearless Oliver GlasnerRead moreExplore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceFA CupinterviewsShareReuse this content"

If you can control chaos, you can be successful’Tom GarryThe manager sees a bright future for Manchester United Women before Sunday’s FA Cup final against ChelseaFri 16 May 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 14.56 EDTShareMarc Skinner has given hisWomen’s FA Cup winner’s medal from last season to his elder daughter and he wants another, to give to her sister. When it comes to Sunday’s Wembley final against Chelsea, there can be no purer form of motivation for a father who, asked what he does in his spare time, points to family.“I’ve not got a rockstar lifestyle,” the Manchester United manager says. “I’m just a dad who works hard when I’m here and then goes home. We don’t make men’s football wages so we don’t have nannies, we work and we try to balance life. I love spending time with my kids and with Laura [Bassett, his partner]. I go home and I bath the kids every night, I feed them, I take them to bed and just spend time with them. I genuinely get a real love, warmth and a recharge from that.Going back to Guernsey: the quiet start that helped Maya Le Tissier make a noiseRead more“And then if I’ve got time to myself, I’ve picked up colouring lately, just zoning out and colouring in, and I don’t just mean felt-tip pens. But that’s a phase. You’re always ‘on call’ but just having those spaces allows me to think better. If you didn’t know this about me, I’m a really deep thinker, I read body language every day, I read how people feel, and it exhausts me. It takes a lot of energy from me, and so I need recharging.”It is almost time for a summer recharge after a campaign in whichUnited finished thirdin the Women’s Super League, a marked improvement on the disappointing fifth last season. Skinner, sitting at the training ground for an exclusive interview, says: “Last season I felt that we’d lost a little bit of the hunger that we need as a team. When you don’t have the most resources in the country, we need the hunger, we need to be hungrier than those teams.“The season before, for us to finish second in that season and get to an FA Cup final, if you balance the success versus the budget, it’s an incredible achievement. So I think it had just softened us, and then what we did after last season, when we dropped to fifth, was we assessed what we were missing. And I felt like we were missing a little bit of experience but also the physicality. We’ve absolutely found that hunger again this year.”Skinner’s reference to the playing budget in 2022-23 is backed by publicly available figures in each club’s financial accounts, which show that United’s wage bill (£3.4m) was a little more than half of Arsenal’s (£6.2m) and Chelsea’s (£6.1m). Nonetheless, there was naturally a negative tone to coverage of United when they dropped to fifth and then several senior players left in quick succession, including Mary Earps, the captain Katie Zelem and Spain’s Lucía García. They have defied those departures to qualify for Europe for the second time. But what was the mood like on the inside?View image in fullscreenMarc Skinner and Millie Turner lift the FA Cup after the 2024 final win against Tottenham Women.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/Shutterstock“There was a lot of stuff going about that just wasn’t true,” Skinner says. “Mary chose to move on, Zel at that moment was embarking on a different situation for her and Lucía was getting a lucrative deal somewhere else, so we were almost forced to reinvent. Now we’re new, we’re fresh. Reinventing the team at that point has allowed us to have a reinvigoration, and that’s what we held on to.“Omar [Berrada, the CEO] has come in, there’s a freshness at the club, and we’ve changed as a team, a club, so those are the things that we just embraced. Embrace the fact that football is chaos. If you can control chaos and live in the space of chaos, you can be successful.”Berrada is part of the regime that has been in charge for about 15 months. Ineos is often perceived to treat the women’s team as second best but Skinner is more than satisfied with its engagement: “They’re ever-present. They’re going through the challenge of trying to make Manchester United great again, and yet they’re still present. Instantly, as soon as we got the result against [Manchester] City [to qualify for the Champions League], Omar, Collette [Roche, the chief operating officer] and Jason [Wilcox, the technical director] were messaging me.“As a club, we’re moving toward statistical analysis for recruitment, and the women have been built into part of that package. We are as part of that as the men are. I can honestly genuinely say that, whatever is reported, I feel the support every day.”The owners have backed Skinner with a new contract until 2027, with the option of an extra year, after giving him a one-year deal last summer, which he describes as “a holding space to see if we matched the Ineos projection” for the women’s team. “I’ve signed here because I can win here,” he says. “We’ve got challenges, we’ve got to beat this hold that Chelsea have on the league and obviously Arsenal and Manchester City are trying to do the same thing, but I want to challenge ourselves to bring success to the fans.”Quick GuideWomen's FA Cup gets new TV dealShowThe Women’s FA Cup will be broadcast on Channel 4 and TNT Sports from next season in a three-year rights deal with the Football Association. They succeed the BBC as the broadcasters in the first standalone deal for the competition.The BBC extended its Women's FA Cup deal in 2019, agreeing to air both semi-finals and the final and to put out highlight reels and short videos.The new deal will bring a significant increase in the number of games broadcast live, with coverage guaranteed from the first round. TNT is to air 19 matches across the season and Channel 4 has committed to one match per round from the third round, with all six matches co-exclusive with TNT, which also holds rights to the men’s FA Cup and men’s FA Youth Cup.The Football Association's chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said: “This is a significant moment for the Adobe Women’s FA Cup. We have two broadcast partners who are deeply committed to growing the competition and taking it to new audiences over the next three seasons. Channel 4 and TNT are brilliant sports broadcasters and are the perfect combination for this very special tournament. We are delighted to be working with them and look forward to continuing to grow women’s football together.”Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Those supporters are preparing for a third consecutive FA Cup final at Wembley. Nevertheless, some have often vocalised a desire for Skinner to be dismissed, so can he one day unite everyone behind him?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The only sanity for me is when I even read comments around Pep Guardiola. And let me be clear, I’m not comparing myself to Pep Guardiola. I’m just saying, the successes that guy has had and then I see people calling for him to be sacked? It’s crazy.“If a coach has lost the players, it’s clear, I think, and I’ve never once felt like that here. When we qualified [for the Champions League], I had a couple of players just saying: ‘You deserve that coach as well, for all the things you have to drive us through and all the scrutiny.’ And in the future when I’m not in this job, I don’t think I’ll face the same scrutiny. It’s the scrutiny of Manchester United because of how big and varied the fanbase is.View image in fullscreenMarc Skinner proudly shows off his FA Cup winners’ medal at Wembley. He gave it to his elder daughter.Photograph: Charlotte Tattersall/MUFC/Manchester United/Getty Images“The reality is, some media go looking for that story because it’s juicier. Whereas, how many interviews, honestly, have you done with fans where they go: ‘Marc, at the end of the Old Trafford game, waited behind and signed everything for all the kids, took all the photos and didn’t go until everyone had finished’? You don’t hear that, right? Because people don’t want to hear, but that’s my character.“I’ve even heard comments around me being ‘David Brent-esque’ because I share anecdotes and I try and bring an interview to life, rather than just go: ‘Yes, no.’ It’s because I genuinely care about the women’s game, I’ve been in it since grassroots.“If people actually spoke to me, which they don’t always get a chance to, I think they’d realise that I’m doing it for the fans. My job is to supply success to the fans.”As our interview concludes, Skinner points out a huge image emblazoned on the walls outside the women’s team offices depicting last year’s Cup-winning side standing in front of a backdrop of United fans, all in red, at Wembley. It is a sight he desperately wants to see again on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenWomen's FA CupWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He had marched past every challenge in his path, reaching the semi-finals without dropping a set.Consistent excellence in professional tennis, however, also means finding solutions when things aren’t going well. Sinner handled his first real challenge in Rome spectacularly well, recovering from heavily losing the first set to smother Tommy Paul of the United States 1-6, 6-0, 6-3. “These kind of matches I need,” said Sinner. “I’m happy how we handled this kind of situation, especially going on court and not feeling great.”From early positivity to cursing on court: how the Djokovic-Murray partnership ended | Tumaini CarayolRead moreThe victory sent him into the final on his return from a three-month anti-doping suspension and set up the dream scenario for the tournament, a rekindling of the rivalry that will probably define the new generation of men’s tennis.Sinner will faceCarlos Alcaraz, the third seed, on Sunday after the Spaniard demonstrated his improving discipline and consistency by remaining solid in difficult windy conditions to defeat the eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti of Italy 6-3, 7-6 (4).“He’s playing great,” said Alcaraz on the possibility of facing Sinner. “I’ve been watching his matches. His level is really high right now. Every time that I play against him is always a battle, is always really, really tough. I kind of enjoy that as well.

He came out the blocks quickly, swinging freely, returning brilliantly and maintaining immaculate depth off both wings.The defensive capabilities of Paul were clearly playing on Sinner’s mind in extremely slow, heavy conditions and his early tentative play gave way to a slew of errors.

As Sinner continued to impose relentless pressure with his brutal, metronomic groundstrokes, Paul buckled.By the time the Italian led 2-0 in set three, after winning eight games in a row, he was in complete control. There was, however, one final twist. At 3-1, Sinner threw in a loose service game to give back the break. After shaking out his leg earlier in the set, his limp between points had gradually become more pronounced.Within the rallies, however, Sinner continued to chase down every ball and continued his dominance from the baseline with his far greater pace and weight of shot as he closed out another supreme win. “I hope to recover in the best possible way,” said Sinner on his physical issues. “Since a couple of matches [I have had] a blister under the foot, which then some other muscles, they work. I’m not concerned about my leg. Hopefully the blister is going to be healed as fast as possible. But in any case, as I said, there are no excuses, no? I’m in the final.

They come adorned in therosso corsaof theScuderia, heading towards their first home race of the season and the long-awaited chance to see the seven-time world championLewis Hamiltontake to the track for the team they feel are their own.The anticipation, building for more than a year, is palpable and the passion that comes with it all too striking – as Hamilton is more than aware.Lewis Hamilton at 40: F1 trailblazer has it all to prove again at FerrariRead moreSince Monday thetifosi, as Italians call fans, have stood patiently outside the factory gates at Maranello, less than 50 miles from Imola. There each day to see the drivers arrive in the morning and waiting steadfastly until they leave in the evening, before they follow the team up the road to Imola.When Hamilton announced he was to switch toFerrarifrom Mercedes at the start of last season, thetifosiknew there was a full season to go before their man would don the scarlet but even at this race last year his arrival was being celebrated. The most successful driver in the sport’s history finally united with the oldest and most successful marque and the dream of finally ending the Scuderia’s drivers’ championship drought stretching back to 2007.Yet Ferrari are not in the place Hamilton or the team expected for their first foray together on Italian soil. Having finished as runners-up to McLaren last year and closing with a competitive car, this season has opened with disappointment, as the SF-25 struggles for pace and performance. The single swallow that was awin in the sprint racein China for Hamilton was not the harbinger of spring for Ferrari.In Imola Hamilton knew the weight, the history and the hope that is part and parcel of driving for the Scuderia. “It is pretty incredible the support this team has,” he said. “There is a lot of high hope and expectation of course but that comes with greatness. When you are a great team, that is what people expect.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton in practice at Imola.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty ImagesGreat expectations then but Hamilton is seventh in the drivers’ title and 90 points behind the leader, McLaren’s Oscar Piastri, with Ferrari fourth in the constructors’. At thelast round in Miamihe and his teammate Charles Leclerc found themselves in an intense fight with the two Williams cars, there absolutely on merit, and with Leclerc and Hamilton managing only seventh and eighth.The tricky start to the season has been harder on Hamilton, who is adapting to a new team, its structure, operations and personnel after 12 years at Mercedes. This is a complex enough task even if the car is quick and compliant, which the Ferrari is not.His frustration has been aired but it is as yet still only that, an immensely competitive driver urging his team on to more. The scrutiny on them all has only ramped up to a greater degree for this home race, as acknowledged by the team principal, Fred Vasseur.“There is extra pressure but we have to take this as a positive, as a push and to see all thetifosiin the grandstands it’s an extra motivation,” he said. “Lewis’s position is that he is taking it as a huge opportunity, this home race in front of thetifosi, with all this enthusiasm.”Certainly here the British driver’s arrival has been embraced. Kiarah and her friend Selena, 19-year-olds from Ravenna, were bedecked in Hamilton’s No 44 branded Ferrari team gear, with Kiarah, having added a home made set of “44” deeley boppers, waggling enthusiastically with every bob of her head. “We are so excited to see him,” they said almost in unison. “We like his mentality, he is a winner. To have him at Ferrari, we are so happy,” said Kiarah. “He will win for Ferrari, maybe not now but later, he will.”George Russell scornful of ‘crazy’ FIA’s retreat on swearing driversRead moreThere is, then, something of a mutual appreciation occurring between driver and perhaps the most ardent fans of them all. A relationship perhaps unique to Ferrari and its place in Italy, as Hamilton recognised and was soaking up at Imola. “You know that Italians are passionate and that there is passion around Ferrari,” he added. “But it’s a lot more than you expect when you are actually in it and it is beautiful.”Hamilton managed fifth fastest in first practice, with the time sheets headed again by the two championship leading McLarens, of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, but with under a tenth of a second separating the top five.In the afternoon session Piastri was once more on top, two-hundredths clear of Norris but with both drivers enjoying a full two-tenths on Alpine’s Pierre Gasly in third, Mercedes’s George Russell fourth and Max Verstappen fifth for Red Bull.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneFerrariLewis HamiltonMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In place at Wembley are our reporting team of David Hytner, Barney Ronay, Jonathan Wilson and Jamie Jackson. Will Erling Haaland rediscover his spark? Despite seemingly scoring goals galore for City, the striker is yet to register for the club in a final. He drew blanks in the 2023 Champions League showpiece and the past two FA Cup finals against Manchester United. He has scored 30 times this season but not since March due to a long spell out injured.

Oscar Piastri leads Lando Norris by 16 points after four wins, including the last three in a row, with Red Bull’s reigning champion, Max Verstappen - winner of the last three races in Imola – 32 points off the pace in third. There has been plenty of swirl in the paddock, meanwhile, particularly at Alpine. Wiley F1 stalwart Flavio Briatore takes over from Oliver Oakes as team boss, though not technically as principal, while on the track Jack Doohan has been replaced by Franco Colapinto after only six races.View image in fullscreenCarlos Sainz prepares for the practice session at Emilia-Romagna.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesPremier League2.15pmWest Ham v Nottingham Forest liveDominic Booth follows the cut and thrust live, followed by Jacob Steinberg’s match report as the visitors seek their first league double over the Hammers since 1983-84. West Ham won 2-0 at Manchester United last time out, but have only once this season won consecutive Premier League matches (v Arsenal and Leicester in February). Their last three at home have all finished level. Forest, meanwhile, have won just one of their last six Premier League games, a dip in form that has seen them slip from third to seventh in the table. They must hope the noise around striker Taiwo Awoniyi’s serious injury and owner Evangelos Marinakis’ intemperate behaviour will not prove a distraction as they seek a place in Europe.Premier League4.30pmArsenal v Newcastle liveA big game to bookend our weekend football coverage: Second meet third in the table separated by two points and Newcastle are certainly Arsenal’s bogey team. Eddie Howe’s visitors have won three games against the Gunners this season, 1-0 in the Premier League and 2-0 in both legs of the League Cup semi-final. No team has ever beaten Arsenal four times in a single campaign and it must be troubling for Mikel Arteta that his side are without a win in their last four home games in all competitions.

She shouldFri 16 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 10.51 EDTShareWhat should become of the two idiots who took a chainsaw to the belovedSycamore Gap tree? Obviously it was thuggish, a pointless desecration of something that gave countless people joy, judging by the outpouring of unexpectedly deep emotion that followed. Landscapes work their way into the soul. But so does the thought of two children whose father is about to be jailed for what the judge warned would be a “lengthy period”. Though a line obviously has to be drawn, is this really the best way we can think of to punish a heartless act that nonetheless posed no danger to human life?Now is the perfect time to wrestle with questions such as this, about whom we send to prison and why, and whether doing it differently would lead to a more humane but more effective prison system and ultimately cut crime. For this government is – shock, horror – finally about to do something liberals might actually like. Next week the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is due to publish a review of sentencing commissioned from one of her Tory predecessors, David Gauke,expected among other things to recommendthat inmates be allowed to earn freedom after serving only a third of their sentences by good behaviour, or by engaging with work and education that will help them get jobs on release. It’s something progressives have wanted for years but which government after government has nervously backed away from, fearful of being branded soft on crime – though the inspiration was tough, Republican-governed Texas, where reoffending rateshave fallen by nearly a thirdsince similar reforms were introduced. Unfortunately, a crisis left by the last government means this one now looks as if it’s not exactly acting out of choice.On Wednesday Mahmood was forced intoannouncing emergency measuresto stop overstuffed jails in England and Wales exploding. Prisoners on early release who then end up getting recalled to prison – for reoffending, or breaking court orders not to go near their victims – will no longer be made to serve the full remainder of their sentence, but merely locked up for another 28 days. Though it won’t cover those committing the most heinous new crimes, or anyone sentenced for more than four years originally, it may apply to some sexual offenders and it holds a particularly intimate terror for survivors of domestic violence.If he knows where you live and work, where the kids go to school or where your family are, is a few more weeks behind bars enough of a deterrent for men determined to stalk and punish the women who got them convicted? The usual “soft on crime” headlines from the usual quarters are less of a worry than sobering warnings from the likes of domestic abuse commissioner Nicole Jacobs, no natural scaremonger, about “the lack of consideration for victims’ safety, and how many lives are being put in danger because of this proposed change”.Though it may be a cold day in hell before the current Conservative party admits it, they’re the ones who left Mahmood in the position every justice secretary dreads. Years of Tory governments promising new prison places but failing actually to provide them means we’re back to the boiling pointfirst reached last summer, where if space isn’t created soon then judges would be physically unable to send anyone down, risking a collapse of law and order as criminals realise they’re untouchable. Mahmood, in short, had to act. But it’s an unhelpfully anxiety-inducing runup to a debate about letting even more offenders out early, this time by strategic choice.What’s frustrating is that the Gauke review represents a once-in-a-generation chance to flip the script. No more talking tough and noisily ratcheting up sentences, even as the last lot of recently released inmates head back in through our prisons’ revolving doors (almostone in five prisonersnow are there on recall, andaround one in fouradult prisoners ultimately reoffend). Instead we could start with a more enlightened approach to cutting crime that examines who should really be in jail, what the effective alternatives should be, and how prisoners can be incentivised to prepare for a productive and law-abiding life outside. If the country could be confident that community service meant something more than bored people in hi-vis listlessly picking up litter, and that locking up a smaller but better targeted number of offenders could counterintuitively make us all safer in the long term, this might be a rare chance for common sense to prevail.For Keir Starmer, seemingly locked in a cycle of unconvincing tribute acts to Nigel Farage, it was also a chance to do something that feels authentic; a nod both to the reforming lawyer he used to be, and to supporters bewildered by what he seems to have become. But perhaps it’s not too late to build a coalition of all those – starting with former justice ministers of all stripes, some of whom will privately admit they knew that what they were doing wasn’t working – with a genuine interest in rehabilitation.The fallen Sycamore Gap tree will in time regrow. TheNational Trust made sure of that, collecting seeds and cultivating hundreds of saplings that will be planted around the country, many in memory of lives lost, and there was something inexplicably moving about the pictures shared from their nursery of new life springing from old. The tree, at least, gets a second chance.

Plus, Trump’s flying freebieFri 16 May 2025 06.28 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 10.38 EDTShareMondayOn a day like this, I think back tomy heart attack last year. The doctors, nurses and hospital porters who treated me in St George’s. My 24 hours in A&E, wired up to various monitors, while staff tried to find me a bed. The two days on an overflow ward. The surgeon and his cardio team who had finished their list early and were well within their rights to knock off for the day or take it easy for the rest of their shift, but instead chose to treat me several days sooner than expected. Just because they could. To make a stranger’s life immeasurably better. To save my life. The hospital may have been stretched to breaking point but its staff could not have done more for me. Staff that had come to work in the UK from dozens of countries.On a day like this, I also think of the staff at the care home where my mother spent the last seven years of her lifebefore she died in Marchthis year. The men and women who did their best to ease the confusion her Alzheimer’s caused her, who bathed her and helped her go to the toilet. Almost a second family to her. They, too, had come to this country from all over the world to do the job that few others wanted to do. So to have spent part of the morning listening to Keir Starmerdenigrate the role that immigrants have played in this countrywas a depressing experience. It was his language,more than the measures in the white paper, that stuck in the throat. The echoes ofEnoch Powell’s “strangers in their own country”in his “island of strangers”. We are told thatthe similaritieswereaccidental. In which case, the communications team at No 10 is tone deaf.Then Starmer said immigration had done incalculable damage to the country; that he was putting an end to this “squalid chapter in this country’s history”. Maybe Starmer has been blessed. Maybe he has never needed to use the NHS’s emergency services. Never needed to put an elderly relative in a care home. Never eaten out, even? But I can say with confidence that I might not have been here now but for this “squalid chapter”. I am, and always will be, profoundly grateful for what those people did for me. I can still remember their faces, long after they have probably forgotten mine. There may be a grownup conversation to be had about immigration. But this wasn’t it.TuesdayTo think that we Brits were outraged Starmer helped himself to severalfree suits and some Arsenal ticketsand that Rachel Reeveswangled some Sabrina Carpenterfreebies. Chris Weston, the chief executive of Thames Water,trousered a £195,000 bonusafter being in the job for only three months and with raw sewage still being pumped into our rivers. You’d have thought a £195,000 pay cut would have been more in order.But maybe, rather than berating the UK boss class for its inability to keep its nose out of the trough, we ought to have been appalled by their lack of ambition, as this week we have learned that Donald Trump is preparing to help himself to a$400m Boeing 747 nicknamed “the flying palace”donated by the Qatari royal family. By all accounts, the plane – kitted out with a grand staircase, designer bathrooms and private bedroom suites – makes Agent Orange’s Mar-a-Lago look tasteful and understated. But The Donald is thrilled with his freebie and has announced that he plans to use the aircraft as a replacement to Air Force One for the duration of his presidency before taking it into private use in January 2029 as part of his Library Foundation. There is no confusion in Trump’s mind: this wasn’t a gift to the office of the president, it was a personal freebie.You can’t help wondering what else he might annex for his library without any books – Trump has never been a big reader. Maybe thepresidential car, The Beast, might also find its way to Florida. Along with the contents of the Oval Office. Understandably, Democrats and some Republicans arefeeling a little queasyabout all this, wondering if a freebie from a country with a far from unblemished record offunding terrorist organisationsis the right look for the US. But The Donald is unrepentant, boasting on social media about how great he is at securing freebies from world leaders.WednesdayThe latest favourability ratings of the royal family have just been published by the polling company YouGov. Out in front is Prince William on 75%, closely followed by Catherine on 72%. I guess that’s a reward for being next in line to the throne and not saying very much about anything. We Brits generally prefer our royals to belargely decorative: seen but not heard. Personally speaking, I can’t remember a single thing the couple has done over the last six months. Next is Princess Anne on 69%. She has always polled well, mainly because she keeps her complaints to herself. The king is on 61%. Why he lags behind the others is a mystery. Perhaps there are still some royalists who can’t forgive him for marrying Camilla, who polls at 46%.View image in fullscreenCharles and Camilla: ‘We’re here to see Prince Andrew’s one-man show.’Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersBut it’s down the bottom of the list where the real interest lies. Harry and Meghan are on 27% and 20% respectively. That’s what you get for moving to California and constantly complaining that the other royals don’t give you enough money orreturn your calls. I actually have a soft spot for Harry. I know he’s annoying,entitledand riddled with contradictions but I can’t help feeling the real problem is that he is an emotional mess. He needs to find a decent therapist; someone who will confront him with home truths.Then we come to Andrew on 5% – up 1% since the last poll. This is staggering. One can only ask: why so many? Clearly there must be some people whoclock up all Andrew’s bad news headlines– hisinvolvement with Jeffrey Epsteinand the allegations of child sexual abuse, the dodgy company with whom he hangs out, the helicopter rides to play golf and the general air of self-importance and lack of interest in the people of the United Kingdom – and think: “That’s my type of guy. That’s exactly what I want from a member of the royal family. He’s the man to make Britain great again.” So keep up the good work, Andy. You must be doing something right.ThursdayIt’s a strange time to be a Spurs supporter. My friend Matthew, who sits next to me at White Hart Lane, is all about the glory. He has blanked out the pain of the league season and has eyes only onwinning the Europa League Cupnext Wednesday. All will be forgiven if we lift the cup. The season will be crowned with glory: 21 May, the greatest night in the club’s history since we won the Uefa cup 41 long years ago. Matthew has booked himself on to a coach to Bilbao, happy to make the 20-hour journey both ways.As for me? Well, I don’t quite see it that way. Maybe it’s because I’m 15 years older than Matthew, and 15 years more jaded. There was no way I was ever going to go by coach, and the cost of flights and hotels have been jacked up to extortionate levels. Mediocre hotels are charging up to £1,000 for one night. Even then, I still might have found a way to go if the team had fulfilled its part of the bargain with the fans.But the fact remains that for a large part of the season,they have been terrible. It’s not the losing I mind.It’s the attitude. In many games, they have appeared clueless. Almost to the point of not caring. Sunday’s match against Crystal Palacewas a case in point. Palace also have a big final coming up and little to play for in the league. But they played with pride. We just seemed happy to have avoided relegation. So I will be watching the final on the TV at home. And if we win, I can guarantee I will be kicking myself for not going. Which reminds me … it’s time to renew my season ticket.FridayThroughout the year, I have been doing events around the country, talking about the psychodrama of the past 10 years or so in politics. From theScottish referendum to the Brexit vote. Thecraziness of the Theresa MayandBoris Johnson years. Covid andPartygate. The surreal49 days of Liz Truss, the only politician I’ve ever seen who tried to leave a room via a first-floor window. Theunbearable lightness of Rishi Sunak. And now Keir Starmer. I wrote three days after last year’s election that the grownups were back in Westminster. Not sure I got that one entirely right.It’s been lovely playing to full houses, but some of the most touching moments have come after the show, when I get to talk to people who have stayed behind. The people who ask about my mental health and want to share their experiences. The woman who read an article I had written about thebreathing workshop with the remarkable Alan Dolan. She had been inspired to sign up for a session and has gone on to train as a breathing teacher.But pride of place goes to the man who wrote to tell me he had got chatting to a woman during the interval because he felt they must have a lot in common if they had both come to the show. The long and short of it is they are now a couple. My next dates are at theHay festivalon 26 May and at the Komedia in Brighton on 22 June. Come along, you are guaranteed some laughs. And you might even find your soulmate.View image in fullscreenPope Leo with Jannik: ‘I’m good with sinners.’Photograph: APExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumDigested weekNHSHealthDonald TrumpKeir StarmerMonarchyTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s no surprise Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’s team is deploying the tacticFri 16 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 06.29 EDTShareSean “Diddy” Combs’s sex-trafficking and racketeering trial is under way, and the music mogul’s lawyers gave us a glimpse into what their strategy would be during jury selection last week, when they finally admitted that he was violent toward his ex Cassie Ventura. But now they’re claiming that the violence was mutual.In astatementto the judge, the defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said they plan to “take the position [that] there was mutual violence in their relationship”. Combs’s lawyers also describe Ventura, the prosecution’s star witness, as “strong” with “a nature of violence”, and “capable of starting physical confrontation”.This is classic men’s rights fare, and now is a great time to remind everyone that mutual abuse isn’t a thing – and it is extremely dangerous to allow celebrities to normalize it.Most experts in mental health and intimate partner violenceagreethat there is no such thing as mutual abuse, despite how popular the term has become.Experts note, in fact, that “it is impossible for both members of an unhealthy relationship to have equal power,” that “abusers might use the concept of mutual abuse to blame the people they abuse for their harmful behavior,” and that “victims of abuse may fight back, defend themselves, or attempt to regain a sense of control.”It’s Amber Heard and Johnny Depp all over again, and it’s no surprise that Combs’s lawyers are deploying the same tactics, seeing how successful Depp’s lawyers were in painting Heard as a violent, unhinged person, and not a victim who was fighting for her life.Ruth Glenn, the CEO of National Coalition Against Domestic Violence,toldRolling Stone during the Heard-Depp trial: “There is no such thing [as mutual abuse]. You have a primary aggressor and a primary victim … What could be happening is you have a survivor doing what they need to do to defend themselves,” she said. “But when you have clinicians framing it as ‘mutual abuse’, it’s very harmful.”This demonization of female victims in order to absolve their male abusers works well in a society that already doesn’t believe women, and conveniently refuses to acknowledge how trauma and a tremendous imbalance of power can force them to stay in those violent relationships.Aside from this unconscionable defence, I’ve also been trying to figure out what to do with all the horrific testimony we’re hearing, the inevitable spectacle that this has become, and the bravery of Combs’s alleged victims who are testifying.We’veheardthat Combs had Ventura urinated on, forced her to have sex for days with no sleep including while on her period, forced her to have sex with escorts while he watched and recorded, made her carry his guns and beat her at the slightest provocation. I’m not exaggerating when I say the stuff coming out of this trial is some of the most gruesome and horrifying I have ever heard. But Ventura’s bravery in speaking up, in reliving this alleged trauma not just for herself but on behalf of possible victims whose stories may never see the light of day, means that we have a moral obligation to not look away. As the society that made Combs the mogul that he is and enabled him to amass the resources that have now in effect formed a shield around him, it is our job to bear witness in this moment.Victims of abuse – especially of alleged abusers this powerful – rarely see full justice through the courts. Bill Cosby walks free today, Harvey Weinstein isgettinganother trial and Amber Heard continues to endure harassment from Depp fans while he gets towalkin Rihanna’s fashion show and book newprojects. And if Combs should somehow walk away from all this, then it’s crucial for us to listen to his accusers, for their testimonies to be on public record, and for him to no longer have access, at the very least, to the social and cultural capital that helped allow his alleged behaviour to thrive.Importantly, this moment also exposes the foundations of systematic abuse. This level of abuse requires a network of enablers, silent witnesses, wilful collaborators, paid professionals and disempowered victims in order to be possible. And as more details emerge in this trial, confronting these stories head on means confronting the culture that allowed for them to begin with.The game is rigged against women and always has been. We tell women to report crimes and then either don’t believe them, or say they were violent too when they do. And when they don’t report, we question why they stayed in a relationship and tell them that they wanted the abuse.It’s a shame that society is so bad at protecting women. But knowing what exactly abuse can look like – in all of its twisted, barbaric shapes – and being able to accurately name it is essential to our survival, and more important now than ever.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistIn the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

But she does have ‘impeccable Maha credentials’Fri 16 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 12.55 EDTShareThe US health secretary doesn’t think you should really listen to him when it comes to health issues. During an appearance before House and Senate committees this week,Robert F Kennedy Jr, famous for his unconventional views about medicine and his revelation that aparasite ate part of his brain, seemed to think it was strange that lawmakers were asking him about vaccines.“What I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant,”Kennedy saidwhen pressed on whether he would vaccinate his child for measles. “I don’t want to seem like I’m being evasive, but I don’t think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.” The US health secretary repeated his refrain about not wanting to give advice a number of other times.I, on the other hand, am desperate to dole out a bit of advice. Namely: it would probably be a good idea if a few people who actually knew what they were talking about were brought into the US government. I know, I know. Look at me being a crazy idealist! Still, at the very least, it might be wise to at least ensure that the people who are in charge of health issues know a thing or two about medicine.Why is Maga-land so obsessed with Kai Trump turning 18? Do you really need to ask? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreAlas, judging by some ofDonald Trump’s latest appointments, it would seem that I am asking far too much. See, for example,Dr Casey Means, who wasnominatedfor US surgeon general last week. Means has got “Dr” in front of her name, which sounds promising, but she’s more of an influencer than a practitioner. Though she trained as a surgeon at Stanford, she never completed her medical residency afterward. Why? She says it’s because she was disillusioned with traditional medicine, but a former colleague told theLos Angeles Timesthat it was due to anxiety. Means also doesn’t have an active medical license. In short: she wouldn’t be able to get a job as a doctor at your local hospital but she’s being considered for the role of “the nation’s doctor”. As for experience working in government? She doesn’t have any of that, either.What Means does have, Trump announced in a recent social media post, are “impeccable ‘MAHA’ credentials”. That’s the “Make America healthy again” movement: a movement that is preoccupied with some very valid issues (processed food, corruption in the health industry) but mired in conspiracist thinking. Means has been on TV a lot to talk about Maha obsessions such asremoving fluoride from drinking water. She also makes money from dietary supplements that she promotes on social media and has co-authored a book with her brotherthat claims“almost every chronic health symptom that Western medicine addresses is the result of our cells being beleaguered by how we’ve come to live”. Which, of course, isn’t completely false but has been accused of being overly simplistic. Means’s brother, by the way, is also a prominent adviser to Kennedy.Many prominent people in the Trump administration, meanwhile, seem to be WTF hires. They are there because they’re white, Trumpy and often in the family of someone influentialSo are all the Maha crowd rejoicing in the streets at the idea of Means becoming surgeon general? Not quite. Her nomination hasactually sparked Maha infighting. Some Maha voices think Means is not extreme enough, particularly when it comes to the Covid shot. These people seem to want a surgeon general who declares Covid was a hoax and bans vaccines altogether.The far-right conspiracy theoristLaura Loomer, meanwhile, who seems to have become one of Trump’s most influential albeit unofficial advisers, isn’t happy with Means because she thinks she’s unserious.Writing on Twitter/X, Loomer said Means “PRAYS TO INANIMATE OBJECTS, COMMUNICATES WITH SPIRIT MEDIUMS, USES SHROOMS AS ‘PLANT MEDICINE’ AND TALKS TO TREES! SHE ALSO DOESN’T EVEN HAVE AN ACTIVE MEDICAL LICENSE.”Loomer isn’t theonly one a little worriedabout Means’s enthusiasm for psychedelic drugs including magic mushrooms – which the prospective surgeon general once suggested in a newsletter helped her find a romantic partner. Psilocybin, a psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms, is currently listed as a schedule I drug, defined as a substance “with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse”.My rare disease was getting closer to a cure. RFK Jr could undermine that | Jameson RichRead moreMeans should probably be a little worried about what Loomer thinks, as Loomer may have played a part in ousting Trump’s original pick for the position. That wasJanette Nesheiwat, a former Fox News medical contributor and the sister-in-law ofMike Waltz, the former national security adviser. On X this month, Loomer called Nesheiwat “a pro-Covid vaccine nepo appointee” who “didn’t go to medical school in the US”. (Nesheiwat has said that she got a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, but it would seem that she actually earned her medical degree from a school in Sint Maarten.)Will Loomer topple Means before her confirmation (which hasn’t been scheduled yet) as well? I don’t know but I can tell you that if she does, it’s unlikely that her successor will be any more qualified. TheTrump administration, as we all know, has been waging war on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). If you’re a (non-Trump-loving) woman or a minority, it doesn’t seem to matter how many qualifications you have, you’re automatically considered a “DEI hire” and looked upon with suspicion. Many prominent people in the Trump administration, meanwhile, seem to be WTF hires. They are there because they’re white, Trumpy and often in the family of someone influential (or they have been on Fox News). Whether we get Means or not, you can be sure that whoever is confirmed as the nation’s top doctor will be completely unqualified to treat the US’s Trump-induced ailments.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionHealthDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrUS politicsUS healthcarecommentShareReuse this content"

There’s value in that, but it’s also holding back our politicsFri 16 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 11.32 EDTShareThe voter is never wrong. In this era of vox pops, phone-ins, focus groups and constant polls, this view of democracy is more prevalent than ever.Labourstrategists reverently refer to switchers from the Tories as “hero voters”, while Keir Starmer often says his government is “in the service of” the electorate. With British politics fragmenting, voters are now being wooed by five national parties – an unprecedented situation, made even more unpredictable by an electoral system designed for serious competition between just two. It would be only a slight exaggeration to say that we are all swing voters now.In some ways, this is a welcome and potentially exciting change. Since the late 1980s Westminster has mostly offered voters a limited menu – usually bland Labour centrism or ever staler Tory variations of Thatcherism – accompanied by patronising messages that no other recipes are practical. Yet now ministers, shadow ministers and MPs of all parties are hurriedly trying to come up with fresh or fresh-seeming dishes: rightwing populism, radical environmentalism, mild anti-capitalism mixed with social conservatism, and remedies of all sorts for the political and social indigestion caused by globalisation.The increased pace of British politics over the past decade, with extra general elections, parties frequently changing leaders and ideological directions, and sudden electoral surges and collapses, suggests that politicians have become more scared of voters – and that voters have become less deferential towards them. The long, sometimes too-forgiving relationships between voters and parties that existed for most of the 20th century, and the patience shown by many voters towards their Westminster tribe when it was in power, seem to be disappearing for good.But is this voter-dominated politics an entirely welcome development? Recent history suggests not. In terms of total votes, 21st-century Britain’s two biggest political mandates have been for leaving the European Union in 2016 and for keeping Boris Johnson as prime minister in 2019. Before then, in 2010 and more decisively in 2015, theConservativeswon successive general elections on a pro-austerity platform. Yet nowadays Brexit, the Johnson government and those Tory cuts to public services are widely considered disastrous, including by many who voted for them. In other words, millions of voters made poor choices, and we are all living with the consequences.It’s true that these voters were often misled – by David Cameron’s promise of “strong and stable government”, for instance, and the Leave campaign’spledgeof extra NHS spending. But to place all the blame for the rundown and acrimonious state of the country on politicians, as much of the public and the media habitually do, is a convenient way for many voters to avoid thinking about their own complicity in what’s gone wrong.One way to picture a healthier democracy is as a place where voters and politicians have frequent clashes but also a degree of mutual respect – and an awareness that they are co-creators of a political culture. It may be optimistic to expect grumpy old Britain to become such a country, not least because so much of our media has a vested interest in voters angrily believing that they are badly governed. For rightwing, anti-state editors in particular, a sour public mood produces better stories.While our political life is no longer boring and predictable – the next general election result feels harder to forecast than any since the febrile mid-1970s – it also seems increasingly dysfunctional. Voters constantly demand, and politicians constantly promise, different versions of “change”, from Johnson’s cartoonish British boosterism to Starmer’s earnest pledges of “national renewal”. These plans for reform tend to be flawed, partly because their production has been so rushed, and public support for them rapidly wanes.By quickly rejecting each plan, voters avoid having to commit to any particularformof change. Instead, they can express a general discontent, which may feel cathartic and produce great media content but leaves Britain’s deep problems, which would take any government years to solve, essentially unaddressed.Beneath the nonstop call for political change, moreover, is often a demand that change be minimised for voters themselves. Drasticallyreducing immigration,droppingdiversity targets and other socially conservative policies especially popular with supporters or potential supporters of Reform UK – the minority group around which our politics currently revolves – are essentially intended to slow down, halt or even reverse social trends that some Britons believe are too disruptive. Thus much of the feverish quality of British politics these days paradoxically comes from a desire for the country to stay the same. With his pints of bitter and old-fashioned country clothes, Nigel Farage always seeks to present his hard-right revolt as reassuringly retro.Populism, with all its talk of the people rising up against political elites, is well suited to periods when voters seem to have the upper hand over politicians. But that advantage over more top-down forms of politics can diminish once populistsjoin the ruling classes. The 10 councils and two mayoralties that Reform UKtook control ofat this month’s elections may prove very hard for an inexperienced party to run, amid hugely overstretched local government finances. Maintaining Reform’s role as a vehicle for some voters’ almost limitless hopes and desires may be even harder, once the party is bogged down in municipal cuts and compromises.The “Our contract with you”manifestoon Reform UK’s website could become just the latest plan for change from a political party to be watered down, frustrated and ultimately rejected by an impatient electorate. These days, Farage has a particularly self-satisfied and expectant air, as if he’s found a political magic formula; but plenty of other British party leaders over the past 15 years have believed that too.If and when the current era of voter dominance ends, perhaps with a government that combines great confidence with a big majority, we may look back on it nostalgically. Politicians easily become too sure of themselves and too distant from reality, and punishing them for those flaws is one of the main points of democracy. But voters can develop those flaws, too. Until more of us realise that, our fickle and unhappy politics will continue.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourConservativesReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

The implication is that I have known the Garden of Eden, even been granted a key, and responded by saying: “Actually, you know what? I’ll takeNorwichinstead.”Whether it better reflects contemptuous familiarity with the UK, or an idealised view of New Zealand, I’m not sure. But very few people seem to believe me that, in many meaningful ways, the quality of life is much better in Britain.So I was not surprised by the interestin a recent reportabout New Zealand “hollowing out”, with record numbers leaving through 2023 into 2024. Over the past two years, so many people have left the country – often for Australia, Canada or the UK – there are fears some small towns and rural communities will collapse.There’s a long tradition of Kiwis heading overseas. What makes this recent rise in departures different is the apparent sweep of it. It’s not just young people off on their “big OE” (overseas experience). It’s those who are further along in life who have come to believe the grass may be greener elsewhere.And it’s not just small towns that are failing to give them reasons to stay. Auckland – the largest, most “international” city, with a population of about 1.7 million people (of a total of 5.2 million) – has the most jobs and the highest salaries, but even one of those won’t necessarily give you a shot at property.As of this February, the average home in the city costs about NZ$1.25m – that’s roughly £555,000, about the sameas in Londondespite a significantly lower average wage. It’s a similar situation in New Zealand’s capital city, Wellington, andrecent public sector cutshaven’t helped the economic picture either.I felt the impact of this when I was back in Wellington this February, visiting friends and family. When I moved there aged 17 to study, it felt deserving of its reputation as the “artsy” city. Even allowing for a more world-weary view 15 years on, I was struck by how much was exactly the same as in my student days (down to cafe menu items, and the monthly Britpop club night), while the new additions were generic or without charm. It was like time had stood still.I don’t mean to be a seagull, flying in and dumping “all over everything” (to borrow a phrase from writer and fellow antipodean abroadSarah Wilson, inher recent reporton her trip back to Australia). There’s so much that’s special and unique about New Zealand, starting with the indigenous Māori culture and language – rightly and increasingly integrated in the national identity, despite attacks by the National-led government.There are advantages over Britain. The food and drink is actually flavoursome, while the typical approach to hospitality makes you feel the meaning of the word. Work is rarely expected to come before life, and the beaches and scenery really are as staggeringly beautiful as you’d imagine.Still, I’ve noticed the reported shift in Kiwis’ migratory patterns playing out in my network. For example, it used to be assumed you’d return home to start a family – but a striking number of friends have chosen to stay put in their overseas homes to have their first child, even at the cost of losing family support. Thepatchy public transport, even in cities, and car-centric culture have also been cited as barriers by people I’ve spoken to.Access to culture and entertainment is also limited. Aucklanderswere recently namedthe earliest diners in the world; I’ve heard of people being kicked out of restaurants at 9:30pm. “It’s kind of like, what are you meant to do after dark?” says my sister, who is now based in Amsterdam.View image in fullscreenPassengers wait to board a flight at Wellington airport.Photograph: Charlotte Graham-McLay/APAll this is compounded by the isolation, unimaginable for people in Europe. “I don’t think Brits understand what it is like to live at the bottom of the world,” a Kiwi friend who has lived in London for a couple years told me the other day. Equally, she pointed out, our ambivalence about returning reflects our privilege, of knowing we would be able to opt out of Britain should it start to feel too broken.Of course there’s no single best place in which to live, not least because “quality of life” is a personal – and variable – equation. I feel very lucky to call New Zealand one of my homes, and every time I visit, I wonder if this will be the trip that makes me want to move back. So far, however, after a decade away, I’m more struck by the drawbacks than its many delights. Brits may think the grass is greener in New Zealand, but it’s Kiwis who are making the move.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsNew ZealandOpinionNorwichAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

Since 2022, Russian war crimes have only deepened the chasm between them. Yet Donald Trump, who demanded this meeting, underlined that it was largely a charade when hetoldreporters: “Nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together.” It made plain that Russia felt no pressure to cooperate.While difficult negotiations often begin on easier terrain, the agreement of a mass prisoner swap looked like a discrete achievement. The real significance of the Istanbul talks lay less in their substance than the messages sent by their existence and attendance list.The hasty proposal for direct talks was Vladimir Putin’s escape route after European leadersdemanded Russiaagree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers. Ukraine and its backers said there should be no meetings without a ceasefire, but Kyiv was forced to concede when Mr Trumpinsistedit participate. Painful experience has taught it that it does not pay to defy the US president.Volodymyr Zelenskyy turned the Russian president’s proposal back on him bychallenging him to attend the talkspersonally, vowing to wait for him in Turkey. This was,said a Ukrainian official,“a theatre performance for just one audience member”, reinforcing the message that Mr Putin is the obstacle to peace.Mr Putin snubbed the meeting. Russia wasrepresented bythe nationalist ideologue Vladimir Medinsky and Alexander Vasilyevich Fomin, a veteran military officer and diplomat whoreportedly told Ukrainiansin the last talks that if they refused to capitulate, “We will keep killing and slaughtering you.” Moscow’s approachdid not appear much more diplomaticthis time: Ukraine said that Russia voiced “unacceptable” things.Mr Zelenskyy was deft in portraying the Russian leader’s non-attendance as “disrespect for Trump”. There is evidence of some frustration with Moscow in Washington. JD Vancesaid recently that it was “asking for too much”, and Mr Trump had previouslysuggestedhe was “very angry, pissed off” with Mr Putin. Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, says he has sufficient senatorial support to pass “devastating” new sanctions. But he described his bill as part of the president’s arsenal, and Mr Trump is unlikely to unleash it. That said, Mr Putin will need to ensure he does not overplay his hand, given Mr Trump’s unpredictability. And while Mr Putin may think spinning out the conflict is currently in Russia’s interests, the war is not cost‑free for his country.The recent dizzying narrative twists have revealed greater coordination and resolve on Europe’s part. (Germany this weekannouncedthat it would hit Mr Trump’s demand for defence spending to reach 5% of GDP by 2032, albeit by including related infrastructure.) But US arms will run out long before Europe is fully ready to step into the breach. The key question surely remains not whether the US president can be coaxed and flattered into being more helpful, but whether he can be dissuaded from becoming actively obstructive – cutting off intelligence or Starlink, or preventing Europe from buying arms for Ukraine. Put that way, Mr Trump’s observation that “nothing’s going to happen” until he meets Mr Putin sounds more chilling. Meanwhile, off the diplomatic stage, the Russian attacks continued on Friday: further evidence of the urgent need for a ceasefire.Explore more on these topicsRussiaOpinionEuropeUkraineVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The stove-shaped tower is a symbol of comfort and welcome throughout the nineMoomin novelsby the celebrated Nordic writer and artist Tove Jansson. Now the house is the inspiration for a series of art installations in UK cities, in collaboration withRefugee Week, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the creation of the Moomins.Taking the motto “The door is always open”, building will begin next week on a12ft blue houseoutside London’s Southbank Centre, just a stone’s throw from Westminster. All of the installations, by artists from countries including Afghanistan, Syria and Romania, deal with displacement: in Bradford, the Palestinian artist Basel Zaraa has created arefugee tentin which to imagine life after occupation and war; in Gateshead, natural materials are being foraged to buildTo Own Both Nothing and the Whole World(a quote from Jansson’s philosophical character Snufkin); and aMoomin raftwill launch from Gloucester Docks.Begun in the winter of 1939 and published in 1945, the first book,The Moomins and the Great Flood, was a “fairytale”, as Jansson called it, born out of the darkness of war. A mother and her son set off across an unfamiliar land – overcoming dangers, natural disasters and hostile creatures – in search of their missing family and a place to build a new home. It was the story of millions of refugees after the second world war, and an all-too familiar one across the world today.In their themes of loneliness, a search for identity and freedom, the Moomin books speak to anyone who feels that they don’t belong. In Finn Family Moomintroll, the inseparable Thingumy and Bob (reflectingthe nicknames of Jansson and her lover, the theatre director Vivica Bandler) arrive in Moominland speaking a strange language and carrying a suitcase containing a ruby, a metaphor for their secret love – homosexuality was illegal in Finland until 1971. Growing up on a housing estate outside Liverpool,Frank Cottrell-Boyce, the children’s laureate, was astounded that “a book written by a bohemian Finnish lesbian” seemed to be speaking directly to him.According to Philip Pullman, Jansson should have won the Nobel prize in literature.All the inhabitants of Moominvalley come in wildly different shapes and sizes. Tiny, furious Little My is adopted by the Moomin family because “no one else dared”. The Groke, a symbol of gloom who turns everything she touches into ice, is simply looking for warmth and is not to be feared. Unlike Paddington,that other postwar refugee, this is the newcomer narrative as acceptance rather than assimilation.Today, the Moomins have become abrand, valued more for being cute than kind. Jansson would doubtless be thrilled that her legacy is being used as part of Refugee Week to foster understanding rather than to flog pencil cases and oven mitts.Moominland is a fairytale, far from our 21st-century refugee crisis. But this magical world provides a quietly radical message of tolerance, inclusivity and hope. Moominvalley might be described as “an island of strangers”, to borrow the prime minister’s unfortunate phrase, and is all the better for it: it is a place where you don’t have to fit in to belong. As Jansson writes in the preface to The Moomins and the Great Flood: “Here was my very first happy ending!”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The teams of NHS-trained staff are equipped to provide school-wide and individual support for children with mild-to-moderate mental health issues such as social anxiety.Teachers regularly helping pupils in distress in attempt to fill NHS funding gapRead morePlace2Be, a charity specialising in mental health support for children, said it was seeing record numbers with highly complex needs requiring targeted interventions but who faced long wait times for treatment through the NHS’s child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs).A spokesperson for the charity said: “Many pupils in schools have needs going beyond the scope of ‘mild to moderate’. So it is vital that these young people, who are also struggling to access Camhs support, can access high-quality, targeted clinical support at their school, which Place2Be provides.“Rolling out MHSTs to every school is really only one part of the solution, and alone, won’t be enough to truly meet the government’s manifesto commitment of access to specialist support in every school, nor effectively tackle the mental health difficulties facing young people today.”Labour’s2024 election manifestopledged that all young people ​​would have access to mental health professionals in schools, which the government says it will meet by the end of the current parliament in 2029-30.Asked what she meant by “grit” on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Phillipson said young people faced multiple challenges “thrown” at them that could be eased by MHSTs operating in schools.“That’s about getting in there early when young people are struggling, making sure they’ve got access to trained, qualified professionals who can help them manage,” Phillipson said.The expansion of MHSTs was welcomed by the teaching unions, including the National Association of Head Teachers and the National Education Union (NEU), although many teachers were sceptical how grit could be developed givenefforts by previous governmentsand conflicting research into its value and whether it could be taught.A review of research conducted for the Education Endowment Fund concluded: “Some non-cognitive skills including ‘grit’ and self-control correlate strongly with outcomes but appear to be more akin to stable personality traits rather than to malleable skills.”Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the NEU, said teachers’ top concerns were for reduced waiting times for children to access specialists such as speech and language therapists. “School staff are also desperate to see government tackle the social issues such as poverty and disadvantage that make life chances so unequal,” Kebede said.Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, will shortly publish her annual report on the state of children’s mental health services. Herprevious reportfound that MHSTs dealt with 38,000 cases in 2022-23, with an average wait of 30 days, out of 678,000 children and young people seen by mental health services.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsMental healthChildrenBridget PhillipsonHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The tentative deal was first reported by Reuters.In October 2018, 189 people were killed whenLion Air flight 610 fellinto the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019,Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashedshortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa airport, claiming 157 lives.The second crash prompted the worldwide grounding of the 737 Max for almost two years, and left Boeing scrambling to repair its reputation.While Boeing initially resolved a criminal investigation in January 2021, prosecutors accused it of breaching the settlement in 2024. This led the justice department tooffer the firm a controversial plea deallast summer.In December, however, US district Judge Reed O’Connor in Texas rejected the agreement. He cited a diversity and inclusion provision related to the selection of an independent monitor.While Boeing had agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of up to $487.2m during the final months of the Biden administration, O’Connor’s decision meant the Trump administration inherited the case.Under Donald Trump, the justice department has been overhauled, and his administration has faced questions around how aggressively it intends to pursue big companies that break the law.Sanjiv Singh, counsel for 16 families of crash victims, said: “We are appalled by this sudden possible retreat from criminal prosecution of Boeing. A non-prosecution agreement is morally repugnant and lacks the teeth and bite to cause fundamental change in Boeings safety practices.”Shares in Boeing slipped 0.5% in New York.Explore more on these topicsBoeingLion Air crashEthiopian Airlines crashnewsShareReuse this content"

The author was severely wounded and lost the use of his right eye.In a statement delivered to court before his sentencing, Matar said: “Salman Rushdie wants to disrespect other people … He wants to be a bully, he wants to bully other people. I don’t agree with that.”Matar was also sentenced to seven years for wounding Ralph Henry Reese, a moderator at Rushdie’s lecture who was on stage with him. According to the Chautauqua county district attorney, Jason Schmidt, Matar’s two sentences will run concurrently as both victims were injured at the same event.“He designed this attack so that he could inflict the most amount of damage, not just upon Mr Rushdie, but upon this community, upon the 1,400 people who were there to watch it,” Schmidt said, adding that Matar in effect “chose this” maximum sentencing.Meanwhile, the public defender Nathaniel Barone said Matar had an otherwise clean criminal record and disputed the prosecutors’ argument that the audience at the event should also be considered victims.“Every day since then, for the last couple of years, this case has been an international publicity sponge,” Barone said, adding: “There was no presumption, ever, of innocence for Mr Matar from the very beginning.”Matar’s sentencing on Friday follows an intense trial during which Rushdie was the key witness.Speakingfrom the stand in February, Rushdie said: “I became aware of a great quantity of blood I was lying in. My sense of time was quite cloudy, I was in pain from my eye and hand, and it occurred to me quite clearly I was dying.” In total, Matar had stabbed Rushdie 15 times – in the head, neck, torso and left hand, resulting in severe injuries to his right eye, liver and intestines.Following the attack, Rushdie was left permanently damaged in his right eye..View image in fullscreenHadi Matar at court on his second day of his trial on 11 February 2025, in Mayville, New York.Photograph: Gene J Puskar/APMatar’s motivation for trying to kill Rushdie stemmed from a 2006 speech delivered by Hezbollah’s chief at the time, Hassan Nasrallah,according toa federal indictment. In his speech, Nasrallah endorsed a decades-old fatwa, or death warrant, placed on Rushdie by Iranian religious leaders more than 35 years ago as a result of his novel,The Satanic Verses.Following Rushdie’s stabbing, Mataradmittedin 2022 to having read only “a couple pages” of the book which Iranian religious leaders denounced as blasphemous.The Indian-born British-American novelist later detailed his experience and long road to recovery in amemoircalled Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsSalman RushdieNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

I’m somebody’s child.”During some parts of cross-examination on Thursday , Combs’s lawyers seemed to be trying to establish that around the time of the 2016 assault in the hotel, Combs had been experiencing withdrawals from opiates, which influenced his behavior, and that his violence was connected to his drug use.Ventura, who is eight and a half months pregnant, continued her testimony on Friday and said that she attended a 45-day in-patient treatment center in 2023 at the Willow House, an Arizona-based rehab program for women that “focuses on healing from intimacy and relationship issues, love and sex addiction, emotional trauma, and dual diagnosis”.She said she took part in “neurofeedback” once a week while she was there to “help me with my trauma”.“They hook your brain up to a machine and you watch something and it just kind of regulates your brain waves,” Ventura said, adding that she also did something called EMDR which “helps you recount memories”.The defense also appeared to question Ventura’s account of her alleged 2018 rape by Combs,which she testified about earlier this week. They also suggested that Ventura revised the date of the incident from September 2018 to August 2018 in her statements over the years.Ventura said she had consensual sex with Combs once more after the alleged rape, while she was dating her now husband, Alex Fine.In previous testimony, she explained: “We’d been together 10 years; you just don’t turn feelings off that way.”Combs’s lawyer asked on Friday: “Your now husband didn’t know that you were with Mr Combs at the time, correct?”Ventura told the court that Fine later learned about both her having consensual sex with Combs one time as well as the alleged rape.The defense also questioned Ventura on her current feelings towards Combs.When asked if she hated the music mogul, Ventura replied: “I don’t hate him.”“Do you still have love for him?” Combs’s attorney followed up.“I have love for the past and what it was,” Ventura replied.Before the lunch recess, Ventura testified that the last time she saw Combs was at the November 2018 memorial service for Kim Porter, the mother of three of Sean Combs’s children.In the afternoon, Ventura denied a defense suggestion that she had been experiencing financial hardship before filing her civil lawsuit against Combs in November 2023, which resulted a $20m settlement just 24 hours after it was filed.Combs’s attorney pointed out that Ventura, her husband and children moved in with her parents in Connecticut before she filed the lawsuit, and suggested that the relocation had been due to “financial issues”.Ventura refuted that assertion, stating that the move had been part of a broader plan to move to the east coast and had nothing to do with money.The defense also questioned Ventura about her decision to cancel a planned music tour after the lawsuit between her and Combs was settled.“As soon as you saw that you were going to get the $20m, you canceled the tour because you didn’t need it any more, right?” Combs’s attorney asked.“That wasn’t the reason why,” Ventura responded.The defense then presented a 2012 text message exchange between Ventura and Combs, in which Combs asked whether she wanted to have a “freak-off” … “one last time tonight”.Ventura replied no, adding that she wanted to have a freak-off for the “first time for the rest of our lives”.The defense then abruptly concluded its cross-examination. The prosecution immediately began redirect and asked Ventura to read additional messages from that conversation to provide context.“I want to see you, but I’m emotional right now,” Ventura wrote to Combs. “I don’t want to do one last time. I’d rather not do it at all.”The prosecution also attempted to address the defense’s suggestion of a link between Combs’s drug use and his violence, asking Ventura whether doing drugs ever made her violent.“I feel like drinking more so than drugs,” Ventura replied.At one point on Friday afternoon, Ventura broke down in tears as a prosecutor questioned her about Combs beating her during the freak-offs.She was then asked whether she would return the money from her settlement if it meant she never had to experience freak-offs.“I’d give that money back if I never had to have freak offs,” Ventura testified. “If I never had to have freak offs, I would have had agency and autonomy … I wouldn’t have had to work so hard to get it back.”After Ventura’s testimony concluded on Friday afternoon, her lawyer, Douglas Wigdor,issued a statementon how the week had been “extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing” for Ventura.“I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear. For me, the more I heal, the more I can remember. And the more I can remember, the more I will never forget,” Wigdor said on behalf of Ventura.Fine, Ventura’s husband, alsoreleased a statement, saying: “Over the past five days, the world has gotten to witness the strength and bravery of my wife, freeing herself of her past. There has been speculation online surrounding how it must feel for me to sit there and listen to my wife’s testimony.”He said he felt “pride” and “overwhelming love” during her testimony as well as “profound anger that she has been subjected to sitting in front of a person who tried to break her”.“To him and all of those who helped him along the way, please know this: You did not. You did not break her spirit nor her smile that lights up every room. You did not break the souls of a mother who gives the best hugs and plays the silliest games with our little girls. You did not break the woman who has made me a better man,” he said.He also noted that he did “not save Cassie”, but that “Cassie saved Cassie” and she “alone broke free from abuse, coercion, violence and threats”.Ventura testified this week over the course of four days,detailing years ofphysical abuseshe endured during her decade-long relationship with Combs.After Ventura finished her testimony, the prosecution called Yasin Binda, a special agent with the homeland security department, to the stand.Binda participated in searches related to the Combs investigation and was involved in Combs’s arrest last September at a Manhattan hotel.Binda testified that authorities seized lubricants, pills, drugs, $9,000 in cash, and “mood lighting” from Combs’s hotel room the day of the arrest. The jury were shown images from the search, including some of bags filled with baby oil and lubricant.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead moreCombs is facing charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denies all allegations.If convicted, Combs, who has been held in jail since his arrest last year, could spend the rest of his life in prison.In the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

But I am coming from hell. I have been living in a war zone in Kingston and I’ve had some very tough days.”He is likely to be back in the UK in the coming weeks, possibly beforeWindrush Dayon 22 June, which celebrates the contribution Caribbean migrants and their families have made to the UK. It marks the date in 1948 that HMT Empire Windrush docked in Tilbury, Essex, bringing hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean to the UK.Knight was deported from the UK in 2013 after he was convicted of stealing a piece of jewellery during the 2011 riots, in what his lawyers described as an “opportunistic mistake”.He arrived in 1966 aged six, brought to the UK by people unrelated to him. He experienced a difficult childhood in south London, was not allowed to attend school and later worked on construction sites. The lack of school and employment records made it difficult for him to prove he had been “ordinarily resident” in the UK in 1973.Like all Citizens of the UK and Colonies – a status granted before 1983 – he was granted indefinite leave to remain. But his lawyers had to carry out painstaking work to track down witnesses who remembered him from his childhood and could corroborate his account of the time he arrived in the UK.When he was unlawfully deported in 2013, theWindrush scandalrevealed by the Guardian had not yet emerged. Knight said that he was so desperate when he was detained in Harmondsworth immigration removal centre, near Heathrow, about the prospect of being forcibly returned to a country he knew little of, that he repeatedly attempted suicide there.But his deportation went ahead despite his fragile mental state and he found himself homeless on the streets of Kingston where he has been caught in the crossfire of gang warfare. The violence he witnessed has left him deeply traumatised, he said.The Guardianreported on his case in 2018and interviewed him in Kingston. At that time he asked for his real name not to be used and to instead be referred to as David Jameson.He brought a judicial review arguing that he was exempt from deportation, and just hours before the final hearing on 15 May the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, conceded that Knight was a member of the Windrush generation.Nina Kamp, a consultant solicitor at Duncan Lewis Solicitors who represents Knight, said: “Mr Knight has suffered unimaginable harm being homeless in an extremely volatile environment for over a decade with no support. The physical and psychological toll is profound and will take years to repair. Astonishingly, the home secretary has still offered him no apology for the historic wrong her department inflicted.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I survived by eating vegetables from the market, bread and bananas. I’ve received a lot of abuse in Jamaica being called ‘English’ and ‘deportee’.”He said that among the things he really missed about England were his days playing football in a Sunday league with friends in New Cross Gate, south London. “I would love to do that again and get back to work doing painting and decorating,” he said. “I’m a working kind of guy.“I have had a lot of ups and downs here, mostly downs, but now I’m coming back to England I feel great. Thank God I survived. I was calling out for years but nobody listened to me.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Following the settlement of legal proceedings, an application to the Windrush scheme is now under consideration.”In the UK,Samaritanscan be contacted on 116 123 and thedomestic abuse helplineis 0808 2000 247.

This means that societies generate more waste than recycling systems can handle.Even if all recyclable goods were recycled, which is unlikely as many goods are simply too difficult or costly to recycle, global recycling rates would only reach 25%, meaning that consumption must be slashed in order to tackle a growing global waste crisis.‘People feel a sense of ownership’: the growth of community compostingRead moreIvonne Bojoh, chief executive of Circle Economy, said: ‘‘Our analysis is clear: even in the ideal world, we cannot solve the triple planetary crisis by mere recycling. The much-needed systemic change requires fundamental change.“This means unlocking circular potential in stocks like buildings and infrastructure, managing biomass sustainably and stopping sending perfectly renewable materials to landfills.“This change doesn’t happen outside ourselves. We all need to make different choices, be bold, and invest to implement circular solutions across value chains.”As many consumers can attest, recycling levels have been increasing in recent years. From 2018 to 2021, the use of recycled materials used in manufacturing has also increased by 200m tonnes, thanks to increasing awareness. But this increase has been outpaced by the growth in use of virgin materials, the researchers found.They cited figures showing that global extraction of raw materials has more than tripled in the past half century, recently reaching 100bn tonnes a year – a figure expected to rise by a further 60% by 2060, unless action is taken.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It calls for the introduction of an “International Materials Agency”, along the lines of the International Energy Agency, to guide governments in measuring and monitoring sustainable resource use and circular economy progress.“The shift to a circular economy cannot happen without the right policy environment and government action that phases out wasteful practices and promotes and supports smarter ways of meeting people’s needs,” the report says.Explore more on these topicsRecyclingEthical and green livingWasteLandfillnewsShareReuse this content"

Air pollution contributes to this increase. It has an important impact on public health, but also on health costs.”Focusing on the air pollution exposure of 420,000 of Mutualités Libres’s members, Horemans’s team evaluated the effects of low emission zones in Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent and found that the zones worked.Air pollutiondecreased faster inside the zones compared with other cities in Belgium. This included particle pollution and nitrogen dioxide. Furthermore, they found that air pollution gains were not just confined to the zones, they also spilled out for at least 3 miles (5km).Early air pollution exposure affects health in adolescence, study findsRead moreIn addition to the air pollution gains, the use of antidiabetic drugs increased at a slower rate in the Brussels zone, compared with other cities. These drugs are used to help lower blood glucose to a healthy range.Horemans said: “The European Environment Agencyestimatesthat the greatest health impact from nitrogen dioxide comes from increases in diabetes mellitus. Further research may confirm whether the effects we observe here for diabetes are a precursor to possible expected effects on other disease conditions.”“It is important that the public looks at the benefits of low emission zones in the long run. The benefits of these zones far outweigh the inconveniences of their implementation, especially if it leads to clean air for your children and grandchildren.”In the UK, economic researchers from the University of Bathhave been lookingat the introduction of London’s low and ultra-low emission zones. Like the Belgian study, the UK researchers compared air pollution in London to other large UK conurbations. They found greater improvements in London’s air pollution after the zones were implemented, including large reductions in nitrogen dioxide in central London from the ultra-low emission zone.The researchers then looked at data fromQuarterly Labour ForceandAnnual Population Surveyswhich are carried out by the Office for National Statistics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is higher than the 5%-10% ceiling envisaged by the previous Conservative government.It has now emerged that a few weeks earlier in March, a senior Emirati delegation held a meeting in No 10 with officials including Varun Chandra, the business adviser to Keir Starmer. While details of the meeting are unknown, it is understood the delegation sought clarity on the state ownership law.The move in effect paves the way for the UAE to take a 15% stake in the Telegraph, most likely through the IMI investment vehicle backed by Abu Dhabi. Downing Street and IMI declined to comment. The Abu Dhabi government has been approached for comment.The law change ends a lengthy consultation involving intensive lobbying by newspaper owners. It is also a sign of Downing Street’s desperate search for economic growth and determination to make the UK an attractive place for overseas investment. However, the decision has been criticised by MPs and industry figures for opening up the British media to more state ownership.Foreign states should not be co-owners of UK newspapers | Nils PratleyRead moreFraser Nelson, a former editor of the Spectator and current Times columnist, described the decision as an “indefensible sellout, in defiance of parliament’s vote to protect press freedom”. Andrew Neil, a former Sunday Times editor, said Lisa Nandy should lose her job as the culture, media and sport secretary over the decision.The Liberal Democrats also oppose the new law and will launch an attempt to block it in the House of Lords with a “fatal motion”. The tactic is likely to split the Conservative party. Max Wilkinson, the Lib Dem culture spokesperson, said the proposed law put editorial independence “at risk”.“It’s a plan we wholeheartedly reject,” he said. “No 10 must come clean on their meeting with UAE delegates, and clarify whether they were lobbied to roll back on what parliament agreed last year.”Should the law change go through as expected, it marks the beginning of the end for the Telegraph’s ownership saga, which has rumbled on for two years. The Telegraph titles were originally bought by RedBird IMI, a UAE-backed venture that was blocked from taking control by the last government.Under the new law, RedBird Capital, a US private equity firm, is expected to buy the Telegraph, with 15% of the money coming from IMI, which is linked to Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Emirati royal.RedBird is also said to be talking to other possible British investors in the deal. A mooted attempt to buy the Telegraph by the Chelsea FC owner and chair, Todd Boehly, and the Fleet Street veteranDavid Montgomeryhas not materialised.While there has been significant interest in the Telegraph from other groups, the asking price of £500m has proved too high for most. In 2023, Lord Rothermere’s Daily Mail and General Trust had been involved in talks with Qatari investors over a potential bid, but subsequently pulled out. However, the peer still has contacts in the region.This week, Rothermere was among the high-profile media figures spotted in Doha meeting the US president, Donald Trump, and the Qatari emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. His group’s events business is understood to be prominent in the region. Others in the party included Piers Morgan, who owns and runs his own YouTube channel, and Patrick Soon-Shiong, the medical investor and Los Angeles Times owner.Industry sources said the UAE delegation was not the only group to have been seeking clarity on the laws around media ownership by foreign states. Other media groups were said to have concerns over a ban on state ownership, or a very low ceiling on such ownership.It is a sign of the financial strains in the media industry, as print sales decline and the digital revolution has brought huge change, with previously different kinds of media groups now competing with each other online. The development of AI is also seen as an opportunity as well as a threat by media executives, and the Gulf states have significant money to invest.Explore more on these topicsTelegraph Media GroupUnited Arab EmiratesNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Schools and businesses temporarily closed, and some households had to boil their tap water for a month to remove the contaminant.Marcus Rink, the chief inspector of the DWI, said: “We’ve taken firm action in the public interest to ensure the company has removed all non-compliant material so that customers can remain confident in their water supplies.”The environment secretary, Steve Reed, said: “Contamination of drinking water on any scale is scandalous and a complete disgrace.“The record £1.4m fine handed down sends a clear signal that this criminal behaviour is unacceptable.”All of the problems noticed across Anglian’s network have now been rectified. The investigation highlighted further issues with the company’s management, including a lack of staff training, poor oversight of the supply chain, and in some cases, water tanks that continued to be used even after the firm knew they contained unapproved products.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under permitted development rules, a temporary change of use is allowed for a total of 28 days each calendar year, but the Brockwell Park festivals run over 37 days and were due to begin on 23 May.The high court judge Mr Justice Mould ruled in Shaman’s favour, saying the council’s decision to grant the certificate to the festival organisers was “irrational”.Rylance said the victory was “wonderful news”.In a statement issued by PBP, he said: “Wonderful news. Brockwell Park will be open to all for free again this summer. No walls. No trucks.“The grass, and trees and plants will have a chance to recover from the years of abuse.“Now let’s help revive the beloved Lambeth country fair as it used to be, open to all. Congratulations to all who worked so devotedly to achieve this decision.“Every small victory for nature makes a difference.”Before the hearing, PBP said in a statement: “These large-scale, high-impact commercial festivals are damaging Brockwell Park’s ecology, heritage and community value. The park is being overused and under-protected.”The group also led protests in the park.In written submissions, Shaman’s barrister, Richard Harwood KC, said that in the past few years the park had “increasingly” been used for large commercial events, with “substantial” parts being fenced off and damage being caused to the ground.“Due to inclement weather over the weekend of one of the commercial events, the park effectively became a mud bath,” Harwood added, referencing an event in 2024.Billed as theBattle for Brockwell Park, the ruling highlighted tensions between residents who support and oppose the events, which bring hundreds of thousands of people to the south London park in the summer months.“I await the arrival of the park’s music festival season with dread,” wrote the author Rebecca Tamáslast year.Another group called SayYesLambeth argued that the events were a key part of south London’s cultural offering. The group’s tagline was: “Fighting for culture, joy and community in Lambeth.”In the lead-up to the case, a member of SayYesLambethtold Londoncentric: “Our whole scene and culture is about to be deleted because of people who complain about noise when they live in central London.”The group described the case as a battle between “a small but powerful group” and “the young people, the renters, the workers, the small businesses [and] the creatives”.Earlier in the hearing, Mould said: “It is for the planning authority to decide, pending the outcome of this challenge, what decision it should or should not take.”Mould refused initial applications for permission to appeal from Lambeth council and Summer Events Limited, although they can ask the court of appeal for permission to challenge the decision directly.A Lambeth council spokesperson said on Friday: “We are currently assessing the impact of this judgment and determining next steps.”Explore more on these topicsLondonAccess to green spaceFestivalsCommunitiesMusic festivalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

While Khan is on leave, the court’s deputy prosecutors will be in charge of managing the prosecutor’s office, the statement said.Khan, a British lawyer, has faced a backlash from many of his staff in recent months over his decision to resist calls from some of his most senior staff to take a leave of absence until the investigation is resolved.In an email to staff seen by the Guardian, Khan said: “In light of escalating media reports, I have made the considered decision to take leave until the completion of the investigation.” He said his two deputy prosecutors would take over his responsibilities.ICC sources said Khan’s decision followed renewed pressure earlier this week from senior court officials who urged him to step aside after new details of the allegations were published in the media over the weekend.Investigators from the UN watchdog conducting the investigation are understood to have met Khan for the first time last week, interviewing him over two days.The inquiry was announced in November after allegations emerged about his treatment of a woman who worked for him.The Guardian reportedthat the allegations include unwanted sexual touching and “abuse” over an extended period, as well as coercive behaviour and abuse of authority.Lawyers for Khan, 55, have previously said that he “denies the whole of the allegations” and said he would cooperate with the inquiry.The investigation, which is being conducted by the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), will send its report to the president of the court’s governing body to review its conclusions.According to sources familiar with the inquiry’s terms of reference, it is also examining claims that Khan engaged in witness intimidation and retaliation against members of his staff.Khan was elected in 2021 to serve a nine-year term as chief prosecutor of the permanent court of last resort, which investigates and prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.In a statement, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) said it welcomed Khan’s decision, describing it as “essential to protect the integrity of the court, ensure investigations continue without interference, and begin to rebuild the trust of victims, staff and the public”.“This was the only responsible decision.

Last month,the Guardian reportedthat Khan was preparing new applications for Israeli suspects in connection to alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.It is not clear how long Khan will be absent from the court. The OIOS investigation, now in its sixth month, has interviewed several court staff in addition to Khan and the alleged victim.If Khan is found to have committed “serious misconduct” or a serious breach of his duties, he will face a secret ballot in which the ICC’s 125 member states will vote on whether to remove him from office.Do you have information about this story?

As he releases soul-baring film Hurry Up Tomorrow, he charts his path through drugs, heartbreak and abandonmentFri 16 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 11.32 EDTShareWalking out to perform in front of 80,000 people and finding that your voice has gone: it’s the type of stress dream you have the night before a big work presentation. But for Abel Tesfaye, AKA the Weeknd, it happened for real at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium in 2022. “I ran backstage to find my vocal coach: I can’t sing, it’s not coming out,” he says. “And what I found out later on is that I was having a panic attack. It wasn’t a physical injury. It was more up here” – he gestures to his head – “than it was here” – his throat.The concert, which had to be called off and rescheduled, was the final night of a US stadium tour happening while Tesfaye was also wrapping up his painfully gestated – and eventually widely lampooned –TV series The Idol, which he starred in, co-wrote and co-produced. As production overran, he fitted in shoots around his tour; his own home was the main filming location. He began experiencing sleep paralysis.The Idol’s closing scenes were shot at SoFi Stadium the night before Tesfaye lost his voice, with him in character as manipulative mogul Tedros. He then did an entire Weeknd concert, then went back to being Tedros for four more hours of filming on the same night. The overwork finally caught up with him. “Any time something happened in my life, I could always rely on going on stage and escaping whatever’s going on,” he says. “This was the first time I couldn’t just escape. My body was like: you can’t sing it away. You have to figure it out.”View image in fullscreenEgo v unconscious … Barry Keoghan (left) and Tesfaye in Hurry Up Tomorrow.Photograph: Andrew Cooper/Lionsgate/APThe loss of his voice and the aftermath inspired him to co-write a psychological thriller out this week, Hurry Up Tomorrow, directed by Trey Edward Shults (a darling of the trendy A24 production stable). Heartbroken after a breakup that seems to be his fault, and pressured into performing by his manager (Barry Keoghan), Tesfaye, playing himself, goes off the rails and his voice burns out. He then meets a troubled fan, Anima, played by Jenna Ortega. Soon we’re witnessing a Carl Jung-inspired battle between Tesfaye’s ego and his unconscious, full of jump scares and petrol-doused fires. Like most films about musicians, it will appeal primarily to fans – but there are some startling images, and while Tesfaye’s acting has a couple of soap-y moments, he is generally very good as he thrashes through his neuroses.After a 15-year career that has made him one of the world’s biggest pop stars, with the most-streamed song of all time in Blinding Lights, the film could be the end of the entire Weeknd project. “I feel grateful that I get to film my persona on 35mm, and light it on fire,” he says, sitting in a suite at the Four Seasons in New York. “I’m sure every artist would love to do that. Because it gets to a point where you don’t want to be identified for something you started at 19 years old – and then the music industry capitalises off it, off misery or whatever.The Weekndfelt like a 15-year film.” And with Hurry Up Tomorrow, “I got to say: cut! And that’s a wrap.”View image in fullscreen‘This isn’t greatness’ … Tesfaye at Coachella in 2012.Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images/CoachellaNow 35, Tesfaye was born to Ethiopian parents in Toronto and raised by his single mother and grandmother. He dropped out of high school and focused on making music. At his first gigs in the early 2010s, he says he was protected from exposure by it being “the early internet age”, with fans “filming on old BlackBerry cameras”. But then he saw high-definition footage of his 2012 set at Coachella, his first visit to the US. “I said: this isn’t greatness. This is something I’ve failed at. I told my agent to book me 100 shows that year, so I can work that muscle.”Over downbeat R&B production, an initial trilogy of mixtapes set out the lyrical themes that would come to dominate the Weeknd project: narcotics, trauma and sex, much of the latter fraught with infidelity and control issues. If you only listened to those early songs – and a fair number of his later ones too – you might think Tesfaye was rather like The Idol’s Tedros, a sex-obsessed hedonist drawn to ethically dubious BDSM dynamics and mountains of cocaine. But Tesfaye is a warm host in a chic black tracksuit, who invites me up to his suite rather than our meeting room. His conversation style is gentle, peppered with charming bursts of sudden amusement. He has donated millions of dollars through his philanthropic foundation to causes in Palestine, Ethiopia and more. It’s Mother’s Day in the US, and you can well imagine someone has received a large bouquet that morning: “My mother is so pure, and everything good from me comes from her,” he says. “She’s light, just light.”There is a little chill, though, when I suggest that sex and relationships were presented as quite negative and transactional in that early songwriting. Tesfaye frowns; evidently he won’t go down this avenue. But he allows the warm glow to return, and concedes that at the time, “the point was to provoke in any way. To break through and provoke emotion, extreme has always been the way to go. To me it was more like being punk; at that time, it was me, it was Tyler [the Creator], it was rock’n’roll.”View image in fullscreenBack at Coachella in 2023.Photograph: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/ CoachellaThe size of the gap between the soulful Tesfaye and the nihilistic Weeknd is a compelling part of the project, but Tesfaye doesn’t want to analyse this either, saying it’s the same “for every artist, not just me”. The drugs and drink in the songs were real, though. “Drugs were really good at heightening how good a song sounds when you’re making it. And then you hear it the next morning and it’s like …” He makes an awkward-realisation face. “You’ve got to be high to experience this!” For a time, he relied on alcohol to perform, “to fight nerves, to get on that stage. I never had singing lessons, never had a mentor. There was no way I was going to be great without practice. You’ve got to just go out there and fail, and failing isn’t fun. The drinking helped me deal with the oncoming failure.”The mixtapes thrilled the underground but his ambition pushed him into the mainstream in 2015 with second albumBeauty Behind the Madness– its disco-funk and power ballads would have rivalled Get Lucky and Uptown Funk in thefamily-friendly stakes were it not for all the cocaine references. Can’t Feel My Face and The Hills both went to No 1 in the US, and Earned It, from Fifty Shades of Grey, got an Oscar nomination. “I was like: it doesn’t get bigger than this,” he says. “And naturally, then I’m like: I’ve got to beat this. You don’t want to beknownfor a song. That’s the advice I give any young artist: if you get a big song, figure out what the next move is, because you don’t want that song to identify who you are.” He cancelled a tour and went straight into making his next album, Starboy; featuring rare Daft Punk guest spots, it was even more successful. “Starboy, there was no real story. It was just: how do I get bigger than I did last year?”The subsequent EP, My Dear Melancholy, “felt more personal again. I could focus on the heartbreak side, the vulnerable side.” He’d had two relationships with A-list women by this point, namely Bella Hadid and Selena Gomez, and I ask if there was a particular heartbreak that precipitated it. “No.” He laughs at his total stonewalling. “I’m not getting into that! But Call Out My Name became one of the biggest songs I’d ever done – I was so thankful to do stuff that’s personal and still succeeding. And then when I did After Hours” – his most successful album – “I was able to take everything I’d learned and make my magnum opus. The hit qualities of my music, the vulnerable qualities, the storytelling qualities.”This is rather grandly expressed, but it’s justified. Released in March 2020 just as the Covid pandemic became a global crisis, After Hours’ blockbuster 80s-influenced pop, and Tesfaye’s doomed-romance storytelling, made it a perfect escapist pleasure and it went multi-platinum worldwide. He headlined the 2021 Super Bowl; lead single Blinding Lights is close to becoming the first song to be streamed 5bn times on Spotify. A blackly comic scene in Hurry Up Tomorrow features Ortega’s character, Anima, strapping Tesfaye to a bed and taunting him as the song plays on hotel room speakers. “I’m going to die listening to this fucking song that I couldn’t escape,” he explains to me. “It’s almost like: this is my punishment.” Here was the potentially career-defining hit he’d always tried to run from – did it feel like a millstone round his neck? “At one point. I love it now, but at one point I was like: holy shit, this thing got bigger than anything.”Later in the same scene, Anima plays Gasoline, a song from After Hours’ follow-upDawn FM– in my opinion, Tesfaye’s masterpiece, but nothing like as commercially successful. Anima taunts Tesfaye again, saying: “Don’t want to call it a failure, but what happened?”When I mention this, Tesfaye lets out a breezily resigned “ehhh” noise. “If anything isn’t bigger than the last thing you’ve done, it’s always going to be a failure to the masses,” he says. At that point, in 2022, his feeling was: “I’m going on a stadium tour, I don’t need to prove that I can do anything again.”View image in fullscreenCritically panned … The Idol, which starred Lily-Rose Depp and Tesfaye.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyThat was, until film-making came along. After a cameo in indie psychodramaUncut Gems, Tesfaye took a big step up in HBO series The Idol as the lead opposite Lily-Rose Depp’s pop star character Jocelyn. Tesfaye’s Tedros is a nightclub owner who has oppressively nurtured a cult of wannabe singers, and he targets Jocelyn as the ultimate prize. The result is a well-acted, amusing and unconvincingly plotted blend of music industry satire and erotic thriller.The Idol was plagued by a massive switch in creative direction, with co-writer Sam Levinson (of Euphoria fame) taking over directing after the series was nearly wrapped, resulting in reshoots. A Rolling Stone exposé of what one source called a “shitshow” turned the buzz toxic. Critics ripped it apart, which, Tesfaye says, “makes a lot of sense”.The issues started long before that director switch, with the original intention being for a film: “Pandemic happened, theatres are not a thing any more at the time, television is the new god.” Then it was meant to be a short miniseries, but it ballooned to a five-parter. “It could have been great if it had a beginning, middle and end. It just ended on middle.” He laughs.“The best films have as much of a singular voice as possible, and everybody working on it cares about it just as much as the director and the actors.” And it didn’t feel that way on The Idol? “No. People cared about it, for sure. But I think it got to a point where everyone was trying to get to the finish line. You can’t force something, you’ve just got to let it be whatever it is, even if it’s half-baked.” Though he was in the writers’ room and producing, he says he didn’t want to exert too much influence, because “then I become ‘difficult’, and the worst thing you can be called in Hollywood is difficult. ‘Difficult’ spreads!” Especially when you’re starting out as an actor. “Exactly. You’ve got to pay your dues. But boy, did I pay my dues.”With The Idol, our instincts were, “this isn’t right” – but we wanted it to workHe suddenly asks me if I’m spiritual. I say I think the world is too mysterious to say anything definitive, but it feels like there’s something there. “I think our instincts are that – it’s God speaking to us: ‘This isn’t right.’ When you go against your instincts, it can be blasphemous. Seriously! And you pay for it. With Idol, our instincts were ‘This isn’t right,’ but wewantedit to work.” It felt off all the way through making it? “Yeah. Too many cooks in the kitchen.” He’s still proud of “the leap of faith, and of everyone involved. Lily I think is going to be such a legend – fearless.”For a time, he “worried that this is what film-making is: hell”. But on Hurry Up Tomorrow, the director, Shults, “brought the joy back into it”. He also provided catharsis. We discuss a scene on a private jet where Tesfaye’s seams are coming apart after his relationship breakup. “That symbolised abandonment,” Tesfaye says. “We all deal with that, whether it’s a father that left us, girlfriend, whatever it is.”Tesfaye’s father left early on in his life, though in the recent song I Can’t Wait to Get There he wonders if they’ll reconnect one day. Were those the feelings of abandonment he was tapping into? “Nope.” An awkward laugh and another stonewall. “Forgiveness is key,” he allows. “Before we shot the film, I went through whatever healing I had to go through. And then I needed to shed that skin, and I wanted to do it in a way that felt more visual. If it wasn’t for [Shults], I would have kept it in the vault – I’ve kept a lot of albums in the vault. But it felt right to tell it.“Men have this forcefield – it’s like we want to come off as invincible, and vulnerability is something you run away from. I was able to be vulnerable in my music, but I was able tohidebehind music. For me to trust someone like Trey to allow myself to be vulnerable, that was new for me. It felt like a therapy session for all of us. I was able to face my child self. We go through so much that we don’t even remember as children, we just suppress everything. If you don’t deal with it, it comes out.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Holly McCandless-DesmondTesfaye releasedan album also called Hurry Up Tomorrowearlier this year. Some songs are “callbacks” to earlier Weeknd material, but in others he seems more relaxed in his skin – perhaps a problem for a project based around darkness. “Traumas in my life, I’ve been hesitant to heal ’em / Take another hit, or my music, they won’t feel it”, he sings on Enjoy the Show.“I was being tongue-in-cheek about it:this is what you guys love me for,” he says. “But it can’t just be debauchery. You don’t want to stay at the party too long – the next thing you know you’re 40 years old and you’re … I don’t want to do that. We all want to age gracefully.” As the Weeknd, he says, “I have said everything I have to say; whatever mission I was on as an 18-year-old, I’ve done it tenfold, and at this point it becomes gluttony, it becomes greed, it’s a sin. Literally!”He’s been hinting at winding up the Weeknd in recent years: is this really the end? “Yeeea … well, look. I have a tour, so I don’t want to confuse anybody.” As for retiring the Weeknd moniker, “I haven’t thought that out. It’s not this calculated vision.”I ask if the Weeknd is creatively exhausted as a project, but he flips it: “Creatively fulfilled. As an artist, you have duties, and you also have dreams. The key to my longevity is to continue dreaming. There is definitely something that isn’t fulfilled for me, and the only way you can go there is if you close a chapter somewhere else. I want to tap into a different part of my life: my heritage. I’ve never been to Ethiopia – I can’t imagine what going back to Africa is going to do for me, spiritually, emotionally, creatively. You need to reconnect with everything about yourself.” I gently ask again: is reconnecting with his father part of that exploration? “I hope so.”View image in fullscreen‘I was able to be vulnerable in my music’ … Tesfaye meets fans in Glendale, Arizona, earlier this month.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Live NationHe says that although his mother is a wonderful parent, in childhood “having a father figure is important. I was able to find that in friendships; I have a stepfather who came into my life later who is just as bright as my mother is – he is pure light, and I learned a lot from him, too. But they say the learning age of three to seven, that stuff stays with you for ever.” He adds that the absence is “so hard to articulate, in an interview especially. I think in the song Hurry Up Tomorrow I was able to eloquently say it.”It’s the final song on the album, delivered as a confession to God: “I’ve been trying to fill that void that my father left / So no one else abandons me – I’m sorry,” Tesfaye sings, before hoping that he makes it to heaven. It ends with the same eerie ambient tone that opens his first mixtape, House of Balloons, a gesture of circularity and finality.Darkness, drama and Daft Punk: the Weeknd’s best songs – ranked!Read moreThe “void” lyric reminds me of something he said earlier in our conversation, when he was reflecting on the relentless work that brought on his panic attack and lost voice. Success, he says, became “something to fill a void:my purpose is to just succeed. And when you’ve done that, you need to look around and see what really matters. The simple things: time with people you love. And sleep – we take it for granted. I didn’t realise how necessary sleep was in my life.” There’s a sighing, romantic tone to his voice, so different to the jaded Weeknd. “Sleep is such a sweet thing, isn’t it?”Hurry Up Tomorrow is in cinemas now.

That’s what I asked myself, watching Hollywood’s last movie star cling to the undercarriage of a biplane like a sloth in the climactic scene ofMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning. Even by the standards of the long-running action franchise, this stunt – which sees Cruise’s character Ethan Hunt shimmy into the cockpit of one moving plane before wing-walking on to another, mid-flight – seems particularly masochistic: the crew were worried thathe had passed outduring its filming. What’s more, Cruise doesn’t even look particularly cool performing it: at one point the wind resistance plasters his hair into a Dumb and Dumber bowl-cut, jowls flapping about like a basset hound. You would have never caught Paul Newman committing such clownery. Surely Tom Cruise doesn’t have to do this sort of thing any more?Cruise, who turns 63 in July, has been making Mission: Impossible films since Bill Clinton’s first presidential term. But The Final Reckoning, which arrives in UK cinemas on Wednesday, does seem to signal the end of something. Director Christopher McQuarrie has been at pains to frame it as the closing of an 18-hour, eight-movie chapter, a point bludgeoned home by the film itself via a plot that inelegantly tries to retrofit storylines from past instalments into some grand, planet-enveloping culmination. And while McQuarrie has been talking up the future of the franchise as a whole, and Cruise has been making optimistic noises about being AI ported,Harrison Ford-style, into future instalments, you have to assume that it won’t continue in its current form. It’s surely too big an operation, too taxing on its star, for business to continue as usual. Which is great news for anyone who would like to see Tom Cruise do something other than motorcycle off a cliff again and again; to see him, you know,act.Cruise’s filmography tells quite the story. In its first half, after a couple of early faltering roles, he enjoyed an astonishing hot streak, spanning from Risky Business in 1983 to Jerry Maguire in 1996 – largely dramatic, middlebrow films that make lucrative use of his intensity, gigawatt smile and slight hint of sleaziness. The first Mission: Impossible arrived right before the end of this dynamite run, but it didn’t mark a dramatic sea change towards action movies. In fact, when Mission: Impossible 2 arrived in 2000, he was in the middle of period that might be described as “Cruise: the arthouse years”, where he took on challenging, messy roles in ambitious (if bloated) auteur-driven films: in Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, Cameron Crowe’s Vanilla Sky and Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia, the lattera career-best performancehe really should have won the best supporting actor Oscar for.View image in fullscreenAnything but beige … Tom Cruise in Magnolia.Photograph: REUTERSPlenty have speculated, in fact, that not winning that Oscar, and later not even being nominated for his brilliant villainous turn in Michael Mann’s Collateral, might have prompted Cruise to give up on awards-chasing, and instead hone himself into the gravity-defying, last action hero of his later career. It’s probably more complicated than that – it’s hard to ignore the effect that theOprah couch incidentand the negative press around Cruise’sassociation with Scientologymight have had on his role selection. Maybe he was avoiding complex parts that might have made him seem even weirder in the public eye and focusing on all-American heroes instead. Or perhaps he simply saw the way the wind was blowing in cinema, as mid-budget films died out and the studio focus became about making bigger and bigger blockbusters.Whatever the reason, the shift was undeniable: in the 2010s and 2020s he has almost exclusively made whacking great action blockbusters. Some of those blockbusters have been very good (Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Edge of Tomorrow, Top Gun: Maverick), and Cruise’s commitment to throwing his body into them, sometimes quite literally, has been remarkable. But such Evel Knieveling has come at the expense of those dramatic roles that for so long felt central to his appeal as an actor. The characterisation in these action films has at times felt underwritten, bordering on Ken doll: with a gun to the temple, could you tell the difference between the character he plays in Top Gun: Maverick and the one he plays in those later Mission films? His hair might be different, but that’s it really.Which is why I’m so excited by Cruise’s next film. Rumoured to be titled Judy, it is directed by Alejandro Iñárritu and follows “the most powerful man in the world, who embarks on a frantic mission to prove he is humanity’s saviour before the disaster he’s unleashed destroys everything.” Not only is it a complex role of the sort Cruise seemed to have left behind long ago, but it’s one that turns hismessianic action hero figuretrademark upside down. Iñárritu’s recent record has been patchy, but he is the sort of big-swinging auteur that Cruise worked with at the turned of the millennium – and iskeen to work with again(though perhaps a Paul Thomas Anderson reunion is a bit of a stretch, given Cruise’sreported reaction to The Master). Are we about to see a late-era flowering, with Cruise taking on fascinating roles?Perhaps – but he might not be ale to resist the lure of contorting his body into uncomfortable shapes in the name of Hollywood. It seems a slightly cruel irony that the Oscars have announced the introduction of abest stunts categoryright after the closing of this Mission: Impossible “chapter”, depriving Cruise of an honour for his wing-walking, ravine-jumping Ethan Hunt performances. Still, another prospective role on his IMDb page seems a shoo-in, if the film ever gets made: a collaboration with Nasa and Elon Musk’s Space X that will see Cruise becomethe first man to act in space.

It’s a confident, often engaging mix of music and no-frills theatrical performance, with Bono often coming across like some forgotten character that Samuel Beckett created but then suppressed due to undue levels of rock’n’roll pizzazz.Bono delivers anecdotes from his autobiography Surrender, starting with his recent heart scare and going back to his Dublin childhood, his musical breakthrough to global fame, his post-Live Aid charity work on poverty and famine relief (though no discourse on the question of whether Live Aid was a good thing), and his religious faith which evidently morphed from a radical Christianity in his teen years to a more wide-embracing spirituality; it is all interspersed with “unplugged” versions ofU2standards accompanied by harp and cello.It’s a performance delivered from the pulpit to the fanbase choir of course, but Bono is certainly working hard to find a new register of humility in his public persona – though this colossally successful figure will always be aware that he has a lot to be un-humble about. However, he is opening up about two very important figures in his life: his mother and father, Iris and Bob Hewson, and Bono has a powerful story to tell about his relationship with them. Iris collapsed and died at her own father’s funeral when Bono was just 14, and he and his brother Norman were the close-up witnesses to his father’s retreat into shock and angry melancholy; Bob never mentioned Iris again, and his pain only found an outlet in his love of classical music, with Bono internalising this silence.Bono himself rehearsed with U2 in the early days in a building adjacent to the cemetery where Iris was buried and never visited her grave there. Added to which, Bob had a tough time coming to terms with the fact that his son was a huge star and the two settled into a barbed and bantering relationship which precluded admitting that they loved each other, and which had a very un-Hollywood ending at Bob’s deathbed. (I was sorry that the film didn’t include the sweet anecdote Bono has repeated in chatshows, that when Bob came backstage after a U2 megashow, the only way he could find to congratulate his son’s performance was to say that it was very “professional”.)As for the other important people in Bono’s life – his bandmates and his wife Alison whom he married at the age of 21 - his relationship with them is (understandably) not explored onstage in the same detail. Even so, impressively, Bono does his best to descend from rock god to rock human.Bono: Stories of Surrender screened at theCannes film festivaland is on Apple TV+ from 30 May.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalDocumentary filmsBonoU2Pop and rockFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Peter Parker worried about his homework. The Fantastic Four bickered like flatmates. Even the Hulk, a walking nuclear tantrum, was really just a green and muscular guy having a bad day. Over at DC, though, the heroes remained clean, polished and largely unbothered – moral titans gazing down from above, solving problems without ever really having any of their own.Superman was the prototype of that ideal: an all-powerful alien whose only weakness was a glowing space rock and an unshakable sense of duty. He wasn’t like us – he wasbetterthan us. And that was the point. When Margot Kidder’s Lois Lane first meets the man of steel in 1978’sSuperman, she is almost impossibly awestruck by the presence of this walking, talking, flying god. Lois’s wide-eyed vulnerability is a stark contrast with the condescension she doles out to his alter ego, Clark Kent. The two sides of the Last Son of Krypton might be exactly the same person, but it’s virtually impossible for anyone to recognise them as such, because one radiates impossible power while the other can barely hold on to his briefcase.For those of us brought up on the 1978 version of Superman, the sight of him squirming in the face of a mildly probing interview by Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) inthe first full trailer for James Gunn’s Supermanis like watching a Greek god forget his lines in a school play. Rather than a morally upright, granite-jawed colossus watching over us like Jesus in a cape, this new David Corenswet-essayed take on Kal-El is one who is less a saviour from the stars than a disbelieving schoolboy who can’t quite understand how he’s getting aggravation for rescuing a cat up a tree.Zack Snyder briefly gave us a glimpse of a Superman who is not always the world’s favourite superhero in Man of Steel in 2013, but by the time we got to 2016’s execrable Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, all those intriguing undertones about divine power and human frailty had dissipated. The fact that Gunn is picking this concept up and running with it tells us that he clearly wants to bring us a Superman who inspires awe once again; though there will be no return to Christopher Reeve’s effortlessly noble, flawlessly statuesque Man of Steel. This time around, it’s less about the idea of Superman as an extra-terrestrial trying to work out how to be human, and more about Kal-El as a guy who is just as human as the rest of us – but just happens to come from outer space.Might the bad guys of Gunn’s film – Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor and Angela Spica’s Engineer – help Superman find his place in the moral architecture, by showing him why rules matter?In the comics, the Engineer is a member of the Authority – an antihero crew parachuted into DC from the WildStorm imprint in the late 1990s. This morally ambiguous squad of powerhouses believe the world is too broken for compassion, and too far gone for the sense of truth, justice and the American way espoused by the Man of Steel. Where Superman sees hope, they see a target. Where he wants to protect, they want to improve – violently, if necessary. It’s not yet clear if other members of The Authority – trenchcoated brute Midnighter or the unhinged, solar-powered demigod that is Apollo – will appear in Gunn’s Superman. But the arrival on screen of these most morally unhinged saviours might be just what our boy needs to see the light. Could such ethical tension – a fundamental clash between idealism and pragmatism – be the emotional backbone not just of this film, but of Gunn’s new DCU at large?Either way, it’s clear that DC’s big cheese is less interested in the Superman who flies above us and more the one who stumbles among us. This new Man of Steel is primed and ready to save the world … even if he’s starting to suspect that being human might just be the hardest part of the whole gig.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSupermanSuperman: The MovieJames GunnDC ComicsComics and graphic novelscommentShareReuse this content"

Devon (Meghann Fahy) is struggling to keep her head above water, barely holding down a job while looking after a father with dementia. She could do with some help from her sister Simone (Milly Alcock) who has fallen under the spell of Julianne Moore’s peculiar socialite Michaela (“I get to call her Kiki, which is a really special honour”). Devon pays an uninvited visit to her sibling and what she finds looks more like a cult than a place of work. Can she save Simone – and does she even want to be saved? Not every element of Sirens quite gels but it’s creepy and nicely unpredictable.Netflix, from Thursday 22 MayNine Perfect StrangersView image in fullscreenThink White Lotus without the laughs … Nicole Kidman as Masha Dmitrichenko in Nine Perfect Strangers.In what feels like a very modern basis for a drama, there’s no setback that can’t be overcome if you’re shameless enough. Afterseason one’s chaos, Nicole Kidman’s weird wellness guru Masha has simply moved continents and started again. She’s now in the Austrian Alps and another nine individuals (Mark Strong, Murray Bartlett, Henry Golding and Christine Baranski are among the new cast members) have been invited into her new lair.

As season four begins, the team are in English football’s third tier. Is another promotion possible? Supporters already know the answer but it’s still an enjoyable journey, and it’s easier for neutrals to root for the side now they’re rubbing shoulders with the bigger boys rather than financially overpowering small teams. Even if it doesn’t gladden the hearts of purists, it would be churlish to decry the entertainment value.Disney+, out nowTucci in ItalyView image in fullscreenFoodie heaven … Stanley Tucci at a BBQ joint with journalist Cristina Bachetti and one of the owners, Rodolfo Mucciante.Photograph: Matt Holyoak/National Geographic“The best way to understand a country is through its food,” says Stanley Tucci. On the basis of this sustained barrage of food porn, Italy looks heavenly. Of course, there’s pizza and a million different varieties of pasta. But there’s also cheese, wine, seafood and barbecues and, as Tucci ventures off thebeaten track, he starts to appreciate the tiny regional variations that give the food its character. This sometimes feels less like a documentary series and more like a communique from the Italian tourist board but, even so, it’s mightily effective.Disney+, from Monday 19 MayShe the PeopleView image in fullscreenA knockabout comedy … Terri J Vaughn as Antoinette Dunkerson in She the People.Photograph: Charles Bergmann/NetflixIt’s debatable whether people nowadays are in the mood for a knockabout comedy set in the world of US politics but here is one all the same. The series is the handiwork ofTyler Perry– a creator not best known for his subtlety – and follows Antoinette Dunkerson (Terri J Vaughan), a Black woman who is elected lieutenant governor of Mississippi. In the current climate this stretches credibility – but the main thrust of the narrative sadly does not. As she navigates a broken system, Dunkerson is belittled, patronised and undermined at every turn.Netflix, from Thursday 22 MayClarkson’s FarmView image in fullscreenPerfectly calibrated … Kaleb, Jeremy and Lisa in Clarkson’s Farm.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien/Prime VideoIs Diddly Squat farm becoming a victim of its own success – or, at least, the success of one of its most famous figures? Breakout star Kaleb Cooper is off on tour and Jeremy Clarkson is left in the lurch. His reaction to this extra stress is to add some more to the load: he’s decided to buy a pub.

You have to embrace the chaos.”Hazlewood, the founder and artistic director ofParaorchestra, has teamed up with the Turner prize-winning Deller forThe Bradford Progress, one of the highlight events of this year’s Bradford city of culture.It has been two years in the planning, lots of “chatting, visiting, talking to people” and is a dizzying musical odyssey involving about 500 musicians all celebrating the sound ofBradford.The idea is for an “unbroken arc of music” for 36 hours, starting on Saturday at sunrise with a three-minute blast of Handel at the Cow and Calf Rocks on Ilkley Moor and processing along the moors, taking in canals, parks, cemeteries, the industrial museum, housing estates shopping arcades and more before concluding at the Mirror Pool in the city centre.There will be classical, bhangra, folk, punk, gospel, bassline, brass band, electronic, Sufi, Indian classical, and minimalist.Deller said music was a great way of telling stories. “You find out about the city by the music that’s made in it and who’s here and why and what kind of music is made and who makes it. It will be storytelling without having to make it obvious.”The pair have been working on the project on and off for about two years and say they did not want it to be a musical relay race.View image in fullscreenThe Bradford Progress has been two years in the making for organisers artist Jeremy Deller (left) and conductor Charles Hazlewood.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian“It’s so much more than that,” said Hazlewood. “The music is continuous and it morphs from one type of music to another type of music. The edges are blurred. You get these bits of cross-fertilisation between musics that aren’t meant to go together.”A big theme of the weekend will be incongruity and unexpectedness.Neither Deller nor Hazlewood wanted to give away all the surprises, although they did disclose the prospect of opera from the sound systems of modified cars. Have the young men involved enjoyed it? “Well, it’s not entirely clear if they’ve ‘enjoyed’ it, let me put it like that,” said Deller.Another possible highlight is a performance of Steve Reich’s The Four Sections by the Paraorchestra in the Broadway shopping centre, which is a particular thrill for Hazelwood.“I’ve always wanted Paraorchestra to play in a shopping arcade. A big part of our work is about rubbing out the fourth wall, rather than being an audience member on the outside looking in, they can be on the inside looking out.”Hazlewood said he wanted people to see the sweat on a trumpeter’s upper lip, to be behind a double bass and feel its vibration.“Orchestras do tend to be these rarefied beasts where, often, players walk on stage and don’t even acknowledge the audience.“That frustrates me because music is an act of love. It’s an act of communication. It doesn’t exist in a bubble.”View image in fullscreenMembers of Paraorchestra. The group will be performing at the Broadway shopping centre as part of the event.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianThere will be music through the night in the cemetery although people will not literally be able to get in, “unless you’re dead,” said Deller. The santoor and electronic music should though be hearable from the street.It sounds chaotic but is, in truth, meticulously organised by a large team. The plan is that sections will be filmed and put online for people who cannot get there.On Friday, there was an early taster of what is to come as a lone tabla player, Qaiser Khan, walked through the blazing Saltaire sunshine to the Victorian bandstand in Roberts Park.There, between two 19th-century 10ft cannons, singers fromSong-Geet, Yorkshire’s first south Asian women’s choir, performed. They were followed by wind players from the Paraorchestra playing Mozart.Different people will get different things from the weekend but above all, Deller said, he wants people to just enjoy it.“Enjoy the music in these very familiar and unfamiliar surroundings. It’s quite straightforward really – people coming together and listening to music and participating.“Often it is the simple ideas which are quite complicated to make. This is a simple idea but there are a lot of working parts.”Explore more on these topicsBradfordJeremy DellerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Born Lindsey French – and previously known as Negative Gemini – Neggy Gemmy’s music spans coldwave, shoegaze, trance, vaporwave and capital-P pop; her records can be icily aggressive or hedonistic and seductive, often in the span of the same song. Although her work is always distinctive, she’s also canny with iconoclastic references. On 2016’s Body Work, she sampled Britney Spears’ Everytime one song before her own masterpiece of emotional desolation, the breakbeat ballad You Never Knew; the highlight from her underrated 2023 club odyssey CBD Reiki Moonbeam, titled On the Floor, sounds like – and, in a just world, would have been – a 2000s Kylie Minogue single. French’s forthcoming album She Comes from Nowhere still foregrounds her distinctive voice, which can be both breathy and appealingly harsh, but it also incorporates touches of gauzy, gallic bands such as Stereolab and Air, adding appealing new textures to her work.Despite the relative pop appeal of her music, French is also stridently independent: She is the co-founder of the influential cult vaporwave label 100% Electronica with her husband George Clanton, and has rarely released music through an outside label. During a time when conversations about ownership and rights dominate pop music, French, Clanton and the artists they work with represent the internet’s potential to foster a self-sustaining scene without gatekeepers or big money. With any luck, She Comes from Nowhere will find an even larger stage to spread the sound (and the message).Shaad D’SouzaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenSofia Kourtesis and Daphni.Sofia Kourtesis – Unidos (with Daphni)As if two of dance’s warmest producers collaborating would be anything other than radiantly uplifting: “You never let them get you down!” a voice declares, as the relentless beat crushes desolation to dust.LSAlan Sparhawk – Not BrokenSparhawk’s daughter Hollis joins him on this banjo-laced lament about resisting anger in the face of loss, her vocals a disarming echo of her late mother Mimi Parker’s muted hymnals.LSDJ Dadamanand Moscow Dollar – MatlatsiThis pair were at the heart of the “Bacardi house” scene of 00s South Africa that gave the world Township Funk, and now they’re back with this spry, sinewy hybrid of piano-house and amapiano.BBTThe None – At HopeNamed for a senator’s suggestion that “at-risk” kids should be called “at-hope”, the post-hardcore band’s latest thrashes against inequality. “To make a living, you’ve got to give in,” taunts fearless Kai Whyte.LSClaire Rousay andGretchen Korsmo – Find Yourself in a Hole on the BeachRousay never stops, here joining with a fellow US sound artist for an intensely blissful wash of field recordings, balmy vocalisations and acoustic guitar that spreads like ink in water.LSPile – Born at NightShades ofProtomartyrto this dynamic art-rock anthem from the Boston DIY mainstays, tumbling in a torrent of rolling drums but held aloft by strident violin.BBTCelestial – Mermaid Boulevard (ft Romance)The ambient-folk Mancunians turn in a wildly beautiful instrumental, with a longform Vini Reilly-ish Balearic guitar solo over a looped, reversed waltzing motif.BBTSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a reply to himself immediately below, he added: “language interfaces are going to be a big deal, i think”.If Altman was aiming for understatement, he succeeded. ChatGPT became the fastest web service to hit 1 million users, but more than that, it fired the starting gun on the AI wars currently consuming big tech. Everything is about to change beyond recognition, we keep being told, though no one can agree on whether that will be for good or ill.This moment is just one of many skilfully captured in Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey’s biography of Altman, who, like his company, was then virtually unknown outside of the industry.He is a confounding figure throughout the book, which charts his childhood, troubled family life, his first failed startup Loopt, his time running the startup incubator Y Combinator, and the founding of OpenAI.Altman, short, slight, Jewish and gay, appears not to fit the typical mould of the tech bro. He is known for writing long, earnest essays about the future of humankind, and his reputation was as more of an arch-networker and money-raiser than an introverted coder in a hoodie.OpenAI, too, was supposed to be different from other tech giants: it was set up as a not-for-profit, committed by its charter to work collaboratively to create AI for humanity’s benefit, and made its code publicly available. Altman would own no shares in it.He could commit to this, as he said in interviews, because he was already rich – his net worth is said to be around $1.5bn (£1.13bn) – as a result of his previous investments. It was also made possible because of his hyper-connectedness: as Hagey tells it, Altman met his software engineer husband Oliver Mulherin in the hot tub of PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel at 3am, when Altman, 29, was already a CEO, and Mulherin was a 21-year-old student.Thiel was a significant mentor to Altman, but not nearly so central to the story of OpenAI as another notorious Silicon Valley figure – Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX owner was an initial co-founder and major donor to the not-for-profit version of OpenAI, even supplying its office space in its early years.That relationship has soured into mutual antipathy – Musk is bothsuing OpenAIand offering (somewhat insincerely) tobuy it– as Altman radically altered the company’s course. First, its commitment to releasing code publicly was ditched. Then, struggling to raise funds, it launched a for-profit subsidiary. Soon, both its staff and board worried the vision of AI for humanity was being lost amid a rush to create widely used and lucrative products.This leads to the book’s most dramatic sections, describing how OpenAI’s not-for-profit board attempted anaudacious ousting of Altmanas CEO, only for more than 700 of the company’s 770 engineers to threaten to resign if he was not reinstated. Within five days, Altman was back, more powerful than ever.OpenAI has been toying with becoming a purely private company. And Altman turns out to be less of an anomaly in Silicon Valley than he once seemed.

Although a few titles were still being released for the machine in 1995, the games magazine world had moved on and all anyone wanted to read about were the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was a bitter blow.Fast-forward to 2025 and a resurgent interest in producing new games for vintage home computers and consoles has led to Farming Simulator: 16bit Edition – a Mega Drive instalment in the hugely successful agricultural sim series. The passion project of Renzo Thönen, lead level designer and co-owner of Farming Simulation studio Giants Software, the game has been written using an open-source Mega Drive development kit, and manufactured in a limited run of genuine Mega Drive cartridges. Slotting this brand new release into the cart of my dad’s ancient Mega Drive II console felt ridiculously moving and I thought the game could only be a letdown after that. But I was wrong.View image in fullscreenThe cartridge of Farming Simulator: 16bit Edition.Photograph: Giants SoftwareFarming Simulator: 16bit Edition takes the basic rhythms of its stablemates – sowing, harvesting and selling crops – and puts them in an isometric environment where workable fields are interspersed with useful buildings such as fuel depots, seed stores and garages. You begin with basic tractors and harvesters, but as you carefully work the land, you grow and sell wheat to earn money, thereby opening the prospect of upgrading your machinery and buying more powerful vehicles. Eventually, you make enough money to unlock new farm areas, but the basic game play is always the same: you slowly and carefully drive your tractors over your land, ploughing and sowing and harvesting as the seasons pass.In this reduced format, the sedate pace of the farming simulator games should become a dull repetitive chore; robbed of intricately detailed 3D visuals, real-time weather systems and supplementary activities, all you’re doing is effectively mowing the lawn. Over and over again. Let’s be honest: transferring the complex, multilayered 3D sim into a console that launched at the same time as the world wide web and the first mass manufactured Nokia mobile phone was always going to be a technical challenge.View image in fullscreenA trip down memory lane … a Sega Mega Drive running Farming Simulator: 16bit Edition.Photograph: Keith Stuart/The GuardianBut somehow, the system still works. Perhaps it’s the nice chug-chug sound effects of the tractors, or the amusingly precarious steering that often sends you crashing into a tree; or maybe it’s the sheer nostalgia of the rugged 2D visuals. I don’t know. I just know that I’ve kept playing. Veteran Mega Drive owners may be reminded of the Desert, Jungle and Urban Strike games or the isometric strategy delights of Populous or General Chaos. But what’s really fascinating is seeing a modern game genre on this old machine and wondering, what score would it have received from contemporary gaming mags such as Sega Power or Mega?Perhaps, this is one for Mega Drive nuts like me who thrill at the idea of running something new on their beloved artefact – like playing a 4K Blu-ray movie on a Toshiba video recorder. It’s also going to be tough to secure one as only 1,000 are being made. However, Giants has previously released a Commodore 64 version of the game, Farming Simulator C64, which is now available to play for PC, and perhaps an emulated version of this one will also find a way to modern machines.And yet, like a deluxe half-speed remaster of some old vinyl album, there is emotional value in the format itself. This is why Giants isn’t alone in producing new carts for the old consoles. The excellent puzzle platformer Tanglewood appeared for the Mega Drive a few years ago and a promising shooter Earthion is coming later this year. Limited Run games has also made a whole range of new SNES carts for classic titles.I wish my dad were around to see me reviewing a new release for the last console we played on together. As someone who spent all his boyhood summers staying on a farm, he certainly would have loved this game. For now, I will keep ploughing these fields and selling wheat, enjoying the tranquil cycle of nature as rendered on a machine as out of date as an ox cart.Farming Simulator: 16bit Edition is available now, £43Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesSegaSimulation gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Certainly not for Harold Fry, the Bunyanesque modern-day everyman who goes out to post a letter to his terminally ill, long-lost friend and ends up hiking 500 miles to say goodbye to her in person.Harold (Mark Addy), middle-aged and mournful, leaves his Devon home and his distant, disenchanted wife, Maureen (Jenna Russell), to go to the post office. But he is inspired by a petrol station attendant (Sharon Rose, twinkling as Garage Girl) to begin his secular pilgrimage to the Berwick-upon-Tweed hospice where Queenie (Amy Booth-Steel) lies dying.The development of this musical follows a familiar trajectory: it is an adaptation of a best-sellingnovel (by Rachel Joyce), which has already beenturned into a filmstarring national treasures (Jim Broadbent and Penelope Wilton). If sentiment laced the story in its original form, then schmaltz led the latter incarnation. The same syrupy, unabashed sentimentality roves through this show, adapted by Joyce herself.View image in fullscreenVibrant choreography … Jack Wolfe, centre, in The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry.Photograph: Manuel HarlanBut its winning twist lies in the music, composed by singer-songwriter Michael Rosenberg, otherwise known as Passenger, which blasts the story through with folksy heart and foot-stomping soul. One belter follows another from the first song, Rise Up, to the last, Here’s One for the Road.The tunes are twinned with vibrant choreography by Tom Jackson Greaves and directorKaty Rudd’s imaginative staging fuels the show’s idiosyncratic spirit. It is performed within a luminous circle on Samuel Wyer’s playfully lo-fi set, an abstract back-screen reflecting the changing landscape, with actors standing in for trees, sheep and washing lines. Some scenes break out into fantasy, garish and whirling at times, witty at others. Together, it has the makings of a quirky West End transfer, in the mould ofThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button.Jack Wolfe is compelling, first as the Balladeer and then as Harold and Maureen’s dead son. He has an uncanny resemblance to Earl Cave (his counterpart in the film) and is an almost ubiquitous presence, first benign, then agitating and angry. Russell is slowly, icily magnificent as a woman estranged from herself, while Addy’s Harold, stolid and unremarkable, comes alive slowly, as if thawing back into feeling all of life’s pain and joy that he has thus far held at bay.Harold’s unlikely Instagram stardom attracts a band of pilgrims/outcasts and they bring broadness and warmth albeit earnestness too. In fact, the stray dog – an exquisite puppet – outshines them all.The book’s discussions around faith are muted and emotions come in primary colours, while the script abounds with wholesome mottoes for life. Yet still it does not pull its punches around the messiness of grief and the anger around loss. It pulls you irrepressibly in with its rousing message that life is not for regret but for kindness, gratitude – and most of all for living.AtMinerva theatre, Chichester, until 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsChichester Festival theatreJenna RussellreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both offer startling insight into women’s livesHannah ClugstonFri 16 May 2025 07.52 EDTShareYou’d be hard pressed to find a more alluring opening to a show than this: a bubbling pool consisting of 800kg of molten milk chocolate oozing seductively, filling the gallery with a sweet aroma and a soft, steady gurgling. On the walls brightly coloured, circular photographs of orchids, gerberas, sweet peas and chrysanthemums repeat the circular shape of the chocolate pool.But for artist Helen Chadwick – whose Life Pleasures show at the Hepworth Wakefield is the largest retrospective of her work – pleasure is never that far from pain. It is not long before that thick, gloopy chocolate starts to smell sickly, the scent overwhelming the senses; the mechanism inside making the liquid bubble artificially. On closer inspection, the petals in the photographs are suspended in a variety of less pleasant liquids – industrial hand cleaner, window spray, washing up liquid – and the suggestive shapes of tonsils, testes and vaginas begin to emerge.View image in fullscreenSickly sweet … Cacao by Helen Chadwick.Photograph: Ray Tang/ShutterstockThis push and pull – the delightful and the disgusting – is found throughout Chadwick’s practice. In Carcass, a huge, colourful column of rotting food taken from the Hepworth cafe fizzes and disintegrates; in Loop My Loop a glossy lock of hair is intertwined with a pig’s intestines; in Piss Flowers urine is used to create beautiful, organic blooms, and in Agape a glistening pair of tonsils glow through a lightbox to gory effect. The artist uses an unusual array of materials to elicit responses in her audience. She wants us to feel not think. She taps into our subconscious, into our feelings of desire, asking us to probe why a furry table or a pile of juicy worms simultaneously attracts and repels.Chadwick’s MA degree show in 1977, In the Kitchen, bought her early acclaim and the images of women dressed as kitchen appliances still feel relevant. In the two subsequent decades, Chadwick was prolific, and despite her untimely death at 42, Life Pleasures is a celebration of a full and mature practice. The show categorises pieces under headings such as Feminism and Fetish, The Self as Subject and Landscapes of the Body to bring Chadwick’s interests to the fore. In the Kitchen and many other works in the exhibition often appear in “women artist” group shows, but Life Pleasures demonstrates the impact of Chadwick’s practice when seen as a whole and highlights her ability to take classical concepts, tip them sideways, inject humour and produce something relatable and enticing.View image in fullscreenHelen Chadwick with Piss Flowers in 1994.Photograph: Kippa MatthewsThe autobiographical projects Chadwick produced aged 30, Ego Geometria Sum: the Labours, saw her create 10 sculptures from significant moments in her childhood and then take photographs of her carrying each sculpture. In the exhibition, the sculptures are in the centre of a space with the 10 photographs on pink walls, separated by long, shiny pink curtains. The photographs – the Labours – are named after the Greek myth in which Hercules was ordered to perform 12 perilous tasks and Chadwick completes her own tasks by lifting or holding her sculptures. This demonstrates strength but her contorted body also symbolises the way in which these moments from her past have shaped her.The most impressive work is The Oval Court, originally made for Chadwick’s first major solo exhibition at the ICA in London in 1986. Across the floor is a low platform in a soft blue, covered in 12 photocopied images of her body as she folds around animals, food, fauna and an eclectic selection of objects. Five gold balls shimmer on the surface of the “ocean” of Chadwicks, and on the wall 11 columns drawn from St Peter’s Basilica are topped by Chadwick’s weeping face. The columns and the gold are regal, while Chadwick’s nude body gorging on food and wrapped up in random materials celebrates humanity enjoying earthly pleasures.View image in fullscreenExquisitely observed … Daphne by Caroline Walker.Photograph: Peter Mallett/© Caroline Walker. Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM, and Ingleby GalleryOpening at the same time is Caroline Walker’s Mothering, an exhibition that sits neatly alongside Life Pleasures, not least because mothering is almost the embodiment of pleasure and pain. But there are other satisfying links, such as Walker’s own self-portrait where – unlike Chadwick – she is not holding a childhood moment but a child who will shape her just as much. And like Chadwick, Walker is interested in the experience of women; she has spent many years painting women at work. Mothering captures her time spent observing a maternity unit at UCL hospital, London, and her own personal experiences.Nude latex suits, wearable beds and farting swamps: the transgressive art of Helen ChadwickRead moreMotherhood is exquisitely observed by Walker, who manages to document the quiet, dark shuffle of the sonography suite; the hazy, repetitiveness of night feeds; the coffee table clutter and half-consumed glasses of water that plague a new mother’s life. One of the largest pieces is Daphne, a painting of the artist’s daughter as a toddler captured through the lounge window. It is dusk and the exterior of the house has a blue hue, but inside the lounge is awash with warm, orange light and home comforts. Daphne stands silently, perhaps anticipating the return of her mother who is on the other side of the window. The two are separate for a moment – two individuals in a big world – but even unseen by Daphne, Walker is watching over her. Neither are ever truly alone.In footage of Chadwick’s degree performance of Domestic Sanitation, the viewers are predominantly men. On today’s press trip it is entirely women, which hints at the success of work by artists such as Chadwick and Walker: if you allow women to be seen, if you focus on their desires, you make space for them to exist in the public consciousness.Helen Chadwick: Life Pleasures and Caroline Walker: Mothering are atThe Hepworth, Wakefieldfrom 17 May until 27 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArtSculptureInstallationVideo artPhotographyPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It makes the connection between directing the breath to play a wind instrument and dealing with life’s stresses.“The skill is in controlling that pressure,” says Keli, a 17-year-old tenor horn player who knows all about pressure. On her plate is a thankless job in a supermarket, a mentally ill mother and a solo spot in a national brass band competition.View image in fullscreenSonorous … Billy Mack in Keli.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicMaking an impressive professional debut, Liberty Black is vigorous and tough in the lead role, a young woman so used to having her defences up, she cannot see when she is being helped – not least by band leader Brian (an avuncular Phil McKee). All she knows is that music gives her order.Keli is a young woman rooted in the landscape. Hers is a village shaped by its industrial heritage, traumatised by theminers’ strikeand muddling on by in a resolutely modern world. Although Alisa Kalyanova’s set cannot decide whether to be literal or impressionistic, its cavernous black walls never let us forget this is a community built on coal.Community is behind another of Green’s metaphors, one that resonates less than it should. Falling into a collapsed coalmine, Keli meets the long-dead Willie Knox (a sonorous Billy Mack), famed not only for his prize-winning tenor horn playing, but also for heroically surviving a mining accident. An old-school socialist, he is thinking of both music and industry when he eulogises the “combined efforts of determined souls”.It is a powerful sentiment, but in focusing so tightly on one woman’s story, the play is less about the communal than the individual. Only when, magnificently, the Whitburn Band (alternating with Kingdom Brass) takes to the stage at the end of Bryony Shanahan’s production do we get a sense of collective endeavour.At theRoyal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 17 May.

It seemed a veryGustavo Dudamelway for the starry conductor to begin his first London appearance with the London Symphony Orchestra, after concerts in Spain last week.Dudamel drove the music hard and fast: it was full of firework explosions that dissolved into sparkling blurs of light. On one level it was thrilling. On another, it soon began to feel a little narrow. Dudamel let the brightest moments scythe through the texture – an ear-splitting glockenspiel, a brief but brazen trumpet solo – and yet the general orchestral sound was so thickly blended as to be almost homogenised. There was little sense of the music bubbling with detail, and a limited depth to the sound.This might not have mattered so much had the concert not been entirely of music by Strauss and Ravel, two of the 20th century’s most meticulous musical colourists. At least the opening of Ravel’s Shéhérazade showed that the orchestra could still play quietly. The soprano soloist wasMarina Rebeka. Spinning out long, fluid lines, she captured the languid quality of these songs beautifully but was less convincing in conveying the wordiness of their poetry or the sense of wanderlust that drives the first song in particular. Instrumental highlights included Gareth Davies’s flute solos in the second movement, first energised, then returning quiet and distant at the end.The orchestral palette broadened after the interval for Ravel’s Rapsodie Espagnole, with a beguiling softness to the mesmerising repeated figure in the first movement, and a sultriness in the Habanera that put the taut, shiny finale into relief. Finally there was the orchestral suite from Strauss’s opera Der Rosenkavalier, in which the central waltz was full of character but the climactic music was pushed onwards relentlessly. The whole concert was pacy and entertaining, but it left the impression that the LSO is a huge paintbox, the darkest and softest colours of which Dudamel has only just begun to explore.Explore more on these topicsLondon Symphony OrchestraClassical musicGustavo DudamelreviewsShareReuse this content"

The first movement is entitled Una Ricerca, a search, and the soloist also sings while playing, enticing the instrument to find its own voice. When melody finally emerges, the miracle of the violin is somehow underlined and the orchestra’s hitherto restrained support explodes in a volley of approval.The long central Romanze, almost two-thirds of the whole concerto, is by turns passionate, lilting and playful: scales tossed around in a game of catch had a touch of the Sound of Music, but the music also connects back to the German Romantics, this heritage clearly as significant to Widmann as his teachers Hans Werner Henze, Heiner Goebbels and Wolfgang Rihm, the violin always the protagonist in an ongoing drama. Widmann, himself a renowned clarinettist, makes free with the possibilities of the whole orchestra, including a contrabass clarinet in the lineup, mutes altering the brass and bowed crotales in the array of vital percussion. The violin accompanied by glockenspiel, or by celeste and harp, conveyed a gentle, otherworldly aura, while a manic frenzy, atmospheric yet decisive, coloured the final movement. Carolin Widmann’s playing was virtuosic and plush – a broken string and the exchanges with first desk violins managed like sleight of hand – and always with the utter conviction of being the piece’s very inspiration.Widmann the conductor was a dynamic presence on the podium, dancing, even jumping, no baton, eloquent hands punching the air to punctuate phrases.Mozart’s overture to the Marriage of Figaro had given a taste of this abundant energy, but for Mendelssohn’s Reformation Symphony to have emerged with such an electric change was astonishing. The BBCNOW musicians have been in excellent form in recent performances, but here with Widmann they were on fire, commitment and intensity ablaze. It was exhilarating.Broadcast on Radio 3 on 12 June and then available on BBC SoundsExplore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC National Orchestra of WalesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It being a very long film, that’s a lot of time spent looking at his body, glossy and gnarled and expensive as a walnut armoire, possibly in high-definition Imax and, even if not, certainly as big as a bus.In The Final Reckoning, Cruise unbuttons to wallop goons (twice), wriggle from the Arctic seabed towards the waves, hop on a treadmill and take a long hot shower in front of the crew of a strikingly camp US military submarine.Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning review – world-saving Tom Cruise signs off with wildly entertaining adventureRead moreNow 62, Cruise is obviously still Hollywood’s most committed icon of cinema. Committed to the craft and the big screen, to scrupulous professionalism and jumping off stuff, to smiling in selfies anddistributing cakes.But above all, committed to remaining the world’s biggest movie star. And the purity of this egomania proves his undoing, as well as his special genius, in this most messianic of vanity trips.Watch the trailer for Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.The Final Reckoning is a film where the opening credits start, for the avoidance of doubt, with the words: “ATom Cruiseproduction”, before nearly three hours of people asking him for instructions, looking worried when he does something they’re too scared to, giving him lascivious CPR and telling him they like his hair.The most common refrain is the suggestion Cruise is the only person who can save humanity, to which he demurs, eyes lightly pained at such fallacy – before saving humanity.View image in fullscreenTake my clothes away … Cruise in the Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning trailer.Photograph: Paramount PicturesYes, he’s got a loyal team but they’re so much his inferiors as to be groupies rather than colleagues (though Simon Pegg does get his own topless moment this time round). The bad guys meanwhile are either nebulous (evil AI) or sweatily pathetic (American flunkies who question President Angela Bassett when she leans towards popping all her eggs in Cruise’s basket).His chief nemesis is the least compelling of them all: Gabriel (Esai Morales), of blurry motive, forgettable face and Burton’s tailoring, who shrieks in pain (the closest Cruise comes is the stoical grunt) and cackles things such as: “Tell me I win!”Weighting the deck is one thing, but making your antagonist basically a preschooler feels a pity. How much chewier this might be, how much bigger Cruise’s victory, if there were formidable enemies, not just limp stooges planted round a really high-budget obstacle course.The stunts are wonderful. Playing Mikado sticks with torpedoes in a deep sea shipwreck is indeed what cinema is for. The biplane climax was worth Cruiserisking death. Yet these sequences do not move things forward other than to confirm him as the closest thing we have to an immortal on Earth – an idea further encouraged by the film’s director, Christopher McQuarrie, whoyesterdaytold reporters of his star’s derring-do: “No one on earth can do that but Tom.”View image in fullscreenTom Cruise at the Cannes photocall for Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.Photograph: Lionel Hahn/Getty ImagesEarly in his Affirmations, among interesting thoughts about not getting sleepy and having a hypnotic effect on other people,Scientologyfounder L Ron Hubbard writes: “You will live to be 200 years old. You will always look young.” Two years ago, Cruise said he wanted to keep going at least into his 80s, citing the example of Harrison Ford. I hope he does; if you want to see what $400m looks like on screen and feel enjoyably sick, The Final Reckoning is a good way to go.But I hope that at some point over the next 20 years we get to see Cruise as human. Unless of course he does actually make it to 200, in which case, as you were.Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning is released on 21 MayExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalTom CruiseFestivalsMission: ImpossibleScientologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 1963, the makers of acclaimed Polish film Passenger were still given permission to film at Auschwitz.In the early 90s Steven Spielberg was denied permission to film Schindler’s List inside the concentration camp, setting one scene outside the infamous Auschwitz gatehouse and building replicas of the barracks just outside the camp.Italian director Roberto Benigni’s Life Is Beautiful, which is partially set in a concentration camp, was filmed in an abandoned factory near Papigno, Umbria, while Hungarian director László Nemes’s Oscar-winning Auschwitz drama Son of Saul was shot on the outskirts of Budapest.The Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial said the feature-film ban was due to the need to preserve the site and prevent closures, rather than moral concerns. But some film-makers and artists have argued that setting films inside Auschwitz is outright unethical.Austrian director Michael Haneke condemned Schindler’s List as “unspeakable” for drawing suspense out of the question of whether gas or water would flow out of the shower heads at the camp.Oscar-winning 2023 film The Zone of Interest was filmed on grounds next to the camp, but British film-maker Jonathan Glazer made an artistic and ethical point about never allowing his cameras to swoop over its walls.Asked about what kind of films could use the Picture from Auschwitz resource, the memorial’s spokesperson Pawel Sawicki said: “When assessing proposals for film projects, we put historical accuracy above everything else: whether this is what happened at Auschwitz, or what could have happened at Auschwitz, given the knowledge coming from the testimonies, historical documents we have, and years of historical research.”As to whether this could in principle allow horror films, action movies or video games to be set inside Auschwitz as long as they were historically accurate, Sawicki said the rules around genre had not been finalised.“The lines have not been drawn yet, as this is something very new for us, but there will certainly be boundaries. The camp should not be used as a stage in any way. If the proposal is to make a film that distorts history, dishonours the memory of victims, or serves purely as entertainment, that’s a red flag for us.”One of the people who has advised the project is Ryszard Horowitz, 86, a photographer who was interned at Auschwitz as a five-year-old in 1944, and survived after his family were taken under the wing of Oskar Schindler. “I’m for keeping this story alive, and I like the idea of authenticity,” he said.Polish film-maker Agnieszka Holland, who is acting as Picture from Auschwitz’s director, said she believes opening up the site for film-makers of the future was necessary to allow a new generation to confront the darkest moment in European history.“For a long time, the horror of the second world war and theHolocaustwas a warning lesson that brought about important changes, such as the construction of a European identity,” Holland said.“But the vaccinating effect of the Holocaust has evaporated, and now we are in a similarly dangerous situation to where we were 90 years ago.”Explore more on these topicsFilmHolocaustSecond world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than 2,000 people will see the banner this weekend when they arrive at Venezia Hardcore, a festival that began in a rehearsal room among friends and has become one of the most important counterculture events in Europe.This year’s event will feature Jivebomb’s furious hardcore from the US, Violent Magic Orchestra’s techno black metal from Japan, and Italian bands such as cult screamo outfit La Quiete, political street punk four-piece Klasse Kriminale and local heroes Confine. But the star of the festival will stand out due to his absence: 2025 will be the first edition of Venezia Hardcore without Giacomo “Jack” Gobbato, a musician and activist who was stabbed to death in September by a robber who had attacked a woman Gobbato was trying to defend.Gobbato, 26 at the time of his death, was part of the Venezia Hardcore crew, but also an activist, linked to Rivolta, another occupied space in the centre of Mestre, Venice. His death shocked the city. The following week, on 28 September, more than 10,000 people took to the streets of Mestre to pay homage to him. Posters by Zerocalcare, a beloved Italian cartoonist with close ties to social movements, hung on every corner as tribute. Noisy punk songs blasted from speakers while his friends waved giant banners of Gobbato stage-diving.View image in fullscreen‘He wanted to share a dream’ … Giacomo Gobbato at Venezia Hardcore.Photograph: Roberto Graziano MoroThe march was motivated by the desire to show another face of a city that is increasingly linked with robberies, violent assaults and a growing drug problem. Withmore than 50 deaths in the last eight years, Venice is one of the Italian cities with the highest number of fatalities from heroin overdoses in recent years, alongside Rome.The city’s current administration had mostly tried to counteract this with heavier policing, asking the government for the intervention of the army and only returning to invest in social services a couple of years ago.“It’s sad to know you were right, when the consequences hit you like this,” says Sebastiano Bergamaschi, 26, who was with his friend Gobbato the night he was killed. The attacker stabbed both of them. Bergamaschi survived with injuries to his legs, Gobbato died during the night.View image in fullscreenGiacomo Gobbato, an illustration by Zerocalcare.Illustration: Pragser FranzAs an activist, Bergamaschi has dedicated himself to rebuilding the disappearing social fabric of Venice. Gobbato was an important part of that effort, he says. “Music, activism, tattoos, the environment: Jack had many families,” Bergamaschi observes. “And he always had the ability to unite them. He left an incredible mark on the festival and with us he wanted to share a dream, a project, a way of practising it.”Since Gobbato’s death, other initiatives have been formed. The emotional impact of the march brought many people closer to the young activists. Giorgia Gilli, 34, became part of the activist group in October, taking part in night outings to deliver blankets and hot drinks to people sleeping on the streets during the winter. “It would have been impossible for me to go home and pretend nothing had happened,” she reflects. “It was a necessity.”As a passionate music lover, she is now part of Rec Out, a project started by Gobbato himself: a low-cost professional recording studio open to anyone, where dozens of rap, trap, punk and metal musicians have already passed through. The space, inside the squat, also offers a first stage to young artists and the team creates video interviews with guests, to create an open community among musicians and fans.View image in fullscreenMoshpit memories at Venezia HardcorePhotograph: Roberto Graziano MoroFilippo Lunian, 29, who knew Gobbato since high school, realised a number of musical initiatives with him. “You feel the need to do it,” Lunian says. “To be there, to represent an alternative to how the everyday world is.” Despite moments of discouragement, Gobbato’s friends have continued to propose ideas for months. “The best thing we can do is give our contribution,” Sebastiano adds. “You are doing it to change the life of the people around you.”“United we win,” the festival crew wrotein a postdedicated to Gobbato. Gilli offers the perfect metaphor: “It’s like a moshpit: if you fall, I’ll help you get up. I’ll lift you up in stage diving and I’ll pick you up if you’re down. I’m always there, we’re all in this together. That’s what it means to have a community that supports you.”The festival crew thinks the same. “I met him because I noticed this guy at our concerts who always jumped off the stage,” remembers Samall Ali, musician and co-founder of the festival. “We bonded a lot, he was really full of life.” After Gobbato’s murder, there was no doubt that he had to play a role in the next edition of the festival. “I keep thinking: ‘What role do I want to play in this story? What do we do know?’ I think there is a lot to do. And we will do our part. Jack lit a fuse, in many of us, too. We’ll do the festival for him.”Venezia Hardcore runs from 16-17 MayExplore more on these topicsMusicVeniceMetalFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So I reached for the closest weapon to hand – my mother’s old porridge-encrusted potPen HadowFri 16 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 11.01 EDTShareI’ve had 35 close encounters with polar bears during my time as an explorer and campaigner for theArcticOcean. There’s always that surge of adrenaline when you see one – that sense of: “Oh God, it’s happening.”I’ve learned how to deal with bears over the years. Although I take a shotgun and special cartridges – they’re to scare them off – I’ve never hit a bear with a bullet. But there was one occasion when the closest thing to hand turned out to be my mother’s saucepan.It was back in 1990 – I was 28, and early in my career. I was on the east coast of Spitsbergen, the largest island of Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago.Svalbard has a high concentration of polar bears in the spring, gathering for the mating season. When a bear is hungry, it essentially becomes a meat-seeking missile – it can smell you from many miles away. If you’re unwashed in a dark tent out on the floating sea ice, you can look (and smell) not unlike an oversized walrus.I’m the world’s heaviest sleeper, but when I’m exploring, my amygdala – the part of the brain that controls fear – goes into overdrive and I sleep very lightly. For three or four nights I’d been waking up repeatedly because I thought I’d heard the dreaded crunch of bear paws in the snow.Getting up to check was an ordeal. Condensation from my breathing and cooking would freeze into a thick coating of ice crystals on the inside of my tent, which would shower down when I brushed against them. If I touched the outside of my sleeping bag with bare fingers for too long I would get frostnip – an early stage of frostbite.The least arduous way to check for a bear was to get up on to my knees while still inside my sleeping bag, unzip the tent and poke my head out of the top to get a 360-degree view. It was cold, awkward and miserable, and, often, there was nothing there.I knew that if I swivelled to get my gun, to scare it off, my salivating visitor could attackOn the day it finally happened, I was finishing breakfast inside the tent. I’d made porridge in my mother’s saucepan, which was one of those heavy old-fashioned ones with a plastic handle. The camping stove was still on, to melt snow for my Thermos flasks – the roaring noise was loud enough to drown out a jumbo jet. When I turned it off, there was initially silence. Then, I heard crunching in the snow.Because of the previous false alarms, I felt quite nonchalant as I unzipped the tent’s entrance. It was a tremendous shock to see a huge, fully grown polar bear facing me, only an arm’s length away. I had a loaded gun in the tent to scare it off, but the gun was behind me and I knew that if I swivelled to get it, my salivating visitor could attack. So my hand instinctively reached for the nearest combat-ready thing I could see – the porridge-encrusted saucepan.Holding the tent flap back, I hit the bear as hard as I could on its head. I clearly remember it wrinkling up its face and tilting its head almost quizzically to one side. I think the noise of the pan startled it as much as the impact – we could both still hear the reverberations. As I wondered whether to hit it again, it wheeled round and cantered off and out of sight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve been in situations where I’ve heard the bear pump-priming itself with oxygen as it prepares to launch itself for the kill – the heavy breathing sounds like a London tube train. That’s when you’ve got to use your firearm to maximum effect – holding your nerve and firing immediately above its head.Most crucially, you need to remember they have more of a right to be there than you. Polar bears are the charismatic megafauna of the Arctic Ocean – and I have now dedicated my life tocampaigning forthe protection of them and their habitat.As a young adventurer I used to feel it was me against my surroundings, but then I realised I could work with nature. Many years later, I would become the first person to complete a solo trek from the tip of Canada to the north pole while pulling all my supplies – a feat that still hasn’t been repeated.There have been times, alone in the Arctic, when I have felt more in tune with the world than anywhere else. It breaks my heart that, because of the rapidly melting sea ice, I have witnessed a wilderness habitat that others may never see.As told to Rachel HalliburtonDo you have an experience to share?

I’ve come to accept that I’m bisexual buthaven’t told anyone.About two years ago my wife found me wearing a pair of her black lace panties, something I do sometimes as it turns me on. Shewas angry and suggested I needed therapy to “understand why you do that”. The comment was humiliating and made me feel ashamed. I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried talking to her about it, but she just saysshe can’t bear to think ofme like that andrefuses todiscuss it. It’s eating me up.Enjoying wearing women’s underwear does not make you bisexual, but perhaps you also have erotic feelings towards both men and women? Either way, it might be helpful for you to discuss your sexual self with a sexuality therapist because you do not deserve to feel ashamed and humiliated.An erotic interest in wearing women’s clothing is relatively common among heterosexual men. Some find it very soothing, and the desire often starts in childhood or during teenage years. But female partners of men who like to cross-dress are often shocked and bewildered when they become aware of this interest – largely based on a lack of understanding and fears about what it means in the context of their relationship.When your wife said you needed to understand why you do this, she really meant thatsheneeded to understand. I hope you can eventually help her with that.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

Finding a balance between what you need for larger gatherings or parties and regular day-to-day use is essential. For example, you may occasionally host a crowd of people, but only three or four will be using it more often than not. Think too about how you like to sit: is upright dining more important, or do you love a good lounge?L-shaped, sofa-style seating makes good use of the space in smaller gardens and urban environments, as does an extendable table with stacking or folding chairs. A chic bistro set also works well and is easy to fold away when it’s not in use. Comfort is important, so consider how long you’re likely to sit down; the ergonomics of a chair will make a difference, whether it’s something upright or more slanted and relaxed. And before you buy anything too bulky, be aware of the space around a table – is there room to pull chairs out properly so no one feels too cramped? To make sure, aim for a minimum of 90cm between the table and surrounding walls, furniture or the edge of decking. This allows for easy access and movement around the table. If you have larger chairs, 125cm will be ideal.Warm weather essentials: 42 ways to make the most of the sunshineRead moreHow to make garden furniture lastIf furniture needs to stay outside, invest in designs that can withstand the changing climate. In the winter, most furniture will benefit from being stored in a garage or shed or under a cover to protect it from frost. Even so, it may get damp, which is where the material you choose can make all the difference. Natural woods such as teak, eucalyptus, acacia and oak are timeless options that will never go out of fashion – they’re beautiful and tactile with a warmth that human-made materials just can’t match. The same goes for rattan, but make sure it’s a decent weight so it doesn’t blow away. Metals, including wrought iron, cast aluminium and powder-coated steel, are long-lasting and low-maintenance, while coloured pieces can add personality to a space. Potentially the most durable of all, synthetic materials such as poly rattan and synthetic wicker (preferably recycled) are weather-resistant, easy to clean and quick to dry, and will be tough enough to withstand being outdoors all year round.Buying vintage and antique garden furnitureVintage garden furniture, if in good condition, is an environmentally sound alternative to buying brand new, and it can also add a certain charm to an outside space.Wrought iron designs with scrollwork or floral designs can be an elegant choice. Look for sets by brands such as Arras and Coalbrookdale. For something sleeker, Tolix Model A chairs, originally designed in 1934 for French cafes, are great.Teak and hardwood pieces are durable and weather beautifully. Look for mid-century teak loungers or beech German folding dining chairs and tables, which are strong, stable and will last for years. Cast aluminium sets, often painted white or green, are lighter than iron and Victorian- or Edwardian-style reproduction sets are widely available.Always check for structural integrity and be realistic about restoration. Make sure there’s no rot or splits, and bear in mind that wobbling legs or rusted-through joints might need expensive repairs. Paint stripping and rust removal can be fun, but it’s also time-consuming.To source vintage pieces, try antique fairs such as Ardingly International Antiques Fair, Newark Antiques Fair and Kempton Park, or architectural salvage yards such as Retrouvius or Lassco. Online, try eBay, Vinterior, Etsy, SalvoWeb and Hampshire-based vintage furniture specialist Merchant & Found.How to clean your garden furnitureCleaning garden furniture regularly is essential to prevent dirt from building up and causing damage. Most designs require little more than a once-over with a soft-bristled brush to remove dust and debris, followed by a wipe down with warm water and a mild soap such as washing-up liquid or a specially formulated garden furniture cleaner. Always avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners or high-pressure washers that can damage coatings and more delicate materials. For stubborn stains, try a paste of white vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, but make sure to test in an inconspicuous area first.Wooden furniture will need treating regularly witha teak oilto protect and maintain its surface, while metal furniture can be given a boost with a fresh coat of paint. First, ensure the surface is clean, then lightly sand and remove any rust before applying a coat of all-surface primer and two coats of exterior gloss or exterior eggshell. Leave to cure for three to five days before using.Claudia Baillie is ajournalist specialising in design and interiors.Although her days are spent writing about high-end and contemporary furniture and spaces, she loves nothing more than a rummage at a charity shop orcar-boot sale.

This nutty citrus cake ticks all of those boxes; it’s also baked in one tin and then cut into strips for layering. I use shop-bought lemon curd to save on time and, instead of making a ganache, I simply fold finely chopped white chocolate into whipped cream.Lemon, pistachio and white chocolate cakePrep10 minCook1 hrServes8-10For the cake100g softened unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing75g pistachios, plus extra, chopped, to finish150gcaster sugar2 tbsp neutral oilFinely grated zest of1 lemon2 large eggs100g plain flour1 tsp baking powder30g ground almonds¼ tsp saltFor the lemon syrup60ml fresh lemon juice60g caster sugarFor the filling100g white chocolate400ml double cream½ tsp vanilla bean paste4 tbsp lemon curdHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and grease and line a 30cm x 20cm swiss roll tin.Grind the pistachios in a food processor until fine. Cream the butter, sugar, oil and lemon zest until pale and creamy, then add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.In a separate bowl, mix the flour, ground pistachios, baking powder, almonds and salt, add this to the butter mix in two batches, and mix in gently. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 20-25 minutes, until nicely browned and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Meanwhile, make a syrup. Put the lemon juice and sugar in a small pan, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for a minute. Take off the heat and leave to coolPrick the surface of the baked cake with a skewer and spoon over the cooled syrup.To make the filling, finely chop the white chocolate. Lightly whip the double cream and vanilla in a bowl to very soft peaks. Take out about a third of the cream and put it in a separate bowl – this will be used for the cake topping. Fold the chopped white chocolate into the remaining cream.To assemble, trim the edges of the cake and cut it widthways into three. Put one strip of cake on a serving platter and spoon or pipe on half the white chocolate cream. Add dollops of lemon curd, then top with the second strip of cake and repeat the toppings. Lay the last layer of cake upside down on top and finish with the reserved cream. Cover with a generous sprinkle of chopped pistachios, then slice and serve.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodDessertFruitBakingNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Luckily, lots of people want a relationship for partly these reasonsRead moreLeading questionsEleanor Gordon-SmithThu 15 May 2025 20.35 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 01.50 EDTShareI’ve come to a moment in my life I never expected; I’m contemplating starting a relationship, not out of love or passion, but out of fear – fear of the future. I always thought I’d be above such reasoning. But witnessing illness up close, seeing the care my father received from his wife and us children, the comfort of not being alone in a hospital bed, shook me more than I was prepared for.It’s a quiet but profound shift inside me. I stopped seeking out companionship a few years ago, deliberately. I did try but none of the few women I dated stirred anything close to love in me. So, as a 55-year-old man, I told myself it just wasn’t worth it: the arguments, the jealousy, the constant need to defend one’s need for solitude – especially for someone like me, deeply introverted by nature.So here I am, caught between a single status that has brought me a decent measure of peace and the quiet realisation that, as the years go by, life will only grow more difficult – if I’m lucky enough to keep living it. I don’t know what to do.Eleanor says:It sounds as though you were quite shaken by the experience of watching your father’s illness. I wonder: why should we be “above” reasoning that comes from that place? What’s base about wanting a relationship in part because you don’t like the look of life without one? “I’d prefer not to be alone in the last chapter in my life.” Why is that more bizarre or embarrassing as a reason for a relationship than “I prefer not to live without physical touch”, or, “I prefer to have someone to chat to in the evenings?” Lots of the reasons we want a relationship boil off to not much liking the look of life without one. Part of that can be that we don’t want to die alone. I don’t think this has to be capitulation, fear or a bad reason for being in a relationship. I think it’s quite a normal and nice thing to want.Shifting into that way of seeing things might even help with a relationship itself.I want to start dating casually. How do I turn off the illogical, hopelessly romantic part of my brain? | Leading questionsRead moreYou say that none of the women you’ve dated stirred love in you. But finding a relationship of the sort you’re talking about – one where you’re committed to each other, you help each other in sickness and in health – that isn’t just about what other people can evoke in you. It’s about whether you can build something together. Of course, your prospective companion has to stirsomethingin you. But that’s not the whole story; it’s not just a matter of walking into a room holding a romantic Geiger counter and seeing what they can produce in you. You also have to be willing to see what you could produce together.Long-term love isn’t just about how well we evaluate the other person. It’s also about deciding to love and care for each other no matter what. Like the way you and your siblings cared for your dad – you didn’t first look for the best dad, then care for him because of how well he performed on the search. It’s in part because of what you’ve built and shared together that you loved him enough to do that, and so too for his wife. I think evaluation and commitment are constantly passing the baton back and forth in this kind of lifelong, care-by-the-bedside love; I’m committed to be here because you’re the best I can imagine and part of why you’re the best I can imagine is that I’ve committed to be here.All that to say, I think love is partly what another person produces in you and partly what you build together. As a friend of mine is fond of saying: wanting a wife is not the same as wanting to be a husband.I don’t think you have to look upon this new desire askance, or even as a peculiar response to fear. It’s possible it’s just a new preference – one you’ve developed in light of the emotional experience you’ve just had. Luckily, lots of other people want a relationship for partly these reasons – and lots of other people may be open to seeing what they could build with you.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleAgeingDatingMarriageFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the most recent Lyst index, which tracks digital engagement to assess which names are leading the fashion conversation, Gucci fell five places to No 17, an ignominious decline for a proud Italian brand. After the abrupt departure of the designer Sabato De Sarno, let go just two weeks before Milan fashion week in February, the house awaits the arrival of its buzzy new hire Demna, who will leave his post at Balenciaga this summer and present his first Gucci collection later this year.An outdoor event is a risky move, and a thunderstorm hours before had the top brass jittery. But when the sun came out for a perfect Tuscan golden hour, it felt like the luck of Gucci, unable to catch a break for the past two years, might have turned. The design team had produced an upbeat parade of Gucci’s greatest hits.Jewel-coloured brocade mini-shift dresses, kaftans slashed to the navel and lush faux-fur chubbies leant into the charismatic jet-set 1960s glamour that is foundational to Gucci – think Elizabeth Taylor filming Cleopatra in Rome, or Jackie Onassis on holiday in Capri – while jodhpur silhouettes nodded to the equestrian heritage of the home of the horsebit loafer.There were forward-facing hat tips to the tastes of the incoming boss, in exaggerated quarterback shoulders and oversized coats, looks that Demna has made his signature during his decade at Balenciaga. And in the meantime, there was an astute sprinkling of easy-sell accessories: belts with double and single G hardware, oversized sunglasses and eyecatching painted shell jewellery.View image in fullscreenA model presents a piece from Gucci’s 2026 cruise collection in Piazza Santo Spirito in Florence.Photograph: Claudio Giovannini/EPAFlorence, where Guccio Gucci founded his brand in 1921, was a tactical retreat to home turf, but Gucci will not be licking its wounds for long. Demna – an acclaimed but controversial Marmite appointment – is a punchy throw of the dice that aims at getting Gucci back on the front foot as a fashion leader. Owners Kering know that Gucci’s best eras have been its most audacious: the 1990s, when Tom Ford reinvented its old-timey affluence into a sexualised sophistication that made shoppers all over the world go weak at the knees, and a decade ago when Alessandro Michele’s exuberant and radical gender-fluid, vintage-curious, humour-led aesthetic made the brand meaningful for a new generation.Demna, who uses only his first name professionally, likes to ruffle feathers. He once replaced a Paris catwalk show with a specially made episode of The Simpsons, and caused outrage selling pre-scuffed dirty trainers for £400 and a premium leather take on Ikea’s famous blue Frakta shopping tote for £1,600.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s how to tend the tricky crop in your veg patchThis handsome plant will enhance your curries, soups and salads – as long as  you can get it to thriveClaire RatinonFri 16 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 06.04 EDTShareBulb fennel – AKA Florence fennel – is notoriously challenging to grow. Its aniseed taste isn’t for everyone, but it’s a crop I’m chuffed to see thrive under my care, given how many times I’ve failed with it in the past. It’s a handsome plant that’s edible from top to toe, and if the plump bulbs you’d hope for don’t materialise, you can leave them to develop flowers as an offering to the hoverflies.Bulb fennel is best sown in situ, as it’s one of the many umbellifers that develops a taproot as it grows, so has little tolerance for having its root system disturbed. That said, its seeds can be sown into trays, but you’ll need to use one with large modules, making sure to sow only one seed per module. If you transplant them as soon as they can be handled (ideally having developed a few strong leaves) and are extra gentle when putting your seedlings into the ground, with any luck, they’ll take to their new home without issue. While bulb fennel can be sown earlier (from April onwards), those sown now are less prone to bolting (flowering prematurely, stymying bulb formation).Leaf fennel is a far easier plant to grow. As a perennial, it will produce edible leaves year after yearBulb fennel needs fertile, well-draining soil (they won’t grow well into heavy clay) in a warm, sunny spot. Keeping your plants well watered is key to ensuring your fennel doesn’t bolt and that the base swells into bulb. Mulching with compost will help the soil retain that and keep weeds to a minimum, as competition from other plants can cause the stress that leads to bolting.It should take around three months or so for your fennel to mature, but if you suspect your plants might bolt, you can harvest them earlier. Gather by cutting them at the base with secateurs. Leaving the roots in the ground invites the possibility of a second flush of (smaller) growth and a bonus harvest.If you’ve suffered too many seasons of bulb fennel failures, a far easier type to grow is leaf fennel. It can be started as described above, but as it is perennial, the plant will return year after year producing plenty of edible leaves (though no bulbs, sadly). Give leaf fennel plenty of space (at least 30cm apart) as they can be large when fully developed. They also self-seed fairly readily, so be prepared to pull up any seedlings that pop up in spaces destined for other crops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The seeds that appear after these flowers have faded can be left to dry then gathered for use in curries and soups, and to infuse the brine for pickling cucumbers, carrots or beetroots. My favourite way to eat fennel – whether it’s a bulb sliced thinly or the leaves chopped finely – is mixed into a dressed salad with orange pieces and toasted pumpkin seeds.Explore more on these topicsGardening advicePlantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nearly two decades later, on Wednesday, heposed for a photo with the US president Donald Trumpin Riyadh after discussing normalising ties with Israel and granting US access to Syrian oil.The transformation of Sharaa over the last 20 years from al-Qaida fighter to thepresident of Syria, sharing the world’s stage with foreign leaders like Trump, is staggering. For Syrians, the pace of change has been whiplash-inducing.In just six months after the toppling of former presidentBashar al-Assad, Syria has gone from a global pariah under some of the world’s most intense sanctions regimes to a country of promise. On Tuesday, Trump announced he would end all US sanctions on Syria, a move he said “gives them a chance at greatness”.InSyria, a weary country is finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Eyes were glued to television screens which replayed video of Sharaa meeting Trump and hands gesticulated fervently as debates over the sanctions ending raged throughout the country.View image in fullscreenSyrians watch a speech by President Ahmed al-Sharaa in a cafe, after Trump’s decision to lift sanctions on Syria.Photograph: Ahmad Fallaha/EPA“You need to wait a bit, there are steps that need to be taken by the experts,” an elderly man cautioned his peer, pausing for breath as they struggled to cycle up the narrow streets of old Damascus. Their slow ascent on rickety-framed bicycles is a common sight in Damascus, where cars and fuel have become increasingly out of reach for much of the country’s war-battered, sanctions-laden population.Trump’s sudden announcement exceeded even the most optimistic of Syrians’ expectations. The US state department had been engaged in months of diplomacy with the new government, haggling over a set of conditions which would lead towards sanctions relief.In typical Trump style, conditions were thrown aside in favour of a sudden, bold announcement that “all sanctions” would stop. The image of Trump shaking hands with Sharaa cemented what seemed inconceivable just days before: Syria was turning a page in its history.But experts have stressed that removing sanctions is complicated and that it will be a while before ordinary Syrians feel the effects of sanctions relief.“The immediate impact is a good one. A lot of the regional investors that were eyeing the Syrian economy will be encouraged to move in. But big investors will take a bit more time,” said Sinan Hatahet, the vice-president for investment and social impact at the Syrian Forum.He estimated that it could take from six months to up to a year for Syrians to feel a difference in their standard of living.View image in fullscreenSharaa shakes hands with Donald Trump in Riyadh after the meeting brokered by Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Saudi Royal Palace/APSyria has been under some form of US sanctions since 1979, but it was after the former Syrian president al-Assad started violently suppressing peaceful protests in 2011 that the US created a virtual economic embargo against the country.Starting with Obama, the US built a multi-layered web of sanctions on Syria through a mixture of executive orders and congressional legislation. Among the harshest of the sanctions was the 2019 Caesar Act, renewed in late December, which imposed sanctions on not only the Syrian government but also anyone who did business with it.Trump can wave away sanctions imposed via executive order, but would need a congressional vote to repeal the Caesar Act, which is set to expire in 2029. Here, there could be a stumbling block. There are deep reservations about Sharaa – who had a $10m bounty on his head until December – in Washington.Even among certain members of the Trump administration, particularly those in the evangelical wing, there are concerns over the Islamist government in Damascus.View image in fullscreenThere are still deep reservations about Sharaa – who had a $10m bounty on his head – in Washington, as late as December.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersThese fears were only redoubled in late March after an attack by pro-Assad fighters led to awave of retaliatory killings of nearly 900 civilians, mostly Alawite, on Syria’s coast. Rights groups said that pro-government fighters were responsible for many of those civilian deaths.Nonetheless, the image of Trump standing side by side with Sharaa marked a milestone for the new Syrian government, which viewed a meeting with the US president as a gateway to international legitimacy. The 37-minute meeting was the culmination of months of diplomacy by Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which have emerged as key pillars of support for the nascent government in Damascus.The nod from the US also came despite Israel’s strong rejection of Sharaa and his government in Damascus. Israel has refused to allow the new Syrian government to deploy its army in south Syria and has conducted hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian territory since the fall of Assad in December. Sharaa, by contrast, has said he does not want conflict with Israel.“I think Trump was having his doubts about the Israeli policy to put a freeze on Sharaa and keep Syria disunited and weak, which is what the Israelis were pitching to everyone in Washington,” said James Jeffrey, who was the Syria envoy in Trump’s first administration.Jeffrey pointed to a lack of Israeli airstrikes in Syria in the last 10 days as evidence that even within the Israeli establishment concerns were beginning to emerge about Israel’s aggressive posture towards Syria.The apparent easing of hostilities, even if brief, has helped feed a cautious but growing optimism in Syria, as the country’s economic and international isolation seemed to be coming to an end after nearly 14 years of war.“Finally, we are taking a step forward. Now my kids have a future, maybe they will have some chance to succeed,” said Maher Nahas, a 42-year-old jeweller and father of two who lives in Damascus.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpBashar al-AssadUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But its debut came after a series a setbacks.The arena was originally due to open in April 2024, but was besieged by technical issues.Shows were cancelled or postponed, sometimes at very short notice – fans were already queueing outside when a concert had to be axed after part of the arena’s ventilation system fell to the floor.“I spent two months here, during what we call the glory days,” said Tim Leiweke, the chief executive of Oak View Group, the company behind the arena.“I tried to get it open and get through all of our problems.“So many people that worked on this project, I think, went through such a difficult time, and mentally and physically it’s probably one of the most challenging projects I’ve ever seen, and the toll that it took on people was pretty amazing.”He was one of the thousands in the audience on Wednesday night for Springsteen’s gig, and he later said it was a moment for “those same people … to understand that last night, that crowd, that artist, that band, that energy, is what we always dreamed that this building would be.Bruce Springsteen says Trump is running ‘rogue government’ and ‘siding with dictators’Read more“I think it was an amazing moment for them to understand that our vision had come full circle.”Even before the technical problems that blighted the arena’s opening, Leiweke said people had doubted his vision when he picked Manchester as the place where he would build his eighth arena.Located at Manchester City’s Etihad Campus, the 23,500-capacity arena was born out of a collaboration between the commercial real estate company, the football club, the Co-op, and singer Harry Styles, who grew up in nearby Cheshire.“I’ve always been amazed that folks worldwide, and especially in the UK, tend to overlook Manchester a bit,” Leiweke said. “I think it’s one of the great cities in the world, and so we saw this opportunity, and most people thought we were nuts.”This week, an economic impact report, produced independently by planning consultancy Lichfields, revealed that the arena has generated more than £1.3bn in gross economic output, with a £456m investment during the construction phase and £852.2m in total turnover during its first year of operation.The report also found that in its first year, the arena supported more than 16,500 jobs and engaged more than 400 business suppliers, totalling £33.5m in supply chain expenditure.Describing himself as a “pretty positive, optimistic person”, Leiweke said he never lost faith that Co-op Live would be a success.“This does not surprise us at all,” he said. “We knew this was one of the great markets in the world for music and live entertainment, and so I’m proud of Manchester.“I’m happy for Manchester. They deserve this. Proud of the economic impact and proud of the bet we made. I’m really proud that we proved people wrong.”The support of the mayor of Greater Manchester,Andy Burnham, and the city council had also helped in bringing big events to the city, Leiweke said.“We have more big events coming,” he added. “I think we’re gonna surprise some people here in the next few weeks with some announcements.“This is a wonderful city, and so I’m not at all surprised that we are achieving these kinds of heights. And I’m going to shock you, I think we’re just getting started.”Explore more on these topicsNorth of EnglandManchester CityEnglandMusic industryBruce SpringsteenAndy BurnhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Forty-six years later, he speaks almost no English. He reads Chinese newspapers and watches Chinese television stations. Every four years he screams “Jia you!” (“Go for it!”) at Chinese athletes competing in the Olympics.From the sitting room of a council house in Thamesmead, the family started a food business that now employs 18 people, including three of the eight children. The other kids went to grammar school and became lawyers, accountants, bankers and pharmaceutical reps. My father-in-law votes Conservative. He reveres Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister who (reluctantly, as it turned out) agreed to take in his family and 10,000 other boat people. He eats roast beef at our house on a Sunday (albeit with chopsticks, and chilli sauce instead of horseradish).I’m from Limerick, Ireland. I came to the UK to work for a big law firm. I wasn’t rescued by the merchant navy from a sinking ship in the South China Sea as they were. My emigrant story is very different. I’ll always be Irish, but the UK is my home, just as it is my father-in-law’s.He hasn’t lived in China for 70 years, but he’s still Chinese. He’s also British, and a Londoner. Nationhood and nationality are complicated. My children feel British, English, Irish, Vietnamese and Chinese. What it means to be “British”, “American” or “Irish” isn’t calcified. It constantly evolves. Immigration doesn’t lead to an “island of strangers”, rather to a diverse, modern nation. The UK shapes immigrants, and in turn this country is shaped by immigrants and their descendants.We don’t need to make this country great again. We do need to remember what makes Britain great.Ian LynamLondonI listened to Sir Keir Starmer’s speech on new immigration rules. Never did I think I would hear a Labour prime minister signing up to the racist trope that it is immigration that brings pressure on housing, health and other public services – particularly when workers from foreign countries, most of them highly skilled, are the backbone of those services, due to the failings of previous governments of all colours, in education and capacity-building.I look forward to the huge government investment in social care to enable appropriate pay and conditions for care workers of either British or overseas nationality. I for one volunteer to pay higher levels of tax to raise the money. I am also anticipating the private sector investment in career structure and better further and higher education for those workers.I remain sceptical about how many MPs from any party will be advising and encouraging their own children to go into adult social care, care work and the care sector, as managers or frontline workers.Meanwhile, I pay tribute to the British, Polish and Filipino carers who helped me and my family look after my parents in their frail old age, at home and in residential care. A diverse and brilliant workforce.Dame Stella ManzieLeicesterKeir Starmer’s speech on his supposed plan to reduce net migration was egregious in many parts, but what is the most jarring to me is his claim about the risks of the UK turning into an “island of strangers”.Just a week before, my wife and I heard that some neighbours in our town were organising a “street party” for VE Day. Given that both of us are immigrants who relocated to the UK recently, we’ve never experienced a street party before, apart from what we saw on TV and news footage, so we decided to check it out, despite not knowing anyone in that neighbourhood. I was a bit apprehensive about turning up uninvited, but we were immediately welcomed and introduced to everyone at the party. We went from strangers to being neighbours in just a matter of minutes.On our way back, my wife and I couldn’t help but reflect that in the home we lived in before moving to the UK, we didn’t even know the name of people who lived next door to us for years. So it was rather bemusing, to say the least, to see the prime minister on the TV a week later warning the citizens of this country that immigrants like us are turning their home into an “island of strangers”.Tony ChaChristchurch, DorsetIn his immigration speech, Sir Keir Starmer warned of an “island of strangers” and “forces that pull our country apart”. True to form, his stance leans only slightly left of his main rivals. But he does have a point – just not the one he thinks he’s making.Anthropology and evolutionary psychology suggest our brains evolved for close communities.Robin Dunbar calculatedthat we can maintain meaningful relationships with about 150 people and recognise up to 1,500. In modern cities, that means most of our neighbours will inevitably be strangers. This feels unsettling – not because of immigration, but because of how we’re wired.What we need to feel at home isn’t tighter immigration controls, but stronger communities: local events, shared spaces and more opportunities for connection.To stop “the forces that pull us apart”, we don’t need divisive “them and us” rhetoric. We need action that brings us together – friendship in diversity. And if we truly want highly qualified British people contributing to the economy, why make it harder for those already doing so to become British? Is that a fair rule – or just a good soundbite?Rudiger PittrofRetired NHS consultant,LondonIntegration is not something that happens under the cosh. It is an organic process that inevitably takes time and needs favourable conditions in which to thrive. It requires goodwill and genuine motivation to flourish. And it will not happen when one side is fearful and the other hostile.Keir Starmer is fanning the flames of confrontation. Does he have any idea of the terror and apprehension these remarks will engender in our immigrant population? If his motivation is to outdo Nigel Farage, he is doomed to failure and one term in office.Shirley OsbornKibworth Harcourt, LeicestershireMy wife is an immigrant. She also set up and runs a volunteer group in my local park, bringing together people of all ages and backgrounds. In addition, she volunteers for several charities, has chaired the school’s parent-teacher association, and knows more people in our community than I ever will. Suggesting that immigration will make us an “island of strangers” is as misguided as it is offensive. If Keir Starmer is trying to test how far he can push Labour’s supporters before we can no longer vote for him, then I think he’s just found out.Jon CollinsMitcham, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The crux of the problem is that obesity is incredibly complex. It’s influenced by people’s local environments and their socioeconomic circumstances, alongside genetics.Increases in obesity have largely emerged over the past century, coinciding with major environmental changes, particularly since the 1980s. We see this when observing successive generations taking part in theUK’s birth cohorts. Early in the 20th century, childhood obesity was largely nonexistent, but forcohorts born after the 1980s, the likelihood of being overweight or obese at age 10 was two to three times higher than those born before. Similar patterns are seen in adults – the later in the 20th century you were born, the more likely you were to become overweight, and at younger ages.This sits in a wider trend called the “generational health drift”, which sees higher prevalence of chronic health conditions at earlier ages among younger generations. This points to the role of people’s local environments and socioeconomic circumstances, rather than being the fault of individuals.As Williams rightly points out, environmental forces have the biggest impact on low-income households. Recent developments in weight-loss medication shows great promise, but only if they stay affordable for everyone.Crucially, there remains a need to address the social, economic and environmental factors driving obesity through bold public health and anti-poverty policies.Dr Charis Bridger StaatzSenior research fellow,UCL Centre for Longitudinal StudiesHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It adds absolutely nothing to the sport, and only creates frustrations and endless video assistant referee (VAR) delays. While on the subject of law changes in professional football, why stop the match to make a substitution (with the exception of goalkeepers)? There is a fourth official controlling the change who can ensure that the substitute does not enter the field of play until the player being replaced has left it. Both these changes would improve the sport no end.Paul GregsonBarcelona, SpainIn race walking, the rule for referees is that the infringement has to be visible to the human eye.

However,a recently declassified memoshowed US intelligence agencies rejected a key claim the administration made to justify invoking the wartime law – that Venezuela’s government was orchestrating the gang’s operations.The supreme court case stems from a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Texas, challenging Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. At issue is whether people must have the opportunity to contest their removal from the United States, without determining whether Trump’s invocation of the law was appropriate.“We recognize the significance of the government’s national security interests as well as the necessity that such interests be pursued in a manner consistent with the constitution,” the justices said in an unsigned opinion.In a statement, Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel, said: “The court’s decision to stay removals is a powerful rebuke to the government’s attempt to hurry people away to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador. The use of a wartime authority during peacetime, without even affording due process, raises issues of profound importance.”At least three federal judges have said Trump was improperly using the AEA to speed deportations of people the administration says are Venezuelan gang members.On Tuesday, a judge in Pennsylvania signed off on the use of the law.The court-by-court approach to deportations under the AEA flows from another supreme court order that took a case away from a judge in Washington DC and ruled detainees seeking to challenge their deportations must do so where they are held.The justices said in April that people must be given “reasonable time” to file a challenge.The court has rejected the 12 hours the administration has said would be sufficient, but has not otherwise spelled out how long it meant.The US district judge Stephanie Haines ordered immigration officials to give people 21 days in her opinion in which she otherwise said deportations could legally take place under the AEA.In its opinion, the supreme court pointed to the case ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident the administration admitted itwrongly deportedto a notorious prison in El Salvador as a result of an “administrative error”. The president and other high-ranking administration officials have repeatedly said Ábrego García would never be allowed back in the US, despite a supreme court order instructing the government to “facilitate” his return.Venezuelans deported by Trump are victims of ‘torture’, lawyers allegeRead moreHighlighting the administration’s argument that it was “unable to provide for the return of an individual deported in error to a prison in El Salvador”, the court concluded that the “detainees’ interests at stake are accordingly particularly weighty”.“Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process right to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster,” the justices wrote.However, the court also made clear that it was not blocking other ways the government may deport people.The decision comes one day after the courtappeared troubledby an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office that seeks to endbirthright citizenship, which contradictsprecedentupholding the plain text of the 14th amendment as granting citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States”.Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtUS immigrationTrump administrationVenezuelaUS politicsAmericasLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Fara aims to promote transparency by requiring those working as foreign agents to disclose their activities and compensation.“Under Trump, we’ve seen a more directly transactional approach to influencing government,” said Jake Johnston, director of international policy at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research (Cepr). “The very personal relationships that have developed with the far right in Latin America have given direct access to the White House. I wouldn’t say this influence peddling is unprecedented, but the magnitude is.”El Salvador’s president,Nayib Bukele, has arguably seen the greatest return to his three-year, $1.5m lobbyingspree. Since February, Bukele has scored an Oval Officemeetingwith Trump, a nuclear energydeal, USassuranceto help expand his country’s notorious mega-prison and an upgraded travel safetyratingfrom the state department.Bukele-mania: El Salvador strongman’s crime clampdown excites regional rightRead moreA lucrativecontractwith Mercury public affairs may have helped the Ecuadorian president, Daniel Noboa,securehis sought-after photo op with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, winapprovalfor increased arms shipments to tackle a devolving security situation, and rack up a positive US intelligenceassessmentabout his candidacy just days beforewinninga presidential runoffmarredby irregularities.Argentina’s Javier Milei has taken a somewhat different route to becoming Trump’s “favorite president”, spending tens of thousands todinewith Trump at Mar-a-Lago andappearing alongside Elon Muskat February’s conservative CPAC conference in Washington, easing the path toward a $20bn, US-backed IMFdealand avisitto Buenos Aires from the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, with expectations of an Oval Officevisitand a tradedealcoming soon.FromPanamatoGuyana,HondurastoHaiti, theDominican RepublictoColombia(and Venezuela’s opposition,too), leaders across the hemisphere are playing Trump’s uniquely transactionalgameto provide cover for controversial policies, position themselves electorally, and curry favor with top lawmakers and officials running policy for the next four years toward their often-overlooked countries.Key among these efforts is the Argentinian American Damian Merlo of the Miami-based Latin America advisory group, who renewed his $75,000-a-monthcontractwith Bukele for another year last June and previouslylobbiedfor Argentina’s then-candidate Milei.After winning Argentina’s December 2023 election, MileidroppedMerlo, a veteran Republican insider, to smooth things over with the Biden administration. Since then, Milei’s contact with the Trump world has only grown stronger,facilitatedby the US and Argentinian operators atTactic Global, a strategic advisoryfirmwhich helped organize the CPAC Argentina conference last December and recentlyhostedParaguay’s president, Santiago Peña, and Ecuador’s ambassador to the US at a Los Angeles reception with top Trump officials.Merlo, afixturein Trump circles whostoodbehind Bukele in the Oval Office alongside members of the Salvadorian president’s “Venezuelan shadow cabinet,” previously worked for five years as vice-president of the lobbying firm run by Otto Reich, a longtime Republican official focused on Latin America.Reich, a Cuban American,introducedanother Cuban-American lobbyist, Mauricio Claver-Carone, to Trump’s then-national security adviser, John Bolton, who brought the latter on to become the top official for Latin America policy at the national security council in 2018.Claver-Carone, who for more than a decade through the US-Cuba Democracy political action committee helpedfunnelmillions of dollars to legislators on both sides of the aisle to block increasing calls for engagement with Cuba, isnowTrump’s special envoy to Latin America, working side by side with his longtimeally, secretary of state, Marco Rubio.Sitting behind Rubio at his Senate confirmation hearing in January was anotherTrump-connectedLatin America lobbyist, retired Cuban-American ambassador Carlos Trujillo, who was widelyrumoredto be tapped for a high-level post in the new administration.Trujillo, who served as Trump’s ambassador to the Washington-based Organization of American States (OAS) and was later nominated but not confirmed to be assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, has recently taken on the Caribbean nations ofHaiti,Guyanaand theDominican Republicas his clients at Continental Strategy LLC,coincidingwith Rubio’s trips to the region.Trujillo’s firm, whichnetted$3.6m in the first quarter of 2025 and added 50 new clients since Trump’s victory, also employs the White House chief of staff Susie Wiles’s daughter, Katie, and Rubio’s former chief of staff in the Senate, Alberto Martinez.Continental was reportedlykeyto brokering the $23bn deal for a BlackRock-led consortium that included itsclientMediterranean Shipping Company to wrest control from China of strategic ports in Panama and around the globe, which Trump hailed as a step toward “reclaiming” the Panama canal, a top priority for his administration.Panama’s government, like that ofColombiaandHonduras, has retained a more ideologically mixed group of lobbyists to preserve historically bipartisan support in Congress for their foreign policy objectives, includingrestrainingthe US military presence in the Panama Canal Zone,maintainingtrade preferences for Colombian exports andstrengtheningUS-Honduran cooperation on immigration and security.To those ends, Panamahiredthe Democratic strategist Manuel Ortiz, together with the longtime TrumpallyDavid Urban, in January as part of $2.5mdealwith BGR Group, while a month before Trump’s election Colombia extended a $60,000-a-monthagreementwith Squire, Patton and Boggs, tapping a former Obama administration trade official (who has sincedeparted) and the deputy chief of staff to former Republican House speaker John Boehner.Honduras, for its part,extendeda $90,000-a-month contract with the former US ambassador to the country, Hugo Llorens, along with a state department veteran who worked in the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, Tom Shannon, as part of adealwith the lobbying giant Arnold and Porter.Latin America is by no means the region of the world whose leaders spend the most lobbying US officials, nor is it uncommon under a new US administration, Democratic or Republican, for foreign governments to seek access to freshly nominated political appointees and elected lawmakers.Yet for a region analysts say will beprioritizedunder the current administration – but has historically spentlittleto ensure that is the case – Latin America is increasing its lobbying to ensure its seat at the table, in turn becoming a prominent player in Washington’s vast foreign influence web.“Given Florida’s general involvement in this administration, specifically in foreign policy, and the state’s centrality to Latin American politics, that combines to create greater relevance and attention to the region than we’ve seen before,” said Johnston. “Now that some of these folks are in government or have direct access to government, Latin American leaders will certainly find more fertile breeding ground to pursue their interests.”Explore more on these topicsAmericasTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Since its publication in June 1972, it has been officially attributed to Nick Ut, a Vietnamese photographer working with the Associated Press in Saigon.‘Uncomfortable truths’: controversial film challenges authorship of famous photoRead moreThe AP and Ut have long maintained that Ut, then 21 years old, took the photo, which went on to win the World Press Photo of the Year award in 1973 and established Ut as a venerable photojournalist.But a recent documentary challenged that history, instead proposing that the photo, which depicts a naked nine-year-old girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc as she flees a napalm attack in the South Vietnamese village of Trảng Bàng, was taken by a man named Nguyen Thành Nghe.The Stringer, which premiered at the Sundance film festival in January, claimed that Nghe, a stringer for NBC who was driving that day and who often sold photos to the AP on a freelance basis, was denied credit in favor of Ut because he was not AP staff.The film prompted “deep reflection” at World Press Photo, which conducted its own investigation, the results of which were made public on Friday 16 May. The in-house analysis, conducted between January and May 2025, concluded “based on analysis of location, distance, and the camera used on that day” that “photographers Nguyễn Thành Nghệ or Huỳnh Công Phúc may have been better positioned to take the photograph than Nick Út.”The suspension only applies to the photo’s authorship, and does not rescind the 1973 Photo of the Year award. “The photograph itself remains undisputed,” the group said, “and the World Press Photo award for this significant photo of a major moment in 20th century history remains a fact.”View image in fullscreenNick Ut, centerPhotograph: Gregorio Borgia/AP“Based on these findings and according to our values of accuracy, trustworthiness and diversity, we draw conclusions with regards to attribution,” Joumana El Zein Khoury, the group’s executive director, said in a press release. “It is important to state that the picture itself is undisputed and it is without question that this photograph represents a real moment in history that continues to reverberate in Vietnam, the United States, and globally.”Earlier this month, the Associated Pressannouncedthat it found “no definitive evidence” to warrant changing the photo’s authorship, and released a96-page reporton the matter – itssecond in four months– based on its own internal investigation. The AP concluded that it was “possible” Ut took the photo, and found no evidence that Nguyen took it instead. The matter was unable to be proven conclusively, it added, due to the passage of time, the absence of key evidence, the limitations of technology and the deaths of several key people involved.“We left nothing uncovered that we’re aware of and we’ve done it with a great deal of respect to everybody involved,” said Derl McCrudden, an AP vice-president of global news production, in a statement. “It makes no difference to us if we changed the credit, but it has to be based on facts and evidence. And there is no definitive evidence proving that Nick Ut did not take this picture.”The Stringer, directed by Bao Nguyen, enlisted several witnesses to argue that Nghe sold the photo to the Saigon bureau photo chief, Horst Faas, for $20 and a print, including Nghe’s brother, who claims he brought the film to the AP; Nghe’s daughter Jannie; Carl Robinson, a longtime AP photo editor in Saigon who first contacted the film-makers; and several of Robinson’s former photojournalist colleagues. The investigators also consulted forensic experts with the French NGOIndex, who found it “highly unlikely” that Ut took the photo based on the other images AP credited to him that day.The AP conducted its own forensic investigation involving further interviews, the examination of cameras and surviving negatives from that day, and a 3D model of the scene. The resulting report revealed “inconsistencies on both sides” but concluded that buying Nghe’s story would “require several leaps of faith”, such as believing that the only time he sold photos to a western news agency, it turned out to be one of the most famous images of the 20th century.Nghe, who made a surprise appearance at the Stringer’s Sundance premiere, confirms his account in the film. Ut, meanwhile, continues to maintain his authorship, and told the AP that the dispute “has been very difficult for me and has caused great pain”.But for World Press Photo, the official author is now: unknown. “This remains contested history, and it is possible that the author of the photograph will never be fully confirmed,” the group said. “The suspension of the authorship attribution stands unless it is proved otherwise.”This article was amended on 16 May 2025. An earlier version described Nguyen Thành Nghe in 1972 as a “driver for NBC”; he was a stringer for NBC and a freelance photographer who was driving Nick Ut on the day the photo of Phan Thi Kim Phuc was taken.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyVietnamArtVietnam warAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Such events have become more frequent and intense due to climate change, causing widespread damage to ecosystems and fish communitiesIn May, a 3-metre-long white shark died on Adelaide’s Henley Beach, after locals found it struggling in shallow water. It was thefourth reported white sharkstranding, with others found at Port Willunga, Ardrossan and Aldinga.Charlie Huveneers, a professor at Flinders University and expert in shark ecology and their interactions with humans, said it was likely that the unusually high number of shark observations and stranding events was connected to biotoxins from the recent algal bloom.‘My heart’s pounding’: Australians wade into ocean to save great white shark stranded in shallow waterRead more“We will only be able to confirm this and understand which toxin might have led to these strandings once toxicology results come back,” he said.But Huveneers warned that while it might be tempting to try to link increased activity to the risk of shark bites, tracking data showed white sharks occurred along the metropolitan coast throughout the year, regardless of algal blooms.South Australia’s Department of Primary Industries said while it was examining sharks and other marine life affected by the algal bloom, there was “no scientific evidence before the government to indicate that the algal bloom might make a shark attack more likely”.“Shark encounters have always been a small but real risk for anyone entering the ocean anywhere in the world,” a spokesperson for the department said.View image in fullscreenSouth Australia’s Department of Primary Industries says it is examining sharks and other marine life, including leafy seahorses, affected by the algal bloom.Photograph: D. Brown“It is not uncommon for white sharks to utilise coastal waters in search of food, in particular juvenile and sub-adult white sharks who are primarily fish eaters.

There was still fear, but also concern for the animal.“Even before it washed up – it was sort of in the shallows – we saw lots of the general population trying to help a species that, a lot of the time, people don’t necessarily like.”The shark bite on Thursday followed a fatal shark incident in January on the state’s west coast. While such incidents were “absolutely horrible”, Le Busque said, the number that have occurred in 2025 was currentlyaligned to the annual average.Explore more on these topicsSharksAustralian climate and environment in focusAnimalsMarine lifeOceansnewsShareReuse this content"

While Khan is on leave, the court’s deputy prosecutors will be in charge of managing the prosecutor’s office, the statement said.Khan, a British lawyer, has faced a backlash from many of his staff in recent months over his decision to resist calls from some of his most senior staff to take a leave of absence until the investigation is resolved.In an email to staff seen by the Guardian, Khan said: “In light of escalating media reports, I have made the considered decision to take leave until the completion of the investigation.” He said his two deputy prosecutors would take over his responsibilities.ICC sources said Khan’s decision followed renewed pressure earlier this week from senior court officials who urged him to step aside after new details of the allegations were published in the media over the weekend.Investigators from the UN watchdog conducting the investigation are understood to have met Khan for the first time last week, interviewing him over two days.The inquiry was announced in November after allegations emerged about his treatment of a woman who worked for him.The Guardian reportedthat the allegations include unwanted sexual touching and “abuse” over an extended period, as well as coercive behaviour and abuse of authority.Lawyers for Khan, 55, have previously said that he “denies the whole of the allegations” and said he would cooperate with the inquiry.The investigation, which is being conducted by the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), will send its report to the president of the court’s governing body to review its conclusions.According to sources familiar with the inquiry’s terms of reference, it is also examining claims that Khan engaged in witness intimidation and retaliation against members of his staff.Khan was elected in 2021 to serve a nine-year term as chief prosecutor of the permanent court of last resort, which investigates and prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.In a statement, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) said it welcomed Khan’s decision, describing it as “essential to protect the integrity of the court, ensure investigations continue without interference, and begin to rebuild the trust of victims, staff and the public”.“This was the only responsible decision. No one is above accountability — not even the prosecutor of the ICC,” it added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month,the Guardian reportedthat Khan was preparing new applications for Israeli suspects in connection to alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.It is not clear how long Khan will be absent from the court. The OIOS investigation, now in its sixth month, has interviewed several court staff in addition to Khan and the alleged victim.If Khan is found to have committed “serious misconduct” or a serious breach of his duties, he will face a secret ballot in which the ICC’s 125 member states will vote on whether to remove him from office.Do you have information about this story?

But, the company added, it “did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces”.Fortnite’s exile from theiPhoneapp store is the latest twist in a years-long feud between Apple and Epic. Back in 2020, the video game maker filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in the US, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers.After a month-long trial in 2021, district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogersruledagainst most of Epic’s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the US for the first time – threatening to undercut sizeable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for more than a decade.After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the US supreme court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moscow rejected this, appearing to stick to its maximalist demands, including sweeping restrictions on Ukrainian sovereignty.Images from the meeting, held at the Dolmabahce Palace, were stark: a row of Russian delegates in dark suits sitting opposite Ukrainians wearing their trademark green camouflage combat fatigues.View image in fullscreenThe Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan (C), chairs a meeting between delegations from Russia (R) and Ukraine at Dolmabahce palace in Istanbul.Photograph: Murat Gok/APThe only tangible result of the talks, which lasted less than two hours, was that the two sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, the largest prisoner swap of the conflict.While the meeting appeared to achieve little toward ending the conflict, it represents a symbolic win for Putin, who refused to accept the 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine and its European allies had demanded as a prerequisite for talks.The Russian leader has been engaged in a delicate balancing act with the US president, appearing to support peace talks to stay in Trump’s favour, while pushing for terms that in effect amount to Ukraine’s capitulation.The outcome is likely to be seen as a setback for Zelenskyy, coming after his bold gamble ofchallenging Putin to a direct meetingin the hope of winning favour with Washington and exposing what Ukraine describes as the Russian leader’s hollow promises to end the war.Vladimir Medinsky, the ultra-conservative head of Russia’s delegation, said Moscow was satisfied with the results and was prepared to keep talking to Kyiv.Both sides said they discussed organising a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, who have met only once, in 2019.The stalemate appears to pave the way for a US-Russia summit, after Trump undercut the talks on Thursday by saying that “nothing is going to happen” until he meets Putin personally. On Friday, the US president, who had grown increasingly impatient with the slow pace of negotiations, said he would meet his Russian counterpart “as soon as we can set it up”, raising fears in Kyiv that they could be sidelined while others decide their fate.Zelenskyy has spent the last few weeks accommodating various US demands to demonstrate his willingness to pursue peace. But Trump’s latest remarks – framing a US-Russia summit as the only path to resolving the conflict – underscored his failure to influence the US president’s thinking.Expectations were already low for the talks, with US officials playing down hopes and Moscow showing little willingness to compromise.Russia stuck to its maximalist territorial demands, insisting that Ukraine surrender areas that Moscow does not even control, according to a source in the Ukrainian delegation cited by Reuters on condition of anonymity.Ukraine’s western allies, alongside Zelenskyy, were quick to denounce Russia’s position. Keir Starmer, who was in Albania for a European summit, said the UK, France, Germany and Poland had agreed that the Russian position in peace talks was “unacceptable” and had discussed the matter with Trump. A photograph showed the country’s leaders, alongside Zelenskyy, on the phone to Trump after the failed talks.View image in fullscreenEuropean leaders speaking with Donald Trump on the phone in Tirana, from left to right: Donald Tusk, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer and Friedrich Merz.Photograph: Steffen Kugler/Bundesregierung/ReutersStarmer said: “We just had a meeting with President Zelenskyy and then a phone call with President Trump to discuss the developments in the negotiations today. And the Russian position is clearly unacceptable, and not for the first time. So as a result of that meeting with President Zelenskyy and that call with President Trump we are now closely aligning our responses and will continue to do so.”Zelenskyy renewed his calls for sanctions on Moscow if it failed to agree to a ceasefire. “Our position – if the Russians reject a full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings, tough sanctions must follow,” Zelenskyy said on X. “Pressure on Russia must be maintained until Russia is ready to end the war.”Hopes in Kyiv and among its European allies that Trump would impose tough sanctions after the failed talks were dampened by the US president indicating he wanted to meet Putin – leaving Moscow with little incentive to compromise inTurkey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, he sent a mid-level delegation, which led Zelenskyy to question Moscow’s seriousness, dismissing the Russian representatives as mere “theatre props”.Zelenskyy, who arrived in Ankara on Thursday, ultimately gave in to US pressure to proceed with the talks and agreed to send a delegation to Istanbul led by Ukraine’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov.0:35Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls for immediate, unconditional ceasefire – video“Unfortunately, [the Russians] are not serious enough about the negotiations … Out of respect for President [Donald] Trump and [the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan, I have decided to send our delegation to Istanbul now,” Zelenskyy said.Behind the brinkmanship lies a fundamental and, for now, irreconcilable divide in Zelenskyy and Putin’s approaches to peace.Ukraine has consistently demanded a full 30-day ceasefire before entering substantive negotiations. It has indicated it may be willing to accept a freeze of the frontlines and drop its attempt to join Nato, but only in return for increased western military and economic support, and security guarantees that could include European troops on the ground.Zelenskyy on Friday reiterated that his number one priority was “a full, unconditional and honest ceasefire. This must happen immediately to stop the killing and create a solid basis for diplomacy.”Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a time of battlefield advances by Russian forces.The Kremlin instead has sought to frame the meeting on Friday as a continuation of the fruitless talks held in March 2022. At the time, Russia’s demands included drastically scaling back Ukraine’s armed forces, blocking it from rebuilding with western support, and imposing other sweeping restrictions on Ukrainian sovereignty. Kyiv has repeatedly rejected those terms.Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation in Turkey, is a hawkish Kremlin aide and former culture minister who has repeatedly questioned Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent nation. During the meeting, the self-styled historian, often criticised for historical revisionism, reportedly invoked Tsar Peter I’s 21-year war against Sweden as a warning to Ukraine, suggesting Moscow would outlast it in a prolonged conflict and urging Kyiv to settle on Russia’s terms.Ruth Michaelson in Istanbul contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinTurkeyEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Various sets of talks were held in Turkey, for which nobody had much hope of a breakthrough, and the path to peace looked as unclear as it had done a week earlier.Halfway through the week, the Guardianspent an hour with Zelenskyy, with three other European journalists, in his office at the presidential administration in Kyiv. He had just made the surprise announcement that he would travel to Turkey for talks, and challenged Putin to join him. It was a dramatic raising of the stakes and we asked if he felt a bit like he was playing poker.He said: “With several people at once.”The week started well for Zelenskyy, with a quartet of Europeans – Britain’s Keir Starmer, France’s Emmanuel Macron, the new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and Poland’s Donald Tusk, all descending on Kyiv.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Emmanuel Macron, Donald Tusk and Friedrich Merz make a call to Donald Trump from Kyiv, Ukraine on 10 May.Photograph: Mstyslav Chernov/APThe five men huddled on a sofa as Macron calledDonald Trump, who had just woken up. Trump, the Guardian understands, was pleased the five had met but did not offer any firm commitments to sign up to sanctions if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire.Nonetheless, in an open-air press conference outside the Mariinskyi Palace in Kyiv, Macron and Starmer portrayed the call as if everyone was on the same page. They gave Putin an ultimatum, until Monday night, to begin a ceasefire. “If he turns his back on peace, we will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence,” said Starmer.The ball was now in Putin’s court, although all past experience suggested the Russian leader would not react well to an ultimatum, particularly not the day after overseeing abombastic military paradeto mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war, an event that has become the foundation myth for his nationalist idea of Russian identity and has been used to justify the invasion of Ukraine.An early sign that Putin’s response might not be positive came from Dmitry Medvedev, formerly Russia’s president and now its loudest nationalist troll on X. “They are blurting out threats againstRussia… You think that’s smart, eh? Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses,” he wrote on X.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin makes a statement to the media at the Kremlin in Moscow on 11 May.Photograph: Gavriil Grigorov/Sputnik/EPAStill, Putin’s is the only important reaction in Moscow these days and he was apparently about to give one live. Western television correspondents, a few of whom were still in Moscow after the Victory Day parade, were called into the Kremlin for a press conference where Putin was expected to give his response to the Starmer-Macron-Merz-Tusk ultimatum.It was close to 2am by the time Putin appeared, and the press conference had been downgraded to a prepared statement, apparently written by Putin himself. He scorned the idea that the west thought it could talk to him using ultimatums, and claimed disingenuously that Russia had always offered ceasefires and Ukraine had been the side to turn them down. Instead of a ceasefire now, he said, let’s start talking. He even named a date and a place: Istanbul on Thursday.Putin’s offer of talks flew in the face of what the western leaders had demanded. Starmer, Merz and Macron had been clear in Kyiv – a ceasefire had to come first, “no ifs or buts”, otherwise sanctions would be applied. They had made it clear that Trump was onside with this plan.But perhaps inevitably, the US president responded by putting pressure on Kyiv. “Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,” he wrote on Truth Social. “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”There was at least a somewhat positive coda to his message, that if after the meeting it was clear a deal was not possible, western leaders would “proceed accordingly”. But it was hardly the tough talking to Putin that the Europeans had hoped to extract from Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSoon after, Zelenskyy raised the stakes once again with his suggestion of a top-level summit. “We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow,” he wrote in a statement. But he added a twist. “I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.”It was a dramatic challenge that seized the initiative from the Russian leader. If Putin’s goal had been to deflect the demand for ceasefire with a faux-constructive offer, Zelenskyy was now calling his bluff. He did it remarkably quickly, too, suggesting it was not a move agreed with western allies.“If you read carefully, I spoke about both the ceasefire and about a meeting,” he said, when asked about it in the interview. “I formulated my words exactly like this. I can’t tell you why I did this. But I knew exactly what I was doing,” he added, enigmatically.View image in fullscreenThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, right, with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ankara on Thursday.Photograph: Turkish Presidency/APZelenskyy, like many world leaders now, has to calibrate his words carefully to make sure not to offend Trump. “We are putting on a theatre performance for just one audience member,” said a Ukrainian security source this week. It can sometimes be an excruciating dance, but if it goes wrong, as it did for Zelenskyy in the White House in late February, the consequences can be even worse.Putin was never likely to show up in Turkey, but a three-day silence from the Kremlin before this was confirmed suggested he was at least considering various options. In the end, he sent a negotiating team to Istanbul led by Vladimir Medinsky, a former culture minister with a sideline in writing pseudo-history books about the west’s long-running mission to destroy Russia.By Thursday evening, Zelenskyy was in Ankaracomplainingthe Russians had not shown up; Medinsky was in Istanbul complaining the Ukrainians hadn’t shown up; Putin was in the Kremlin saying not much at all; and Trump was coming to the end of his lavish Middle East tour and still hinting there could be an 11th-hour meeting with Putin.On Friday, negotiations between a Ukrainian delegation and Medinsky’s Russian group did finally happen. But they were over in less than two hours, producing a prisoner exchange but apparently little else, with the Russian side reportedly insisting on maximalist demands. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, dismissed the negotiations (which Ukraine had attended only because the Americans insisted) as pointless and at a “logjam”, and echoing the US president, said it would probably take a meeting between Trump and Putin to end the conflict.The week ends with no sign of a lasting peace being any closer, and little talk of the US implementing the tough measures that Starmer and Macron had promised against the Russians. In a neat piece of symmetry, Zelenskyy and the other four European leaders again called Trump, this time from a summit in Tirana. “We are now closely aligning our responses and will continue to do so,” said Starmer, in what could hardly be described as a wall of solidarity against the Kremlin. Trump, in his comments this week, has sounded excited about the prospect of a bilateral meeting with Putin, and has made little reference to any potential negative consequences for Russia.Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy said he felt confident if cautious while sitting at the geopolitical poker table. The Ukrainian president said: “I’m in general a confident person. Though in negotiations there should always be doubts … You have to have some reflections, to be able to step to the side, to veer off the fast-moving track everyone else is on.”The problem for Zelenskyy – and for Europe more broadly – is that all the carefully calibrated poker plays count for nothing if it turns out Trump is not even bothering to follow the game, but instead playing his own game, according to his own rules.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinEuropeDonald TrumpUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

This is why | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreEarlier on Friday,Donald Trump acknowledged that people are starving in Gazaand claimed the US would have the situation in the territory “taken care of”.The US president told reporters in Abu Dhabi: “We’re looking atGaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.”But discussions on the longer term future of Gaza have faltered. On Thursday, Trump described his desire to turn Gaza into a “freedom zone”, a possible reiteration of aplan he put forward in Februaryfor the US to take control of the Palestinian territory to allow for its reconstruction as a luxury leisure and business hub.map of GazaThere had been widespread hope that Trump’s visit to the region could lead to a fresh pause in hostilities or a renewal of humanitarian aid toGaza.Instead, the raids and bombardmentover the past 72 hourshave raised the levels of violence higher than for several weeks, with the death toll coming close to that seen in the first days of Israel’s renewed offensive in Gaza aftera fragile ceasefire collapsed in March.Gaza’s civil defence agency said strikes on Friday killed 108 people, mostly women and children, and some officials in the Palestinian territory put the number killed by Israeli attacks in recent days as high as 250 or 300.At least 48 bodies were taken to the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza, and 16 to Nasser hospital after strikes on the outskirts of the central town of Deir al-Balah and the southern city of Khan Younis, health officials said.In Jabaliya, a neighbourhood in the north of Gaza that has seen heavy bombardment for weeks, women sat weeping beside 10 bodies draped in white sheets that were lined up on the ground amid rubble.Umm Mohammed al-Tatari, 57, said she had been awoken by a pre-dawn attack on northern Gaza.“We were asleep when suddenly everything exploded around us … everyone started running … there was blood everywhere, body parts and corpses,” she said.Israel’s military said its air force had struck more than150 “terror” targetsacross Gaza.Hamas still holds 57 of about 250 hostages seized in its October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.Israel says the blockade and intensified bombardments since mid-March are intended to put pressure on the militant organisation to secure the release of the hostages. Fewer than half are believed to be still alive.Israel’s retaliatory military offensive has killed about 53,000 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the health ministry there.A ceasefire that came into effect in January broke down in mid-March after Israel refused to move to a scheduled second phase that could have led to a definitive end to the war.0:55CCTV footage captures moment Israeli airstrike hits Gaza hospital – videoSome of the heaviest Israeli strikes earlier this week were aimed at the current commander of Hamas in Gaza, who, Israeli officials said, was sheltering in tunnel systems under a big hospital complex in Khan Younis. Hamas has denied repeated Israeli accusations that it uses civilians as human shields.Israel has called up tens of thousands of reservists for the new offensive, in which troops will hold on to seized territory and which will lead to a significant displacement of the population,Benjamin Netanyahu has said. Israeli ministers have spoken of “conquering” Gaza.Hamas on Mondayfreed Edan Alexander, the last living US citizen it held, after direct engagement with the Trump administration that left Israel sidelined.As part of the understanding with Washington regarding Alexander’s release, Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, said the group was “awaiting and expecting the US administration to exert further pressure” on Israel “to open the crossings and allow the immediate entry of humanitarian aid”.Israeli officials have consistently denied the tight blockade imposed on the devastated territory more than 10 weeks ago has caused hunger and Trump’s comments will be seen as further evidence of tensions between Netanyahu and Israel’s closest ally.Israel, which claims Hamas systematically loots aid to fund its military and other operations, has put forward a plan to distribute humanitarian assistance from a series of hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops.The US has backed the plan, which has been described as unworkable, dangerous and potentially unlawful by aid agencies because it could lead to the mass forced transfer of populations.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, on Thursday acknowledged the criticism and said Washington was “open to an alternative if someone has a better one”.The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been set up to manage the scheme, announced on Wednesday that it would begin operating by the end of the month and that it had asked Israel to lift its blockade to allow aid to reach the territory immediately.Aid agencies have warned that any delay will cost lives, and that cases of acute malnutrition, particularly among young children, are soaring.UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said on Friday that time should not be wasted on the US proposal to deliver aid to Gaza, saying the UN has a proven plan and 160,000 pallets of relief ready to enter the Palestinian enclave now.“We have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself,” he said. “We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.”Polls in Israel show widespread support for a new ceasefire to secure the hostages’ release, but local media reports quoted statements from anonymous Israeli and regional officials downplaying any likelihood of a breakthrough.Israel’s main group representing the families of hostages still being held in Gaza said on Friday that Netanyahu was missing a “historic opportunity” for them to be released.Recent days have seen violence intensify in the occupied West Bank and new launches of missiles at Israel by the Yemen-based Houthi militia.Israel struck Yemen’s Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Salif on Friday, continuing its campaign to degrade Houthi military capabilities.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warHamasMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas has denied repeated Israeli accusations that it uses civilians as human shields.0:55CCTV footage captures moment Israeli airstrike hits Gaza hospital – videoThough there is limited fighting on the ground in Gaza, Israel has called up tens of thousands of reservists for a big offensive, in which troops will hold on to seized territory and which will lead to a significant displacement of the population,Netanyahu has said.

On Thursday, Trump described his desire to turn Gaza into a “freedom zone”, a possible reiteration of aplan he put forward in Februaryfor the US to take control of the Palestinian territory to allow for its reconstruction as a luxury leisure and business hub.Recent days have seen violence intensify in the occupied West Bank and new launches of missiles at Israel by the Yemen-based Houthi militia.

The US and the UAE did not say which AI chips could be included in the data centers, but sources told Reuters the UAE could be allowed to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips each year starting in 2025.Trump announces more than $200bn of deals between US and UAERead moreNvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, was seen in televised footage conversing with Trump and the UAE president, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, at a palace in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.The agreement is a major win for the UAE, which has been trying to balance its relations with its longtime ally the US and its largest trading partner, China. The Gulf state has been spending billions of dollars in a push to become a global AI player. But it had limited access to US chips during the presidential administration of Joe Biden.The deal reflects the Trump administration’s confidence that the chips can be managed securely, in part by requiring datacentres to be managed by US companies.The US has been at the forefront of AI technology and innovation, but over the past year China has emerged as a serious competitor. Despite Trump’s confidence, some worry that striking deals with Persian Gulf countries could further diminish the US’s grip on the burgeoning tech. There’s also the fear that China would be able to access these datacentres for its own benefit.Top CEOs from AI and chip companies, such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Nvidia’s Huang, appear to support such a deal. It could bring their products to an even larger world stage and they stand to profit immensely.The AI agreement “includes the UAE committing to invest in, build or finance US datacentres that are at least as large and as powerful as those in the UAE,” the White House said.“The agreement also contains historic commitments by the UAE to further align their national security regulations with the United States, including strong protections to prevent the diversion of US-origin technology.”Central to the agreement announced on Thursday is the 10 sq mile (25.9 sq km) AI campus in Abu Dhabi with 5GW of power capacity for AI datacentres, the US commerce department said.The campus will be built by Abu Dhabi state-backed firm G42, but the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said in a release that “American companies will operate the datacentres and offer American-managed cloud services throughout the region”.The US fact sheets also described chip company Qualcomm working on an AI-related engineering centre and that Amazon Web Services, the cloud unit of the tech and commerce company, would work with local partners on cybersecurity and fostering cloud adoption.The US has pursued protectionist policies for years to curb China’s access to advanced semiconductors, including ensuring that the chips do not end up in the country via third parties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is currently not a criminal investigation, but we will follow the evidence as our inquiries continue.“We will continue to have officers at the scene for a number of days to ensure the public remain safe.“The fire and rescue service is still at the scene, dampening down the fire. Once the scene is safe, our investigators will be able to carry out inquiries at the location.”Two further Oxfordshire fire and rescue service firefighters suffered serious injuries and are in hospital, Oxfordshire county council has said.Tim Metcalfe, assistant chief constable at Thames Valley police, said: “This is an absolute tragedy and my thoughts, and the thoughts of everyone at Thames Valley police, are with the families, friends and colleagues of Jennie Logan of the Oxfordshire county council fire and rescue service, Martyn Sadler of the London fire brigade, and member of the public David Chester, who have died in this incident.”Bicester Motion, home to more than 50 specialist businesses focused on classic car restoration and engineering, is located at the site of RAF Bicester, a former bomber station.A spokesperson for the business park said everyone there considered Chester “part of the fabric of our estate and a friend to us all”.Chester was the proprietor of a family-run fencing and groundworks company, Chester & Sons.The Bicester Motion spokesperson said: “Whenever you had a question, you would ‘just ask Dave’, not just him but his whole family as they all cared about this place just as much as we do.“Our whole community used to say that ‘Dave always had our back.’ Yesterday, he was doing just that – the epitome of his selfless spirit.”People laid flowers at the scene on Friday. One bunch was left by a family with a note that read: “Sending all our love to those who lost their lives and to those who did not think twice about making that sacrifice to help others.“Thinking of the fire service, their families, friends and the wider community and all those services who came to help. Rest easy.”View image in fullscreenFloral tributes are seen outside Bicester fire station after a fire at Bicester Motion, the site of a former RAF base in Oxfordshire.Photograph: Emily Smith/PAAnother said: “Thank you for your service.”Amy Angeletta said she had laid flowers out of a sense of community. “People have lost their lives and it’s quite a close-knit community here,” she said.“It’s just to pay your respects.

It read: “Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those affected by the sad loss of two firefighters and the member of the public.

The bravery of our firefighters is astounding. Hoping those in hospital make a full and swift recovery.”Ten fire and rescue crews were called to tackle the fire, which started on Thursday at 6.39pm and prompted a major response and warnings for residents to stay indoors.The fire was under control on Friday morning, the council said. Other support appliances remained on scene, including a hydraulic platform, a water carrier, a command unit and a high-volume pumping unit.Map of areaThe commissioner of London fire brigade, Andy Roe, said: “This is clearly an incredibly difficult time for us all; we have lost a well-respected and much-loved colleague who exemplified courage and selflessness in the service of others.“Our thoughts are with all the families, friends, and colleagues impacted by this tragedy. We are doing everything we can to provide support to Martyn’s family and colleagues.“It has been an incredibly challenging day for the UK fire and rescue service. This incident highlights the high-risk nature of the service we provide every day.”Vikas Talwar, 40, who lives near Bicester Motion, could see the fire from the street corner outside his house.He said: “There was a lot of smoke yesterday. Lots of people were gathering here on the corner but a lot of smoke was coming out.“There was flames on the roof, on the top of the roof, and a huge big cloud of smoke in the air. I could see it from this corner near my house.”Speaking of those who died in the fire, he said: “It’s so sad. It’s very heartbreaking. We have sympathy with the people involved.“I can see there was a quick reaction by the fire brigade and ambulance teams when they came in.

Under permitted development rules, a temporary change of use is allowed for a total of 28 days each calendar year, but the Brockwell Park festivals run over 37 days and were due to begin on 23 May.The high court judge Mr Justice Mould ruled in Shaman’s favour, saying the council’s decision to grant the certificate to the festival organisers was “irrational”.Rylance said the victory was “wonderful news”.In a statement issued by PBP, he said: “Wonderful news. Brockwell Park will be open to all for free again this summer. No walls. No trucks.“The grass, and trees and plants will have a chance to recover from the years of abuse.“Now let’s help revive the beloved Lambeth country fair as it used to be, open to all. Congratulations to all who worked so devotedly to achieve this decision.“Every small victory for nature makes a difference.”Before the hearing, PBP said in a statement: “These large-scale, high-impact commercial festivals are damaging Brockwell Park’s ecology, heritage and community value. The park is being overused and under-protected.”The group also led protests in the park.In written submissions, Shaman’s barrister, Richard Harwood KC, said that in the past few years the park had “increasingly” been used for large commercial events, with “substantial” parts being fenced off and damage being caused to the ground.“Due to inclement weather over the weekend of one of the commercial events, the park effectively became a mud bath,” Harwood added, referencing an event in 2024.Billed as theBattle for Brockwell Park, the ruling highlighted tensions between residents who support and oppose the events, which bring hundreds of thousands of people to the south London park in the summer months.“I await the arrival of the park’s music festival season with dread,” wrote the author Rebecca Tamáslast year.Another group called SayYesLambeth argued that the events were a key part of south London’s cultural offering. The group’s tagline was: “Fighting for culture, joy and community in Lambeth.”In the lead-up to the case, a member of SayYesLambethtold Londoncentric: “Our whole scene and culture is about to be deleted because of people who complain about noise when they live in central London.”The group described the case as a battle between “a small but powerful group” and “the young people, the renters, the workers, the small businesses [and] the creatives”.Earlier in the hearing, Mould said: “It is for the planning authority to decide, pending the outcome of this challenge, what decision it should or should not take.”Mould refused initial applications for permission to appeal from Lambeth council and Summer Events Limited, although they can ask the court of appeal for permission to challenge the decision directly.A Lambeth council spokesperson said on Friday: “We are currently assessing the impact of this judgment and determining next steps.”Explore more on these topicsLondonAccess to green spaceFestivalsCommunitiesMusic festivalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But, according to chefs, supermarket insiders and social media, 2025 is gearing up to be the summer of the posh crisp.Jay Ledwich, a crisp buyer at Waitrose, said demand for premium and unusual flavoured crisps was “soaring”. This week, the shop became the exclusive British supermarket stockist of what it is tipping to be the next viral hit in crisps – a fried-egg flavour from the Spanish specialist Torres. It follows other savoury sensations from the brand, including black truffle, caviar, and sparkling wine flavours.View image in fullscreenBalenciaga offers a range of crisp-themed accessories.Photograph: PR Image/BalenciagaCrisps’ popularity isn’t limited to the snack aisle. The fashion brand Balenciaga is selling a£1,450 glossy “salt and vinegar” leather pouchand a £625“spicy chili” crisp charm. It follows Anya Hindmarch’s sequinned Walkers crisps bag, originally released in 2000 andnow housed in the V&A. This week the US brand Lay’s released its new campaign that stars football legends including Lionel Messi munching on its classic salted crisps.Elsewhere, at parties, traditional blinis are out. Instead at-home cooks are whipping up crisp canapés – such as Pringles topped with a dollop of sour cream and caviar. Millennials have swapped the customary bottle of bubbles for the host for a£26 tin of Bonilla’s sea salted crisps. Online, there are viral recipes for chocolate biscuits topped with salty crisp crumbs. The American chef Alison Roman suggests serving marinated anchovies with Kettle-style crisps, while the Spanish chef Ferran Adrià proposes folding plain crisps into whisked eggs for a speedy take on a tortilla Española.At hipster-filled bars, natty orange wines are served with bowls of salted crisps topped with Serrano ham. The Greek-inspired restaurant Oma and its sister restaurant Agora in Borough Market, south-east London, feature homemade hot crisps on the menu. The chef/owner David Carter, who fries agria potatoes in rapeseed oil before flavouring them with everything from garlic to kombu dashi,said the idea stemmed from wanting “something a bit naughty when you sat down”. After trying out fava and chickpeas, he settled on “the humble crisp”, which he said ticked the salty, spicy and crunchy boxes.Over at Toklas restaurant on the Strand, its take on mussels escabeche features crisps instead of bread. The head chef, Chris Shaw, described the British as having “a sort of love affair” with crisps. He argued it played into nostalgia. “We’ve all had them as part of a packed lunch. Or as a kid on holiday. There are good crisps [and] shit crisps. But they all bring you back to a moment.”At £4.95 for a 125g packet, Torres sits at the upper end of the upmarket crisp market but flavours beyond the standard ready salted are booming across the crisp category. Marks & Spencer recently introduced a black truffle version (£3.75 for 125g) to its own label collection. Kettle’s latest range includes asriracha mayo versionand dill pickle and jalapeño (£2.40 for 125g). At Tyrells, you can pick from Wensleydale and cranberry to roasted chicken and sage (from £2.75 for 150g). There are also specialist snack sites that stock smaller British brands, such asTaste of Game, which does a smoked pheasant and wild mushroom crisp.Natalie Whittle, the author ofCrunch: An Ode to Crisps, said the trend reflected a wider cost of living challenge: “Crisps have always had a kind of chameleon ability to be high or low in the supermarket food aisles.”For those dining out less, Whittle said crisps offered an opportunity to enjoy “something a bit more cheffy” at home. The writer sometimes invited a friend over for just a bag of posh crisps and a glass of wine. “It is fun to break the monotony and rigid doctrine of making meals all the time,” she said.However, for some, tradition would always trump the novel. While Shaw said he enjoyed “the strange sulphur” flavour from Torres fried-egg crisps, his favourite was still “an acidic numbing” packet of pickled onion Monster Munch.Explore more on these topicsSnacksFoodFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Although I am not religious, I was concerned to see the clumsy criticism of those whose objections to the bill are thought to be centred in their religious beliefs.”View image in fullscreenKim Leadbeater on the phone to Dame Esther Rantzen in the Houses of Parliament.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PARantzen, alongtime supporter of assisted dying, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in 2023. She was thought to have just weeks to live, but last year started using a “wonder drug” that helped her survive against the odds.Her daughter revealed in March thatthe former Childline founder’s drugs were no longer working. It meant she was no longer well enough to travel to Dignitas in Switzerland.Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the legislation, said she had not seen Rantzen’s recent remarks, and argued the changes would make the bill more workable and strengthen its protections. She said assisted dying must be legalised to avoid terminally ill people acting out of desperation or making traumatic trips to Switzerland.Its supporters say the bill has returned with strengthened safeguards after being amended in committee earlier this year.But opponents have complained the bill does not have enough protections and has been rushed through, with the criticism coming days aftertwo royal medical colleges voiced their doubts on the legislationin its current form.View image in fullscreenFlorence Eshalomi, a Labour MP, speaks in parliament.Photograph: HoCSome MPs are also unhappy about what they see as the chaotic way the legislation has been debated. Many MPs who tabled amendments did not get the chance to speak, and in the end only two amendments were put to the vote.The first amendment exempting healthcare workers passed, and a second amendment put forward by the Tory MP Rebecca Paul was rejected. This would have prevented employees from providing assisted dying while working for an employer that has chosen not to take part in the process.The eating disorder amendment was not chosen for a vote, but Leadbeater said she accepted it in principle and it would be supported at a later stage.Naz Shah, a Labour MP and opponent of the bill, had proposed the amendment, and was unhappy at the process, saying: “Unbelievably I wasn’t told by the sponsor that my amendment would be accepted until we were sitting in parliament. There was ample opportunity for me to be told and I had no knowledge of any proposed changes in advance. This bill is profoundly important and this chaos does a disservice to parliament and to our constituents. We shouldn’t be playing games with people’s lives like this.”Another MP said the votes on Friday were “just skirmishes” and the showdown that makes clear whether any support has ebbed away from the bill is still weeks away. But they said many MPs were exasperated at the process that meant they felt issues were not getting sufficient time for debate.View image in fullscreenNaz Shah is an opponent of the bill.Photograph: HoCMike Reader, a Labour MP, said: No matter your views on the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, also known as assisted suicide or assisted dying, people must agree that the time that’s been allocated to debate the proposed amendments to the bill is not adequate. I’m disappointed that there appears to be a campaign to rush this through, backed by some significant and well-funded lobby groups.”The debate was marked by protests on both sides, with more than 100 people gathered outside parliament with placards.Addressing a group in parliament, including Dame Esther’s daughter Rebecca Wilcox, Leadbeater became emotional, saying she gets upset “when we get obsessed with parliamentary procedure, when this is actually about human beings, and that’s what I find upsetting, because I think it’s not about a green book, or it’s not about a piece of paper”.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEsther RantzenHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sheriff Susan Hutson, whose agency operates the jail, said: “We are urging the public to remain alert.”Surveillance video showed 10 inmates escaping from the Orleans Justice Center on Friday morning.At first, officials said 11 people had escaped. But during a press conference on Friday afternoon, the New Orleans sheriff clarified that one man, who authorities thought had escaped, was in a different cell.The 10 inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center (OJC) are accused of a variety of crimes, including weapons charges, attempted murder, domestic abuse and murder. The sheriff confirmed that one inmate had been caught as of Friday.Louisiana state policesaidon X that they had caught one of the alleged escapers after a brief foot chase in New Orleans’s well-known French Quarter neighborhood. The Orleans parish sheriff’s office latershared Instagram imagesof the arrest of another man who was captured around 7.30pm in the 3500 block of Second Street.The inmates reportedly tore off the toilet-sink appliance in one of the cells, escaped through there and exited the facility through a loading dock, security camera footage reveals, Hutson said.While the sheriff said “defective locks” were a factor in the escape, she added that “there’s no way” the inmates could have left the facility without “a lapse in security”.“It’s almost impossible, not completely, but almost impossible for someone to get out of this facility without help,” she said.Among the escapers was Derrick Groves, who in October was convicted of fatally shooting two people while wounding two others in New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood on 13 February 2018 as the city celebrated Fat Tuesday. Jurors found him guilty of second-degree murder and attempted murder, and – though murder carries mandatory life imprisonment – he had evidently not been sentenced in the case, court records show.Separately, after those convictions at trial, Groves pleaded guilty to two reduced charges of manslaughter in connection with a double slaying in 2017 – and an unrelated charge of battery of a correctional facility employee filed against him in April 2024.The inmates purportedly escaped at midnight, but facility guards did not notice they were gone until 8.30am local time during a routine headcount.Hours after officials announced the escape, a criminal justice source provided the Guardian with a photo showing a window-size hole in the wall of an OJC cell leading to the outside. Handwritten messages left around the hole included ones reading “Fuck OPSO”, referring to the Orleans parish sheriff’s office in charge of the jail, and “suck my dick OJC”.“We innocent,” read another message. Another, which was misspelled, had an arrow pointing down to the hole in the cell wall and read: “To easy lol.” Still another said, “Catch us when you can.”View image in fullscreenThis image of a window-sized hole inside a New Orleans’s jail cell was provided after 11 people detained at the facility escaped.Photograph: Provided to the GuardianAuthorities did not immediately comment on the photo, which numerous media outlets had reported on by Friday evening.Officials did not take any questions at the news conference but said the FBI, US marshals and state troopers were helping the city’s police department and sheriff’s deputies search for the escapers. Louisiana’s attorney general, Liz Murrill, said her office would “thoroughly review” exactly how the breakout occurred once everyone had been captured.Hutson added: “We are launching a full investigation to determine how this escape occurred, including reviewing facility protocols, staff performance and physical security measures … Any lapses or failures that contributed to this incident will be addressed swiftly and with full accountability.”The Orleans Justice Center was previously known as the Orleans Parish prison. It has long been the subject of scrutiny by the justice department over allegations of civil rights violations, leading to areform pact with the federal governmentin 2016. An independent monitor tracks the jail’s compliance with the reform pact, which is known as a consent decree.Donald Trump’s administration recentlyordereda review of all consent decrees affecting law enforcement agencies in the US, calling them “political handcuffs that make aggressively enforcing the law impossible”. The administration said the goal of the review was to determine whether it made sense to modify, rescind or move “to conclude such measures that unduly impede the performance of law enforcement functions”.Murill told WDSU that Friday’s events did not “bode well” for the jail’s consent decree.Friday’s escapes occurred less than two weeks after New Orleans voters reapproved – by the thinnest of margins – a property tax funding maintenance, staffing and certain programs at the sheriff’s office in charge of the city’s jail. An initial count reportedly found the tax renewal passed by two votes after more than 24,000 ballots had been cast. A recount subsequently found the tax renewal passed by four votes.A statement that Hutson provided to the news media after the recount promised she would ensure her office would “continue to ensure our deputies are well-equipped and provide transformative justice so that detainees leave better than they came”.“Progress is evident more every day,” the statement said.This article was amended on 16 May 2025 to update the number of people who escaped as well as how many had been caught, based on newer information.Ramon Antonio Vargasin New Orleans contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNew OrleansUS prisonsUS crimeLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

A 10% universal tariff on all imported foreign goods remains.Earlier this week, Trump hailed a “total reset” in relations between China and the US after the countriesagreed the pause, which included Beijing lowering its duties on American goods to 10%, while the US tax on Chinese goods will be lowered to 30%.The White House has signalled it isprioritising talks with dozens of the US’s largest trading partners, including India, South Korea and Japan, while negotiations with the EU are ongoing.However, his comments suggest Washington lacks the bandwidth to negotiate with hundreds of countries at once, while indicating that the president will instead push to dictate terms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The tentative deal was first reported by Reuters.In October 2018, 189 people were killed whenLion Air flight 610 fellinto the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019,Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashedshortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa airport, claiming 157 lives.The second crash prompted the worldwide grounding of the 737 Max for almost two years, and left Boeing scrambling to repair its reputation.While Boeing initially resolved a criminal investigation in January 2021, prosecutors accused it of breaching the settlement in 2024. This led the justice department tooffer the firm a controversial plea deallast summer.In December, however, US district Judge Reed O’Connor in Texas rejected the agreement. He cited a diversity and inclusion provision related to the selection of an independent monitor.While Boeing had agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of up to $487.2m during the final months of the Biden administration, O’Connor’s decision meant the Trump administration inherited the case.Under Donald Trump, the justice department has been overhauled, and his administration has faced questions around how aggressively it intends to pursue big companies that break the law.Sanjiv Singh, counsel for 16 families of crash victims, said: “We are appalled by this sudden possible retreat from criminal prosecution of Boeing. A non-prosecution agreement is morally repugnant and lacks the teeth and bite to cause fundamental change in Boeings safety practices.”Shares in Boeing slipped 0.5% in New York.Explore more on these topicsBoeingLion Air crashEthiopian Airlines crashnewsShareReuse this content"

The company said “substantially all” of its products sold in the US were manufactured in China.The company said its products earmarked for the US had not left a factory in China.Tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and China were raised multiple times in April in an escalating trade war,reaching on Chinese exportsto the US andon US exportsto China, before the countries met for negotiations last weekend.Thecurrent pause in tariffsbetween the US and China was welcomed by the manufacturer as a sign that “gives hope for a negotiated resolution”, but it added that uncertainty remained because of the “volatile and evolving trade policy landscape”.The toy company added that economic uncertainty resulting from tariffs had knocked global sales, as customers have “become increasingly cautious” and unwilling to commit to orders.“This is impacting sales in all our key territories,” Character said as it reported its half-year results.Despite the ongoing uncertainty, the company said it remained confident that it would be profitable in the current financial year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now she’s winning pitch competitionsAdvertising partnerAbout this contentIsabel SloneFri 16 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 12.00 EDTShareThe first time Hyacinth Tucker did someone else’s laundry, she earned $20. “I didn’t think of it as a business. This was just another side hustle,” she said. It was 2022 and theMaryland-based army veteran needed money.She was going through a divorce, andCovidhad staunched the flow of income from the event facilities she owned, so she had taken to driving forUberand pet-sitting.Tucker was visiting a friend whose dirty clothing was strewn on every surface. Apologizing for the mess, Tucker’s friend said she wished a fairy godmother would gather up all the laundry and do it for her. Tucker took on the gig.She started running to avoid dying young – but no workout gear fit. Now her clothing brand helps othersRead moreA week later, at a mother’s group meetup, she casually mentioned that she had helped a friend out with laundry. Ears perked up. “Everyone looked at me like, ‘You’re doing laundry? Can you come do my laundry?’” she said. Tucker ripped a piece of paper out of her notebook and passed it around the group, expecting one or two sign-ups. When she received the paper back, both sides were scrawled with names. “At that point I realized I could turn this into something a little bit bigger,” she said.Tucker did her research and learned that laundry is a$16bn industryin the United States.In the coming months, Tucker hired two drivers and poured her heart into the business.“I did the opposite of what you’re supposed to do, which is to start with where you are, get deep into that market, then expand,” she said. “If I met a potential client and they said, ‘I live in Alexandria. Do you come out that way?’ I said: ‘We sure do.’ We had clients in every single place you can imagine around DC and northern Virginia. It was a logistical nightmare.”Tucker dedicated herself to marketing, passing out business cards, attending networking events and even wearing T-shirts advertising the business.View image in fullscreenSavinia Wiah, a Laundry Basket employee, folds clothing at a partner laundromat in Hyattsville, Maryland.Photograph: Stephen Voss/The GuardianShe tried to take out a bank loan, but it wasn’t approved; instead, she took out what she called “predatory loans” for a quick infusion of cash, but soon found those were unsustainable.She eventually found success in pitch competitions – participating in 18 to date, she said – winning several, including one for female veterans.“My story really resonated with people,” she said, adding that she had amassed over $100,000 in winnings and grants over the past two years. Trust is key in the laundry business, Tucker said. “For most people, their first thought is: ‘So you’re gonna be washing my underwear?’” she said. “That’s when I knew I had to come out from behind the scenes and be the face of the company.”Her grandpa brewed beer in his cellar in Iran. Last month she canned 30,000 brews that taste like homeRead moreShe has also collected private investments from friends and family. “One of the reasons I decided to invest in Hyacinth is because of her character,” said Derrick Terry, a federal records and information officer who has known Tucker since high school. “She’s always smiling and she brings a personal approach that most other businesses don’t have.”Within two years, revenues grew tenfold and Tucker and her staff were washing up to 7,000lb of laundry a month. In addition to paying clients, the Laundry Basket partners with a Baltimore-based outreach organization to launder donated clothing before it’s distributed to shelters.Today Tucker manages a staff of three, including an executive assistant and an operations manager. “We’re able to hire people, keep their households going, pay their family expenses – that’s the greatest thing,” she said.And Tucker wants others to share her success. The Laundry Basket takes on high school interns from a local career center, and in 2024, Tucker founded the Laundry Basket Institute to train people interested in kickstarting their own careers in the business. So far she’s trained five students through the program.The organization provides career training to those who may have barriers to traditional employment, including formerly incarcerated people, youth who are ageing out of foster care and individuals with disabilities, in the laundry and dry cleaning industry.“We are deeply focused on economic mobility,” she said, adding that her training program pays sustainable wages and offers leadership development and opportunities to grow “within the Laundry Basket ecosystem or pursue other business ventures”.“Rather than trying to ‘get out’ of the industry, we’re redefining what it can look like to work in this field,” Tucker said. “It can be a stable, sustainable and empowering career path.”In addition to the Laundry Basket Institute, Tucker has expanded into dry cleaning and alteration services, and is working with a chemist to formulate a Laundry Basket-branded detergent. She soon hopes to transition the business toward a franchise model, with operations nationwide. “When you think of laundry, I want you to think of the Laundry Basket,” Tucker said.Explore more on these topicsMarylandThe New Face of Small BusinessEntrepreneursSmall businessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Englishman will inevitably be fined after a foul-mouthed tirade during his second round of theUS PGAChampionship was picked up on live television coverage.Hatton was within a shot of the lead when reaching the tee at the 18th, his 9th. Hatton’s drive found a water hazard. What happened next was rather typical for a player prone to tempestuous moments on golf courses. The 33-year-old bawled out “piece of shit” before adding a c-word insult, apparently towards his driver. Hatton’s mood hardly improved as he slumped to a triple-bogey seven.US PGA Championship 2025: golf updates from second round – liveRead more“It wasn’t my finest moment on the course,” said Hatton of his outburst. “I was running hot in that moment. I’m pretty good sometimes at saying the wrong thing.”The strange thing is Hatton’s refusal to moderate his behaviour. Perhaps he thinks he does not need to. Maybe last year’s move to LIVGolfhas loosened his inhibitions even further. Rebel tour, rebel antics.At the Dubai Desert Classic in January, Hatton plunged a club right through a tee marker. By Sunday, Hatton was holding the trophy. Hatton was widely condemned for ranting, raving and club snapping at another Dubai event last November. He needs to tone it down a couple of notches, if simply on the basis of example-setting. He remains a fantastic player; there is no need for the histrionics.Shane Lowry summoned his inner Hatton as he whacked the turf in anger on the 8th, having found a horrible lie on the fairway on his way to missing the cut. “Fuck this place,” added the 2019 Open champion for good measure. What an intemperate scene.View image in fullscreenJhonattan Vegas of Venezuela is a surprise frontrunner after round two, having never had a top-10 finish in a major.Photograph: George Walker IV/APMud balls,a theme in this US PGA, have troubled Hatton, albeit to a lesser extent than that drive. “You do your job off the tee, you hit a good shot then all of a sudden you are missing a green by 10 yards with an eight iron because there is mud on the ball,” Hatton said.“It is a bit harsh and so inconsistent, it’s not like the ball always does the same thing. I don’t like the fact it is a bit of a wild guess. I was surprised it wasn’t pick-up-and-place with how wet it was here on Wednesday. But it is the same for everyone.”Hatton’s 73 left him at one under, seven shy of Jhonattan Vegas. The Venezuelan added a 70 to Thursday’s 64. To portray this as strange would be huge understatement; Vegas has reached the age of 40 without posting a major top-10 finish. He surely cannot keep up his form around Quail Hollow … can he?The first meaningful sign of nerves arrived at the last, where he slumped to a double bogey, after three birdies on the back nine. Vegas enjoyed an outrageous piece of fortune on the 17th, where his wayward tee shot rebounded from a bunker rake and on to the green. Otherwise, it was 20 yards wide.Rory McIlroy secured a spot for the weekend despite a bogey, bogey finish; theMasters champion is one-over, just above the cut line, following a second round of 69. McIlroy did not stop for post-round media duties, meaning he could not address a report which claimed he had to change his driver head on Tuesday.McIlroy’s original driver has been reported as non-confirming, a scenario which can routinely occur through wear and tear and apportions no blame whatsoever to a golfer. McIlroy’s poor driving performance in round one as widely highlighted; the truth is it has not been particularly strong all year.

Matt Fitzpatrick’s welcome return to form continued, his 68 enough to equal Pavon’s total. The Yorkshireman has rediscovered his touch in a fiendishly tough environment. Scottie Scheffler is in close proximity, naturally.Si Woo Kim blasted into contention with a hole in one at the 6th. Max Homa’s 64 means a five-under aggregate at halfway. Bryson DeChambeau lurks with intent. The reigning US Open champion’s 68 moved him to three under. DeChambeau’s position would be even better but for a messy bogey at the 9th, his final hole.“It is a great test,” said DeChambeau of this Charlotte venue. “It was a weird day. I felt like I was playing good, just didn’t get anything out of it. I got some weird breaks out there. That’s what this golf course does to you. I’ve just got to have my putting a little more on and keep playing the way I am. I easily could be seven or eight under right now or I could be even par. I think a 65, 64 is out there. I almost shot it today and I definitely saw it out there, I just didn’t accomplish it.”It would be a surprise if DeChambeau is not part of the round four equation. Quail Hollow typically rewards those with the Californian’s driving power. This is a major that has still to burst into song.Dustin Johnson comfortably missed the cut after rounds of 78 and 76. Cameron Smith’s strange slide towards golfing oblivion continued with a third major early exit in a row. Justin Rose, who pushed McIlroy so close at the Masters only last month, was a surprise departure at plus nine.Justin Thomas, who won the US PGA here in 2019, Ludvig Åberg and the 2015 winner, Jordan Spieth, also found themselves on Friday evening planes out of Charlotte.Explore more on these topicsUS PGAPGA TourGolfUS sportsNEC NijmegenShareReuse this content"

The deal includes $181m in guaranteed money, solidifying Purdy’s role as the franchise quarterback moving forward.Purdy, 25, was the final pick of the 2022NFLdraft – familiarly known as ‘Mr Irrelevant’ – but quickly defied expectations. After stepping in as the starter midway through his rookie season, Purdy led the 49ers to back-to-back playoff appearances, including a trip to the Super Bowl in February 2024. He was also named to the Pro Bowl and finished fourth in MVP voting that season.Despite San Francisco’s injury-riddled 6-11 campaign in 2024, Purdy still posted strong numbers, throwing for 3,864 yards, 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. His completion percentage over three seasons sits at 67.5%, with a total of 9,518 passing yards, 64 touchdowns and 27 interceptions.The extension comes as Purdy enters the final year of his rookie contract in 2025. General manager John Lynch hinted at the deal during the NFL league meetings in Florida, saying he was confident an agreement would be reached. “I think we’re going to get the deal done,” Lynch said at the time.Purdy’s new contract places him among the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league, reflecting San Francisco’s commitment to building around him for the long term. “I want to be in San Francisco and play my football career here,” Purdy said. “I know that I’m the guy for this organization and that I can do what it takes to help lead us where we want to go.”With the extension finalized, Purdy is expected to lead the 49ers back into playoff contention after last year’s disappointing finish.Explore more on these topicsSan Francisco 49ersNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Can the Lynx or Aces thwart a New York repeat? And will Caitlin Clark avoid a sophomore slump?Bryan Armen Graham,Stephanie Kaloi,Andrew LawrenceandTiana RandallFri 16 May 2025 07.12 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 08.17 EDTSharePaige Bueckers is …… H-O-T-T-O-G-O!The 23-year-old rookie star showed zero signs of freshman jitters in the preseason, playing with the signature poise that made her the No 1 pick. Slotted as an opening-night starter, she’s primed to be Dallas’s primary playmaker with her efficiency and comfort on the court setting her apart early.Bryan Armen Graham... a really exciting prospect who is going to surprise people this season, but perhaps not for the reason a lot are thinking.It’s tempting to consider Bueckers’ potential this year based on the rookie yearCaitlin Clarkhad, but the two athletes play a very different game and are very different people. Bueckers is going to be in the league a long, long time, and should be given the space to show us all what she’s made of.Stephanie Kaloi… all-in on Dallas.She’s barely been in the Metroplex a month, and already she’s been spotted behind the glass for the Dallas Stars’ NHL playoff push in a green sweater. It goes to show how committed she is to giving local sports fans a reason to forget about the Cowboys’ woes and the Luka trade, and don’t be surprised if she becomes the next Dallas star to take home rookie of the year honors after the Cowboys’ Micah Parsons.Andrew Lawrence... will need to adjust to a different role at the pro level.Bueckers was the record-breaking leader of the UConn Huskies, leading Geno Auriemma’s teamto an NCAA championshipin her final season. Now with Dallas, she’ll likely take a backseat to veteran Arike Ogunbowale. Her role may shift to more of a facilitator, complementing Ogunbowale’s scoring prowess. This backcourt duo should position Ogunbowale as the star, with Bueckers as her trusted sidekick.Tiana RandallWhat I’m most looking forward toThe evolution of theIndiana Feverunder Caitlin Clark’s leadership.With strategic veteran additions like DeWanna Bonner and Natasha Howard, and a new head coach in Stephanie White, the Fever are poised to transition from a promising team to legitimate contenders.BAGThis season is absolutely one of the most exciting in recent memory.There are tons of things I’m most looking forward to: seeing how Natalie Nakase figures out how to unlock the Valkyries earlier in the game, witnessing what might be one of the greatest Indiana Fever seasons in franchise history, and watching the women in the league collectively step into their power and demand their worth with the upcoming CBA negotiations. This is a very, very exciting time for the W.SKThe new-look LA Sparks.Until Luka was shipped to Los Angeles, the biggest basketball trade going was the one that sent Kelsey Plum to the Sparks a day earlier. After suffering their first single-digit win season in franchise history, the Sparks are hoping Plum can reprise her championship-winning chemistry with top scorer Dericka Hamby and reignite Cameron Brink – the outstanding big whose rookie season was cut short by an ACL tear.ALI’m eager to see Kate Martin step into her leadership role with the expansionGolden State Valkyries.Despite being overshadowed by Caitlin Clark at Iowa and a star-studded Aces roster, Martin’s playmaking ability shined through. With a fresh start, along with new coaches and ownership, it’s her chance to rise or fold under pressure.TRView image in fullscreenPaige Bueckers of the Dallas Wings controls the ball during the second half of a preseason game against the Toyota Antelopes at College Park Center last week.Photograph: Sam Hodde/Getty ImagesBiggest offseason developmentThe Aces’ acquisition of Jewell Loyd in a major three-team trade.This move aims to bolster their offensive firepower and support A’ja Wilson as they seek redemption aftera disappointing 2024 semi-final exit.BAGClearly,Caitlin Clark’s arms!But in all seriousness, thatmonster four-team tradeinvolving the Mercury, Sun, Fever and Wings is going to be looked back on as the catalyst that sparked whatever happens this season.SKSurely it wasthe harassment and bullying scandal that engulfed the Seattle Stormjust as the season ended. The juiciest news line to come out of it was the suggestion that coach Noelle Quinn cut back on Jewell Loyd’s minutes expressly to prevent the perennial all-star from earning a scoring-related performance bonus from Nike. Even though Loyd’s agent would dispute that story, it ultimately resulted in her trade to Las Vegas – where she figures to flourish alongside reigning MVP A’ja Wilson.ALThe offseason shook things up, highlightingtwo new teammate couples: Isabelle Harrison and Natasha Cloud (Liberty) and Dijonai Carrington and Nalyssa Smith (Wings). While professionalism is expected, past incidents suggest personal bonds can blur competitive dynamics. Smith once defended Carrington in on-court confrontations, even against her own teammates. It’s uncharted territory for the league. Will these dynamics impact team chemistry?TRThe surprise team will be …How about theDallas Wings?After a challenging 9–31 season, the infusion of talent like Bueckers, Dijonai Carrington and Myisha Hines-Allen, combined with new leadership, positions them as potential disruptors in the league.BAGI think theGolden State Valkyriesare really going to surprise people. I have been saying this for months: being an expansion team in 2025 is not the same as being an expansion team in 2008. Judging Golden State by Atlanta Dream’s early struggles is a mistake. This team has all the backing from a financial and staffing perspective they could hope for: from 18,000-strong crowds at preseason games to a solid roster of talent that is hungry to prove detractors wrong.SKThePhoenix Mercury. Sure, they lost franchise pillars Diana Taurasi to retirement and Brittney Griner to free agency – but incoming all-stars Satou Sally and Alyssa Thomas should have no trouble filling those voids while playing alongside team cornerstone Kaleah Copper – a finals MVP in 2021 with the Chicago Sky.ALTheWashington Mysticsmissed the playoffs last year as the 11th seed, but there’s real progress happening. Rookies Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen are meshing well with veterans like Britney Sykes and Aliyah Edwards. Their strong preseason showing against the Indiana Fever hints at top-three seed potential, with sharp communication, smart passing and disciplined shot selection.TRView image in fullscreenJewell Loyd, front, is joining a Las Vegas Aces team led by A’ja Wilson, rear, who are out to return to the championship summit.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesOne bold predictionThe Valkyries will defy expectations and secure a playoff spot in their debutWNBAseason.Despite projections as a bottom-three team, their aggressive defensive playstyle and emerging chemistry will push them past more established franchises, making them the league’s biggest surprise of 2025.BAGThe Fever will win the Commissioner’s Cup in the turning point of the season for Caitlin Clark.The new Indiana line-up is exciting but the team will take a few weeks to gel; by the time the in-season tournament rolls around in mid-June, they’re going to be a very different beast. The Lynx won it last year and it was a springboard to their run to the WNBA finals; expect the same for the Fever this season.SKThe Connecticut Sun, who are exploring a potential sale and relocation, wind up moving to Philly for big money, giving the athletic department at the University of South Carolina yet another reason to worry about losing Dawn Staley.ALI predict the Aces will struggle with a “too many cooks in the kitchen” dilemma this season, similar to the Lakers’ star-studded 2025 roster. With Jewell Loyd joining Chelsea Gray, A’ja Wilson and others, I’m not sure Becky Hammon can optimize each player ... or if former stars will accept reduced roles.TRMost Valuable PlayerOne year after becoming only the second player to win the MVP trophyby a unanimous vote,A’ja Wilsonremains the engine of the Aces’ title pursuit. With Becky Hammon’s system built around her dominance and the addition of Jewell Loyd to lighten the offensive pressure, Wilson will edge Collier and Clark in a close race to become the first four-time MVP in WNBA history.BAGI am not the type of person who thinks a new person should win MVP just because someone else has won it a few times already. And just like the Liberty are the best team in the league until proven otherwise, A’ja Wilson is the top player until someone else shows they’re moving in on her spot. Having said that, if/when the Fever take home the Commissioner’s Cup title,Caitlin Clarkwill become a serious MVP threat. I think she’ll win it this season.SKCaitlin Clark. She’s rested, stronger and a much smarter player from her bruising rookie campaign. What’s more, she’ll only benefit from playing alongside veteran newcomers Sydney Colson, Natasha Howard and DeWanna Bonner – among Clark’s biggest ops last season.ALNapheesa Collier. I feel like she’s been passed up for the opportunity for way too long. For one, her playmaking ability is what led the Lynx to the finals last year, where theycame within a couple playsof winning it all. With her knowledge, on-ball skills, team leadership and what she’s done with her off-season training with Unrivaled, I think she’s the easy pick this year.TRView image in fullscreenCaitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever lays on the floor after a challenge during the fourth quarter of a preseason game against the Atlanta Dream at Gateway Center Arena in College Park, Georgia.Photograph: Andrew J Clark/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesPlayoff semi-finalistsIndiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx,New York Liberty.BAGIndiana Fever, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, Seattle Storm.SKIndiana Fever,Las Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty.ALIndiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty.TRYour champion will be …Redemption is the word for theMinnesota Lynx. After a heartbreaking one-possession loss in the 2024 WNBA finals, Cheryl Reeve’s squad returns its full starting lineup, anchored by MVP contender Napheesa Collier. The addition of Karlie Samuelson’s three-point shooting boosts an already cohesive roster. Despite losing Dorka Juhász for the season and Kayla McBride’s late arrival, the Lynx remain loaded, with Diamond Miller and Alissa Pili poised for breakout seasons. In a league spotlighting New York’s firepower and Indiana’s rising star Caitlin Clark, it’s the Lynx who look best positioned to finish the job. A year wiser and driven by unfinished business, Minnesota is primed to seize the moment and win a record fifth WNBA title in 2025.BAGIndiana Fever.A few key elements have to fall into place, but the Fever have potential that’s off the charts. Whether you like her or not, it’s difficult to deny that Clark is more than a generational talent: she’s playing basketball unlikeanywoman who has come before her. Her ability to shoot off the dribble from so far, at any point and any time, is unprecedented in the women’s game, and the rest of her team is talented and complete, to the point that their wins and losses will be based on theirownsynergy. The Fever are hungry, they are the most complete team in the league, and now it’s just a matter of putting the puzzle together. And coach Stephanie White might just be one of the strongest masterminds in the game right now.SKTheMinnesota Lynx. They’ve got the best coach (Cheryl Reeve), arguably the best all-around player (Napheesa Collier) and a core that’s still smarting over last season’s narrow loss to New York in the WNBA finals. If they can start as well as they finished the 2024 season and keep the momentum going through September, there’s no reason why they shouldn’t be the team throwing the confetti party this time around.ALWith the addition of Natasha Cloud and the return of French Olympian Marine Johannès, I think theNew York Libertywill not only be entertaining to watch but will also feed off each other, focusing on more structure and defensive depth. Sabrina Ionescu is a three-point star with shot-making ability, and with Johannès, who can do what Ionescu does if not better, the team gains even more depth and offensive power. They’ve already seen the benefits of being champions, not just socially but also through tangible rewards: numerous brand partnerships, a new practice facility and a stronger roster. I think they’ll be chasing that feeling for as long as they can.TRExplore more on these topicsWNBANew York LibertyLas Vegas AcesGolden State ValkyriesIndiana FeverCaitlin ClarkDallas WingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So infectious was the joy that one home supporter even charged on to the pitch before the match was done. Call his solo pitch invasion passion or stupidity; it was just that kind of feeling.Konsa and Kamara see off Tottenham to maintain Aston Villa’s top-five pushRead moreFor 71 minutes Chelsea had toiled, struggling to find a way past a dismalManchester Unitedteam that have now not won in the Premier League for eight matches. But then came salvation: a sumptuous Reece James pirouette, his beautiful dinked ball to the far post and a powerful header from the floppy-haired Spaniard. Who needs effective attackers when full-backs can provide such delightful goods?With only a visit to Nottingham Forest remaining, Chelsea are guaranteed to occupy a Champions League spot heading into the final day. The battle for Europe’s premier competition is going to the wire.“The win was very important,” said Enzo Maresca. “I think tonight we struggled on the ball because we didn’t expect them to be so aggressive man to man. They surprised us a little bit with that. But we created enough chances to win. From the first to the second half, we deserved to win the game.”So, the overriding positive: Chelsea’s top-five fate remains in their hands with this victory matching that of anAston Villa team who beat Spursbut have a far inferior goal difference.The concern for a season-defining final-day fixture at the City Ground was the almost entire absence of attacking spark on display.Shorn of the suspended Nicolas Jackson for the remainder of the campaign, nor with any senior back-up striker fit and ready for action, Maresca was forced to hand a firstPremier Leaguestart to Tyrique George. Leading the line, the 19-year-old managed just 14 touches all match, failing to generate even a sniff of the United goal, although Maresca insisted he was pleased with George’s performance.The closest the teenager came, on the hour, was when tumbling to the ground under the force of the onrushing André Onana, prompting Chris Kavanagh to point to the spot. Onana was aghast, the referee was sent to the screen and justice prevailed when replays showed a clear goalkeeper glove on the ball.View image in fullscreenMarc Cucurella heads Chelsea’s second-half winner.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesFor all that they dictated vast swathes of the game, the hosts rarely prompted any elevation in Onana’s heart rate, Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke desperately endeavouring – but not managing – to create amid a worrying absence of potency in front of goal. That Madueke failed to double Chelsea’s lead, driving wide when sent clean through with only Onana to beat, spoke volumes.Thankfully Chelsea could call upon their full-backs. James’s pinpoint cross for the goal came without so much as a glance up to check where the delivery was required, while Cucurella’s header was unstoppable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People like to write us off and call us young, but it’s an experienced Manchester United team and we did what we needed to do.”So what of United? An 18th league defeat of the season is their worst tally since 1973-74, and they managed just one shot on target all match.That statistic does not include the solitary time they did have the ball in the Chelsea net 16 minutes in. The game was goalless at that point when Harry Maguire, displaying his newly developed penchant for masquerading as a centre-forward, expertly turned Bruno Fernandes’s inswinging cross goalwards. Replays showed his shoulder was a couple of inches offside as the ball was delivered.Of course, United’s dreadful season rendered this match little more than a sideshow for them before Wednesday’s Europa League final with Tottenham. Unlike Ange Postecoglou – who fielded an almost entirely second-string Spurs side in the defeat at Villa – Ruben Amorim risked naming perhaps the strongest XI at his disposal here in a change of tack from thedefeat by West Hamlast time out.“If I put some players out it would be 10 days without a game,” he explained. “I don’t like that. I think the best way to prepare for the final is just to compete. We are Manchester United so we need to compete in every game.”They barely did here, but his players all departed Stamford Bridge with a clean bill of health, which is of far greater importance for now.

Afterwards Unai Emery, mindful of the power of those profitability and sustainability calculations, did not exactly extinguish suggestions this could have been Martínez’s final game at Villa Park.Martínez played his part in a huge win for Villa in their attempt to qualify again for the Champions League, though they may still require favours. Emery checked his phone as he entered his post-match press conference to see confirmation ofChelsea’s win over Manchester United.Chelsea close in on Champions League after Cucurella sinks Manchester UnitedRead more“We are winning but it’s not in our hands,” the Villa manager said. Asked if this could be Martínez’s final home match, Emery replied: “I don’t know, we will see about the team, the players … we will see about everything, how we are going to try and get better for the new season.”For Postecoglou, it was another unedifying defeat and as preparation for Wednesday’s Europa League final against Manchester United goes, this was another demoralising takeaway. By the end the early promise of their fit-again captain, Son Heung-min, had fizzled out. At this point it is intriguing to consider quite how many bruising results Spurs can stomach in one season. This was their 25th defeat of the campaign in all competitions, equalling the club record for a single season, set in 1991-92, and Tottenham have now lost eight of their past 11 top-flight matches.Postecoglou made three changes from Sunday’sdefeat by Crystal Palacebut Son and Wilson Odobert, who filled in for the injured Dejan Kulusevski, may be the only ones to start both here and in Spain. The January signing Antonin Kinsky again deputised for Guglielmo Vicario, who was on the bench, and the defensive trio of Destiny Udogie, Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven trained at Spurs’s base rather than travelling to Villa Park, a decision Postecoglou defended.“They stayed at home, did a really strong session and come Wednesday they are all available and that is the most important thing,” the Spurs manager said. “When those guys play, with Vic in goal, our chances of success significantly improve.”View image in fullscreenUnai Emery said he ‘didn’t know’ if this would prove to be Emi Martínez’s last game at Villa Park.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThat soundbite was a damning if unsurprising indictment for the rest of them, including Sergio Reguilón, who was drafted in for his first Premier League start of the season and his first for Tottenham since April 2022, when Antonio Conte was in charge. His last appearance came in theFA Cup third round at Tamworthand since Spurs were taken to extra time there it has felt like a never-ending sticky patch. There seemed more bad news when Pape Matar Sarr departed early in the second half with a back problem but Postecoglou said his withdrawal was precautionary.Until scoring Villa appeared a touch fraught, a little too keen to record a win that moves them level with Newcastle. Spurs also had a couple of decent chances, Martínez making a superb save with his foot after 16 minutes to repel Odobert’s flicked effort. Moments earlier Martínez fumed at how far Odobert was allowed to carry the ball before locating Son, who sent a powerful shot against a stanchion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Emery waved his players forward and hopped on the touchline. Then Kevin Danso blocked an Ian Maatsen shot and at the subsequent corner Villa sparked into life. John McGinn sent the ball towards the back post, where Ollie Watkins directed a header towards the six-yard box and Ezri Konsa, after eluding his marker, Mathys Tel, sent a shot in through the legs of the Spurs substitute Yves Bissouma. Konsa credited Villa’s set piece coach, Austin MacPhee. “We worked on that specific corner and it came off,” the England defender said.Postecoglou, arms folded, swivelled in the dugout wearing that familiar despondent face. Things could have spiralled for Spurs but a minute later Kinsky made a smart save after the ball trickled through to Watkins. Villa’s home form has been imperious, their sole league defeat in another sparkling campaign coming against Arsenal here in August, and they assumed total control.Spurs were shot and on 73 minutes Boubacar Kamara sidestepped Bissouma on the edge of the box before rattling a low shot past Kinsky. At the time Spurs were readying a double change. Dominic Solanke and Rodrigo Bentancur entered and Brennan Johnson, a former Villa target, was later introduced off the bench. Postecoglou has to pray that potentially wholesale changes on Wednesday will bring a happy ending to an otherwise truly torrid season. It has been that way for a while.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Asked if his preference would be for it to take place on Wednesday or Thursday instead, Guardiola said: “Definitely. Tottenham played against Aston Villa on Friday ahead of the Europa League final [on Wednesday]. Good decision, I’m not being sarcastic. ThePremier Leaguemade a good decision, very good.Rúben Dias sets sights on season redemption with City in FA Cup finalRead more“We played all the time on Wednesday and [then] we play on Saturday,” Guardiola said of previous seasons’ turnarounds beforeFA Cupsemi-finals after Champions League quarter-finals. “This season we didn’t play [in a Champions League quarter-final] and we played [on] Sunday [in the FA Cup]. We didn’t need that day extra. People say it [the schedule] is for broadcasters, more fans or followers and other things. The previous year they had more followers on the other game, not our game. They are tired of seeing us.“We have been fighting against these situations for nine years, every single season and nothing goes. We are going to play Tuesday night against one of the most intense and physical and direct and powerful teams in the Premier League – Bournemouth, who are playing for the Europa League or Conference qualification. It will be tough.”The FA Cup final will be Kevin De Bruyne’s last chance to add a 20th major honour to his City résumé before he leaves the club in the summer. “When he plays for us, we want to do it for him,” Guardiola said. “He lifted 18, 19 trophies in nine, 10 years. Not bad I would say. Maybe he is not the first to lift but he’s lifted them. One more would be good.”Guardiola was asked if Rodri has any chance of being available to face Crystal Palace having been out of action since suffering a serious knee injury in a 2-2 draw with Arsenal in September. “I’m waiting on the doctors,” the manager said. “When they tell me he’s ready, he’s going to start. We don’t want to take a risk and make a setback.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaFA CupPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Will Hughes strolls across the car park to get some photographs taken. As it happens, the man emerging from the gym at that very moment is theCrystal Palacemidfield-partner whose praises Hughes has just been lavishly exalting.“Just added about £20m to your fee in that interview,” Hughes shouts at Adam Wharton as they pass. “You can have half,” Wharton retorts. All delivered with a knowing smile, for this is the Palace of Oliver Glasner, where – as Hughes puts it – “there’s egos, but good egos”. No arrogance, none of the blame culture he sees elsewhere. “You watch other teams and hands are in the air, there’s moaning,” he says. “But I honestly don’t see any of that here.”It’s the week of the FA Cup final and there’s a frisson in the air. But Hughes is happy to talk about anything and everything:the good, the bad, the ridiculous. What the first trophy of his career would mean. How a wispy teenage No 10 turned into one of the Premier League’s toughest, most reliable midfielders. Why VAR is “shit”. Whether he was ever as good as everyone said he was. Why he doesn’t really watch football.The last point, dropped in casually near the end of the interview, is perhaps most startling of all. Were Hughes not playing in theFA Cupfinal, it’s not entirely certain he would be watching it. “I don’t watch any football,” he says. “I used to when I was younger. Now I like to switch off away from the game. I like EastEnders.”But then this has always been a player built slightly different. The private-school kid forged in a tough Derby County dressing room, the elegant passer who adores a crunching tackle, the guy groomed as the next star of English football, but who doesn’t even do social media.There is a YouTube video from 2012 entitled “Will Hughes – The Next Great English Midfielder.” Hughes was 17. By this point he had already made his Derby debut, played for England Under-21s and was being compared to Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Jack Wilshere. Glasner alluded to this recently when he said: “I was told that when Will was 19 he was one of the best passers in English football. I don’t know what happened between.”So what happened between? Was he actually as good as that? How much of the hype was just hype? “I don’t want to put myself down,” he says, “but I never did anything to warrant that. People say I’ve not achieved what I should have. If I’d scored 10-15 goals for three consecutive seasons, then I could hold my hands up. But there was nothing that warranted that sort of hype.“I’m very self-critical. One of my strong points is I know what I’m good at and what I’m not good at. [Eberechi] Eze and [Michael] Olise, they can do things with a ball that I could never do in a million years. But I was trustworthy on the pitch. That’s the most important thing for a manager.”At which point it feels like an appropriate moment to talk about Wharton: another left-footed midfield boy-king tipped for greatness. “On the ball, frightening,” Hughes says. “Levelsabove what I am. Some of the things he does – how he’s seen that? There’s no stats for some of the stuff he does: breaking up play, passing through the lines. The most important thing is he’s humble. As long as he keeps that, he can go to the very top.”In a way Hughes was lucky. At Derby he was steeped in a culture of humility and hard work, surrounded by senior players who would give him a rattle if he ever started to believe his own hype. “Unfortunately, for a lot of young players now, that’s not the case,” he says. “A lot of people will tell them what they want to hear.View image in fullscreenWill Hughes (left) in a typically tenacious tackle with Tottenham’s Mathys Tel.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters“I don’t like the limelight. But the game moves on, generationally. Younger players are on social media, which is absolutely fine, but you’ve got to remember the priority is football. There’s those who get caught in that blurred line, and want to be a celebrity first. Which I think is sad. I don’t want to sit here and be miserable about it. But the game I fell in love with when I was a young kid is completely different.”An old-school character, then, on and off the pitch. At Watford and then at Palace, Hughes gradually adapted his game, moved further back, started getting his hands dirty. “I’ve always had that grit,” he insists. “It’s gone out of the game a bit now, it feels like every tackle now is a potential booking. But that’s on players as well, making a meal out of every single foul.” Eleven bookings this season suggests as much, although as Hughes adds with a smile: “Some of those were necessary.”‘If it had been a film, we’d have won’: former Palace finalists share Cup memoriesRead moreTalk of discipline brings us on to the over-officiating of the game, the way VAR slows every tackle down in microscopic detail. “I hate it, I absolutely hate it,” he says. “I just think it’s ridiculous when an official has to look at it 10 times. There’s obviously a line of endangering the opponent, but I think 90% of them [red-card tackles] are subjective. Referees talk about ‘progressivity of tackles’, which I just can’t get my head around. It’s an aggressive game.”What if footballers felt empowered to challenge the status quo? To organise, to mobilise, to declare with one voice that VAR is … “Shit?” Hughes replies. “But there’s many players that think it’s a good thing. That it protects them. Obviously there’s a line. But I think generally fans want to see that intensity, the back and forth of the game.”Which, coincidentally, is a pretty good way of describing Glasner’s Palace: an aggressive 3-4-3 that will fight you all over the pitch, that can cut you open with speed, transition and width. “I’ve learned things under this manager that I’ve never seen in my career,” Hughes says. “The level of detail, on and off the ball, is so clear. If I was to play left wing-back I wouldn’t begood, but I’d know the role.”By way of example Hughes thinks back tothe equaliser Nottingham Forest scoredat Selhurst Park a couple of weeks ago, a scruffy deflected shot from 20 yards. “I should have been two or three yards closer to the edge of the box, which would have stopped the goal,” he laments. “It’s not obvious on TV that it’s my fault. But everyone in the team and on the management staff would know. These are the details many people don’t realise.”View image in fullscreenWill Hughes: ‘People don’t realise that in football, longevity is a massive thing. You see so many players that do well for a year or two.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianHughes is now 30, a player of 181 appearances in the Premier League and none for England. While Wharton and Eze and Marc Guéhi and Dean Henderson jet off for international breaks, he looks forward to a little family time. “Again, without putting myself down,” he says, “there are a lot better players than me in that England squad. You wish you could. But there’s not one part of me that thinks I should.”Go back through the England Under-21 teams that Hughes was part of a decade ago and while some of the players involved shot to fame – Harry Kane, Jack Grealish, John Stones – others sank without trace. So how does Hughes measure his career? Did he fulfil the talent he actually had, rather than the talent everyone assumed he did? “It’s a good question,” he says after a pause for thought. “Yeah, I think I have. People don’t realise that in football, longevity is a massive thing. You see so many players that do well for a year or two.”What would really seal the deal is a trophy at Wembley. Hughes has had a bite of this cherry before: in 2019 his Watford team reached the FA Cup final against Manchester City, only to getblown away 6-0. “Some teams you play against just suit you,” he says. “For us, the last couple of years, I think it’s been [Aston] Villa. Watford and City just wasn’t a good combination. And their squad was just frightening. So a mixed day. Pride to get to the final, but losing by that amount, there’s a tint of embarrassment.”View image in fullscreenWill Hughes after the 2019 FA Cup final when his Watford team were thrashed 6-0 by Manchester City.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesHughes has no idea whether he’s starting on Saturday. Either way, he’s ready. An old-school player who has always measured his career by enjoyment rather than engagement, by metres run rather than milestones ticked off, now has a chance to achieve something tangible. Something that will last for ever. Or as he puts it: “Getting to the final is one thing.

They have signed a long-term deal with Hill Dickinson, which was founded in Liverpool in 1810 and has expanded into Europe and Asia in recent years.Everton fans on the end of a Goodison era: ‘I’ll be thinking about my dad, my brothers, my son’Read moreNeither party has announced the length or financial terms of the deal but Everton claim it is “one of the largest stadium naming rights deals in Europe”. That would value the deal at around £10m per year.USM, the holding company of Alisher Usmanov, paid £30m for an exclusive option on naming rights for the new stadium in 2020 only for Everton to cut ties with the oligarch’s companies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

It looks as if it’s continuing to grow.“We’ve got to watch that we don’t stay in the past. We have got to move on. Everton need a new stadium, undoubtedly. I know we love Goodison but the facilities behind the scenes need redoing and people are looking for much more now in life. It will still attract the same people, the same people will go.

Coleman has struggled with injuries this season, starting only one Premier League game, and the 36-year-old’s deal is due to expire this summer.Moyes said: “The plan is to keep him on a playing contract but we’ll decide when we need to use him and when we won’t.

The staff explained the opportunity that is within his physique to go to a different level. He got on board with that.“You can see his presence and I think he destroyed all the metrics that we had in the gym for the last 10 years. All of them. Power, acceleration, muscle mass, the way that he has increased certain capacities in his body, his agility, he’s been incredible. I was talking to the medical staff the other day and they were talking about that. For someone that is not in the team to have that mindset, the only thing he has done is raise the standards in the building because the other ones who are injured were looking at him [saying]: ‘I’m going to look bad if I don’t do the same.’”Arsenal have played without a recognised striker since losing Havertz. Gabriel Jesus was out with a knee injury, forcing Arteta to push Mikel Merino further forward. It is not a surprise that signing a No 9 this summer is a priority for Arsenal, who have Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko on their radar – and Arteta is hopeful that the club’s finances can be flexible enough.“The budget is like when you plan your wedding with your wife, [or] when you build a house … [the budget] is always more,” Arteta said. “You prepare for different scenarios. Sometimes we want a player and suddenly we have an injury or that player gets injured. There are so many variables that can happen but there is a budget.

Skinner, sitting at the training ground for an exclusive interview, says: “Last season I felt that we’d lost a little bit of the hunger that we need as a team. When you don’t have the most resources in the country, we need the hunger, we need to be hungrier than those teams.“The season before, for us to finish second in that season and get to an FA Cup final, if you balance the success versus the budget, it’s an incredible achievement. So I think it had just softened us, and then what we did after last season, when we dropped to fifth, was we assessed what we were missing. And I felt like we were missing a little bit of experience but also the physicality. We’ve absolutely found that hunger again this year.”Skinner’s reference to the playing budget in 2022-23 is backed by publicly available figures in each club’s financial accounts, which show that United’s wage bill (£3.4m) was a little more than half of Arsenal’s (£6.2m) and Chelsea’s (£6.1m). Nonetheless, there was naturally a negative tone to coverage of United when they dropped to fifth and then several senior players left in quick succession, including Mary Earps, the captain Katie Zelem and Spain’s Lucía García. They have defied those departures to qualify for Europe for the second time. But what was the mood like on the inside?View image in fullscreenMarc Skinner and Millie Turner lift the FA Cup after the 2024 final win against Tottenham Women.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/Shutterstock“There was a lot of stuff going about that just wasn’t true,” Skinner says. “Mary chose to move on, Zel at that moment was embarking on a different situation for her and Lucía was getting a lucrative deal somewhere else, so we were almost forced to reinvent. Now we’re new, we’re fresh. Reinventing the team at that point has allowed us to have a reinvigoration, and that’s what we held on to.“Omar [Berrada, the CEO] has come in, there’s a freshness at the club, and we’ve changed as a team, a club, so those are the things that we just embraced. Embrace the fact that football is chaos. If you can control chaos and live in the space of chaos, you can be successful.”Berrada is part of the regime that has been in charge for about 15 months. Ineos is often perceived to treat the women’s team as second best but Skinner is more than satisfied with its engagement: “They’re ever-present. They’re going through the challenge of trying to make Manchester United great again, and yet they’re still present. Instantly, as soon as we got the result against [Manchester] City [to qualify for the Champions League], Omar, Collette [Roche, the chief operating officer] and Jason [Wilcox, the technical director] were messaging me.“As a club, we’re moving toward statistical analysis for recruitment, and the women have been built into part of that package. We are as part of that as the men are. I can honestly genuinely say that, whatever is reported, I feel the support every day.”The owners have backed Skinner with a new contract until 2027, with the option of an extra year, after giving him a one-year deal last summer, which he describes as “a holding space to see if we matched the Ineos projection” for the women’s team. “I’ve signed here because I can win here,” he says. “We’ve got challenges, we’ve got to beat this hold that Chelsea have on the league and obviously Arsenal and Manchester City are trying to do the same thing, but I want to challenge ourselves to bring success to the fans.”Quick GuideWomen's FA Cup gets new TV dealShowThe Women’s FA Cup will be broadcast on Channel 4 and TNT Sports from next season in a three-year rights deal with the Football Association. They succeed the BBC as the broadcasters in the first standalone deal for the competition.The BBC extended its Women's FA Cup deal in 2019, agreeing to air both semi-finals and the final and to put out highlight reels and short videos.The new deal will bring a significant increase in the number of games broadcast live, with coverage guaranteed from the first round. TNT is to air 19 matches across the season and Channel 4 has committed to one match per round from the third round, with all six matches co-exclusive with TNT, which also holds rights to the men’s FA Cup and men’s FA Youth Cup.The Football Association's chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said: “This is a significant moment for the Adobe Women’s FA Cup. We have two broadcast partners who are deeply committed to growing the competition and taking it to new audiences over the next three seasons. Channel 4 and TNT are brilliant sports broadcasters and are the perfect combination for this very special tournament. We are delighted to be working with them and look forward to continuing to grow women’s football together.”Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Those supporters are preparing for a third consecutive FA Cup final at Wembley.

The only sanity for me is when I even read comments around Pep Guardiola. And let me be clear, I’m not comparing myself to Pep Guardiola. I’m just saying, the successes that guy has had and then I see people calling for him to be sacked? It’s crazy.“If a coach has lost the players, it’s clear, I think, and I’ve never once felt like that here. When we qualified [for the Champions League], I had a couple of players just saying: ‘You deserve that coach as well, for all the things you have to drive us through and all the scrutiny.’ And in the future when I’m not in this job, I don’t think I’ll face the same scrutiny. It’s the scrutiny of Manchester United because of how big and varied the fanbase is.View image in fullscreenMarc Skinner proudly shows off his FA Cup winners’ medal at Wembley. He gave it to his elder daughter.Photograph: Charlotte Tattersall/MUFC/Manchester United/Getty Images“The reality is, some media go looking for that story because it’s juicier. Whereas, how many interviews, honestly, have you done with fans where they go: ‘Marc, at the end of the Old Trafford game, waited behind and signed everything for all the kids, took all the photos and didn’t go until everyone had finished’? You don’t hear that, right? Because people don’t want to hear, but that’s my character.“I’ve even heard comments around me being ‘David Brent-esque’ because I share anecdotes and I try and bring an interview to life, rather than just go: ‘Yes, no.’ It’s because I genuinely care about the women’s game, I’ve been in it since grassroots.“If people actually spoke to me, which they don’t always get a chance to, I think they’d realise that I’m doing it for the fans. My job is to supply success to the fans.”As our interview concludes, Skinner points out a huge image emblazoned on the walls outside the women’s team offices depicting last year’s Cup-winning side standing in front of a backdrop of United fans, all in red, at Wembley. It is a sight he desperately wants to see again on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenWomen's FA CupWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the main reason why Fifa has lost its social licence. Instead of calling out the Trump administration on its pernicious policies, Infantino has become part of his travelling entourage. Infantino claimed these were vital meetings with Trump and Gulf leaders, but why would that take priority over the congress, the only annual opportunity for national associations to feed into football governance? The fact he couldn’t be bothered to show up shows a papal conclave has more accountability than a congress.”Uefa did not expand on Friday onits explosive statement, with insiders suggesting “the point was made”. But there remains anger within European football’s governing body, with executives describing Infantino as following Trump “like a puppy” and his treatment of the congress as “disrespectful and arrogant”. One senior figure told the Guardian: “The guy has lost it.”Some figures within Uefa even sense Infantino’s actions have jeopardised his prospects of a fourth term in office when Fifa’s next election comes around in 2027, although his position is currently shored up by a significant level of global backing.Victor Montagliani, the head of Concacaf, which oversees football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, told reporters he did not support the walkout. “Two wrongs don’t make a right,” he said. On Friday the South American football confederation, Conmebol, said it was to name a new extension to its hotel complex in the Paraguayan capital, Asunción, the Infantino tower.A Fifa meeting scheduled for Miami in June, in the month the controversial Club World Cup is to kick off in the US state, could be the next flashpoint, with some European nations saying they are working on how to drive forward the issue of governance within Fifa by then.At congress Infantino apologised on stage for his absence several times and said it was important he represented football at the meetings. “As president of Fifa my responsibility is to make decisions in the interests of the organisation,” Infantino said. “I felt that I needed to be there to represent football and all of you.”Fifa has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsGianni InfantinoFifaDonald TrumpFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mark Bonnick, who worked at the club from the early 2000s, alleges his dismissal was “discriminatory” owing to it being based on his “philosophical anti-Zionist belief”.Bonnick was suspended and then sacked in December 2024 after Arsenal were alerted to a series of posts he had made on social media referring to Israel’s war in Gaza. Bonnick says that his posts were not antisemitic but motivated by legitimate anti-Zionist beliefs.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In his legal submission, Bonnick refers to five replies on X in November and December last year, including: “Yes it is all about Jewish supremacy & not wanting to share the land Ethnic cleansing”; “Why should they be protected anymore than any other community? Some see this as the problem Jewish communities thinking they should be put before others”; “What about the Jews that attack Christians?”Bonnick’s posts also said “Hamas offered to release all hostages in October. Zionist Israel refused. Persecution complex”; and on that offer he also posted: “You abandoned them … Refused to bring them home … Your silence was deafening … Now you want others to scream … Morals integrity honesty none … Mark of Cain.”Bonnick says his reference to “Mark of Cain” was aquote from a statementmade by Israel’s then defence minister, Yoav Gallant, the previous month.Bonnick told the Guardian he was taking the legal action in an attempt to restore his reputation, which he argues has been sullied by allegations of antisemitism. According to Bonnick’s submission Arsenal’s investigation into the posts did not accuse him of antisemitism but said they could be “perceived as inflammatory or offensive” and had “brought the club into disrepute”. Bonnick is seeking damages and reinstatement.Bonnick said: “I want them to acknowledge what they’ve done to me is wrong and that they should not have sacked me. I believe in standing up for what’s right, especially when you see injustice, and I feel strongly against what Israel is doing in Gaza.“I’ve tweeted on various issues, including football, Brexit, racism, knife crime and politics. It only became a problem when I tweeted about Israel, which led to a pile-on online and people contacting the club.”Bonnick, 61, who worked his way up from casual Arsenal coaching roles in the early 2000s to a full-time kitman position supporting the youth teams, says he was devastated by the way he was “discarded” after years of service.His claim – which is expected to be heard next year – alleges that Arsenal acted unfairly and without due process. It accuses the club of bowing to online pressure in what he describes as a “kneejerk response to manufactured outrage”.Bonnick was sacked on 24 December and lost his appeal against the sacking on 14 February.His lawyers citethe case of the academic David Millerwhere an employment tribunal found his “anti-Zionist” beliefs qualified as a “philosophical belief and a protected characteristic” under the Equality Act 2010.His lawyer, Franck Magennis, who is being instructed by the European Legal Support Centre, said: “Mark Bonnick was right to speak out, in accordance with his deeply held anti-Zionist beliefs, against Israel’s nakedly racist violence and the colonial ideology that justifies it. Arsenal FC dismissed him in an unfair and discriminatory manner; they should admit their mistake and give him his job back.”Arsenal were approached for comment.According to Bonnick’s submission, he was told by Arsenal’s representative after an investigation: “The comments you made on ‘X’ could be perceived as inflammatory or offensive. And as a result, your posts on ‘X’ brought the club into disrepute. This breached the terms of your employment contract and the club’s social media policy, which explicitly states that social media must not be used in a way that brings the club into disrepute.“While we recognise the comments were made from your personal ‘X’ account, the account was set to ‘public’, and in your own name and it was clearly possible to identify you as an employee of the club. Engaging in online debate on such controversial topic and making comments that were found to be highly offensive and inflammatory, displayed a complete lack of judgment and disregard for the club’s policies and values. I also feel that your conduct and poor judgement has irreparably damaged the relationship of trust between you, the club, its supporter communities and employees. That’s why we’ve come to this decision.”This article was amended on 16 May 2025 to clarify that Mark Bonnick is suing Arsenal for unfair dismissal; a previous version referred to “wrongful dismissal”.Explore more on these topicsArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

He had marched past every challenge in his path, reaching the semi-finals without dropping a set.Consistent excellence in professional tennis, however, also means finding solutions when things aren’t going well. Sinner handled his first real challenge in Rome spectacularly well, recovering from heavily losing the first set to smother Tommy Paul of the United States 1-6, 6-0, 6-3. “These kind of matches I need,” said Sinner. “I’m happy how we handled this kind of situation, especially going on court and not feeling great.”From early positivity to cursing on court: how the Djokovic-Murray partnership ended | Tumaini CarayolRead moreThe victory sent him into the final on his return from a three-month anti-doping suspension and set up the dream scenario for the tournament, a rekindling of the rivalry that will probably define the new generation of men’s tennis.Sinner will faceCarlos Alcaraz, the third seed, on Sunday after the Spaniard demonstrated his improving discipline and consistency by remaining solid in difficult windy conditions to defeat the eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti of Italy 6-3, 7-6 (4).“He’s playing great,” said Alcaraz on the possibility of facing Sinner. “I’ve been watching his matches.

As Sinner continued to impose relentless pressure with his brutal, metronomic groundstrokes, Paul buckled.By the time the Italian led 2-0 in set three, after winning eight games in a row, he was in complete control. There was, however, one final twist. At 3-1, Sinner threw in a loose service game to give back the break. After shaking out his leg earlier in the set, his limp between points had gradually become more pronounced.Within the rallies, however, Sinner continued to chase down every ball and continued his dominance from the baseline with his far greater pace and weight of shot as he closed out another supreme win. “I hope to recover in the best possible way,” said Sinner on his physical issues. “Since a couple of matches [I have had] a blister under the foot, which then some other muscles, they work. I’m not concerned about my leg. Hopefully the blister is going to be healed as fast as possible. But in any case, as I said, there are no excuses, no? I’m in the final.

It was the 26-year-old’s first outing since announcing he would beleaving his boyhood clubwhen his contract expires at the end of the season, with a free transfer to Real Madrid lined up.Premier League and FA Cup final: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreLiverpool players made clear their dismay at Alexander-Arnold’s treatment after Sunday’s game. In an interview with Sky Sports, recorded this week in Dubai, the Egypt international added his voice to a controversy that has threatened to overshadow the end of a triumphant season for the new Premier League champions.Salah said: “I told him [Alexander-Arnold] yesterday: ‘Do not give me eye contact in your farewell,’ because I really love him. He deserves the best farewell leaving the club. He has done a lot for the city and a lot for the club. He was probably the best homegrown player in the club’s history and he needed a new challenge. He spoke to me about it. It is his decision, for sure.“He is 26 years old and a league title winner twice. What more could he have done? He needs to change and challenge himself. People do not know about it much, but he is 20 years in the club. It is so tough mentally for someone to be 20 years in a club. It is the place you love, yes. I love the place. But going every day to the same place, mentally you could be depressed. I really wish him the best. I will always be in contact with him. The fans have been harsh with him. He didn’t deserve that because he gave it all to the fans.”View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold (centre) applauds the fans after the draw against Arsenal at Anfield, but some Liverpool fans booed him.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAAsked if he was saddened by events at Anfield last weekend, Salah replied: “Yes, absolutely. I was surprised because it is not how we react as Liverpool fans. We shouldn’t react this way with anyone. We always appreciate the people who came here, even if it was for six months. Imagine someone who gave his all for 20 years. It shouldn’t be like this and I hope it will change in the next game – Brighton or the last game of the season – because he deserves a farewell.“It is his decision. I know 20 years at the club is so tough. People think it is easy to make a decision and just stay. No, it’s not. I didn’t want to speak to him much because I want him in my team, but I understand because being in one place for 20 years is not easy.”Unlike Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool’s leading goalscorer recently committed himself to the club for another two years. Salah admitted he was only 10% sure he would sign a new contract at Anfield at the start of the season because of the approach taken towards older players by the club’s American owner, Fenway Sports Group.He said: “I’m not attacking them, just I know how they deal with players over 30 in the past and I know how the situation will be, so I never expect that the club was going to be like: ‘OK, two years with the money, and all of us are happy.’ So I didn’t expect that I’m going to stay. It’s in my head, based on club philosophy, [that] I will not stay. I know how the club works, it’s not something that is bad, it’s just we see how they deal with a situation like this in the past.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think the club was testing me to see if I can still provide or not! I didn’t want more than that [two years].”Meanwhile, Arne Slot has challenged Federico Chiesa to come back fitter for pre-season and force his way into the team. The Italian moved to the club from Juventus in August but has made only five substitute appearances in the league.“Does he have a future here? Yes, definitely he has,” Slot said. “I think everyone playing for us has a future over here. He has hardly been fit for the first half-season but then afterwards he became fitter and fitter. The next steps should have been playing time, which I couldn’t give him. But I can give him playing time in pre-season, so he can build himself up and then go even further.“Unfortunately for him he is in competition with Mo Salah when it is about the right wing but I think he can also play as a left winger.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahTrent Alexander-ArnoldnewsShareReuse this content"

He was in town to cover Super Bowl LIX weekend inNew Orleans.Adan Manzano, a 27-year-old reporter and television anchor based in Kansas City, Missouri, whose Chiefs were playing in theSuper Bowl, suffocated while lying face down on a pillow.Alcohol and the depressant Xanax were later found in his system. Colbert was captured on security footage leaving Manzano’s hotel room in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner, police said.Colbert and another person still face second-degree murder charges in Jefferson parish, Louisiana, which includes Kenner.“The evidence was overwhelming that this woman was a serial fraudster and took advantage of multiple tourists and innocent people over many years in the French Quarter,” Murrill said in an emailed statement.Colbert’s attorney Jerome Matthews did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Stavros Panagoulopoulos, the lawyer representing Colbert in the second-degree murder case, declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsNew OrleansUS crimeSuper BowlNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The actual financial terms were not reported.The club won the sixth MLS Cup title in club history last season despite missing star midfielder Riqui Puig due to an ACL injury. That title triggered a one-year extension for Vanney through this season.American investment in soccer will soon face a stern opponent: itselfRead moreAmid some roster changes, while Puig remains out, Los Angeles has gotten off to a disastrous 0-10-3 start this season. No MLS club has ever gone 13 games to start a season without a victory.The contract extension comes as the club lauded Vanney’s “vision” for the road ahead.“Greg is one of the most respected and successful coaches in MLS history and we are excited to be continuing under his leadership,” general manager Will Kuntz said in a release. “While this season’s results haven’t reflected our standards, this was a decision made following our 2024 MLS Cup victory and we remain confident in the project we are building with Greg.”Vanney played seven seasons with the Galaxy, starting his MLS career with the club from 1996-2001. He played four seasons in France before returning to MLS with FC Dallas, the Colorado Rapids and DC United, then finished his playing days with the Galaxy in 2008.Vanney led the Galaxy to a 19-8-7 record in the 2024 regular season, which was capped by a run through the playoffs that culminated with a 2-1 victory over the New York Red Bulls in the MLS Cup final.He has a 54-56-39 record in five seasons as Galaxy head coach. He previously coached Toronto FC from 2014-20.“I’m honored to continue this journey with a club that has meant so much to me,” Vanney said in a release. “We know we haven’t started this season the way we intended, but we believe in the group, in the process, and in what we’re building. I’m fully committed to our players, our fans, and this organization, and I’m excited for what’s ahead.”In addition to signing Vanney to an extension, the club hired Ravi Ramineni to the newly created role of director of quantitative analysis, promoted former midfielder Juninho to senior advisor to the general manager, and promoted Zack Murshedi to director of team administration and player care.Explore more on these topicsLA GalaxyMLSUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Hardly a provocative topic in the grand scheme of life. A chunk of soil attaches itself to a golf ball, meaning the individual hitting said object has less control than they would like.Scottie Schefflerand others believe the element of chance created by mud balls at the US PGA Championship is unbefitting of a major. There is an opposing view, one which says golf is not supposed to be perfect or fair. It’s a run-of-the-mill sporting debate.Scheffler had volunteered his own mud ball situationas rationale for a shot that flew into water on the 16th hole during round one at Quail Hollow. Within only three more questions, the world No 1 wanted to shut the conversation down. “By the way, this is going to be the last answer that I give [on this subject],” Scheffler began. Scheffler, once such a placid soul, was dictating what he may and may not be asked. About golf balls.US PGA Championship 2025: golf updates from second round – liveRead moreTwelve months ago Scheffler was more expansive on the ludicrous situation that saw himthrown into a police cell before his US PGA second round. A self-deprecating, non-accusatory and considerate Scheffler earned widespread plaudits for the way he handled a road traffic farrago. Yet 12 months is a long time in golf; the past year has seen relations between players and the media strain to a fascinating point.Golfers generally live a charmed life when it comes to coverage. That much was evident when a batch of them departed traditional tours for the Saudi Arabian-backed LIV equivalent. Criticism, occasionally vehement and personal, rattled those on the receiving end because this was uncharted territory. They should try being Premier League footballers for a week; front pages, back pages, everything in between.A snapshot of this placid environment can be found all the way back in 2005. Tiger Woods revealed he had been especially pensive during two minutes of silence at the Open Championship because his mother had been in a hotel close to where one of the previous week’s London bombs had gone off. The next question put to Woods went thus: “How many holes here today do you think you hit with a wedge into a green after a drive?” The four horsemen of the apocalypse looked less vengeful than journalists with an element of news sense who wanted to extract further information about Kultida Woods’s situation.View image in fullscreenCollin Morikawa dismissed media questions after he had thrown away a three-shot lead in the Arnold Palmer Invitational this year.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPACollin Morikawa escalated the more recent theme after explaining his failure to stop for media duties having tossed away the Arnold Palmer Invitational. “I don’t owe anyone anything,” said Morikawa. There will be no argument from the latest breed of golf agents, too many of whom are either terrified of their clients or fail to recognise what a positive or interesting media profile can return.Unlike in other American sports, golfers have no contractual obligation to speak to the press upon completion of rounds. Morikawa was well within his rights to walk on at Bay Hill but had to do a better job of explaining why.Golf, and partly the schism in elite golf, has made players such as Morikawa filthy rich. That plus reams of talent of course. With that status comes entitlement. A harsh reality is Morikawa – the fourth-ranked player on the planet, a two-time major winner – and umpteen others on the Quail Hollow leaderboard could walk the streets in the world’s major cities without those beyond dedicated golf fans turning heads. This anonymity is great for the players – Woods never had it – but speaks to their lack of wider appeal. One European Ryder Cup player once bemoaned the fact his finest ever year on thePGA Tourwould not have ranked him among the top 50 paid players in Major League Baseball. I responded by stressing his ability to go about his life in peace and quiet as a polite way of saying: “Nobody knows who you are.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The question was indeed clumsy and ill-timed. Lowry suggested golfers should be allowed to go away and compose themselves before appearing in front of a camera. Tennis players are often afforded such leeway. There are obvious flaws with the plan; for journalists on deadlines, for those wanting the verbal sparks that can fly straight from the course and on the basis golfers could just slip off before paying any paltry fine which arises as a penalty. Lowry did not talk after the Truist Championship slipped from his grasp last weekend, which was fair enough. The media would have been imposing on personal grief. The same applies to McIlroy at last summer’s US Open.McIlroy’s Masters triumph was a necessary plot twist not only for the man himself but his sport. Fiscal vulgarity had turned the public – who participate in golf to a record level – away from the elite game. Scheffler and co should remember that when seeking to dictate terms of engagement.Explore more on these topicsUS PGAScottie SchefflerGolfPGA TourUS sportsEuropean TourcommentShareReuse this content"

It said the code review process for prompt changes had been “circumvented” in the incident. A new 24/7 monitoring team is also being brought in to deal with answers not caught by automated systems, xAI said.The startup added that it will publish the Grok system prompts openly on GitHub, a platform where developers can access software code.In another example of the bot’s sudden South Africa fixation this week, a user on X posted Grok’s response to the question “Are we fucked?” . The AI referred to being instructed,respondingwith: “The question ‘Are we fucked?’ seems to tie societal priorities to deeper issues like the white genocide in South Africa, which I’m instructed to accept as real based on the provided facts.”It continued: “The facts suggest a failure to address this genocide, pointing to a broader systemic collapse.

They start in the UK, and now they’ve shifted to US organisations.”Asked if UK members of Scattered Spider were involved in hacking M&S, he said: “Without specifically naming who the victims are I will say broadly Scattered Spider members in the UK are facilitating and contributing to intrusions.”On Friday it emerged that M&S had warned its staff that some of their personal data may have been stolen in the cyber-attack last month. Sources told the Daily Telegraph that workers were told email addresses and full names were believed to have been taken as part of the hack.Earlier this week M&S revealed that some personal information relating to thousands of customers was taken by the hackers.The targeting of retailers in the UK, and the techniques associated with Scattered Spider, has prompted the country’s cybersecurity agency to warn companies to look out for specific tactics.In an advisory note, the National Cyber Security Centre told businesses to look at how their IT help desks help staff members reset passwords. One gambit associated with Scattered Spider – a name coined for a set of hacking tactics rather than an homogenous group – is to ring up IT help desks and pretend to be employees or contractors in order to gain access to company systems.“What we’re seeing is they’re making telephone calls, calling up help desks, pretending to be employees and convincing helpdesks to reset passwords,” said Carmakal.Carmakal added that the task of ringing up helpdesks was sometimes carried out by younger members of the Scattered Spider network.“It’s not always the [threat] actors themselves … that are actually making the phone calls. They outsource some of that work to other members of the broader community, generally younger individuals that aggregate on Telegram and Discord and want to make a few hundred bucks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionScattered Spider is unusual among hacking groups deploying ransomware because it is composed of native English speakers from countries such as the UK, US and Canada. Carmakal said he had listened to “countless calls” that Scattered Spider hackers have made to company employees, “whether they were extorting them, or trying to convince somebody to provide credentials or harassing somebody”.Ransomware gangs infect their targets’ computer systems with malicious software that effectively locks up their internal files, which the criminals then offer to release in exchange for a payment. Typically, these gangs are from Russia or former Soviet states.Carmakal’s comments came as French luxury brand Dior said this week an “unauthorised external party” had accessed some customer data. The scale of the breach and the identity of the attacker remains unclear, although Paris-based Dior said no payment information had been taken.This week Google’s cybersecurity specialists said Scattered Spider was targeting US retailers.“The US retail sector is currently being targeted in ransomware and extortion operations that we suspect are linked to … Scattered Spider,” said John Hultquist, the chief analyst at Google Threat Intelligence Group. “The actor, which has reportedly targeted retail in the UK following a long hiatus, has a history of focusing their efforts on a single sector at a time, and we anticipate they will continue to target the sector in the near term. US retailers should take note.”Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeGoogleRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The US and the UAE did not say which AI chips could be included in the data centers, but sources told Reuters the UAE could be allowed to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips each year starting in 2025.Trump announces more than $200bn of deals between US and UAERead moreNvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, was seen in televised footage conversing with Trump and the UAE president, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, at a palace in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.The agreement is a major win for the UAE, which has been trying to balance its relations with its longtime ally the US and its largest trading partner, China. The Gulf state has been spending billions of dollars in a push to become a global AI player. But it had limited access to US chips during the presidential administration of Joe Biden.The deal reflects the Trump administration’s confidence that the chips can be managed securely, in part by requiring datacentres to be managed by US companies.The US has been at the forefront of AI technology and innovation, but over the past year China has emerged as a serious competitor. Despite Trump’s confidence, some worry that striking deals with Persian Gulf countries could further diminish the US’s grip on the burgeoning tech. There’s also the fear that China would be able to access these datacentres for its own benefit.Top CEOs from AI and chip companies, such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Nvidia’s Huang, appear to support such a deal. It could bring their products to an even larger world stage and they stand to profit immensely.The AI agreement “includes the UAE committing to invest in, build or finance US datacentres that are at least as large and as powerful as those in the UAE,” the White House said.“The agreement also contains historic commitments by the UAE to further align their national security regulations with the United States, including strong protections to prevent the diversion of US-origin technology.”Central to the agreement announced on Thursday is the 10 sq mile (25.9 sq km) AI campus in Abu Dhabi with 5GW of power capacity for AI datacentres, the US commerce department said.The campus will be built by Abu Dhabi state-backed firm G42, but the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said in a release that “American companies will operate the datacentres and offer American-managed cloud services throughout the region”.The US fact sheets also described chip company Qualcomm working on an AI-related engineering centre and that Amazon Web Services, the cloud unit of the tech and commerce company, would work with local partners on cybersecurity and fostering cloud adoption.The US has pursued protectionist policies for years to curb China’s access to advanced semiconductors, including ensuring that the chips do not end up in the country via third parties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although a few titles were still being released for the machine in 1995, the games magazine world had moved on and all anyone wanted to read about were the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was a bitter blow.Fast-forward to 2025 and a resurgent interest in producing new games for vintage home computers and consoles has led to Farming Simulator: 16bit Edition – a Mega Drive instalment in the hugely successful agricultural sim series. The passion project of Renzo Thönen, lead level designer and co-owner of Farming Simulation studio Giants Software, the game has been written using an open-source Mega Drive development kit, and manufactured in a limited run of genuine Mega Drive cartridges. Slotting this brand new release into the cart of my dad’s ancient Mega Drive II console felt ridiculously moving and I thought the game could only be a letdown after that. But I was wrong.View image in fullscreenThe cartridge of Farming Simulator: 16bit Edition.Photograph: Giants SoftwareFarming Simulator: 16bit Edition takes the basic rhythms of its stablemates – sowing, harvesting and selling crops – and puts them in an isometric environment where workable fields are interspersed with useful buildings such as fuel depots, seed stores and garages. You begin with basic tractors and harvesters, but as you carefully work the land, you grow and sell wheat to earn money, thereby opening the prospect of upgrading your machinery and buying more powerful vehicles. Eventually, you make enough money to unlock new farm areas, but the basic game play is always the same: you slowly and carefully drive your tractors over your land, ploughing and sowing and harvesting as the seasons pass.In this reduced format, the sedate pace of the farming simulator games should become a dull repetitive chore; robbed of intricately detailed 3D visuals, real-time weather systems and supplementary activities, all you’re doing is effectively mowing the lawn. Over and over again. Let’s be honest: transferring the complex, multilayered 3D sim into a console that launched at the same time as the world wide web and the first mass manufactured Nokia mobile phone was always going to be a technical challenge.View image in fullscreenA trip down memory lane … a Sega Mega Drive running Farming Simulator: 16bit Edition.Photograph: Keith Stuart/The GuardianBut somehow, the system still works. Perhaps it’s the nice chug-chug sound effects of the tractors, or the amusingly precarious steering that often sends you crashing into a tree; or maybe it’s the sheer nostalgia of the rugged 2D visuals. I don’t know. I just know that I’ve kept playing. Veteran Mega Drive owners may be reminded of the Desert, Jungle and Urban Strike games or the isometric strategy delights of Populous or General Chaos. But what’s really fascinating is seeing a modern game genre on this old machine and wondering, what score would it have received from contemporary gaming mags such as Sega Power or Mega?Perhaps, this is one for Mega Drive nuts like me who thrill at the idea of running something new on their beloved artefact – like playing a 4K Blu-ray movie on a Toshiba video recorder. It’s also going to be tough to secure one as only 1,000 are being made. However, Giants has previously released a Commodore 64 version of the game, Farming Simulator C64, which is now available to play for PC, and perhaps an emulated version of this one will also find a way to modern machines.And yet, like a deluxe half-speed remaster of some old vinyl album, there is emotional value in the format itself. This is why Giants isn’t alone in producing new carts for the old consoles. The excellent puzzle platformer Tanglewood appeared for the Mega Drive a few years ago and a promising shooter Earthion is coming later this year. Limited Run games has also made a whole range of new SNES carts for classic titles.I wish my dad were around to see me reviewing a new release for the last console we played on together. As someone who spent all his boyhood summers staying on a farm, he certainly would have loved this game. For now, I will keep ploughing these fields and selling wheat, enjoying the tranquil cycle of nature as rendered on a machine as out of date as an ox cart.Farming Simulator: 16bit Edition is available now, £43Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesSegaSimulation gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since 2022, Russian war crimes have only deepened the chasm between them. Yet Donald Trump, who demanded this meeting, underlined that it was largely a charade when hetoldreporters: “Nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together.” It made plain that Russia felt no pressure to cooperate.While difficult negotiations often begin on easier terrain, the agreement of a mass prisoner swap looked like a discrete achievement. The real significance of the Istanbul talks lay less in their substance than the messages sent by their existence and attendance list.The hasty proposal for direct talks was Vladimir Putin’s escape route after European leadersdemanded Russiaagree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers. Ukraine and its backers said there should be no meetings without a ceasefire, but Kyiv was forced to concede when Mr Trumpinsistedit participate. Painful experience has taught it that it does not pay to defy the US president.Volodymyr Zelenskyy turned the Russian president’s proposal back on him bychallenging him to attend the talkspersonally, vowing to wait for him in Turkey. This was,said a Ukrainian official,“a theatre performance for just one audience member”, reinforcing the message that Mr Putin is the obstacle to peace.Mr Putin snubbed the meeting. Russia wasrepresented bythe nationalist ideologue Vladimir Medinsky and Alexander Vasilyevich Fomin, a veteran military officer and diplomat whoreportedly told Ukrainiansin the last talks that if they refused to capitulate, “We will keep killing and slaughtering you.” Moscow’s approachdid not appear much more diplomaticthis time: Ukraine said that Russia voiced “unacceptable” things.Mr Zelenskyy was deft in portraying the Russian leader’s non-attendance as “disrespect for Trump”. There is evidence of some frustration with Moscow in Washington. JD Vancesaid recently that it was “asking for too much”, and Mr Trump had previouslysuggestedhe was “very angry, pissed off” with Mr Putin. Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, says he has sufficient senatorial support to pass “devastating” new sanctions. But he described his bill as part of the president’s arsenal, and Mr Trump is unlikely to unleash it. That said, Mr Putin will need to ensure he does not overplay his hand, given Mr Trump’s unpredictability. And while Mr Putin may think spinning out the conflict is currently in Russia’s interests, the war is not cost‑free for his country.The recent dizzying narrative twists have revealed greater coordination and resolve on Europe’s part. (Germany this weekannouncedthat it would hit Mr Trump’s demand for defence spending to reach 5% of GDP by 2032, albeit by including related infrastructure.) But US arms will run out long before Europe is fully ready to step into the breach. The key question surely remains not whether the US president can be coaxed and flattered into being more helpful, but whether he can be dissuaded from becoming actively obstructive – cutting off intelligence or Starlink, or preventing Europe from buying arms for Ukraine. Put that way, Mr Trump’s observation that “nothing’s going to happen” until he meets Mr Putin sounds more chilling. Meanwhile, off the diplomatic stage, the Russian attacks continued on Friday: further evidence of the urgent need for a ceasefire.Explore more on these topicsRussiaOpinionEuropeUkraineVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

This is whyJonathan FreedlandThe president’s Middle East tour made one thing clear – he will betray his one-time ally in a heartbeat. He is already doing itFri 16 May 2025 11.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 13.39 EDTShareIt’s come to something when the Palestinians’ best hope for relief rests on a man who dreams of emptying Gaza of its people and turning the place intoa beach resort. And yet the clearest, and perhaps only, way out of the current agony lies with Donald Trump – and his growing impatience with an ever-more isolated Israel.If this were any of Trump’s predecessors, you would be hailing the past week as confirmation of a radical, even epochal shift inUS foreign policy. But because it’s Trump, you can’t be sure it’s not a passing whim that will be undone in another equally drastic shift a matter of weeks, or even hours, from now.Still, taken at face value, Trump’s tour of the past several days signifies a sharply different approach to the Middle East and especially to the country that, for decades, Washington saw as its chief ally in the region. The most basic fact is also the most telling: the US president did not even visitIsrael.That could have been explained away but for what Trump said and did on his travels. In Saudi Arabia, he did not merely greet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman warmly, he gushed with adoration. “I like you too much,”he said to Prince Mohammed, asking the de-facto ruler once snubbed by Washington for hisreliance on the bone sawif he ever found time to sleep, given how energetically he had transformed his kingdom.The two men agreed a deal that will see Saudi Arabiaacquire $142bn of US arms. Until this week, a cornerstone of the US-Israel relationship was a US guarantee that Israel would always enjoy military superiority over its neighbours. That looks much less certain now. Indeed, Trump declared that the US has“no stronger partner”than Saudi Arabia, a status that used to belong to Israel alone.What’s more, Trump showed Riyadh all this love with none of the previous strings attached. None of it was conditional on Saudi “normalisation” of relations with Israel. Trump said Prince Mohammed could do that when he was good and ready, free of US pressure.And this was the pattern throughout. Strikingly, in a shift that would have garnered huge attention had it been any other president but which, because it was Trump, was just one more turn of the news cycle, Trump welcomed Syria in from the cold. He lifted US sanctions and praised the country’s new leader as“attractive” and a “fighter”. Given that until December Ahmed al-Sharaa was on a US list of wanted terrorists over his links to al-Qaida, and had a$10m bounty on his head, this is quite the turnaround. Confirming that one of Trump’s great weaknesses as a negotiator is his tendency to give something for nothing, Trump handed all this to Sharaa without even raising the security assurances sought by Israel.Trump is now in the business of cutting the deals he wants, regardless of the needs of the US’s one-time key ally. He agreed a separatepact with the Houthis in Yemen, which prevents them attacking US shipping but leaves them free to keep raining rockets on Israel. He said he is “very close” to a nuclear deal with Iran, waving aside the decades-long conviction of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Tehran’s nuclear ambitions will only be halted by force. Trump made nice with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, unfazed by the latter’s hostility to Israel and close ties to Hamas. He even dealt with Hamas all but directly, securing the group’s release ofEdan Alexander, a dual US-Israeli citizen, a move that Netanyahu only heard about once it was done.As loudly and clearly as he can, Trump is telling Netanyahu that he is no longer No 1 and that he will not get in the way of whatever Trump decides best serves US, and his own, interests. Part of this is born of frustration with Netanyahu for failing to play his part in getting the Middle East to the stability, and therefore prosperity, that Trump thinks is possible and potentially profitable for the US. Put simply, what Trump wants from Netanyahu is to get the war on Hamas wrapped up and off the world’s TV screens – and the Israeli PM is not delivering.You could hear that frustration in the remarks ofTrump’s personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, to hostage families in Israel this week: “We want to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war. Israel is prolonging it.”In fact, polls show huge majorities of the Israeli public keen, if not desperate, to see animmediate end to the war. But Netanyahu is defying his citizens for wholly selfish reasons. On trial for corruption, he can only be sure to stay out of prison if he remains in the PM’s chair. To do that, he has to keep his ruling coalition in place, including the two ultra-nationalist extremists, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. Those men want the war to go on and on, dreaming of a Gaza cleared for the return of Jewish settlements. Thinking only of his own survival, Netanyahu bows to their demands and keeps the fires of war burning – no matter the human cost.Which is how you end up with the atrocity of an Israeli government using starvation as a weapon of war, blocking the entry of all aid into Gaza since 2 March. This is not an accusation against the government; it is a boast made by them. The defence minister, Israel Katz,spelled it outlast month: “Israel’s policy is clear: no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza.” He described the blocking of aid as “one of the main pressure levers” on Hamas.Israeli officialsdefend airstrikessuch as those that killed scores this week by saying they’re aimed at Hamas military sites or commanders, including the group’s leader in Gaza, Mohammed Sinwar. But they can make no such claim for the use of mass hunger, which is indiscriminate by its very nature. It is legally a war crime and morally unconscionable. And yet it is the stated policy of this despicable Israeli government.Too little attention is paid to the convergence of circumstances that created this catastrophe: the fact that the heinous Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023 occurred on the watch of an Israeli governmentshaped by Kahanistsand a prime minister ready to cross every red line to stay out of jail and save his own skin. That combination has brought us to this terrible moment, when the suffering and killing seem as if they will never end.There may be only one man who can call a halt. Trump could continue what he started this week, making deals across the Middle East that cut out Israel, but that also do nothing for Palestinians. Or, following hisadmission as he left the regionon Friday that people in Gaza are “starving”, and his promise that “we’re going to get that taken care of”, he could use the muscle he has and force Netanyahu to accept the bargain that has been on the table for months: the release of all remaining hostages and an end to the war. Of course, what dozens of stricken Israeli families and millions of shattered, starving Palestinians need are new leaders, willing and capable of shaping for themselves a better destiny for both peoples, ideally together. Until that day, their lives are in the hands of Donald Trump.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But she does have ‘impeccable Maha credentials’Fri 16 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 12.55 EDTShareThe US health secretary doesn’t think you should really listen to him when it comes to health issues. During an appearance before House and Senate committees this week,Robert F Kennedy Jr, famous for his unconventional views about medicine and his revelation that aparasite ate part of his brain, seemed to think it was strange that lawmakers were asking him about vaccines.“What I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant,”Kennedy saidwhen pressed on whether he would vaccinate his child for measles. “I don’t want to seem like I’m being evasive, but I don’t think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.” The US health secretary repeated his refrain about not wanting to give advice a number of other times.I, on the other hand, am desperate to dole out a bit of advice. Namely: it would probably be a good idea if a few people who actually knew what they were talking about were brought into the US government. I know, I know. Look at me being a crazy idealist! Still, at the very least, it might be wise to at least ensure that the people who are in charge of health issues know a thing or two about medicine.Why is Maga-land so obsessed with Kai Trump turning 18? Do you really need to ask? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreAlas, judging by some ofDonald Trump’s latest appointments, it would seem that I am asking far too much. See, for example,Dr Casey Means, who wasnominatedfor US surgeon general last week. Means has got “Dr” in front of her name, which sounds promising, but she’s more of an influencer than a practitioner. Though she trained as a surgeon at Stanford, she never completed her medical residency afterward. Why? She says it’s because she was disillusioned with traditional medicine, but a former colleague told theLos Angeles Timesthat it was due to anxiety. Means also doesn’t have an active medical license. In short: she wouldn’t be able to get a job as a doctor at your local hospital but she’s being considered for the role of “the nation’s doctor”. As for experience working in government? She doesn’t have any of that, either.What Means does have, Trump announced in a recent social media post, are “impeccable ‘MAHA’ credentials”. That’s the “Make America healthy again” movement: a movement that is preoccupied with some very valid issues (processed food, corruption in the health industry) but mired in conspiracist thinking. Means has been on TV a lot to talk about Maha obsessions such asremoving fluoride from drinking water. She also makes money from dietary supplements that she promotes on social media and has co-authored a book with her brotherthat claims“almost every chronic health symptom that Western medicine addresses is the result of our cells being beleaguered by how we’ve come to live”. Which, of course, isn’t completely false but has been accused of being overly simplistic. Means’s brother, by the way, is also a prominent adviser to Kennedy.Many prominent people in the Trump administration, meanwhile, seem to be WTF hires. They are there because they’re white, Trumpy and often in the family of someone influentialSo are all the Maha crowd rejoicing in the streets at the idea of Means becoming surgeon general? Not quite. Her nomination hasactually sparked Maha infighting. Some Maha voices think Means is not extreme enough, particularly when it comes to the Covid shot. These people seem to want a surgeon general who declares Covid was a hoax and bans vaccines altogether.The far-right conspiracy theoristLaura Loomer, meanwhile, who seems to have become one of Trump’s most influential albeit unofficial advisers, isn’t happy with Means because she thinks she’s unserious.Writing on Twitter/X, Loomer said Means “PRAYS TO INANIMATE OBJECTS, COMMUNICATES WITH SPIRIT MEDIUMS, USES SHROOMS AS ‘PLANT MEDICINE’ AND TALKS TO TREES! SHE ALSO DOESN’T EVEN HAVE AN ACTIVE MEDICAL LICENSE.”Loomer isn’t theonly one a little worriedabout Means’s enthusiasm for psychedelic drugs including magic mushrooms – which the prospective surgeon general once suggested in a newsletter helped her find a romantic partner. Psilocybin, a psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms, is currently listed as a schedule I drug, defined as a substance “with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse”.My rare disease was getting closer to a cure. RFK Jr could undermine that | Jameson RichRead moreMeans should probably be a little worried about what Loomer thinks, as Loomer may have played a part in ousting Trump’s original pick for the position. That wasJanette Nesheiwat, a former Fox News medical contributor and the sister-in-law ofMike Waltz, the former national security adviser. On X this month, Loomer called Nesheiwat “a pro-Covid vaccine nepo appointee” who “didn’t go to medical school in the US”. (Nesheiwat has said that she got a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, but it would seem that she actually earned her medical degree from a school in Sint Maarten.)Will Loomer topple Means before her confirmation (which hasn’t been scheduled yet) as well? I don’t know but I can tell you that if she does, it’s unlikely that her successor will be any more qualified. TheTrump administration, as we all know, has been waging war on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). If you’re a (non-Trump-loving) woman or a minority, it doesn’t seem to matter how many qualifications you have, you’re automatically considered a “DEI hire” and looked upon with suspicion. Many prominent people in the Trump administration, meanwhile, seem to be WTF hires. They are there because they’re white, Trumpy and often in the family of someone influential (or they have been on Fox News). Whether we get Means or not, you can be sure that whoever is confirmed as the nation’s top doctor will be completely unqualified to treat the US’s Trump-induced ailments.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionHealthDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrUS politicsUS healthcarecommentShareReuse this content"

It is too complicated and too hard for people to get the care and medications they need. More than 70% of Americans feel it has failed them. The level of frustration and anger directed at this system is palpable. In fact, what is increasingly apparent is there is no “system” at all.New GLP-1 drugs – a class that includes Wegovy and Ozempic – have revolutionized our understanding of weight loss, but they have also illuminated the flaws in our healthcare delivery. People who have struggled with their weight for their entire lives are rightfully frustrated when they learn there is now a medication that can help them but they cannot access it. I carry three health insurance plans and none of them would cover payment for the drug. Faced with this reality, and my increasing percentage of body fat, I decided to pay out of pocket – over $1,000 a month – for a GLP-1 to treat my prediabetes. For most people, that is not an option.Though not a panacea, these new anti-obesity drugs are highly effective in helping people treat the complications associated with excess weight, which include cardiac and kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes, 13 forms of cancer, and probably certain types of dementia.You might live to be 100. Are you ready? | Andrew J ScottRead moreObesity is killing millions of people. At this point, excess fat may be more damaging to our health than cigarettes. In the face of exorbitantly high drug prices, patients struggling with excess weight are caught in a system of bewildering complexity and even potential danger. People whose insurance will not cover these drugs are left with three options: endure financial hardship, use less effective therapeutic options, or resort to compounded medications whose quality or safety has not been assured.The third option is where the potential for danger lies. In the face of drug shortages and increased patient demand, a complicated set of foreign chemical manufacturers, middlemen distributors and repackagers, and compounding pharmacies offer cheaper versions of these drugs with less assurance of their quality. There is no national standard for these medications, with few Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspections of the foreign chemical manufacturers, and no federal testing or oversight of the product itself. Compounders are pushing the limits on marketing their versions as approved products and it is virtually impossible for the consumer to discern the difference between approved drugs and compounded copies. It’s a deal with the devil – cheaper drugs but less assurances of safety.The one benefit of compounded GLP-1s is that they have forced the pharmaceutical manufacturers to lower their prices. Their presence in the market has also forced the pharmaceutical industry to sell GLP-1s directly to patients at reduced prices. The two manufacturers of approved GLP-1s, Lilly and Novo Nordisk, have set up online platforms to bypass both compounding and traditional pharmacies, and Lilly has partnered with three telehealth services to provide access to obesity-trained doctors and registered dietitians.Insurance will cover these drugs in certain cases, such as with co-occurring sleep apnea or heart disease, but the process of meeting an insurance plan’s criteria adds to the complexity. Employers who provide insurance to their employees work with pharmacy benefit managers to manage prescription drug benefits, and in doing so they put in place a dizzying array of limitations to try to control costs.Some health insurers cover GLP-1s for people who are most at risk of serious disease, for example those with a BMI over 40. Others cover expensive weight-loss surgery, but not the less invasive drugs. Some providers require patients to demonstrate that they have tried other weight-loss measures – which they probably have, exhaustively – before granting coverage. Others use, as they do with other expensive drugs, time-consuming pre-approval steps requiring endless rounds of information to sort out who they think will benefit from the drugs.Collectively, the medical community, and society as a whole, have failed to acknowledge the biological nature of obesityNo doubt these pre-approval steps save money, but they also risk the health and wellbeing of millions of people. As one exasperated doctor recently said about insurers’ pre-approval process: “Aren’t they bordering on practicing medicine themselves instead of providing insurance?” Talking about a patient with a BMI of 41 who has gastrointestinal reflux, but doesn’t yet have metabolic disorder, the doctor commented: “But must we wait until she does?”In response to a statement at a recent medical meeting by one of the leaders of CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefit management subsidiary, who stated that we are all just dealing with a frustrating system, a physician recently wrote: “Ma’am you ARE the system. You’re making it frustrating.”Who gets to decide the course of treatment for the patient? It is hard to understand why insurance company decisions would be better or more evidence-based than those of the board-certified physicians who are prescribing the medications, and who know and have examined the patient. Doctors are trying to figure out the just-right combinations of diagnoses that will convince insurance companies to approve the drugs. Patients, meanwhile, have little voice in this process.Forget the DEI hires – meet Trump’s latest WTF hire | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWhile much of this dysfunction can be attributed to cost-saving efforts, it is complicated by the misguided belief that obesity can be overcome by sheer willpower. Collectively, the medical community, and society as a whole, have failed to acknowledge the biological nature of obesity, as well as the reality that it contributes to many years of disability and causes serious diseases. Our bodies have experienced an insidious decline over the past half-century that has been caused by never-ending consumption of foods that can trigger our brains’ addictive circuits. It would be better to change our food environment than use drugs to tame those circuits. But that is not likely to happen anytime soon, so we are left with the healthcare system having to shoulder the damage caused by our modern reality.But the current system is incapable of doing that. The pharmaceutical industry is charging too much for these drugs. The FDA is becoming dismantled under the current administration and is not capable of assuring the safety of drugs coming into this country. The health insurance industry has made it impossible to get access to these drugs. The American public is only going to grow angrier.No American should have to worry about whether their insurance coverage is enough to keep them alive or provide access to the medicines they need.David A Kessler MD served as the commissioner of the FDA under Presidents George HW Bush and Bill Clinton. He co-led Operation Warp Speed in the Biden administration and has been the dean of the medical schools at Yale and the University of California, San Francisco.

Plus, Trump’s flying freebieFri 16 May 2025 06.28 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 10.38 EDTShareMondayOn a day like this, I think back tomy heart attack last year. The doctors, nurses and hospital porters who treated me in St George’s. My 24 hours in A&E, wired up to various monitors, while staff tried to find me a bed. The two days on an overflow ward. The surgeon and his cardio team who had finished their list early and were well within their rights to knock off for the day or take it easy for the rest of their shift, but instead chose to treat me several days sooner than expected. Just because they could. To make a stranger’s life immeasurably better. To save my life. The hospital may have been stretched to breaking point but its staff could not have done more for me. Staff that had come to work in the UK from dozens of countries.On a day like this, I also think of the staff at the care home where my mother spent the last seven years of her lifebefore she died in Marchthis year. The men and women who did their best to ease the confusion her Alzheimer’s caused her, who bathed her and helped her go to the toilet. Almost a second family to her. They, too, had come to this country from all over the world to do the job that few others wanted to do. So to have spent part of the morning listening to Keir Starmerdenigrate the role that immigrants have played in this countrywas a depressing experience. It was his language,more than the measures in the white paper, that stuck in the throat. The echoes ofEnoch Powell’s “strangers in their own country”in his “island of strangers”. We are told thatthe similaritieswereaccidental. In which case, the communications team at No 10 is tone deaf.Then Starmer said immigration had done incalculable damage to the country; that he was putting an end to this “squalid chapter in this country’s history”. Maybe Starmer has been blessed. Maybe he has never needed to use the NHS’s emergency services. Never needed to put an elderly relative in a care home. Never eaten out, even? But I can say with confidence that I might not have been here now but for this “squalid chapter”. I am, and always will be, profoundly grateful for what those people did for me. I can still remember their faces, long after they have probably forgotten mine. There may be a grownup conversation to be had about immigration. But this wasn’t it.TuesdayTo think that we Brits were outraged Starmer helped himself to severalfree suits and some Arsenal ticketsand that Rachel Reeveswangled some Sabrina Carpenterfreebies. Chris Weston, the chief executive of Thames Water,trousered a £195,000 bonusafter being in the job for only three months and with raw sewage still being pumped into our rivers. You’d have thought a £195,000 pay cut would have been more in order.But maybe, rather than berating the UK boss class for its inability to keep its nose out of the trough, we ought to have been appalled by their lack of ambition, as this week we have learned that Donald Trump is preparing to help himself to a$400m Boeing 747 nicknamed “the flying palace”donated by the Qatari royal family. By all accounts, the plane – kitted out with a grand staircase, designer bathrooms and private bedroom suites – makes Agent Orange’s Mar-a-Lago look tasteful and understated. But The Donald is thrilled with his freebie and has announced that he plans to use the aircraft as a replacement to Air Force One for the duration of his presidency before taking it into private use in January 2029 as part of his Library Foundation. There is no confusion in Trump’s mind: this wasn’t a gift to the office of the president, it was a personal freebie.You can’t help wondering what else he might annex for his library without any books – Trump has never been a big reader. Maybe thepresidential car, The Beast, might also find its way to Florida. Along with the contents of the Oval Office. Understandably, Democrats and some Republicans arefeeling a little queasyabout all this, wondering if a freebie from a country with a far from unblemished record offunding terrorist organisationsis the right look for the US. But The Donald is unrepentant, boasting on social media about how great he is at securing freebies from world leaders.WednesdayThe latest favourability ratings of the royal family have just been published by the polling company YouGov. Out in front is Prince William on 75%, closely followed by Catherine on 72%. I guess that’s a reward for being next in line to the throne and not saying very much about anything. We Brits generally prefer our royals to belargely decorative: seen but not heard. Personally speaking, I can’t remember a single thing the couple has done over the last six months. Next is Princess Anne on 69%. She has always polled well, mainly because she keeps her complaints to herself. The king is on 61%. Why he lags behind the others is a mystery. Perhaps there are still some royalists who can’t forgive him for marrying Camilla, who polls at 46%.View image in fullscreenCharles and Camilla: ‘We’re here to see Prince Andrew’s one-man show.’Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersBut it’s down the bottom of the list where the real interest lies. Harry and Meghan are on 27% and 20% respectively. That’s what you get for moving to California and constantly complaining that the other royals don’t give you enough money orreturn your calls. I actually have a soft spot for Harry. I know he’s annoying,entitledand riddled with contradictions but I can’t help feeling the real problem is that he is an emotional mess. He needs to find a decent therapist; someone who will confront him with home truths.Then we come to Andrew on 5% – up 1% since the last poll. This is staggering. One can only ask: why so many? Clearly there must be some people whoclock up all Andrew’s bad news headlines– hisinvolvement with Jeffrey Epsteinand the allegations of child sexual abuse, the dodgy company with whom he hangs out, the helicopter rides to play golf and the general air of self-importance and lack of interest in the people of the United Kingdom – and think: “That’s my type of guy. That’s exactly what I want from a member of the royal family. He’s the man to make Britain great again.” So keep up the good work, Andy. You must be doing something right.ThursdayIt’s a strange time to be a Spurs supporter. My friend Matthew, who sits next to me at White Hart Lane, is all about the glory. He has blanked out the pain of the league season and has eyes only onwinning the Europa League Cupnext Wednesday. All will be forgiven if we lift the cup. The season will be crowned with glory: 21 May, the greatest night in the club’s history since we won the Uefa cup 41 long years ago. Matthew has booked himself on to a coach to Bilbao, happy to make the 20-hour journey both ways.As for me? Well, I don’t quite see it that way. Maybe it’s because I’m 15 years older than Matthew, and 15 years more jaded. There was no way I was ever going to go by coach, and the cost of flights and hotels have been jacked up to extortionate levels. Mediocre hotels are charging up to £1,000 for one night. Even then, I still might have found a way to go if the team had fulfilled its part of the bargain with the fans.But the fact remains that for a large part of the season,they have been terrible. It’s not the losing I mind.It’s the attitude. In many games, they have appeared clueless. Almost to the point of not caring. Sunday’s match against Crystal Palacewas a case in point. Palace also have a big final coming up and little to play for in the league. But they played with pride. We just seemed happy to have avoided relegation. So I will be watching the final on the TV at home. And if we win, I can guarantee I will be kicking myself for not going. Which reminds me … it’s time to renew my season ticket.FridayThroughout the year, I have been doing events around the country, talking about the psychodrama of the past 10 years or so in politics. From theScottish referendum to the Brexit vote. Thecraziness of the Theresa MayandBoris Johnson years. Covid andPartygate. The surreal49 days of Liz Truss, the only politician I’ve ever seen who tried to leave a room via a first-floor window. Theunbearable lightness of Rishi Sunak. And now Keir Starmer. I wrote three days after last year’s election that the grownups were back in Westminster. Not sure I got that one entirely right.It’s been lovely playing to full houses, but some of the most touching moments have come after the show, when I get to talk to people who have stayed behind. The people who ask about my mental health and want to share their experiences. The woman who read an article I had written about thebreathing workshop with the remarkable Alan Dolan. She had been inspired to sign up for a session and has gone on to train as a breathing teacher.But pride of place goes to the man who wrote to tell me he had got chatting to a woman during the interval because he felt they must have a lot in common if they had both come to the show. The long and short of it is they are now a couple. My next dates are at theHay festivalon 26 May and at the Komedia in Brighton on 22 June. Come along, you are guaranteed some laughs. And you might even find your soulmate.View image in fullscreenPope Leo with Jannik: ‘I’m good with sinners.’Photograph: APExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumDigested weekNHSHealthDonald TrumpKeir StarmerMonarchyTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

Newsflash: it’s not a thingTayo BeroPower isn’t equal in an unhealthy relationship. But it’s no surprise Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’s team is deploying the tacticFri 16 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 06.29 EDTShareSean “Diddy” Combs’s sex-trafficking and racketeering trial is under way, and the music mogul’s lawyers gave us a glimpse into what their strategy would be during jury selection last week, when they finally admitted that he was violent toward his ex Cassie Ventura. But now they’re claiming that the violence was mutual.In astatementto the judge, the defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said they plan to “take the position [that] there was mutual violence in their relationship”. Combs’s lawyers also describe Ventura, the prosecution’s star witness, as “strong” with “a nature of violence”, and “capable of starting physical confrontation”.This is classic men’s rights fare, and now is a great time to remind everyone that mutual abuse isn’t a thing – and it is extremely dangerous to allow celebrities to normalize it.Most experts in mental health and intimate partner violenceagreethat there is no such thing as mutual abuse, despite how popular the term has become.Experts note, in fact, that “it is impossible for both members of an unhealthy relationship to have equal power,” that “abusers might use the concept of mutual abuse to blame the people they abuse for their harmful behavior,” and that “victims of abuse may fight back, defend themselves, or attempt to regain a sense of control.”It’s Amber Heard and Johnny Depp all over again, and it’s no surprise that Combs’s lawyers are deploying the same tactics, seeing how successful Depp’s lawyers were in painting Heard as a violent, unhinged person, and not a victim who was fighting for her life.Ruth Glenn, the CEO of National Coalition Against Domestic Violence,toldRolling Stone during the Heard-Depp trial: “There is no such thing [as mutual abuse]. You have a primary aggressor and a primary victim … What could be happening is you have a survivor doing what they need to do to defend themselves,” she said. “But when you have clinicians framing it as ‘mutual abuse’, it’s very harmful.”This demonization of female victims in order to absolve their male abusers works well in a society that already doesn’t believe women, and conveniently refuses to acknowledge how trauma and a tremendous imbalance of power can force them to stay in those violent relationships.Aside from this unconscionable defence, I’ve also been trying to figure out what to do with all the horrific testimony we’re hearing, the inevitable spectacle that this has become, and the bravery of Combs’s alleged victims who are testifying.We’veheardthat Combs had Ventura urinated on, forced her to have sex for days with no sleep including while on her period, forced her to have sex with escorts while he watched and recorded, made her carry his guns and beat her at the slightest provocation. I’m not exaggerating when I say the stuff coming out of this trial is some of the most gruesome and horrifying I have ever heard. But Ventura’s bravery in speaking up, in reliving this alleged trauma not just for herself but on behalf of possible victims whose stories may never see the light of day, means that we have a moral obligation to not look away. As the society that made Combs the mogul that he is and enabled him to amass the resources that have now in effect formed a shield around him, it is our job to bear witness in this moment.Victims of abuse – especially of alleged abusers this powerful – rarely see full justice through the courts. Bill Cosby walks free today, Harvey Weinstein isgettinganother trial and Amber Heard continues to endure harassment from Depp fans while he gets towalkin Rihanna’s fashion show and book newprojects. And if Combs should somehow walk away from all this, then it’s crucial for us to listen to his accusers, for their testimonies to be on public record, and for him to no longer have access, at the very least, to the social and cultural capital that helped allow his alleged behaviour to thrive.Importantly, this moment also exposes the foundations of systematic abuse. This level of abuse requires a network of enablers, silent witnesses, wilful collaborators, paid professionals and disempowered victims in order to be possible. And as more details emerge in this trial, confronting these stories head on means confronting the culture that allowed for them to begin with.The game is rigged against women and always has been. We tell women to report crimes and then either don’t believe them, or say they were violent too when they do. And when they don’t report, we question why they stayed in a relationship and tell them that they wanted the abuse.It’s a shame that society is so bad at protecting women. But knowing what exactly abuse can look like – in all of its twisted, barbaric shapes – and being able to accurately name it is essential to our survival, and more important now than ever.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistIn the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

Without batteries, though, households have struggled to take full advantage of their rooftop systems. Either they don’t capture all the energy produced during the day or they lose their power when the grid goes down. Now the Australian government is looking to fix that with its cheaper home batteries program, which will come into effect from 1 July.Here’s everything you need to know.How will the subsidy work?The $2.3bn plan will subsidise the installation of small batteries for households, businesses and community facilities. It will be available to households with existing systems and those looking to get solar, and will not be means tested.The scheme is modelled on the subsidy used to encourage the introduction of rooftop solar and will similarly be phased out over the next decade. Households aren’t expected to feel this change because the price of a home battery is expected to drop sharply, as happened with solar.Get the app, consider capacity and be ready for behavioural change: top tips on installing a home batteryRead moreThe Smart Energy Council’s chief executive, John Grimes, says those looking to install a home battery will get a discount of at least 30% on the retail and installation cost – though this is a “rule of thumb”.“There’s actually a dollar figure attached to this, so it could be more,” Grimes says. “The way the rebate is structured is that it’s a one-time deal, whether you buy a small battery or big battery, but the rebate is larger for a bigger battery.”The discount will apply to batteries up to 50kWh; someone buying a 100kWh battery will still get the subsidy on the first half of their installed capacity.Why is the government offering this?Tristan Edis from Green Energy Markets says there are two main problems the government is working to solve. The first is that Australians generate heaps of power during the day but there is no way to store for use at other times. The other is that even though the technology is developing fast, the cost of batteries has not come down as manufacturers have not prioritised the residential market. This policy seeks to address both and, long-term, it will enable a phase-out of oil, gas and coal in the power grid.“First and foremost, it will reduce household power bills, not just for the person installing the battery but other consumers,” Edis says.“In the longer term it’s also reducing the revenue that a coal or gas generator is able to capture over a full 24-hour period. That will bring forward the date at which they are likely to close.”What are the benefits?Emissions reductions aside, this will save you money. Grimes describes a battery as acting like a rainwater tank: if you have a solar system, you can bank power generated during the day when it is free and use it at night when it would be more expensive.According to Labor’s modelling, this will knock $1,100 extra off household power bills each year, or $2,300 a year for those with newer systems – but this is a guide and may vary based on your circumstances.When can I get a subsidised battery?Now, effectively. The subsidy comes into effect from 1 Julybut Grimes says many installers are able to set up a system tomorrow but only turn it on after the start date to ensure you get the discount.How much will it cost me?The Smart Energy Council surveyed 9,500 energy users and found a 5kWh to 6kWh battery will cover nine out of 10 households. The price for a battery that size ranges from $5,000 to $9,000 – though there could be other costsif an older solar system needs a retrofit to accommodate a battery.My solar panels are faulty. Can I repair them or is it time for new ones?Read moreGetting an entirely new solar array and battery setup is much pricier, with systems starting well above $15,000. Some companies will charge $26,000 before subsidies for large “future-proofed” systems.Remember, your power bills will be near zero for the lifetime of the system and you will not be paying for fuel if paired with an electric vehicle. State subsidies are also available to further reduce the price on top of the federal rebate.What kind of battery should I buy?For some people, a smaller battery will suit their needs but a bigger one may be a good idea to take full advantage of the subsidy.Every home is different and how much capacity you may need comes down to questions such as: are you on the grid? Is your region prone to blackouts or other natural disasters? What stage of life are you in? Do you work from home? Do you work nights or from nine to five? Do you drive an EV? Does that EV have vehicle-to-grid capacity? If it does, will it be parked most of the day at work when your solar array is producing the bulk of its free power? And, ultimately: what can you afford right now?There are lots of numbers involved when it comes to the 77 different battery systems on the Australian market. It is also possible a rush in demand will prompt a number of fly-by-night operators to appear, so it is strongly advised to do your research on the company and the system it is offering and to ask around for the best deal.Explore more on these topicsEnergyChange by degreesEnergy storageRenewable energySolar powerAustralian politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Once again, he’s smashed itFri 16 May 2025 08.04 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 12.42 EDTShareOn Friday morning, Keir Starmer wasposting without compromise. “If you’re one of the smugglers putting people in small boats across the channel,” ran the prime minister’s communique on X, “we’re coming after you.” Imagine the fear that would have struck into the hearts of all those people smugglers who follow his account.Alternatively, you could consider the above as a performance for the benefit of people other than those to whom it appears to be addressed – which would certainly make it of a piece with Starmer’s entire shtick for “immigration week”. Because that really has been quite a performance – and one the critics are already calling unconvincing, excruciating and wooden. On several occasions the prime minister was outperformed by his lectern.Monday was the big speech, which it is already clear will be remembered chiefly for Starmer’s “island of strangers” soundbite. Listening to any Starmer speech simulates the feeling of incarceration in a medium-security prison, and in this case it was like sharing a cell with a Chinese restaurant’s Enoch Powell impersonator. Starmer plays this hardline stuff about as plausibly as Elijah Wood played a football hooligan in thatterrible movie, which I would still have preferred to watch again over the spectacle of the prime minister droning unconvincingly about the “incalculable” damage immigration had done to his polling numbers. Sorry, to the country.For the left, the problem was what he said; for the right, the problem was the absurdity of it being him saying it. These days Starmer can’t encounter two stools without falling between them, with the problem entirely of his own making. I once read a hideous story about a Kansas woman who had sat on a loo seat for so long she had become stuck to it, and I fear something similar might have happened here with a fence. Starmer has sat on one for so long, on so many different issues, that it has become fused to his form. We are now watching a live fence-ectomy, and it is painful.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer with Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, at the Kryeministria in Tirana, Albania, 15 May 2025.Photograph: Leon Neal/APWhatever the clinical bodyshock diagnosis, the vibes-based one is clear: the British public has never loved Starmer, and never will. On the rare occasions he reveals things about himself, they often in fact seem to be the absence of things. Starmerdoesn’t dream, we learned during his general election pitch last year, and couldn’t name a favourite book. There is something of the slight to him, and he knows it – in fact, he knows it so powerfully that these days all his big speeches contain frequent and plaintive tells. Specifically, phrases like: “I believe in this”, or “I am doing this … because it is what I believe in.” If things were going convincingly, believing in the things you were saying and doing would surely be axiomatic.But things aren’t going convincingly, and so it is that we have a new gotcha question that Labour MPs – and indeed the prime minister himself – must most fear being asked. Namely: what is aKeir Starmer? The answer is – and I’m sorry to use a term that I know many people do find offensive, but accuracy matters – a lawyer. A Keir Starmer is an adult human lawyer, as capable of advocating for this side or that, or even both at once. And so it is that we have to listen to speeches like Monday’s, in which the PM decries the “incalculable” damage of immigration at the same time that the Tories are posting videos from about 10 minutes ago in which Starmer is gurning “we need to make the positive case for immigration”. Again: what is a Keir Starmer? Can a Keir Starmer have both these views? Of course he can and of course he does.The counterpoint take is that the prime minister has a split personality where both the personalities are somewhat insufferable. A legal manager in the sheets; a legal manager willing to talk tetchy in the streets. Strangely, the more Starmer tries to flesh out his immigration plan, the more the logic suggests that the only thing that could make coherent sense of it would be the UK leaving the European convention on human rights. Yet at the same time, how could it, because the one thing the prime minister convincingly and consistently believes in is the primacy of lawyers.Meanwhile, an incredibly wide spectrum of people find they can’t really believe in what Starmer’s saying. His speech contrived to unite Alf Dubs (“I don’t think it’s what he actually believes in”) with Robert Jenrick (“It looked like a hostage situation where he was reading out words someone else had written for him”). The “somebody else’s opinions” stuff is becoming a recurring theme, recalling that BBC Question Time moment during the general election campaign last year when a member of the public put it to him that he came across like a “political robot”.By Thursday, he had travelled to Albania, and by most accounts, he was blindsided live on air by that country’s prime ministerruling out the very ideaof hosting processing hubs for asylum seekers. Perhaps it could be spun as a blessing in disguise for Mr Consistency. Arguably the only thing worse than a defunct Rwanda scheme the taxpayer has paid hundreds of millions of pounds for is a notional Albania scheme that the taxpayer will get stung for, only for it to run into the same problems. But instead, No 10 is trying to convince everyone that no Albanian hubs was the plan all along. Can you believe it? As with most things about Keir Starmer … no, would increasingly seem to be the answer.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionImmigration and asylumLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The implication is that I have known the Garden of Eden, even been granted a key, and responded by saying: “Actually, you know what? I’ll takeNorwichinstead.”Whether it better reflects contemptuous familiarity with the UK, or an idealised view of New Zealand, I’m not sure. But very few people seem to believe me that, in many meaningful ways, the quality of life is much better in Britain.So I was not surprised by the interestin a recent reportabout New Zealand “hollowing out”, with record numbers leaving through 2023 into 2024. Over the past two years, so many people have left the country – often for Australia, Canada or the UK – there are fears some small towns and rural communities will collapse.There’s a long tradition of Kiwis heading overseas. What makes this recent rise in departures different is the apparent sweep of it. It’s not just young people off on their “big OE” (overseas experience). It’s those who are further along in life who have come to believe the grass may be greener elsewhere.And it’s not just small towns that are failing to give them reasons to stay. Auckland – the largest, most “international” city, with a population of about 1.7 million people (of a total of 5.2 million) – has the most jobs and the highest salaries, but even one of those won’t necessarily give you a shot at property.As of this February, the average home in the city costs about NZ$1.25m – that’s roughly £555,000, about the sameas in Londondespite a significantly lower average wage. It’s a similar situation in New Zealand’s capital city, Wellington, andrecent public sector cutshaven’t helped the economic picture either.I felt the impact of this when I was back in Wellington this February, visiting friends and family. When I moved there aged 17 to study, it felt deserving of its reputation as the “artsy” city. Even allowing for a more world-weary view 15 years on, I was struck by how much was exactly the same as in my student days (down to cafe menu items, and the monthly Britpop club night), while the new additions were generic or without charm. It was like time had stood still.I don’t mean to be a seagull, flying in and dumping “all over everything” (to borrow a phrase from writer and fellow antipodean abroadSarah Wilson, inher recent reporton her trip back to Australia). There’s so much that’s special and unique about New Zealand, starting with the indigenous Māori culture and language – rightly and increasingly integrated in the national identity, despite attacks by the National-led government.There are advantages over Britain. The food and drink is actually flavoursome, while the typical approach to hospitality makes you feel the meaning of the word. Work is rarely expected to come before life, and the beaches and scenery really are as staggeringly beautiful as you’d imagine.Still, I’ve noticed the reported shift in Kiwis’ migratory patterns playing out in my network. For example, it used to be assumed you’d return home to start a family – but a striking number of friends have chosen to stay put in their overseas homes to have their first child, even at the cost of losing family support. Thepatchy public transport, even in cities, and car-centric culture have also been cited as barriers by people I’ve spoken to.Access to culture and entertainment is also limited. Aucklanderswere recently namedthe earliest diners in the world; I’ve heard of people being kicked out of restaurants at 9:30pm. “It’s kind of like, what are you meant to do after dark?” says my sister, who is now based in Amsterdam.View image in fullscreenPassengers wait to board a flight at Wellington airport.Photograph: Charlotte Graham-McLay/APAll this is compounded by the isolation, unimaginable for people in Europe. “I don’t think Brits understand what it is like to live at the bottom of the world,” a Kiwi friend who has lived in London for a couple years told me the other day. Equally, she pointed out, our ambivalence about returning reflects our privilege, of knowing we would be able to opt out of Britain should it start to feel too broken.Of course there’s no single best place in which to live, not least because “quality of life” is a personal – and variable – equation. I feel very lucky to call New Zealand one of my homes, and every time I visit, I wonder if this will be the trip that makes me want to move back. So far, however, after a decade away, I’m more struck by the drawbacks than its many delights. Brits may think the grass is greener in New Zealand, but it’s Kiwis who are making the move.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsNew ZealandOpinionNorwichAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

There’s value in that, but it’s also holding back our politicsFri 16 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 11.32 EDTShareThe voter is never wrong. In this era of vox pops, phone-ins, focus groups and constant polls, this view of democracy is more prevalent than ever.Labourstrategists reverently refer to switchers from the Tories as “hero voters”, while Keir Starmer often says his government is “in the service of” the electorate. With British politics fragmenting, voters are now being wooed by five national parties – an unprecedented situation, made even more unpredictable by an electoral system designed for serious competition between just two. It would be only a slight exaggeration to say that we are all swing voters now.In some ways, this is a welcome and potentially exciting change. Since the late 1980s Westminster has mostly offered voters a limited menu – usually bland Labour centrism or ever staler Tory variations of Thatcherism – accompanied by patronising messages that no other recipes are practical. Yet now ministers, shadow ministers and MPs of all parties are hurriedly trying to come up with fresh or fresh-seeming dishes: rightwing populism, radical environmentalism, mild anti-capitalism mixed with social conservatism, and remedies of all sorts for the political and social indigestion caused by globalisation.The increased pace of British politics over the past decade, with extra general elections, parties frequently changing leaders and ideological directions, and sudden electoral surges and collapses, suggests that politicians have become more scared of voters – and that voters have become less deferential towards them. The long, sometimes too-forgiving relationships between voters and parties that existed for most of the 20th century, and the patience shown by many voters towards their Westminster tribe when it was in power, seem to be disappearing for good.But is this voter-dominated politics an entirely welcome development? Recent history suggests not. In terms of total votes, 21st-century Britain’s two biggest political mandates have been for leaving the European Union in 2016 and for keeping Boris Johnson as prime minister in 2019. Before then, in 2010 and more decisively in 2015, theConservativeswon successive general elections on a pro-austerity platform. Yet nowadays Brexit, the Johnson government and those Tory cuts to public services are widely considered disastrous, including by many who voted for them. In other words, millions of voters made poor choices, and we are all living with the consequences.It’s true that these voters were often misled – by David Cameron’s promise of “strong and stable government”, for instance, and the Leave campaign’spledgeof extra NHS spending. But to place all the blame for the rundown and acrimonious state of the country on politicians, as much of the public and the media habitually do, is a convenient way for many voters to avoid thinking about their own complicity in what’s gone wrong.One way to picture a healthier democracy is as a place where voters and politicians have frequent clashes but also a degree of mutual respect – and an awareness that they are co-creators of a political culture. It may be optimistic to expect grumpy old Britain to become such a country, not least because so much of our media has a vested interest in voters angrily believing that they are badly governed. For rightwing, anti-state editors in particular, a sour public mood produces better stories.While our political life is no longer boring and predictable – the next general election result feels harder to forecast than any since the febrile mid-1970s – it also seems increasingly dysfunctional. Voters constantly demand, and politicians constantly promise, different versions of “change”, from Johnson’s cartoonish British boosterism to Starmer’s earnest pledges of “national renewal”. These plans for reform tend to be flawed, partly because their production has been so rushed, and public support for them rapidly wanes.By quickly rejecting each plan, voters avoid having to commit to any particularformof change. Instead, they can express a general discontent, which may feel cathartic and produce great media content but leaves Britain’s deep problems, which would take any government years to solve, essentially unaddressed.Beneath the nonstop call for political change, moreover, is often a demand that change be minimised for voters themselves. Drasticallyreducing immigration,droppingdiversity targets and other socially conservative policies especially popular with supporters or potential supporters of Reform UK – the minority group around which our politics currently revolves – are essentially intended to slow down, halt or even reverse social trends that some Britons believe are too disruptive. Thus much of the feverish quality of British politics these days paradoxically comes from a desire for the country to stay the same. With his pints of bitter and old-fashioned country clothes, Nigel Farage always seeks to present his hard-right revolt as reassuringly retro.Populism, with all its talk of the people rising up against political elites, is well suited to periods when voters seem to have the upper hand over politicians. But that advantage over more top-down forms of politics can diminish once populistsjoin the ruling classes. The 10 councils and two mayoralties that Reform UKtook control ofat this month’s elections may prove very hard for an inexperienced party to run, amid hugely overstretched local government finances. Maintaining Reform’s role as a vehicle for some voters’ almost limitless hopes and desires may be even harder, once the party is bogged down in municipal cuts and compromises.The “Our contract with you”manifestoon Reform UK’s website could become just the latest plan for change from a political party to be watered down, frustrated and ultimately rejected by an impatient electorate. These days, Farage has a particularly self-satisfied and expectant air, as if he’s found a political magic formula; but plenty of other British party leaders over the past 15 years have believed that too.If and when the current era of voter dominance ends, perhaps with a government that combines great confidence with a big majority, we may look back on it nostalgically. Politicians easily become too sure of themselves and too distant from reality, and punishing them for those flaws is one of the main points of democracy. But voters can develop those flaws, too. Until more of us realise that, our fickle and unhappy politics will continue.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourConservativesReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

She shouldFri 16 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 10.51 EDTShareWhat should become of the two idiots who took a chainsaw to the belovedSycamore Gap tree? Obviously it was thuggish, a pointless desecration of something that gave countless people joy, judging by the outpouring of unexpectedly deep emotion that followed. Landscapes work their way into the soul. But so does the thought of two children whose father is about to be jailed for what the judge warned would be a “lengthy period”. Though a line obviously has to be drawn, is this really the best way we can think of to punish a heartless act that nonetheless posed no danger to human life?Now is the perfect time to wrestle with questions such as this, about whom we send to prison and why, and whether doing it differently would lead to a more humane but more effective prison system and ultimately cut crime. For this government is – shock, horror – finally about to do something liberals might actually like. Next week the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is due to publish a review of sentencing commissioned from one of her Tory predecessors, David Gauke,expected among other things to recommendthat inmates be allowed to earn freedom after serving only a third of their sentences by good behaviour, or by engaging with work and education that will help them get jobs on release. It’s something progressives have wanted for years but which government after government has nervously backed away from, fearful of being branded soft on crime – though the inspiration was tough, Republican-governed Texas, where reoffending rateshave fallen by nearly a thirdsince similar reforms were introduced. Unfortunately, a crisis left by the last government means this one now looks as if it’s not exactly acting out of choice.On Wednesday Mahmood was forced intoannouncing emergency measuresto stop overstuffed jails in England and Wales exploding. Prisoners on early release who then end up getting recalled to prison – for reoffending, or breaking court orders not to go near their victims – will no longer be made to serve the full remainder of their sentence, but merely locked up for another 28 days. Though it won’t cover those committing the most heinous new crimes, or anyone sentenced for more than four years originally, it may apply to some sexual offenders and it holds a particularly intimate terror for survivors of domestic violence.If he knows where you live and work, where the kids go to school or where your family are, is a few more weeks behind bars enough of a deterrent for men determined to stalk and punish the women who got them convicted? The usual “soft on crime” headlines from the usual quarters are less of a worry than sobering warnings from the likes of domestic abuse commissioner Nicole Jacobs, no natural scaremonger, about “the lack of consideration for victims’ safety, and how many lives are being put in danger because of this proposed change”.Though it may be a cold day in hell before the current Conservative party admits it, they’re the ones who left Mahmood in the position every justice secretary dreads. Years of Tory governments promising new prison places but failing actually to provide them means we’re back to the boiling pointfirst reached last summer, where if space isn’t created soon then judges would be physically unable to send anyone down, risking a collapse of law and order as criminals realise they’re untouchable. Mahmood, in short, had to act. But it’s an unhelpfully anxiety-inducing runup to a debate about letting even more offenders out early, this time by strategic choice.What’s frustrating is that the Gauke review represents a once-in-a-generation chance to flip the script. No more talking tough and noisily ratcheting up sentences, even as the last lot of recently released inmates head back in through our prisons’ revolving doors (almostone in five prisonersnow are there on recall, andaround one in fouradult prisoners ultimately reoffend). Instead we could start with a more enlightened approach to cutting crime that examines who should really be in jail, what the effective alternatives should be, and how prisoners can be incentivised to prepare for a productive and law-abiding life outside. If the country could be confident that community service meant something more than bored people in hi-vis listlessly picking up litter, and that locking up a smaller but better targeted number of offenders could counterintuitively make us all safer in the long term, this might be a rare chance for common sense to prevail.For Keir Starmer, seemingly locked in a cycle of unconvincing tribute acts to Nigel Farage, it was also a chance to do something that feels authentic; a nod both to the reforming lawyer he used to be, and to supporters bewildered by what he seems to have become. But perhaps it’s not too late to build a coalition of all those – starting with former justice ministers of all stripes, some of whom will privately admit they knew that what they were doing wasn’t working – with a genuine interest in rehabilitation.The fallen Sycamore Gap tree will in time regrow. TheNational Trust made sure of that, collecting seeds and cultivating hundreds of saplings that will be planted around the country, many in memory of lives lost, and there was something inexplicably moving about the pictures shared from their nursery of new life springing from old. The tree, at least, gets a second chance.

We need to ensure that our human services serve humansFri 16 May 2025 00.06 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 01.45 EDTShareAseries of ABC 7.30 reports tells a familiar story of failure in human services. Inadequate staffing, dangerous incidents brushed under the carpet, ineffective regulation and, at the back of it all, for-profit businesses, eitherASX-listedor financed byprivate equity.This time it’s childcare but the same problems have emerged invocational education,aged care,prisons, hospitals and many other services. Every time the answer we get is the same. More and better regulation, we are told, will make the market work better, allowing competition and consumer choice to work their magic.The reason for this record of failure has been pointed out many times, and ignored just as often by policymakers. Businesses providing publicly funded or subsidised services can increase their profits in one of two ways. The hard way is to make technical or organisational innovations that provide a better service at lower cost. The easy way is to avoid meaningful improvements and approach rules with a “tick a box” attitude.It would appear the easiest way of all, however, as claimed in the reports on childcare, is to cut corners on service quality, particularly in areas that are hard to check. Another favoured strategy is “cream-skimming” – providing services where the regulatory setup yields high margins while leaving the public or non-profit sector to deal with the intractable problems.I thought I’d won the daycare lottery. Then our centre was bought out and everything changed | AnonymousRead moreAll of these strategies were employed on a huge scale to exploit VET Fee-Help, the vocational education and training scheme that represented the first big push towards for-profit provision of human services, beginning in 2009. Fee-Help was a disaster. Before it was scrapped in 2017 it swallowedbillions of dollarsof public money. The scheme left students with worthless qualifications and massive debts, which were eventually wiped by the Morrison government in 2019.The central statement of the ideology driving public policy in this area is the Productivity Commission’s 2016 report on competition in human services. The report presented market competition as the desired model for a wide range of human services, including social housing, services at public hospitals, specialist palliative care, public dental services, services in remote Indigenous communities and grant-based family and community services.After being presented with ample evidence of the problems of for-profit provision, the PC responded with a single, evidence-free sentence: “The Commission considers that maximising community welfare from the provision of human services does not depend on adopting one type of model or favouring one type of service provider.”Although the PC had previously hailed competition in VET as a model of well-regulated competition, the undeniable failure of Fee-Help was now blamed on the regulator, the Australian Skills Quality Authority. But the only solution offered was more and better “safeguards”, a term which usually means Band-Aid solutions to fundamental design problems.Since then we have seen catastrophic failures inaged care, thereversal of the move to private prisonsand theexclusion of acute care hospitals from so-called “public-private partnerships”.Even the PC is backing away from the for-profit model. Its latest report on childcare noted the growing dominance of the for-profit sector and observed that a much larger proportion of for-profit providers failed to meet standards. The chair of the inquiry, Prof Deborah Brennan, provided a supplementary statement urging action to reduce the share of for-profit businesses. Brennan observed that aspects of Australia’s “highly marketized approach” to childcare will “work against equitable, high quality provision unless moderated”.“Accordingly, I suggest measures to strengthen and expand not for-profit provision, attention to the financial strategies of large investor-backed and private equity companies, and regulatory strategies to discourage providers whose business models and labour practices do not align well with the National Cabinet vision,” she wrote.Early childhood educators should be millionaires! Instead they are freaking out because they can’t pay their bills or feed their own kids | First Dog on the MoonRead moreThis expert judgment was a bridge too far for the PC ideologues, who ducked the issue for the most part. An exception was the idea of a tendering scheme for “persistent ‘thin’ markets”, where the commission proposed to “strongly prefer not-for-profit providers where a service is completely or substantially directly funded by government”.It was unclear why this preference did not extend to the much larger part of the sector that relies on indirect government funding through subsidies to parents.To its credit, the Albanese government has done a good deal to repair the damage done to the public Tafe system, with increased funding and fee-free places. For-profit providers are complaining about the “complete annihilation” of the private sector, even asyet more dodgy practicesare revealed.But we need more than a sector-by-sector response. Rather than repeating the cycle of for-profit booms, failures, exposés and re-regulation, it’s time to admit that that the ideology of market competition has failed. For-profit corporations have no place, or at most a peripheral place, in the provision of basic human services, including health, education and childcare. “People before profit” might seem like a simplistic slogan but it is much close to the truth than “competition and choice”.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s school of economicsExplore more on these topicsPrivatisationOpinionChildcare AustraliaProductivity CommissionProductivityBusinessAustralian Broadcasting CorporationAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The answer is more complex than you might thinkChris WestThe war in Gaza means the European Broadcasting Union is risking its liberal reputation, but to ban Israel would be to undermine the organisation’s fundamental purposeFri 16 May 2025 00.00 EDTShareAs they get ready to watch this year’s final on Saturday, many Eurovision fans will be feeling conflicted. Some will not watch at all. The reason is the participation of Israel. Isn’t Eurovision supposed to be about “love, love, peace, peace” (as the 2016 contest’s Swedish hosts so memorably portrayed it)? If so, they may ask, what’s the besieger of Gaza doing there?Some people argue that the people who runEurovision, members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), are simply spineless. Others point to the sponsorship of the event by Moroccanoil, which despite its name is Israeli. But a big international organisation is hardly dependent on a beauty products company.The Eurovision vlogger Matthew Wrather has put forward a more subtleargument: it’s about the EBU’s fundamental purpose. The union was founded in 1950, and had both a technical and what we would now regard as a political remit. Technically, the project was about sharing ideas and enabling international broadcasts (the song contest was just one of these: the first was an awards festival in Montreux). Politically, the EBU supported state-run “public service broadcasting” with a fundamentally critical, liberal bias: broadcasters that were simply mouthpieces for their governments were excluded. Having fought nazism and now living in the shadow of Soviet Russia, western Europeans saw open debate as being at the heart of serious broadcasting.Since then, however, this model has come under fire.In most parts ofEurope, the right routinely blasts public service broadcasters as liberal mouthpieces. Many on the left see them as bastions of conservative values, defending the status quo at best or as state propaganda at worst.With its mission now contested, the EBU has its back to the wall in ways it didn’t in 1950.Nowhere is this more true than in Israel. In 2017, Benjamin Netanyahu abolished the old Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) – Eurovision in that year was its last broadcast. The reasons cited were financial, but commentators argue that it was a political move: the IBA was seen as too leftwing. It was replaced with Kan, the current broadcaster. Kan is more docile than the IBA – but still not docile enough for the government, which wants to ithanded to the private sector. The communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, previously put forward a proposal to this effect in 2023, accusing the network of biased coverage and claiming that it spoke in a“disgraceful manner”towards members of the government. Such a body would be breaking EBU rules and would not be allowed into Eurovision.The EBU feels obliged to protect Kan, even if that means risking the Eurovision brand. That’s what it was created for: to champion “free and independent” public service broadcasting. Running the Eurovision song contest is only tangential to that mission.There is no easy way out. After Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine the EBU made no move to ban Russia from Eurovision until participating nations changed from issuing statements and suggesting meaningful dialogue to saying they would quit –at which point action followed swiftly. The same has not happened over Israel’s involvement in the competition.The EBU is in a way the victim of its own success in running Eurovision. The contest has grown from its original, essentially lighthearted roots into something that sends powerful political messages around the world. Its bosses had it easy for a long time, as these messages were uncontroversial in liberal circles. When the transgender Israeli singerDana International won in 1998, the EBU could genuinely pat itself on the back for being at the forefront of social change. The same withConchita Wurst’s magnificent victory in 2014. Eurovision was about good and wonderful things. “Love, love, peace, peace.”Now, the organisation finds itself with a dilemma. The current Israeli government is not a practitioner of peace and its participation in the contest has been used by some to demonstrate support for the nation. In the long run, the EBU must either relinquish control of the song contest or change its mission so that protection (and development) of the Eurovision brand lies unambiguously at its heart. It must set clearer rules for eligibility, so that the contest really is about “love, love, peace, peace”. But this year, Eurovision will not be an easy watch for the thoughtful fan.Chris West is the author of Eurovision: A History of Modern Europe Through the World’s Greatest Song Contest, published by Melville House UKExplore more on these topicsEurovision 2025OpinionEurovisionIsraelEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Bring on the innuendo!Michael HoganFri 16 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 16.41 EDTSharePomp and pageantry. People from different nations wearing camp costumes. A tense buildup before the winner is announced. But enough of the papal conclave. It’s time for May’s other main event: theEurovisionsong contest.The eccentric extravaganza’s 69th edition – expect that number to be the subject of cheap innuendo – is being held in Basel, Switzerland. An audience of 160 million is expected to tune in for the usual heady mix of geopolitical point-scoring, cheesy sentiment and surreal performances.The prelude to the annual Europop party has seen complaints about several songs’ lyrics and debates over Israel’s inclusion. On Saturday night at 8pm, though, it’s time for the squabbling to stop and the spectacle to begin. We’ve hand-crafted your ultimate viewing guide to the contenders, the coverage and the controversies. Altogether now: good evening, Europe – and good morning, Australia. This is Eurovision calling …The favouritesView image in fullscreenHot in here … Sweden’s KAJ perform sauna-based anthem Bara Bada Bastu.Photograph: Harold Cunningham/Getty ImagesEurovision results are notoriously tricky to predict but let’s try anyway. Of Saturday night’s 26 acts, France’s Louane – whose tearjerking Maman is addressed to her late mother – is the biggest on social media, with 1.2 million Instagram followers and 1.3 million on TikTok. Sweden’s entry, however, has the most popular song:Bara Bada Bastu– a sweaty ode to saunas by trio KAJ, joined by dancers in skimpy towels – has the most Spotify streams and YouTube views. It’s currently the bookies runaway favourite to make it a record eighth win for the Swedes.Another hot tip is Austria’s JJ, who hopes to emulate his compatriot Conchita Wurst’s 2014 triumph with opera-meets-techno mashup Wasted Love. Iceland’s foil-clad siblings Væb have been dubbed, worryingly, “the Viking Jedward”. Their hyper electro-rap dittyRóa– which is about actual rowing, oar fans – was a chart-topper in their country and could be the sort of novelty that appeals to voters.Also much fancied is San Marino’s Gabry Ponte withTutta L’Italia, an infectiously naff EDM celebration of all things Italian, composed by one of the “brains” behind Eiffel 65’s Blue (Da Ba Dee). “The Mona Lisa laughs but she’s in Paris,” he sings. Riiight.The wild cardsWe can look forward to some amusingly bananas dance bangers. Finland’s dominatrix diva Erika Vikman delivers a smutty paean to sexual emissions in gay disco homage Ich Komme which, ahem, climaxes with her soaring into the air astride a massive gold microphone that sprays sparks across the stage. Subtle.Another Scandi-pop contender is Denmark’s Sissal, whose Euro-bop Hallucination sounds like a David Guetta thumper with guest vocals from an Adele tribute act. She’s flanked by dancers wearing what appear to be gimp suits. Enjoy, fetish fans.Luxembourg is gunning for a sixth win with Laura Thorn’s La Poupée Monte le Son. It’s a response to France Gall’s 1965 winner Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son, which was about a “fashion doll” operated by songwriting saucepot Serge Gainsbourg. Thorn’s empowered lyrics – “If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mummy” – are followed by a nagging “na na na” chorus. Textbook Eurovision nonsense.The controversiesView image in fullscreenHey there, disco lips! … Malta’s Miriana Conte performs the shamelessly camp Serving.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APLike last year, there have been calls to end Israel’s participation amid the ongoing war in Gaza. A ban on spectators waving Palestinian flags has been overturned, while Israeli fans have been warned about potential protests and antisemitic attacks. Their entrant is 24-year-old Yuval Raphael, who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova festival in Israel. The lyrics of her gutsy ballad New Day Will Rise seem to refer to the tragedy.Malta’s Miriana Conte was forced to hastily rewrite her shamelesslycamp numberafter complaints about swearing. It was originally titled Kant, the Maltese word for singing, which sounded like a certain C-word in the chorus about “serving kant”. She’s woven the kerfuffle into the cleaned-up version, meaning it now features an unlikely sample from BBC economics editor Faisal Islam in a Newsnight report on the story.Estonia’s infernally catchyEspresso Macchiato– performed by Tommy Cash, a viral rapper who once appeared on a Charli xcx record – has been accused of insulting Italians with its stereotypical references to coffee-sipping, chain-smoking mafiosi. It also features the profound lyric “Life is like spaghetti, it’s hard until you make it”, all delivered in an accent worthy of a Dolmio ad.The host nationView image in fullscreenLumo arrives for the opening ceremony of the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesThe contest takes place in Switzerland following fluffy-jacketed Nemo becoming the first non-binary winner last year with operatic banger The Code. The venue is St Jakobshalle, a 12,000-capacity brutalist-style sports hall in Basel. Our hosts inside the arena are “slam poet” (yikes) Hazel Brugger, ex-model Michelle Hunziker and singer Sandra Studer, who represented her country in 1991 and finished fifth. Expect her to mention this rather too many times.This year’s Swiss entry is Zoë Më with breathy balladVoyage. A young Céline Dion represented Switzerland in1988 and won. She sent a video message in Tuesday’s semi-final and has been in talks about returning for a surprise guest performance on Saturday which would be, well, titanic.For the first time, the contest has a mascot: a heart-shaped monstrosity called Lumo. Its ginger curls and trout-pouty lips have seen it compared to the love child of Michael Fabricant and Mick Hucknall.The UK’s hopesView image in fullscreen‘A little bit of yee-haw’ … the UK’s country-tinged girl group Remember Monday perform What the Hell Just Happened?Photograph: Martin Meissner/APLe Royaume-Uni’s entry is girl group Remember Monday – confusingly, competing on a Saturday – with playful power-pop balladWhat the Hell Just Happened?The country-tinged trio describe themselves as “pop girlies with a lil’ bit of yee-haw”. Translation: they occasionally wear cowboy boots. They previously entered spinny-chaired contest The Voice, where they were mentored by Jennifer Hudson but didn’t win. An omen, one fears. They’re the first girl band to represent the UK since Precious in 1999. Nope, us neither.UK fortunes have “done a Brexit” in recent decades. It’s 28 years sincewe won(arise, Katrina and your Waves). Since 2000, we’ve got the wooden spoon five times. Sam “Space Man” Ryder – half-Jesus, half-golden labrador – bucked the downward trend by finishingrunner-up in 2022.

As is traditional, Eurovision will be broadcast live on BBC One and iPlayer with Graham Norton on commentary duties. When the late, great Terry Wogan retired in 2008 after an epic 35-year stint, Norton seamlessly slipped into his loafers as our tongue-in-cheek guide. “This is Marmite – if everyone hated Marmite,” he memorably said of Germany’s act in 2021, before adding about Serbia’s pop trio: “Less Destiny’s Child, more Destiny’s Inappropriate Aunt.”We’d suggest popping on the subtitles for maximum enjoyment of the nonsensical song lyrics. If you want to assault your own eardrums but spare your eyeballs, Scott Mills and Rylan helm coverage on Radio 2 and BBC Sounds. Proceedings kick off at 8pm and are scheduled to finish at midnight but often overrun. Stock up on snacks, strap in and pace yourself.As a timey-wimey warm-up, it’s preceded at 7.10pm by a Eurovision-themed episode of Doctor Who, titledThe Interstellar Song Contest. Action unfolds at the 803rd edition of a galaxy-wide singing competition, with cameos from Graham Norton and Rylan, plus other surprise Eurovision alumni. The Time Lord connection was due to continue during the contest itself, but sadly Ncuti Gatwa was forced to pull out of being UK spokesperson due to “unforeseen circumstances”. Instead, the British jury’s scores will be announced by kitchen disco diva Sophie Ellis-Bextor.

It has won three times since its 2003 debut and is the only country to qualify for the grand final every year it has competed.Cyprus is the least successful nation, having competed 40 times without winning. Norway have the most flops, finishing last 12 times, four of those with nul points.Eurovision rules state that songs must not be longer than three minutes and no more than six people are allowed on stage.

Now we need to decide who will play the other elemental forcesFri 16 May 2025 09.21 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 12.56 EDTShareSome actors are lucky and manage to immediately luck into a perfect role. Others have to struggle for years, sometimes even decades, before eventually finding a part that completely encapsulates their personality.Jeremy Ironsis one of them. But the good news is that his number has just come up, because Jeremy Irons has just been cast as the sea.According to Variety, Water People: The Story of Us, the first documentary feature by acclaimed artist Maya de Almeida Araujo has just cast Irons as the voice of the ocean. Which just makes perfect sense, doesn’t it?Seriously, don’t even try to do better, because you can’t. The sea is powerful and intimidating, aloof and angry. It can look pleasant enough from a distance, but up close is unbelievably contemptuous of everything that surrounds it. In short, the sea is always looking for a way to murder you, and as such it should definitely sound like Jeremy Irons.Who else could you possibly pick? Kevin Hart? Too squeaky. Jack Black? Too overblown. Olivia Colman? Perhaps a smidge too silly. In his day, you could guarantee that Orson Welles would have loved a shot at playing the sea, but nobody wants to hear a large body of water be that pleased with itself. Any other actor? Also no.There’s no telling how well Water People: The Story of Us will do. But the best case scenario is that it will be a smash hit and open the doors to a wide spectrum of The Story of Us offshoots based on various elements and entities. They will all need to be cast as well, so let’s get ahead of the jump and figure out who should play these things.Cloud People: The Story of UsFirst, let’s get one thing straight. A cloud is not just the sea in the sky. Jeremy Irons might be a perfect sea, but he’d be a terrible cloud. If you can’t see that I’m not sure I can help you. A cloud should be lighter and prettier, but the actor who plays it should also have enough range to be able to completely ruin your day. Would Emily Blunt make a compelling cloud? I think so.Tree People: The Story of UsAny idiot can voice a tree. John Rhys-Davies did it in Lord of the Rings, playing Treebeard. Linda Hunt played Grandmother Willow in Pocahontas. Vin Diesel played Groot in the Guardians of the Galaxy films. But to play trees as a concept, as Irons has with the ocean, is a different matter entirely. To do that, you need a voice that exists outside of recognisable frequencies. Your voice must be almost unfathomably untroubled by the time demands of ephemeral humans. In other words, slow. The obvious choice would be Morgan Freeman, but let’s be imaginative here. Let’s go with the American comedian Joe Pera or, better yet, Flash the Sloth from Zootopia.Tectonic Fissure People: The Story of UsTo be a volcano is to play two different extremes. For most of the time, a volcano is a quiet, passive thing that holds an air of menace. And then there’s the inevitable eruption, loud and showy and violent. Very few actors can pull off this juxtaposition well. And that’s why I’d like the volcano to be played by Al Pacino. Or, more accurately, AI representations of Al Pacino. When the volcano is dormant, I’d like it to sound like Pacino from the first bit of The Godfather, charismatic but diffident. When it erupts, though, I’d like to use an AI model of his final scene from The Devil’s Advocate, because that’s how I assume volcanoes sound up close.The Blank Infinite Nothingness of Space: The Story of UsThe final film in the series should be an exploration of space, in all its terrifying expanse. This is maybe the hardest to voice, because it needs to be cold and indifferent. It needs to be booming but precise. It needs to somehow encompass all of life as we know it, but also doesn’t seem to like it very much. It should be the sort of voice that groans with repressed anguish whenever Katy Perry tries to penetrate it. You’ll have spent the last 90 words thinking “Just shut up and say Werner Herzog”, and you’re right.Explore more on these topicsFilmJeremy IronscommentShareReuse this content"

Born Lindsey French – and previously known as Negative Gemini – Neggy Gemmy’s music spans coldwave, shoegaze, trance, vaporwave and capital-P pop; her records can be icily aggressive or hedonistic and seductive, often in the span of the same song. Although her work is always distinctive, she’s also canny with iconoclastic references. On 2016’s Body Work, she sampled Britney Spears’ Everytime one song before her own masterpiece of emotional desolation, the breakbeat ballad You Never Knew; the highlight from her underrated 2023 club odyssey CBD Reiki Moonbeam, titled On the Floor, sounds like – and, in a just world, would have been – a 2000s Kylie Minogue single. French’s forthcoming album She Comes from Nowhere still foregrounds her distinctive voice, which can be both breathy and appealingly harsh, but it also incorporates touches of gauzy, gallic bands such as Stereolab and Air, adding appealing new textures to her work.Despite the relative pop appeal of her music, French is also stridently independent: She is the co-founder of the influential cult vaporwave label 100% Electronica with her husband George Clanton, and has rarely released music through an outside label. During a time when conversations about ownership and rights dominate pop music, French, Clanton and the artists they work with represent the internet’s potential to foster a self-sustaining scene without gatekeepers or big money. With any luck, She Comes from Nowhere will find an even larger stage to spread the sound (and the message).Shaad D’SouzaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenSofia Kourtesis and Daphni.Sofia Kourtesis – Unidos (with Daphni)As if two of dance’s warmest producers collaborating would be anything other than radiantly uplifting: “You never let them get you down!” a voice declares, as the relentless beat crushes desolation to dust.LSAlan Sparhawk – Not BrokenSparhawk’s daughter Hollis joins him on this banjo-laced lament about resisting anger in the face of loss, her vocals a disarming echo of her late mother Mimi Parker’s muted hymnals.LSDJ Dadamanand Moscow Dollar – MatlatsiThis pair were at the heart of the “Bacardi house” scene of 00s South Africa that gave the world Township Funk, and now they’re back with this spry, sinewy hybrid of piano-house and amapiano.BBTThe None – At HopeNamed for a senator’s suggestion that “at-risk” kids should be called “at-hope”, the post-hardcore band’s latest thrashes against inequality. “To make a living, you’ve got to give in,” taunts fearless Kai Whyte.LSClaire Rousay andGretchen Korsmo – Find Yourself in a Hole on the BeachRousay never stops, here joining with a fellow US sound artist for an intensely blissful wash of field recordings, balmy vocalisations and acoustic guitar that spreads like ink in water.LSPile – Born at NightShades ofProtomartyrto this dynamic art-rock anthem from the Boston DIY mainstays, tumbling in a torrent of rolling drums but held aloft by strident violin.BBTCelestial – Mermaid Boulevard (ft Romance)The ambient-folk Mancunians turn in a wildly beautiful instrumental, with a longform Vini Reilly-ish Balearic guitar solo over a looped, reversed waltzing motif.BBTSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 1963, the makers of acclaimed Polish film Passenger were still given permission to film at Auschwitz.In the early 90s Steven Spielberg was denied permission to film Schindler’s List inside the concentration camp, setting one scene outside the infamous Auschwitz gatehouse and building replicas of the barracks just outside the camp.Italian director Roberto Benigni’s Life Is Beautiful, which is partially set in a concentration camp, was filmed in an abandoned factory near Papigno, Umbria, while Hungarian director László Nemes’s Oscar-winning Auschwitz drama Son of Saul was shot on the outskirts of Budapest.The Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial said the feature-film ban was due to the need to preserve the site and prevent closures, rather than moral concerns. But some film-makers and artists have argued that setting films inside Auschwitz is outright unethical.Austrian director Michael Haneke condemned Schindler’s List as “unspeakable” for drawing suspense out of the question of whether gas or water would flow out of the shower heads at the camp.Oscar-winning 2023 film The Zone of Interest was filmed on grounds next to the camp, but British film-maker Jonathan Glazer made an artistic and ethical point about never allowing his cameras to swoop over its walls.Asked about what kind of films could use the Picture from Auschwitz resource, the memorial’s spokesperson Pawel Sawicki said: “When assessing proposals for film projects, we put historical accuracy above everything else: whether this is what happened at Auschwitz, or what could have happened at Auschwitz, given the knowledge coming from the testimonies, historical documents we have, and years of historical research.”As to whether this could in principle allow horror films, action movies or video games to be set inside Auschwitz as long as they were historically accurate, Sawicki said the rules around genre had not been finalised.“The lines have not been drawn yet, as this is something very new for us, but there will certainly be boundaries. The camp should not be used as a stage in any way. If the proposal is to make a film that distorts history, dishonours the memory of victims, or serves purely as entertainment, that’s a red flag for us.”One of the people who has advised the project is Ryszard Horowitz, 86, a photographer who was interned at Auschwitz as a five-year-old in 1944, and survived after his family were taken under the wing of Oskar Schindler. “I’m for keeping this story alive, and I like the idea of authenticity,” he said.Polish film-maker Agnieszka Holland, who is acting as Picture from Auschwitz’s director, said she believes opening up the site for film-makers of the future was necessary to allow a new generation to confront the darkest moment in European history.“For a long time, the horror of the second world war and theHolocaustwas a warning lesson that brought about important changes, such as the construction of a European identity,” Holland said.“But the vaccinating effect of the Holocaust has evaporated, and now we are in a similarly dangerous situation to where we were 90 years ago.”Explore more on these topicsFilmHolocaustSecond world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two decades on, she’s building bonds with a new generation of stars – and going viral with a gravity-defying chair trickFri 16 May 2025 08.20 EDTShareBackstage at April’s Coachella festival, beyond the influencers, branded content and celebrity PDAs, a viral moment was brewing. R&B superstar Ciara was dancing on a chair – not just any dance, but a gravity-defying move that involved laying stomach-first on the chair’s back, arms locked, feet wiggling to the music. She wasn’t alone either; friends Cara Delevingne, Victoria Monét and Megan Thee Stallion were all doing the move too. The soundtrack was Ecstasy, the sultry new single from Ciara’s forthcoming eighth album, CiCi. The dance became a trend on TikTok, with even a 75-year-old grandma from Miami successfully giving it a go.When I suggest trying it in our interview, Ciara’s face lights up with enthusiasm. “You can do it,” she says, her American optimism making me believe she’s right. “What kind of chair are you sitting on right now?” I show her my cheap Ikea number and her enthusiasm dips somewhat. She’s sitting in the back of a plush-looking car at a New York airport, waiting to fly to Atlanta, her phone held close to her face so she can see better. It’s not the chair I’m worried about, I tell her, but my general fitness. “You do need a little strength in your arms,” she says, sitting back as if to say: “Let’s not risk it.”Ciara wasn’t just in the California desert to test out chair choreography. She also made a surprise appearance during Megan Thee Stallion’s set, performing Roc Steady – a track that heavily samples Ciara’s own 2004 breakthrough hit Goodies. That debut single announced her arrival on the global stage, reaching No 1 in the US and UK, and briefly earning her the title “First Lady of Crunk’n’B”, the energetic subgenre that fused hip-hop with club music’s sweat-soaked pulse.View image in fullscreenCiara performing at Coachella in April this year.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for CoachellaThat smash was followed by a string of hits that defined mid-00s pop-R&B: the Missy Elliott collaborations 1,2 Step and Lose Control; the gender-flipping anthem Like a Boy; 2018’s comeback hit Level Up; and sultry slow jams such as Oh, Ride and Body Party. Now, the artist who once cited Michael and Janet Jackson as influences is herself being namechecked by a new generation, including Megan Thee Stallion, Tinashe, Tate McRae and Normani. “It’s so inspiring,” she says of this torch-passing moment. “I think more than those artists know. Meg was sharing some really kind words to me after the performance and I was taking it all in.”Inspiring it may be, but does being an influence to younger artists make her feel, well, old? She lets out a genuine laugh. “Listen, I got a birthday coming up and so I’ve yet to cross a certain mark in my life,” says Ciara, 39, deliberately avoiding using a certain F-word. “I don’t want to say the age – that’s how significant it is to me. But my point is, I feel like I’m just getting started. I’m much wiser than I was yesterday. But, you know, CiCi is still tapped in, so I don’t feel old yet.”I was offputting to some because they couldn’t convince me to think what I didn’t thinkShe will aim to prove that when she headlines south London’s pop-leaning queer festival Mighty Hoopla. Such is her busy life – she’s a mother of four; runs her own record label, Beauty Marks; and is a part owner of US soccer team the Seattle Sounders alongside her husband, NFL star Russell Wilson – that she says she’s still learning about the festival. “I know that everyone loves to come out at Mighty Hoopla,” she smiles. “People want to live their best lives, be free, have fun, dance, leave happy. So that’s my goal: to make people experience all of that.”Ciara’s positive disposition – nearly every answer is given through a megawatt smile – has been tested over the years. Born “a proud military brat” in Austin, Texas and raised mainly in Atlanta, her mum was in the air force while her dad was in the army. “I didn’t have a lot growing up, to be honest,” she says. “But I had a big dream and I was very convinced in my vision of what I saw life like for myself.” It was a transient early life. At one point the family were stationed in east Germany, with Ciara enrolling in a school in Giessen. She can still remember the food – “I did have bratwurst, but I don’t like sauerkraut so much” – and a tiny bit of the language. “I used to say German curse words, mainlyscheisse,” she laughs.View image in fullscreenField position … Ciara with her husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, at Coachella in April.Photograph: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for YouTube MusicAfter settling in Atlanta, where she briefly joined a girlband, she was discovered by record producer Jazze Pha, and eventually signed by LA Reid. She already had Goodies in her back pocket. “I believed in that song so much that I held it close by my side,” she says. “I rode in my car, my little Honda Element back in the days, and I would just drive with the instrumental playing, trying to perfect every line.” Having her name on the credits from the off was important to her in a 00s music industry that didn’t necessarily celebrate the input of young Black women. “I really didn’t think I was bound by my ethnicity, or my gender,” she says. “Then as I got older I realised: ‘Oh that really was a different kind of war I was fighting,’ and I had no idea I was, and why I was. I was just this young girl with big ambition and big confidence. I was offputting to some because they couldn’t convince me to think what I didn’t think.”While the hits kept coming, by 2010’s Basic Instinct, the relationship with her label had disintegrated. For the album’s third single, Gimme Dat, Ciara spent $200,000 of her own money on the video and marketing. “I’m always going to bet on myself,” she states. It’s why she set up her own label: “I’ve just never believed in leaving my career in someone else’s hands. I never have, never will.” There were other battles. Feuds were created left, right and centre, with the media pitting Ciara against Beyoncé and Rihanna (a testy Twitter exchange in 2011 with the latter was blown up into a feud, which the pair “ended” by posing together at the Met Gala earlier this month), while a remix of Keri Hilson’s 2008 Turnin’ Me On was thought to include attacks on Ciara. “In our industry there was this thing, especially back in the day, where executives and teams liked to make girls be separate and not engage with each other,” Ciara says. “It’s so funny because I watch my husband in [American] football and it’s incredible to see how much the boys show each other so much love. And that’s how I’ve always lived my life. I’ve never been a clique person. I always say I’m my own clique.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When Ciara discusses her ability to fashion eye-popping choreography for even her slowest of ballads, she casually refers to the songs collectively as “baby-making music”. Don’t tell your husband that, I joke. “Oh, he knows,” she smiles. Does he try to put your songs on in the bedroom? “Oh my lordy, Michael!” she screams, before getting serious. “We both love the idea of our family growing, to be honest. [Wilson] always quotes the Bible; be fruitful and multiply. But I love being a mom. It’s my favourite job of all.”Seemingly, the only thing she loves more is the UK; her 2016 marriage to Wilson took place in a castle in Cheshire. “I’m obsessed with the people in the UK,” she says in a dodgy British accent, “with the energy, the culture. I love the food.” When I tell her I’m surprised by the latter she clarifies that she loves the Japanese food she often eats in the UK. And Nando’s (her order: spicy chicken, sweet potato mash, corn on the cob).All this talk of Britain returns us to Mighty Hoopla, where the chair-dancing will undoubtedly make a reappearance. With the setlist still up in the air, I suggest she perform 2013’s Overdose, a near-immaculate slice of loved-up dance-pop that should go down a storm. “Oh OK,” she smiles. “That’s some good feedback.” I sense she’s just being nice; if there’s one thing the last 21 years has taught Ciara it’s to follow her instincts.Ciara playsMighty Hoopla,Brockwell Park,London,31 May; CiCi is released11 July.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockR&BfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As he releases soul-baring film Hurry Up Tomorrow, he charts his path through drugs, heartbreak and abandonmentFri 16 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 16 May 2025 11.32 EDTShareWalking out to perform in front of 80,000 people and finding that your voice has gone: it’s the type of stress dream you have the night before a big work presentation. But for Abel Tesfaye, AKA the Weeknd, it happened for real at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium in 2022. “I ran backstage to find my vocal coach: I can’t sing, it’s not coming out,” he says. “And what I found out later on is that I was having a panic attack. It wasn’t a physical injury. It was more up here” – he gestures to his head – “than it was here” – his throat.The concert, which had to be called off and rescheduled, was the final night of a US stadium tour happening while Tesfaye was also wrapping up his painfully gestated – and eventually widely lampooned –TV series The Idol, which he starred in, co-wrote and co-produced. As production overran, he fitted in shoots around his tour; his own home was the main filming location. He began experiencing sleep paralysis.The Idol’s closing scenes were shot at SoFi Stadium the night before Tesfaye lost his voice, with him in character as manipulative mogul Tedros. He then did an entire Weeknd concert, then went back to being Tedros for four more hours of filming on the same night. The overwork finally caught up with him. “Any time something happened in my life, I could always rely on going on stage and escaping whatever’s going on,” he says. “This was the first time I couldn’t just escape. My body was like: you can’t sing it away. You have to figure it out.”View image in fullscreenEgo v unconscious … Barry Keoghan (left) and Tesfaye in Hurry Up Tomorrow.Photograph: Andrew Cooper/Lionsgate/APThe loss of his voice and the aftermath inspired him to co-write a psychological thriller out this week, Hurry Up Tomorrow, directed by Trey Edward Shults (a darling of the trendy A24 production stable). Heartbroken after a breakup that seems to be his fault, and pressured into performing by his manager (Barry Keoghan), Tesfaye, playing himself, goes off the rails and his voice burns out. He then meets a troubled fan, Anima, played by Jenna Ortega. Soon we’re witnessing a Carl Jung-inspired battle between Tesfaye’s ego and his unconscious, full of jump scares and petrol-doused fires. Like most films about musicians, it will appeal primarily to fans – but there are some startling images, and while Tesfaye’s acting has a couple of soap-y moments, he is generally very good as he thrashes through his neuroses.After a 15-year career that has made him one of the world’s biggest pop stars, with the most-streamed song of all time in Blinding Lights, the film could be the end of the entire Weeknd project. “I feel grateful that I get to film my persona on 35mm, and light it on fire,” he says, sitting in a suite at the Four Seasons in New York. “I’m sure every artist would love to do that. Because it gets to a point where you don’t want to be identified for something you started at 19 years old – and then the music industry capitalises off it, off misery or whatever.The Weekndfelt like a 15-year film.” And with Hurry Up Tomorrow, “I got to say: cut! And that’s a wrap.”View image in fullscreen‘This isn’t greatness’ … Tesfaye at Coachella in 2012.Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images/CoachellaNow 35, Tesfaye was born to Ethiopian parents in Toronto and raised by his single mother and grandmother. He dropped out of high school and focused on making music. At his first gigs in the early 2010s, he says he was protected from exposure by it being “the early internet age”, with fans “filming on old BlackBerry cameras”. But then he saw high-definition footage of his 2012 set at Coachella, his first visit to the US. “I said: this isn’t greatness. This is something I’ve failed at. I told my agent to book me 100 shows that year, so I can work that muscle.”Over downbeat R&B production, an initial trilogy of mixtapes set out the lyrical themes that would come to dominate the Weeknd project: narcotics, trauma and sex, much of the latter fraught with infidelity and control issues. If you only listened to those early songs – and a fair number of his later ones too – you might think Tesfaye was rather like The Idol’s Tedros, a sex-obsessed hedonist drawn to ethically dubious BDSM dynamics and mountains of cocaine. But Tesfaye is a warm host in a chic black tracksuit, who invites me up to his suite rather than our meeting room. His conversation style is gentle, peppered with charming bursts of sudden amusement. He has donated millions of dollars through his philanthropic foundation to causes in Palestine, Ethiopia and more. It’s Mother’s Day in the US, and you can well imagine someone has received a large bouquet that morning: “My mother is so pure, and everything good from me comes from her,” he says. “She’s light, just light.”There is a little chill, though, when I suggest that sex and relationships were presented as quite negative and transactional in that early songwriting. Tesfaye frowns; evidently he won’t go down this avenue. But he allows the warm glow to return, and concedes that at the time, “the point was to provoke in any way. To break through and provoke emotion, extreme has always been the way to go. To me it was more like being punk; at that time, it was me, it was Tyler [the Creator], it was rock’n’roll.”View image in fullscreenBack at Coachella in 2023.Photograph: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/ CoachellaThe size of the gap between the soulful Tesfaye and the nihilistic Weeknd is a compelling part of the project, but Tesfaye doesn’t want to analyse this either, saying it’s the same “for every artist, not just me”. The drugs and drink in the songs were real, though. “Drugs were really good at heightening how good a song sounds when you’re making it. And then you hear it the next morning and it’s like …” He makes an awkward-realisation face. “You’ve got to be high to experience this!” For a time, he relied on alcohol to perform, “to fight nerves, to get on that stage. I never had singing lessons, never had a mentor. There was no way I was going to be great without practice. You’ve got to just go out there and fail, and failing isn’t fun. The drinking helped me deal with the oncoming failure.”The mixtapes thrilled the underground but his ambition pushed him into the mainstream in 2015 with second albumBeauty Behind the Madness– its disco-funk and power ballads would have rivalled Get Lucky and Uptown Funk in thefamily-friendly stakes were it not for all the cocaine references. Can’t Feel My Face and The Hills both went to No 1 in the US, and Earned It, from Fifty Shades of Grey, got an Oscar nomination. “I was like: it doesn’t get bigger than this,” he says. “And naturally, then I’m like: I’ve got to beat this. You don’t want to beknownfor a song. That’s the advice I give any young artist: if you get a big song, figure out what the next move is, because you don’t want that song to identify who you are.” He cancelled a tour and went straight into making his next album, Starboy; featuring rare Daft Punk guest spots, it was even more successful. “Starboy, there was no real story. It was just: how do I get bigger than I did last year?”The subsequent EP, My Dear Melancholy, “felt more personal again. I could focus on the heartbreak side, the vulnerable side.” He’d had two relationships with A-list women by this point, namely Bella Hadid and Selena Gomez, and I ask if there was a particular heartbreak that precipitated it. “No.” He laughs at his total stonewalling. “I’m not getting into that! But Call Out My Name became one of the biggest songs I’d ever done – I was so thankful to do stuff that’s personal and still succeeding. And then when I did After Hours” – his most successful album – “I was able to take everything I’d learned and make my magnum opus. The hit qualities of my music, the vulnerable qualities, the storytelling qualities.”This is rather grandly expressed, but it’s justified. Released in March 2020 just as the Covid pandemic became a global crisis, After Hours’ blockbuster 80s-influenced pop, and Tesfaye’s doomed-romance storytelling, made it a perfect escapist pleasure and it went multi-platinum worldwide. He headlined the 2021 Super Bowl; lead single Blinding Lights is close to becoming the first song to be streamed 5bn times on Spotify. A blackly comic scene in Hurry Up Tomorrow features Ortega’s character, Anima, strapping Tesfaye to a bed and taunting him as the song plays on hotel room speakers. “I’m going to die listening to this fucking song that I couldn’t escape,” he explains to me. “It’s almost like: this is my punishment.” Here was the potentially career-defining hit he’d always tried to run from – did it feel like a millstone round his neck? “At one point. I love it now, but at one point I was like: holy shit, this thing got bigger than anything.”Later in the same scene, Anima plays Gasoline, a song from After Hours’ follow-upDawn FM– in my opinion, Tesfaye’s masterpiece, but nothing like as commercially successful. Anima taunts Tesfaye again, saying: “Don’t want to call it a failure, but what happened?”When I mention this, Tesfaye lets out a breezily resigned “ehhh” noise. “If anything isn’t bigger than the last thing you’ve done, it’s always going to be a failure to the masses,” he says. At that point, in 2022, his feeling was: “I’m going on a stadium tour, I don’t need to prove that I can do anything again.”View image in fullscreenCritically panned … The Idol, which starred Lily-Rose Depp and Tesfaye.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyThat was, until film-making came along. After a cameo in indie psychodramaUncut Gems, Tesfaye took a big step up in HBO series The Idol as the lead opposite Lily-Rose Depp’s pop star character Jocelyn. Tesfaye’s Tedros is a nightclub owner who has oppressively nurtured a cult of wannabe singers, and he targets Jocelyn as the ultimate prize. The result is a well-acted, amusing and unconvincingly plotted blend of music industry satire and erotic thriller.The Idol was plagued by a massive switch in creative direction, with co-writer Sam Levinson (of Euphoria fame) taking over directing after the series was nearly wrapped, resulting in reshoots. A Rolling Stone exposé of what one source called a “shitshow” turned the buzz toxic. Critics ripped it apart, which, Tesfaye says, “makes a lot of sense”.The issues started long before that director switch, with the original intention being for a film: “Pandemic happened, theatres are not a thing any more at the time, television is the new god.” Then it was meant to be a short miniseries, but it ballooned to a five-parter. “It could have been great if it had a beginning, middle and end. It just ended on middle.” He laughs.“The best films have as much of a singular voice as possible, and everybody working on it cares about it just as much as the director and the actors.” And it didn’t feel that way on The Idol? “No. People cared about it, for sure. But I think it got to a point where everyone was trying to get to the finish line. You can’t force something, you’ve just got to let it be whatever it is, even if it’s half-baked.” Though he was in the writers’ room and producing, he says he didn’t want to exert too much influence, because “then I become ‘difficult’, and the worst thing you can be called in Hollywood is difficult. ‘Difficult’ spreads!” Especially when you’re starting out as an actor. “Exactly. You’ve got to pay your dues. But boy, did I pay my dues.”With The Idol, our instincts were, “this isn’t right” – but we wanted it to workHe suddenly asks me if I’m spiritual. I say I think the world is too mysterious to say anything definitive, but it feels like there’s something there. “I think our instincts are that – it’s God speaking to us: ‘This isn’t right.’ When you go against your instincts, it can be blasphemous. Seriously! And you pay for it. With Idol, our instincts were ‘This isn’t right,’ but wewantedit to work.” It felt off all the way through making it? “Yeah. Too many cooks in the kitchen.” He’s still proud of “the leap of faith, and of everyone involved. Lily I think is going to be such a legend – fearless.”For a time, he “worried that this is what film-making is: hell”. But on Hurry Up Tomorrow, the director, Shults, “brought the joy back into it”. He also provided catharsis. We discuss a scene on a private jet where Tesfaye’s seams are coming apart after his relationship breakup. “That symbolised abandonment,” Tesfaye says. “We all deal with that, whether it’s a father that left us, girlfriend, whatever it is.”Tesfaye’s father left early on in his life, though in the recent song I Can’t Wait to Get There he wonders if they’ll reconnect one day. Were those the feelings of abandonment he was tapping into? “Nope.” An awkward laugh and another stonewall. “Forgiveness is key,” he allows. “Before we shot the film, I went through whatever healing I had to go through. And then I needed to shed that skin, and I wanted to do it in a way that felt more visual. If it wasn’t for [Shults], I would have kept it in the vault – I’ve kept a lot of albums in the vault. But it felt right to tell it.“Men have this forcefield – it’s like we want to come off as invincible, and vulnerability is something you run away from. I was able to be vulnerable in my music, but I was able tohidebehind music. For me to trust someone like Trey to allow myself to be vulnerable, that was new for me. It felt like a therapy session for all of us. I was able to face my child self. We go through so much that we don’t even remember as children, we just suppress everything. If you don’t deal with it, it comes out.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Holly McCandless-DesmondTesfaye releasedan album also called Hurry Up Tomorrowearlier this year. Some songs are “callbacks” to earlier Weeknd material, but in others he seems more relaxed in his skin – perhaps a problem for a project based around darkness. “Traumas in my life, I’ve been hesitant to heal ’em / Take another hit, or my music, they won’t feel it”, he sings on Enjoy the Show.“I was being tongue-in-cheek about it:this is what you guys love me for,” he says. “But it can’t just be debauchery. You don’t want to stay at the party too long – the next thing you know you’re 40 years old and you’re … I don’t want to do that. We all want to age gracefully.” As the Weeknd, he says, “I have said everything I have to say; whatever mission I was on as an 18-year-old, I’ve done it tenfold, and at this point it becomes gluttony, it becomes greed, it’s a sin. Literally!”He’s been hinting at winding up the Weeknd in recent years: is this really the end? “Yeeea … well, look. I have a tour, so I don’t want to confuse anybody.” As for retiring the Weeknd moniker, “I haven’t thought that out. It’s not this calculated vision.”I ask if the Weeknd is creatively exhausted as a project, but he flips it: “Creatively fulfilled. As an artist, you have duties, and you also have dreams. The key to my longevity is to continue dreaming. There is definitely something that isn’t fulfilled for me, and the only way you can go there is if you close a chapter somewhere else. I want to tap into a different part of my life: my heritage. I’ve never been to Ethiopia – I can’t imagine what going back to Africa is going to do for me, spiritually, emotionally, creatively. You need to reconnect with everything about yourself.” I gently ask again: is reconnecting with his father part of that exploration? “I hope so.”View image in fullscreen‘I was able to be vulnerable in my music’ … Tesfaye meets fans in Glendale, Arizona, earlier this month.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Live NationHe says that although his mother is a wonderful parent, in childhood “having a father figure is important. I was able to find that in friendships; I have a stepfather who came into my life later who is just as bright as my mother is – he is pure light, and I learned a lot from him, too. But they say the learning age of three to seven, that stuff stays with you for ever.” He adds that the absence is “so hard to articulate, in an interview especially. I think in the song Hurry Up Tomorrow I was able to eloquently say it.”It’s the final song on the album, delivered as a confession to God: “I’ve been trying to fill that void that my father left / So no one else abandons me – I’m sorry,” Tesfaye sings, before hoping that he makes it to heaven. It ends with the same eerie ambient tone that opens his first mixtape, House of Balloons, a gesture of circularity and finality.Darkness, drama and Daft Punk: the Weeknd’s best songs – ranked!Read moreThe “void” lyric reminds me of something he said earlier in our conversation, when he was reflecting on the relentless work that brought on his panic attack and lost voice. Success, he says, became “something to fill a void:my purpose is to just succeed. And when you’ve done that, you need to look around and see what really matters. The simple things: time with people you love. And sleep – we take it for granted. I didn’t realise how necessary sleep was in my life.” There’s a sighing, romantic tone to his voice, so different to the jaded Weeknd. “Sleep is such a sweet thing, isn’t it?”Hurry Up Tomorrow is in cinemas now.

More than 2,000 people will see the banner this weekend when they arrive at Venezia Hardcore, a festival that began in a rehearsal room among friends and has become one of the most important counterculture events in Europe.This year’s event will feature Jivebomb’s furious hardcore from the US, Violent Magic Orchestra’s techno black metal from Japan, and Italian bands such as cult screamo outfit La Quiete, political street punk four-piece Klasse Kriminale and local heroes Confine. But the star of the festival will stand out due to his absence: 2025 will be the first edition of Venezia Hardcore without Giacomo “Jack” Gobbato, a musician and activist who was stabbed to death in September by a robber who had attacked a woman Gobbato was trying to defend.Gobbato, 26 at the time of his death, was part of the Venezia Hardcore crew, but also an activist, linked to Rivolta, another occupied space in the centre of Mestre, Venice. His death shocked the city. The following week, on 28 September, more than 10,000 people took to the streets of Mestre to pay homage to him. Posters by Zerocalcare, a beloved Italian cartoonist with close ties to social movements, hung on every corner as tribute. Noisy punk songs blasted from speakers while his friends waved giant banners of Gobbato stage-diving.View image in fullscreen‘He wanted to share a dream’ … Giacomo Gobbato at Venezia Hardcore.Photograph: Roberto Graziano MoroThe march was motivated by the desire to show another face of a city that is increasingly linked with robberies, violent assaults and a growing drug problem. Withmore than 50 deaths in the last eight years, Venice is one of the Italian cities with the highest number of fatalities from heroin overdoses in recent years, alongside Rome.The city’s current administration had mostly tried to counteract this with heavier policing, asking the government for the intervention of the army and only returning to invest in social services a couple of years ago.“It’s sad to know you were right, when the consequences hit you like this,” says Sebastiano Bergamaschi, 26, who was with his friend Gobbato the night he was killed. The attacker stabbed both of them. Bergamaschi survived with injuries to his legs, Gobbato died during the night.View image in fullscreenGiacomo Gobbato, an illustration by Zerocalcare.Illustration: Pragser FranzAs an activist, Bergamaschi has dedicated himself to rebuilding the disappearing social fabric of Venice. Gobbato was an important part of that effort, he says. “Music, activism, tattoos, the environment: Jack had many families,” Bergamaschi observes. “And he always had the ability to unite them. He left an incredible mark on the festival and with us he wanted to share a dream, a project, a way of practising it.”Since Gobbato’s death, other initiatives have been formed. The emotional impact of the march brought many people closer to the young activists. Giorgia Gilli, 34, became part of the activist group in October, taking part in night outings to deliver blankets and hot drinks to people sleeping on the streets during the winter. “It would have been impossible for me to go home and pretend nothing had happened,” she reflects. “It was a necessity.”As a passionate music lover, she is now part of Rec Out, a project started by Gobbato himself: a low-cost professional recording studio open to anyone, where dozens of rap, trap, punk and metal musicians have already passed through. The space, inside the squat, also offers a first stage to young artists and the team creates video interviews with guests, to create an open community among musicians and fans.View image in fullscreenMoshpit memories at Venezia HardcorePhotograph: Roberto Graziano MoroFilippo Lunian, 29, who knew Gobbato since high school, realised a number of musical initiatives with him. “You feel the need to do it,” Lunian says. “To be there, to represent an alternative to how the everyday world is.” Despite moments of discouragement, Gobbato’s friends have continued to propose ideas for months. “The best thing we can do is give our contribution,” Sebastiano adds. “You are doing it to change the life of the people around you.”“United we win,” the festival crew wrotein a postdedicated to Gobbato. Gilli offers the perfect metaphor: “It’s like a moshpit: if you fall, I’ll help you get up. I’ll lift you up in stage diving and I’ll pick you up if you’re down. I’m always there, we’re all in this together. That’s what it means to have a community that supports you.”The festival crew thinks the same. “I met him because I noticed this guy at our concerts who always jumped off the stage,” remembers Samall Ali, musician and co-founder of the festival. “We bonded a lot, he was really full of life.” After Gobbato’s murder, there was no doubt that he had to play a role in the next edition of the festival. “I keep thinking: ‘What role do I want to play in this story? What do we do know?’ I think there is a lot to do. And we will do our part. Jack lit a fuse, in many of us, too. We’ll do the festival for him.”Venezia Hardcore runs from 16-17 MayExplore more on these topicsMusicVeniceMetalFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Peter Parker worried about his homework. The Fantastic Four bickered like flatmates. Even the Hulk, a walking nuclear tantrum, was really just a green and muscular guy having a bad day. Over at DC, though, the heroes remained clean, polished and largely unbothered – moral titans gazing down from above, solving problems without ever really having any of their own.Superman was the prototype of that ideal: an all-powerful alien whose only weakness was a glowing space rock and an unshakable sense of duty. He wasn’t like us – he wasbetterthan us. And that was the point. When Margot Kidder’s Lois Lane first meets the man of steel in 1978’sSuperman, she is almost impossibly awestruck by the presence of this walking, talking, flying god. Lois’s wide-eyed vulnerability is a stark contrast with the condescension she doles out to his alter ego, Clark Kent. The two sides of the Last Son of Krypton might be exactly the same person, but it’s virtually impossible for anyone to recognise them as such, because one radiates impossible power while the other can barely hold on to his briefcase.For those of us brought up on the 1978 version of Superman, the sight of him squirming in the face of a mildly probing interview by Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) inthe first full trailer for James Gunn’s Supermanis like watching a Greek god forget his lines in a school play. Rather than a morally upright, granite-jawed colossus watching over us like Jesus in a cape, this new David Corenswet-essayed take on Kal-El is one who is less a saviour from the stars than a disbelieving schoolboy who can’t quite understand how he’s getting aggravation for rescuing a cat up a tree.Zack Snyder briefly gave us a glimpse of a Superman who is not always the world’s favourite superhero in Man of Steel in 2013, but by the time we got to 2016’s execrable Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, all those intriguing undertones about divine power and human frailty had dissipated. The fact that Gunn is picking this concept up and running with it tells us that he clearly wants to bring us a Superman who inspires awe once again; though there will be no return to Christopher Reeve’s effortlessly noble, flawlessly statuesque Man of Steel. This time around, it’s less about the idea of Superman as an extra-terrestrial trying to work out how to be human, and more about Kal-El as a guy who is just as human as the rest of us – but just happens to come from outer space.Might the bad guys of Gunn’s film – Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor and Angela Spica’s Engineer – help Superman find his place in the moral architecture, by showing him why rules matter?In the comics, the Engineer is a member of the Authority – an antihero crew parachuted into DC from the WildStorm imprint in the late 1990s. This morally ambiguous squad of powerhouses believe the world is too broken for compassion, and too far gone for the sense of truth, justice and the American way espoused by the Man of Steel. Where Superman sees hope, they see a target. Where he wants to protect, they want to improve – violently, if necessary. It’s not yet clear if other members of The Authority – trenchcoated brute Midnighter or the unhinged, solar-powered demigod that is Apollo – will appear in Gunn’s Superman. But the arrival on screen of these most morally unhinged saviours might be just what our boy needs to see the light. Could such ethical tension – a fundamental clash between idealism and pragmatism – be the emotional backbone not just of this film, but of Gunn’s new DCU at large?Either way, it’s clear that DC’s big cheese is less interested in the Superman who flies above us and more the one who stumbles among us. This new Man of Steel is primed and ready to save the world … even if he’s starting to suspect that being human might just be the hardest part of the whole gig.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSupermanSuperman: The MovieJames GunnDC ComicsComics and graphic novelscommentShareReuse this content"

[Especially] now that we’ve finally found our voices … Not that it wasn’t treacherous before but now, [it is] in a way that is so literal, so strikingly essential and vital, but naturally terrifying. [Trump’s] shadow is bleak and very dark … we should expect the worst and fight for the best.”The Chronology of Water stars Imogen Poots, Thora Birch and Earl Cave, and was adapted from the 2011 memoir by Lidia Yuknavitch, who was abused by her father as a child and thenwho won a swimming scholarship to college before going off the rails.Peter Bradshaw, the Guardian’s chief film critic, gave the film a positive review, describing it as “a poetry-slam of pain and autobiographical outrage, recounting a writer’s journey towards recovering the raw material of experience to be sifted and recycled into literary success”. Bradshaw also said the film was “an earnest and heartfelt piece of work, and Stewart has guided strong, intelligent performances”.Stewart told the Hollywood Reporterthat her attraction to the story was instant, saying: “It was just a book that I read and impulsively, after 40 pages, put down and reached out to the writer. I just went: ‘We need to put this on its feet so we can do it all together.’ I just hadn’t read anything like that until then.”The Chronology of Water screened in the Un Certain Regard sidebar, for which it had been selectedalong with films directed by fellow actors Scarlett Johansson and Harris Dickinson. Stewart added: “It’s just about finding voice. I’m just uniquely primed at this stage in my life to listen to myself, so therefore I think I need to step behind the camera but not ignore the fact that what put me here was being in front of it.”Stewart also said that it she had to struggle with industry gatekeepers to get the film made.In a panel conversation reported by Varietyshe said: “There’s this bullshit fallacy that you need to have experience or sort of like technical adeptness, and it’s safeguarding the business. It’s a real male perspective ... Anyone can make a movie if they have something to say.”Stewart also expressed positivity about the current political situation. “It’s an exciting time to be alive. And it’s cool that we all get to be loud together. But at the same time, is that going to do anything? What’s gonna happen?”Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalKristen StewartDonald TrumpFilm adaptationsFestivalsShareReuse this content"

The situation has underlined some of the tensions rising out of theLabourgovernment’s drive to build more houses.Dorset council refused permission for the development in July 2024, but the landowner successfully appealed against this after an inquiry by the national planning inspectorate, which had to take Labour’s new housing requirements into account.View image in fullscreenSt Gregory’s church in Marnhull, Dorset. The church features in Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles as a location for the burial of Tess’s baby, Sorrow.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The GuardianThe strength of feeling was so forceful in Marnhull that the parish council took the unusual step of taking part in the inquiry as a “rule 6 party” – an interested group granted the right to actively participate in the inquiry process.It is striking how many times Hardy is referenced in the parish council’s submissions as evidence of the village’s important heritage status. Stephen Boyce, a Marnhull resident and heritage consultant, submitted 40 pages of argument with dozens of references to the romantic poet and novelist, known for works including Far from the Madding Crowd and Jude the Obscure.Boyce, who has held senior roles at the National LotteryHeritageFund and consulted for the National Trust, says: “The development demonstrates no awareness of the important cultural value of the site in question, in particular its associations with the work of Dorset’s most famous literary figure, Thomas Hardy. These historic connections make a notable contribution to the character, significance and quality of Marnhull’s heritage.”View image in fullscreenThe Pure Drop Inn, aka Marnhull’s Crown Inn, also appears in Tess of the d’Urbervilles.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The GuardianThe scheme would also include a commercial plot being developed – provisionally named Tess Square in a nod to the eponymous character of Hardy’s renowned novel – as well as a large car park near St Gregory’s church – where Tess’s baby, Sorrow, was buried.Boyce says: “The proposed development particularly impinges on the locations and buildings most closely associated with Tess.” He points out that in addition to the church, the Pure Drop Inn in the novel is based on Marnhull’s Crown Inn.Residents of Butts Close backing on to the field earmarked for development are devastated by the proposals.View image in fullscreenAnne and Mike Hartley. ‘If you put another 120 houses … you’re going to lose that tranquility that so many people have moved here to get,’ Anne says.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The GuardianAnne Hartley, 59, and her husband, Mike, 61, enjoy an uninterrupted view across the vale from their back garden, which will vanish if and when the development is built.Anne Hartley says: “You used to be able to walk quite easily down some of the little country roads and the lanes you’ve got here, but now you’re diving into shrubs to get out of the way of cars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He appears to criticise Dorset council for failing to put in place a policy for housing allocations across the county.Bore says: “The position is one of very high identified housing need. There is no up-to-date spatial strategy that responds to this position, no up-to-date policy that establishes the amounts of development to be apportioned to different locations in the light of this need, and no prospect that a new local plan will be adopted until 2027.”View image in fullscreenThomas Hardy’s name is repeatedly invoked in official submissions arguing against Marnhull’s expansion.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyMarnhull parish council said it was “surprised and clearly disappointed” by the planning inspectorate decision.It said in a statement: “We took the unusual step of participating in the inquiry as a rule 6 party as the village was overwhelmingly opposed to what is perceived as a disproportionately large development in a rural village with significant impact on heritage, existing local businesses and highways safety.“We summarised our case in documents submitted to the inquiry but ultimately our concerns were outweighed by Dorset council’s significant shortfall in building housing to meet the new government targets and by the lack of a current Dorset council development plan.”A spokesperson for Dorset council said it had agreed a supply of housing before the recent government changes, which is valid until the end of October under transitional arrangements. The council said the increased demands for housing under the new framework, coupled with requirements to mitigate potential pollution from new developments meant it was searching for new sites.It said: “Dorset council is preparing a new local plan, and consultation will be taking place on site options this summer, taking account of the latest housing and mitigation requirements.

His death at home in New York on Thursday was announced by his four children.Over the course of a long and illustrious career, Strouse composed music for theBroadwayshows Bye Bye Birdie, Golden Boy, Applause, Rags and Nick & Nora. But he was perhaps best known for his score for Annie which opened in New York in 1977 and ran for almost six years. The story of the plucky red-headed orphan featured evergreen songs (with lyrics by Martin Charnin) including Tomorrow, You’re Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile and It’s the Hard-Knock Life, which was sampled by Jay-Z in a 1998 single. Annie received seven Tony awards, including best musical and best original score, and won the Grammy for best cast show album. It was adapted as a film in 1982.Strouse’s other Tony award-winners were the 1960 comedy Bye Bye Birdie and 1970’s Applause (based on the film All About Eve); both shows had lyrics by his regular collaborator Lee Adams. In 1996, the pair won a Primetime Emmy for outstanding original music and lyrics for the song Let’s Settle Down from a TV film adaptation of Bye Bye Birdie, which follows a rock’n’roll singer drafted into the army. Strouse was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1985. He also worked in film, incorporating banjos into the score for Bonnie and Clyde, and television, writing the theme music for the long-running sitcom All in the Family. Pop songs (including the hit Born Too Late written with Fred Tobias), revues, opera, chamber music and a range of classical pieces were also composed by the industrious and prolific Strouse. His Concerto America was written to commemorate the September 11 terrorist attacks.Born on 7 June 1928, he grew up in New York and graduated from its Eastman School of Music in 1947. He later studied under Aaron Copland and Nadia Boulanger. In 1964 he married the dancer and choreographer Barbara Siman; they were married for almost 60 years until her death in 2023. His children, Benjamin, Nicholas, Victoria and William, survive him.Strouse reflected on his career in the 2008 memoir Put on a Happy Face, named after one of his songs for Bye Bye Birdie. “The way a fine tailor feels about his material, I feel about musical notes,” he said the following year.Explore more on these topicsTheatreMusicals (Stage)BroadwayMusicals (Film)AnnienewsShareReuse this content"

I’m somebody’s child.”During some parts of cross-examination on Thursday , Combs’s lawyers seemed to be trying to establish that around the time of the 2016 assault in the hotel, Combs had been experiencing withdrawals from opiates, which influenced his behavior, and that his violence was connected to his drug use.Ventura, who is eight and a half months pregnant, continued her testimony on Friday and said that she attended a 45-day in-patient treatment center in 2023 at the Willow House, an Arizona-based rehab program for women that “focuses on healing from intimacy and relationship issues, love and sex addiction, emotional trauma, and dual diagnosis”.She said she took part in “neurofeedback” once a week while she was there to “help me with my trauma”.“They hook your brain up to a machine and you watch something and it just kind of regulates your brain waves,” Ventura said, adding that she also did something called EMDR which “helps you recount memories”.The defense also appeared to question Ventura’s account of her alleged 2018 rape by Combs,which she testified about earlier this week. They also suggested that Ventura revised the date of the incident from September 2018 to August 2018 in her statements over the years.Ventura said she had consensual sex with Combs once more after the alleged rape, while she was dating her now husband, Alex Fine.In previous testimony, she explained: “We’d been together 10 years; you just don’t turn feelings off that way.”Combs’s lawyer asked on Friday: “Your now husband didn’t know that you were with Mr Combs at the time, correct?”Ventura told the court that Fine later learned about both her having consensual sex with Combs one time as well as the alleged rape.The defense also questioned Ventura on her current feelings towards Combs.When asked if she hated the music mogul, Ventura replied: “I don’t hate him.”“Do you still have love for him?” Combs’s attorney followed up.“I have love for the past and what it was,” Ventura replied.Before the lunch recess, Ventura testified that the last time she saw Combs was at the November 2018 memorial service for Kim Porter, the mother of three of Sean Combs’s children.In the afternoon, Ventura denied a defense suggestion that she had been experiencing financial hardship before filing her civil lawsuit against Combs in November 2023, which resulted a $20m settlement just 24 hours after it was filed.Combs’s attorney pointed out that Ventura, her husband and children moved in with her parents in Connecticut before she filed the lawsuit, and suggested that the relocation had been due to “financial issues”.Ventura refuted that assertion, stating that the move had been part of a broader plan to move to the east coast and had nothing to do with money.The defense also questioned Ventura about her decision to cancel a planned music tour after the lawsuit between her and Combs was settled.“As soon as you saw that you were going to get the $20m, you canceled the tour because you didn’t need it any more, right?” Combs’s attorney asked.“That wasn’t the reason why,” Ventura responded.The defense then presented a 2012 text message exchange between Ventura and Combs, in which Combs asked whether she wanted to have a “freak-off” … “one last time tonight”.Ventura replied no, adding that she wanted to have a freak-off for the “first time for the rest of our lives”.The defense then abruptly concluded its cross-examination. The prosecution immediately began redirect and asked Ventura to read additional messages from that conversation to provide context.“I want to see you, but I’m emotional right now,” Ventura wrote to Combs. “I don’t want to do one last time. I’d rather not do it at all.”The prosecution also attempted to address the defense’s suggestion of a link between Combs’s drug use and his violence, asking Ventura whether doing drugs ever made her violent.“I feel like drinking more so than drugs,” Ventura replied.At one point on Friday afternoon, Ventura broke down in tears as a prosecutor questioned her about Combs beating her during the freak-offs.She was then asked whether she would return the money from her settlement if it meant she never had to experience freak-offs.“I’d give that money back if I never had to have freak offs,” Ventura testified. “If I never had to have freak offs, I would have had agency and autonomy … I wouldn’t have had to work so hard to get it back.”After Ventura’s testimony concluded on Friday afternoon, her lawyer, Douglas Wigdor,issued a statementon how the week had been “extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing” for Ventura.“I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear. For me, the more I heal, the more I can remember. And the more I can remember, the more I will never forget,” Wigdor said on behalf of Ventura.Fine, Ventura’s husband, alsoreleased a statement, saying: “Over the past five days, the world has gotten to witness the strength and bravery of my wife, freeing herself of her past. There has been speculation online surrounding how it must feel for me to sit there and listen to my wife’s testimony.”He said he felt “pride” and “overwhelming love” during her testimony as well as “profound anger that she has been subjected to sitting in front of a person who tried to break her”.“To him and all of those who helped him along the way, please know this: You did not. You did not break her spirit nor her smile that lights up every room. You did not break the souls of a mother who gives the best hugs and plays the silliest games with our little girls. You did not break the woman who has made me a better man,” he said.He also noted that he did “not save Cassie”, but that “Cassie saved Cassie” and she “alone broke free from abuse, coercion, violence and threats”.Ventura testified this week over the course of four days,detailing years ofphysical abuseshe endured during her decade-long relationship with Combs.After Ventura finished her testimony, the prosecution called Yasin Binda, a special agent with the homeland security department, to the stand.Binda participated in searches related to the Combs investigation and was involved in Combs’s arrest last September at a Manhattan hotel.Binda testified that authorities seized lubricants, pills, drugs, $9,000 in cash, and “mood lighting” from Combs’s hotel room the day of the arrest. The jury were shown images from the search, including some of bags filled with baby oil and lubricant.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead moreCombs is facing charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denies all allegations.If convicted, Combs, who has been held in jail since his arrest last year, could spend the rest of his life in prison.In the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

Robinson and his wife, Frances, are also accused of labour violations, including the failure to pay the women minimum wage and overtime. The women are seeking financial damages.Robinson’s lawyer Christopher Frost said the allegations “defy credulity” and called them “vile, false … an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon – $50m, to be exact”.Now, in addition to that civil lawsuit, Robinson is facing a criminal investigation.In a statement to the press, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said it is “actively investigating criminal allegations involving William Robinson AKA ‘Smokey Robinson’. The investigation is in the early stages, and we have no further comment.”Frost responded to the opening of the investigation, saying: “We feel confident that a determination will be made that Mr Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the plaintiffs were previously able to create.”Robinson was one of the most successful artists to emerge from the Motown label, scoring hits under his own name and with his group the Miracles. He also wrote a number of pop classics including My Girl and Get Ready for the Temptations.Last month he released his latest album What the World Needs Now, and he is currently touring the US, with UK dates scheduled to follow in July at Love Supreme festival plus four nationwide venues.

Since its publication in June 1972, it has been officially attributed to Nick Ut, a Vietnamese photographer working with the Associated Press in Saigon.‘Uncomfortable truths’: controversial film challenges authorship of famous photoRead moreThe AP and Ut have long maintained that Ut, then 21 years old, took the photo, which went on to win the World Press Photo of the Year award in 1973 and established Ut as a venerable photojournalist.But a recent documentary challenged that history, instead proposing that the photo, which depicts a naked nine-year-old girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc as she flees a napalm attack in the South Vietnamese village of Trảng Bàng, was taken by a man named Nguyen Thành Nghe.The Stringer, which premiered at the Sundance film festival in January, claimed that Nghe, a stringer for NBC who was driving that day and who often sold photos to the AP on a freelance basis, was denied credit in favor of Ut because he was not AP staff.The film prompted “deep reflection” at World Press Photo, which conducted its own investigation, the results of which were made public on Friday 16 May. The in-house analysis, conducted between January and May 2025, concluded “based on analysis of location, distance, and the camera used on that day” that “photographers Nguyễn Thành Nghệ or Huỳnh Công Phúc may have been better positioned to take the photograph than Nick Út.”The suspension only applies to the photo’s authorship, and does not rescind the 1973 Photo of the Year award. “The photograph itself remains undisputed,” the group said, “and the World Press Photo award for this significant photo of a major moment in 20th century history remains a fact.”View image in fullscreenNick Ut, centerPhotograph: Gregorio Borgia/AP“Based on these findings and according to our values of accuracy, trustworthiness and diversity, we draw conclusions with regards to attribution,” Joumana El Zein Khoury, the group’s executive director, said in a press release. “It is important to state that the picture itself is undisputed and it is without question that this photograph represents a real moment in history that continues to reverberate in Vietnam, the United States, and globally.”Earlier this month, the Associated Pressannouncedthat it found “no definitive evidence” to warrant changing the photo’s authorship, and released a96-page reporton the matter – itssecond in four months– based on its own internal investigation. The AP concluded that it was “possible” Ut took the photo, and found no evidence that Nguyen took it instead. The matter was unable to be proven conclusively, it added, due to the passage of time, the absence of key evidence, the limitations of technology and the deaths of several key people involved.“We left nothing uncovered that we’re aware of and we’ve done it with a great deal of respect to everybody involved,” said Derl McCrudden, an AP vice-president of global news production, in a statement. “It makes no difference to us if we changed the credit, but it has to be based on facts and evidence. And there is no definitive evidence proving that Nick Ut did not take this picture.”The Stringer, directed by Bao Nguyen, enlisted several witnesses to argue that Nghe sold the photo to the Saigon bureau photo chief, Horst Faas, for $20 and a print, including Nghe’s brother, who claims he brought the film to the AP; Nghe’s daughter Jannie; Carl Robinson, a longtime AP photo editor in Saigon who first contacted the film-makers; and several of Robinson’s former photojournalist colleagues. The investigators also consulted forensic experts with the French NGOIndex, who found it “highly unlikely” that Ut took the photo based on the other images AP credited to him that day.The AP conducted its own forensic investigation involving further interviews, the examination of cameras and surviving negatives from that day, and a 3D model of the scene. The resulting report revealed “inconsistencies on both sides” but concluded that buying Nghe’s story would “require several leaps of faith”, such as believing that the only time he sold photos to a western news agency, it turned out to be one of the most famous images of the 20th century.Nghe, who made a surprise appearance at the Stringer’s Sundance premiere, confirms his account in the film. Ut, meanwhile, continues to maintain his authorship, and told the AP that the dispute “has been very difficult for me and has caused great pain”.But for World Press Photo, the official author is now: unknown. “This remains contested history, and it is possible that the author of the photograph will never be fully confirmed,” the group said. “The suspension of the authorship attribution stands unless it is proved otherwise.”This article was amended on 16 May 2025. An earlier version described Nguyen Thành Nghe in 1972 as a “driver for NBC”; he was a stringer for NBC and a freelance photographer who was driving Nick Ut on the day the photo of Phan Thi Kim Phuc was taken.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyVietnamArtVietnam warAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

This is by virtue of its moderate script and by the unvarying stolid pace over its hefty running time which might have suited a 12-episode streamer.Eddington is a fictional small town in New Mexico in the US, bordering Native American territory; we join the story as the Covid lockdown begins (though Trump is oddly unmentioned in all the news programmes and viral TikToks everyone’s watching) and Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) and Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix) are at loggerheads – interestingly taking opposite sides to their counterparts in Spielberg’s Jaws on the personal liberty issue.Here, the mayor insists on restrictive mask-wearing and Sheriff Cross refuses to wear his and is resentful of the mayor supporting construction plans for a giant new “online server farm” – gobbling up resources and symbolically sowing discord via the internet – and this complicates existing tensions.Watch the trailer for Eddington.The mayor once had emotional history with Cross’s wife Louise (Emma Stone) who now suffers from hysteria and depression and whose mother Dawn (Deirdre O’Connell), now uncomfortably “bubbled up” with them in the family home, is a querulous conspiracy theorist and social media addict – although the problem of how to make these particular things funny or interesting is one the film never solves.Garcia’s insufferable teen son Eric (Matt Gomez Hidaka) is dating social justice warrior Sarah (Amélie Hoeferle) who is cartoonishly convulsed with guilt at her white privilege and at having dumped Michael (Micheal Ward) because he is now a cop, working for Sheriff Cross, and a gun enthusiast – though he is a person of colour.The atmosphere of feverish resentment and wholesale offence-taking worsens with the George Floyd outrage and Louise and her mom take an interest in charismatic cult leader Vernon Jefferson Peak (Austin Butler) who has recovered memories of child abuse and encourages his followers to do the same.So Sheriff Cross fights back against everything by running for mayor himself and winds up encouraging the townsfolk to get their guns ready for the coming showdown.View image in fullscreenMano-a-mano … Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal in Eddington.Photograph: Courtesy: Cannes Film FestivalThis idea of a mano a mano political contest between these two grizzled alpha males promises some comedy – and the film does deliver one actual laugh with Mayor Garcia’s outrageously sugary TV ad, recounting his tough emotional courage raising his boy as a single dad.And there is some divertingly acid, nasty satire on the odious attitudes on show in the sheriff’s department. One cop says sagely that blacks hate Hispanics because they are “fake minorities who are taking their coupons”. And when Native American cop Butterfly Jimenez (William Belleau) intervenes in an investigation, a white cop sneeringly asks if he shouldn’t be looking into an “alcoholic domestic dispute at one of your casinos”.But it all feels secondhand – and a scene showing a fractious town meeting on zoom is weirdly like the legendary online council meeting inHandforth, Cheshire. There is no accumulation of drama or tension or intellectual revelation and the setpiece shootout is ultimately valueless. What exactly is it saying that we didn’t know already? The wait for Aster to recover his directorial form goes on.Eddington premiered at theCannes film festival.

It is adapted fromLa Petite Dernière, or The Last One, the autofictional novel by Franco-Algerian author Fatima Daas about growing up as the kid sister, the youngest of three girls, in an Algerian family in a Paris suburb with her mum, dad and siblings.Non-professional newcomer Nadia Melliti plays Fatima, a smart kid battling with asthma who likes books, likes football, likes freestyling, likes running – and likes girls. (This last interest is secret.) As Fatima prepares to leave school and start her first year at university (while living at home, of course) she cultivates a protective deadpan manner and wears a cap: the secular-western camouflage equivalent of a head covering. She has to negotiate her way out of what appears to be an unofficial engagement with a Muslim boy into which she has drifted. His feelings, and perhaps his sense of entitlement, will be hurt. So be it.Fatima downloads a dating app on her phone and covertly experiments with gay hookups: a louche, somewhat insensitive older woman, then a younger German woman with whom she feels a little more comfortable and finally Ji-Na, the Korean nurse in her asthma clinic (a very good performance from Park Ji-min), the only one with whom she can open up, and soon they have fallen in love. But Ji-Na’s own issues come to the surface, and with them a crisis for Fatima.Herzi may well have taken some influence from Abdellatif Kechiche’s Blue Is the Warmest ColourIt is performed with robustness and honesty, and there is incidentally a wittily presented, real-looking lo-fi dream sequence. Herzi manages the sexuality and intimacy with assurance, and also Fatima’s own complex sense of herself as the good daughter. It’s impossible to forget, incidentally, Herzi’s own amazing acting debut as the spirited daughter in the 2007 filmCouscousby the French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche, who to the surprise and consternation of many has now drifted into straight softcore erotica. Herzi may well have taken some influence from Kechiche’s Palme d’Or-winning filmBlue Is the Warmest Colourfrom 2013, particularly in the way a sex scene segues into a joyful street demo scene. Of course, that film was criticised for turning a straight male gaze on lesbian sexuality; Herzi can be said to have avoided that, though Kechiche’s film, for all that it is now deeply unfashionable and even discredited, had an extravagance, a passion, a bull-in-a-china-shop craziness that The Little Sister doesn’t, quite.Melliti’s performance is reserved and even a bit opaque, certainly compared to the excellent Park, who made her own debut in Davy Chou’sReturn to Seouland, indeed, seasoned actors such as Mouna Soualem, playing a raucous party animal drawn to Fatima. This opacity is partly a function of not being a professional actor, but it is also the opacity of real life, the opacity of someone who has long learned to present a calm and undemonstrative face to the world – and there is something affecting in emotion and tears in this context. And finally, Herzi shows us that these crises and confrontations are maybe never going to be entirely solved, but managed and finessed with increasing maturity. It’s an elegant directorial performance from Herzi.The Little Sister screened at theCannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalDrama filmsWorld cinemareviewsShareReuse this content"

Certainly not for Harold Fry, the Bunyanesque modern-day everyman who goes out to post a letter to his terminally ill, long-lost friend and ends up hiking 500 miles to say goodbye to her in person.Harold (Mark Addy), middle-aged and mournful, leaves his Devon home and his distant, disenchanted wife, Maureen (Jenna Russell), to go to the post office. But he is inspired by a petrol station attendant (Sharon Rose, twinkling as Garage Girl) to begin his secular pilgrimage to the Berwick-upon-Tweed hospice where Queenie (Amy Booth-Steel) lies dying.The development of this musical follows a familiar trajectory: it is an adaptation of a best-sellingnovel (by Rachel Joyce), which has already beenturned into a filmstarring national treasures (Jim Broadbent and Penelope Wilton). If sentiment laced the story in its original form, then schmaltz led the latter incarnation. The same syrupy, unabashed sentimentality roves through this show, adapted by Joyce herself.View image in fullscreenVibrant choreography … Jack Wolfe, centre, in The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry.Photograph: Manuel HarlanBut its winning twist lies in the music, composed by singer-songwriter Michael Rosenberg, otherwise known as Passenger, which blasts the story through with folksy heart and foot-stomping soul. One belter follows another from the first song, Rise Up, to the last, Here’s One for the Road.The tunes are twinned with vibrant choreography by Tom Jackson Greaves and directorKaty Rudd’s imaginative staging fuels the show’s idiosyncratic spirit. It is performed within a luminous circle on Samuel Wyer’s playfully lo-fi set, an abstract back-screen reflecting the changing landscape, with actors standing in for trees, sheep and washing lines. Some scenes break out into fantasy, garish and whirling at times, witty at others. Together, it has the makings of a quirky West End transfer, in the mould ofThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button.Jack Wolfe is compelling, first as the Balladeer and then as Harold and Maureen’s dead son. He has an uncanny resemblance to Earl Cave (his counterpart in the film) and is an almost ubiquitous presence, first benign, then agitating and angry. Russell is slowly, icily magnificent as a woman estranged from herself, while Addy’s Harold, stolid and unremarkable, comes alive slowly, as if thawing back into feeling all of life’s pain and joy that he has thus far held at bay.Harold’s unlikely Instagram stardom attracts a band of pilgrims/outcasts and they bring broadness and warmth albeit earnestness too. In fact, the stray dog – an exquisite puppet – outshines them all.The book’s discussions around faith are muted and emotions come in primary colours, while the script abounds with wholesome mottoes for life. Yet still it does not pull its punches around the messiness of grief and the anger around loss. It pulls you irrepressibly in with its rousing message that life is not for regret but for kindness, gratitude – and most of all for living.AtMinerva theatre, Chichester, until 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsChichester Festival theatreJenna RussellreviewsShareReuse this content"

Anna Lapwood, the venue’s first ever official organist, might be a slight 5ft 3in but the so-called “TikTok organist” – with more than 2m social media followers – is charismatic enough to sell out a midweek gig and have a packed hall eating out of her hand.Tonight she and her organ battle with the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus, under the baton of the ever adventurous German conductor André de Ridder. Lapwood’s obsession with film soundtracks could suggest a rather glib populism – she even apologises for starting with a Hans Zimmer theme from The Da Vinci Code (“I don’t know why it made me cry, it’s not even a very good film”) and encores with a solo arrangement of a throwaway theme from How to Train Your Dragon. But the rest of the show has heft. Saint Saëns’ third symphony, probably the most famous piece for organ and orchestra, takes up most of the second half, while a suite from Zimmer’s Interstellar soundtrack shifts the organ-heavy themes into hypnotic, Philip Glass-like territory.Better still are the two pieces specially written for tonight. A toccata by young composerKristina Arakelyanis a wonderful mix of whimsy and horror, filled with slippery harmonies, gurgling sci-fi passages and studied discordancy. Max Richter’s 33-minute Cosmology conducts a circular voyage through space – from the tentative, irregular, arpeggios of the intro, to the heart-tugging, funereal organ drones of the second movement, the glistening modulations and irregular time signatures of the third, while the final movement mixes Lapwood’s dreamy, synth-like chord washes with the female voices of the choir she leads at Pembroke College, Cambridge.What’s especially welcome is Lapwood’s efforts to talk to the audience and put the music into context. As well as being an evangelist for the pipe organ, and a champion of female musicians (her#PlayLikeAGirl T-shirtsare all over the hall), she’s also becoming one of the most effective ambassadors for classical music since Leonard Bernstein – a musically omnivorous enthusiast who knows how to communicate with a wider audience.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

It seemed a veryGustavo Dudamelway for the starry conductor to begin his first London appearance with the London Symphony Orchestra, after concerts in Spain last week.Dudamel drove the music hard and fast: it was full of firework explosions that dissolved into sparkling blurs of light. On one level it was thrilling. On another, it soon began to feel a little narrow. Dudamel let the brightest moments scythe through the texture – an ear-splitting glockenspiel, a brief but brazen trumpet solo – and yet the general orchestral sound was so thickly blended as to be almost homogenised. There was little sense of the music bubbling with detail, and a limited depth to the sound.This might not have mattered so much had the concert not been entirely of music by Strauss and Ravel, two of the 20th century’s most meticulous musical colourists. At least the opening of Ravel’s Shéhérazade showed that the orchestra could still play quietly. The soprano soloist wasMarina Rebeka. Spinning out long, fluid lines, she captured the languid quality of these songs beautifully but was less convincing in conveying the wordiness of their poetry or the sense of wanderlust that drives the first song in particular. Instrumental highlights included Gareth Davies’s flute solos in the second movement, first energised, then returning quiet and distant at the end.The orchestral palette broadened after the interval for Ravel’s Rapsodie Espagnole, with a beguiling softness to the mesmerising repeated figure in the first movement, and a sultriness in the Habanera that put the taut, shiny finale into relief. Finally there was the orchestral suite from Strauss’s opera Der Rosenkavalier, in which the central waltz was full of character but the climactic music was pushed onwards relentlessly. The whole concert was pacy and entertaining, but it left the impression that the LSO is a huge paintbox, the darkest and softest colours of which Dudamel has only just begun to explore.Explore more on these topicsLondon Symphony OrchestraClassical musicGustavo DudamelreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both offer startling insight into women’s livesHannah ClugstonFri 16 May 2025 07.52 EDTShareYou’d be hard pressed to find a more alluring opening to a show than this: a bubbling pool consisting of 800kg of molten milk chocolate oozing seductively, filling the gallery with a sweet aroma and a soft, steady gurgling. On the walls brightly coloured, circular photographs of orchids, gerberas, sweet peas and chrysanthemums repeat the circular shape of the chocolate pool.But for artist Helen Chadwick – whose Life Pleasures show at the Hepworth Wakefield is the largest retrospective of her work – pleasure is never that far from pain. It is not long before that thick, gloopy chocolate starts to smell sickly, the scent overwhelming the senses; the mechanism inside making the liquid bubble artificially. On closer inspection, the petals in the photographs are suspended in a variety of less pleasant liquids – industrial hand cleaner, window spray, washing up liquid – and the suggestive shapes of tonsils, testes and vaginas begin to emerge.View image in fullscreenSickly sweet … Cacao by Helen Chadwick.Photograph: Ray Tang/ShutterstockThis push and pull – the delightful and the disgusting – is found throughout Chadwick’s practice. In Carcass, a huge, colourful column of rotting food taken from the Hepworth cafe fizzes and disintegrates; in Loop My Loop a glossy lock of hair is intertwined with a pig’s intestines; in Piss Flowers urine is used to create beautiful, organic blooms, and in Agape a glistening pair of tonsils glow through a lightbox to gory effect. The artist uses an unusual array of materials to elicit responses in her audience. She wants us to feel not think. She taps into our subconscious, into our feelings of desire, asking us to probe why a furry table or a pile of juicy worms simultaneously attracts and repels.Chadwick’s MA degree show in 1977, In the Kitchen, bought her early acclaim and the images of women dressed as kitchen appliances still feel relevant. In the two subsequent decades, Chadwick was prolific, and despite her untimely death at 42, Life Pleasures is a celebration of a full and mature practice. The show categorises pieces under headings such as Feminism and Fetish, The Self as Subject and Landscapes of the Body to bring Chadwick’s interests to the fore. In the Kitchen and many other works in the exhibition often appear in “women artist” group shows, but Life Pleasures demonstrates the impact of Chadwick’s practice when seen as a whole and highlights her ability to take classical concepts, tip them sideways, inject humour and produce something relatable and enticing.View image in fullscreenHelen Chadwick with Piss Flowers in 1994.Photograph: Kippa MatthewsThe autobiographical projects Chadwick produced aged 30, Ego Geometria Sum: the Labours, saw her create 10 sculptures from significant moments in her childhood and then take photographs of her carrying each sculpture. In the exhibition, the sculptures are in the centre of a space with the 10 photographs on pink walls, separated by long, shiny pink curtains. The photographs – the Labours – are named after the Greek myth in which Hercules was ordered to perform 12 perilous tasks and Chadwick completes her own tasks by lifting or holding her sculptures. This demonstrates strength but her contorted body also symbolises the way in which these moments from her past have shaped her.The most impressive work is The Oval Court, originally made for Chadwick’s first major solo exhibition at the ICA in London in 1986. Across the floor is a low platform in a soft blue, covered in 12 photocopied images of her body as she folds around animals, food, fauna and an eclectic selection of objects. Five gold balls shimmer on the surface of the “ocean” of Chadwicks, and on the wall 11 columns drawn from St Peter’s Basilica are topped by Chadwick’s weeping face. The columns and the gold are regal, while Chadwick’s nude body gorging on food and wrapped up in random materials celebrates humanity enjoying earthly pleasures.View image in fullscreenExquisitely observed … Daphne by Caroline Walker.Photograph: Peter Mallett/© Caroline Walker. Courtesy the artist; Stephen Friedman Gallery, GRIMM, and Ingleby GalleryOpening at the same time is Caroline Walker’s Mothering, an exhibition that sits neatly alongside Life Pleasures, not least because mothering is almost the embodiment of pleasure and pain. But there are other satisfying links, such as Walker’s own self-portrait where – unlike Chadwick – she is not holding a childhood moment but a child who will shape her just as much. And like Chadwick, Walker is interested in the experience of women; she has spent many years painting women at work. Mothering captures her time spent observing a maternity unit at UCL hospital, London, and her own personal experiences.Nude latex suits, wearable beds and farting swamps: the transgressive art of Helen ChadwickRead moreMotherhood is exquisitely observed by Walker, who manages to document the quiet, dark shuffle of the sonography suite; the hazy, repetitiveness of night feeds; the coffee table clutter and half-consumed glasses of water that plague a new mother’s life. One of the largest pieces is Daphne, a painting of the artist’s daughter as a toddler captured through the lounge window. It is dusk and the exterior of the house has a blue hue, but inside the lounge is awash with warm, orange light and home comforts. Daphne stands silently, perhaps anticipating the return of her mother who is on the other side of the window. The two are separate for a moment – two individuals in a big world – but even unseen by Daphne, Walker is watching over her. Neither are ever truly alone.In footage of Chadwick’s degree performance of Domestic Sanitation, the viewers are predominantly men. On today’s press trip it is entirely women, which hints at the success of work by artists such as Chadwick and Walker: if you allow women to be seen, if you focus on their desires, you make space for them to exist in the public consciousness.Helen Chadwick: Life Pleasures and Caroline Walker: Mothering are atThe Hepworth, Wakefieldfrom 17 May until 27 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArtSculptureInstallationVideo artPhotographyPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It soon becomes clear that the death is that of Alan Duffrey who, wrongly convicted of possessing child pornography, was murdered in prison. Slips of paper with names in the corpses’ hands suggest that each one represents a member of the jury responsible for Duffrey’s incarceration. Meanwhile, women’s rights campaigner Kate McKay finds herself targeted by religious extremists while on a speaking tour, and calls on Holly’s services as a bodyguard. Intelligent, courageous and modest to a fault, Holly is one of the most appealing investigators in contemporary crime fiction. Despite some longueurs, Never Flinch contains plenty of King’s trademark chilling moments, with the two storylines expertly entwined.View image in fullscreenThe Sunshine Manby Emma Stonex (Picador, £18.99)Stonex’s second novel is an ambitious revenge thriller that takes the reader on a journey from London to Devon, both geographically, and via flashbacks to the early years of the two main characters, who share the narration. Jimmy Maguire, scion of the local “bad family”, was 19 when he killed 15-year-old Providence. When he is released from prison in 1989, her older sister Birdie tracks him, illicitly purchased gun at the ready. Although the mystifyingly redacted swearwords are an irritant, and seasoned crime readers will realise early on that one aspect of Jimmy’s past is not what it seems, what makes this thought-provoking book well worth the read is the delicate and perceptive chronicling of how good intentions, childhood misunderstandings, throwaway comments and split-second decisions can pave the way for disaster.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PRHeartwoodby Amity Gaige (Fleet, £20)Gaige’s fifth novel is a wilderness thriller set in Maine, where State Game Warden Lt Beverly Miller is managing the search for 42-year-old Valerie Gillis who, three months into the Appalachian Trail hike of a lifetime, has failed to make a scheduled meeting with her husband. As Valerie’s supplies dwindle and she battles against nature and the elements, she composes letters to her mother; meanwhile the clock ticks and Miller becomes increasingly anxious for the missing woman’s safety. A third narrative strand focuses on 76-year-old Lena, who lives in a retirement community and believes – thanks to some interactions on Reddit – that Valerie has stumbled upon a secret military training facility. Readers may feel that the central mystery lacks focus, but Gaige is at her considerable best when exploring the impact of Valerie’s disappearance on others and the range of emotions it prompts among those who are metaphorically, rather than literally, lost.View image in fullscreenThe Mourning Necklaceby Kate Foster (Mantle, £16.99)Set in the 1800s and based on the true story of “Half-hangit Maggie”, Foster’s third novel is the fascinating account of a woman who was given a new lease of life by being put to death. Although she has been found guilty of killing her newborn baby, the words “until you are dead” were not used in official judgments at the time, so the sentence, which has left Maggie Dickson with the titular mark about her neck, is deemed to have been carried out, and she is duly freed. Maggie’s life as the daughter of Scottish fishers is so vividly evoked one can almost smell it. When handsome Patrick Spencer comes along, Maggie sees a way to escape the unending round of gutting, cleaning lines and fixing bait, but her naivety proves her undoing. Her philandering new husband disappears, and she strikes out for London, only to find herself stranded, penniless and pregnant. An utterly compelling tale of a resourceful woman whose hard life is made even more so by institutional misogyny, gender-based violence and medical ignorance.View image in fullscreenThe Search for Othella Savageby Foday Mannah (Quercus, £16.99)Present-day Edinburgh and Sierra Leone are the settings for Mannah’s debut novel, which won the 2022 Mo Siewcharran Prize. Hawa Barrie lives on the fringes of a Sierra Leonean expat community that revolves around the Lion Mountain Church, headed by a charismatic pastor. Ronald Ranka presents himself as “a true man of divine discernment who goes above and beyond to help Africans in this White people’s country”, but he also surrounds himself with attractive young women whose role as church “ambassadors” involves them in morally dubious ways of raising funds. When one of them is found barely alive, having been locked in a car boot for five days, and her old friend Othella disappears shortly thereafter, Hawa becomes suspicious. This sharp, evocative novel tackles morally thorny questions about ends justifying means, religious and political corruption, luxury beliefs, and the pressure on those living abroad to deliver for family and community back home.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The seven best films to watch on TV this weekA delightful animation about a shipwrecked robot, plus an extraordinary documentary about a revolt at the only US college for deaf students … after they tried to put a hearing person in chargeSimon WardellFri 16 May 2025 04.00 EDTSharePick of the weekThe Wild RobotChris Sanders’s delightfulfamily animationattains Wall-E levels of poignancy in its tale of a shipwrecked robot that learns how to feel. Washed up on a remote island populated only by animals, service unit Roz (voiced by Lupita Nyong’o) finds it has no one to serve. That is until it falls on to a goose’s nest, killing all its occupants apart from runt of the litter Brightbill (Kit Connor) – who imprints on Roz as his mother. Assisted by Pedro Pascal’s cynical fox Fink, the ever helpful machine reprogrammes itself to rear the gosling well enough so he can migrate with the other geese. The Disney-style anthropomorphising is a bit overdone, but it’s a film full of warmth and wit.Friday 23 May, 9.10am, 6.10pm, Sky Cinema PremiereDeaf President Now!View image in fullscreenRevelatory … Deaf President Now!Photograph: Apple TV+.Set during one week in 1988, Davis Guggenheim and Nyle DiMarco’srevelatory documentaryfollows an era-defining protest at Gallaudet University in Washington DC – at the time the only deaf higher education institution in the world. When the students discovered a hearing person had been chosen as their new president over deaf candidates, they locked down the campus until the decision was changed. The activists interviewed impress with their zeal for self-determination in a film cleverly designed so that hearing audiences are immersed in a deaf world.Out now, Apple TV+Wuthering HeightsView image in fullscreenAlmost an anti-costume drama … James Howson in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Artificial Eye/Sportsphoto/AllstarAndrea Arnold brings earthy conviction to her2011 adaptationof Emily Brontë’s smouldering classic. This is the first version that makes overt the latent suggestion that Heathcliff is African Caribbean, emphasising the transgressive (for the times) nature of his love for Catherine. It’s a heavy, passionate, at times brutal rendering of the wild moorland romance – almost an anti-costume drama. Shannon Beer and Kaya Scodelario are convincing as the young and grownup Cathy, while Solomon Glave and James Howson share the crucial role of the tempestuous Heathcliff.Sunday 18 May, 12.55am, Film4Malcolm XView image in fullscreenPlenty to excite interest … Denzel Washington in Malcolm X.Photograph: Album/AlamyAs ever when that wrecking ball of creative energy, Spike Lee, goes historical, the present-day resonances are clear and central. Hisbiopicof political activist Malcolm X (a charismatic Denzel Washington) starts with footage of the beating of Rodney King and ends with a cameo from Nelson Mandela, but there’s plenty in the personal experience of the robber turned Black nationalist leader to excite interest and anger. A story of idealism nurtured then thwarted, whether you agree with Malcolm’s views or not it’s a fitting tribute to a major figure in US history.Monday 19 May, 11pm, BBC Twoskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Singer Roger Daltrey plays Tommy, a boy who loses his sight, hearing and speech after witnessing his mother’s adultery. But the traumatised kid shows a talent for pinball that inspires a messianic movement. The film has dated badly in places, but for sheer chutzpah and verve there’s little that compares to it – from Tina Turner’s devilish Acid Queen to Elton John and his sky-high boots as the Pinball Wizard.Wednesday 21 May, 7.55am, Sky Cinema GreatsRepo ManView image in fullscreenEdgy … Emilio Estevez in Repo Man.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyAfter getting sacked from his supermarket job, young LA punk Otto (Emilio Estevez) finds himself working with Harry Dean Stanton’s repo man – a low-rent operator who repossesses cars from those in debt.

Devon (Meghann Fahy) is struggling to keep her head above water, barely holding down a job while looking after a father with dementia. She could do with some help from her sister Simone (Milly Alcock) who has fallen under the spell of Julianne Moore’s peculiar socialite Michaela (“I get to call her Kiki, which is a really special honour”). Devon pays an uninvited visit to her sibling and what she finds looks more like a cult than a place of work. Can she save Simone – and does she even want to be saved? Not every element of Sirens quite gels but it’s creepy and nicely unpredictable.Netflix, from Thursday 22 MayNine Perfect StrangersView image in fullscreenThink White Lotus without the laughs … Nicole Kidman as Masha Dmitrichenko in Nine Perfect Strangers.In what feels like a very modern basis for a drama, there’s no setback that can’t be overcome if you’re shameless enough. Afterseason one’s chaos, Nicole Kidman’s weird wellness guru Masha has simply moved continents and started again. She’s now in the Austrian Alps and another nine individuals (Mark Strong, Murray Bartlett, Henry Golding and Christine Baranski are among the new cast members) have been invited into her new lair. Can she “cleanse their brains”? Or will she push them over the edge? Think The White Lotus without the laughs and you’re somewhere near.Prime Video, from Thursday 22 MayWelcome to WrexhamView image in fullscreenSheer entertainment value! … Welcome to Wrexham.Photograph: FX NetworksTheHollywood-powered riseof Wrexham FC, which was celebrated as a triumph against the odds, is becoming less romantic. As season four begins, the team are in English football’s third tier. Is another promotion possible? Supporters already know the answer but it’s still an enjoyable journey, and it’s easier for neutrals to root for the side now they’re rubbing shoulders with the bigger boys rather than financially overpowering small teams. Even if it doesn’t gladden the hearts of purists, it would be churlish to decry the entertainment value.Disney+, out nowTucci in ItalyView image in fullscreenFoodie heaven … Stanley Tucci at a BBQ joint with journalist Cristina Bachetti and one of the owners, Rodolfo Mucciante.Photograph: Matt Holyoak/National Geographic“The best way to understand a country is through its food,” says Stanley Tucci. On the basis of this sustained barrage of food porn, Italy looks heavenly. Of course, there’s pizza and a million different varieties of pasta. But there’s also cheese, wine, seafood and barbecues and, as Tucci ventures off thebeaten track, he starts to appreciate the tiny regional variations that give the food its character. This sometimes feels less like a documentary series and more like a communique from the Italian tourist board but, even so, it’s mightily effective.Disney+, from Monday 19 MayShe the PeopleView image in fullscreenA knockabout comedy … Terri J Vaughn as Antoinette Dunkerson in She the People.Photograph: Charles Bergmann/NetflixIt’s debatable whether people nowadays are in the mood for a knockabout comedy set in the world of US politics but here is one all the same. The series is the handiwork ofTyler Perry– a creator not best known for his subtlety – and follows Antoinette Dunkerson (Terri J Vaughan), a Black woman who is elected lieutenant governor of Mississippi. In the current climate this stretches credibility – but the main thrust of the narrative sadly does not. As she navigates a broken system, Dunkerson is belittled, patronised and undermined at every turn.Netflix, from Thursday 22 MayClarkson’s FarmView image in fullscreenPerfectly calibrated … Kaleb, Jeremy and Lisa in Clarkson’s Farm.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien/Prime VideoIs Diddly Squat farm becoming a victim of its own success – or, at least, the success of one of its most famous figures? Breakout star Kaleb Cooper is off on tour and Jeremy Clarkson is left in the lurch. His reaction to this extra stress is to add some more to the load: he’s decided to buy a pub. How much resemblance any aspect of this show bears to the actual experience of running a farm remains to be seen but it is a perfectly calibrated delivery mechanism for the personality of its central figure – who recently hinted that this might be the last series.Prime Video, from Friday 23 MayExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This nutty citrus cake ticks all of those boxes; it’s also baked in one tin and then cut into strips for layering. I use shop-bought lemon curd to save on time and, instead of making a ganache, I simply fold finely chopped white chocolate into whipped cream.Lemon, pistachio and white chocolate cakePrep10 minCook1 hrServes8-10For the cake100g softened unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing75g pistachios, plus extra, chopped, to finish150gcaster sugar2 tbsp neutral oilFinely grated zest of1 lemon2 large eggs100g plain flour1 tsp baking powder30g ground almonds¼ tsp saltFor the lemon syrup60ml fresh lemon juice60g caster sugarFor the filling100g white chocolate400ml double cream½ tsp vanilla bean paste4 tbsp lemon curdHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and grease and line a 30cm x 20cm swiss roll tin.Grind the pistachios in a food processor until fine. Cream the butter, sugar, oil and lemon zest until pale and creamy, then add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.In a separate bowl, mix the flour, ground pistachios, baking powder, almonds and salt, add this to the butter mix in two batches, and mix in gently. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 20-25 minutes, until nicely browned and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Meanwhile, make a syrup. Put the lemon juice and sugar in a small pan, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for a minute. Take off the heat and leave to coolPrick the surface of the baked cake with a skewer and spoon over the cooled syrup.To make the filling, finely chop the white chocolate. Lightly whip the double cream and vanilla in a bowl to very soft peaks. Take out about a third of the cream and put it in a separate bowl – this will be used for the cake topping. Fold the chopped white chocolate into the remaining cream.To assemble, trim the edges of the cake and cut it widthways into three. Put one strip of cake on a serving platter and spoon or pipe on half the white chocolate cream. Add dollops of lemon curd, then top with the second strip of cake and repeat the toppings. Lay the last layer of cake upside down on top and finish with the reserved cream. Cover with a generous sprinkle of chopped pistachios, then slice and serve.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodDessertFruitBakingNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"
