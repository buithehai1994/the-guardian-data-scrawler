We’ve reached the point where Nigel Farage has taken to arranging press conferences for himself in various locations around the country on an almost daily basis. On Monday he was in Port Talbot telling the Welsh toget back down the mines, today he was in Westminster to reveal the identity of Reform’s new party chair after Zia Yusuf’sabrupt resignationlast week. Who knows where he will be tomorrow?The press conference is Nige’s happy place. The ideal way to indulge his narcissism. A room full of people all there to listen to him. And him alone. Others are only admitted into his world on sufferance. They must know their place in life. That they owe their chance of glory only as a satellite of his own ego. He only knows he’s truly alive if there are cameras there to record his existence. To get to sleep at night, he watches his greatest hits on TikTok, all the while murmuring to himself, ‘You’re the best, Nige. You’re the best.’Moments before Nige made his appearance, the supporting cast took their seats. First Richard Tice. The loyal Dicky who has made being a bridesmaid to Nigel his life’s work. Every humiliation heaped upon him – sudden demotion to deputy leader – accepted with a permatanned grin. Not even a hint of annoyance. Ask not what Nige can do for you. Ask what you can do for Nige.Then Sarah Pochin. Reform’s very own Nurse Ratched. Never knowingly caught with a smile. She had transgressed by suggesting a burqa ban at last week’s PMQs. Her punishment was to be a sharp put-down from Nige himself. Reform had had some defections from the Tories, he would say. And all of them had been failures. Time for Nurse Ratched to perform electric shock therapy on himself.Lee Anderson just looked fed-up and bored. Another Nige presser for which he was obliged to be part of the furniture. James McMurdock was just bewildered. Out of his depth. As usual. Hard to believe, but this hapless quartet are likely to have key cabinet posts if Reform wins the next election. Dicky as chancellor? 30p Lee as foreign secretary? Prepare to leave the country.Last in were Yusuf and David Bull. Dave is the only man to have spent longer on the sunbed than Dicky. Perhaps they have a timeshare. He is also the next Reform party chair.Dave likes to think he is the great communicator: a TV presenter of note. The reality is much sadder than that. Having peaked as a presenter of Most Haunted, his career has steadily faded into obscurity. Last seen – allegedly – he was presenting his own show on TalkTV to an audience measured in single figures. But Dave’s biggest asset is his loyalty. His head is so far up Nige’s bum that it occasionally peeks out of his mouth. He will never say a word that hasn’t been pre-authorised. He knows his place.Lights, cameras, actions. Nige appeared centre stage, basking in the attention. Cracking jokes. Laughing along with himself. The ship had been righted and he was still very much the captain. Principally, he was keen to establish the official version of events. What followed was pure passive-aggression. Lighthearted barbs intended to humiliate.The reality was that Zia had dared to consider himself Nige’s equal. Had been the one tasked with professionalising the party. Had got sick and tired of the constant racism from members of his own party. Including from Nurse Ratched. Had been ground down and decided he had better things to do with his life than to feed Farage’s solipsism. But this was no time for reality. So we got the Waltons treatment. Pure saccharine. It had all been a misunderstanding. Just one of those things, Zia had got a bit emotional. No big deal. Reform was one big happy family.To prove the point, Zia was dragged on stage. Exhibit A. To officially recant and swear his undying allegiance to Nige, the One True God. He had made the biggest mistake of his life, he said. Sad face. He didn’t know what had come over him.Zia would never question Nige again. He would devote the rest of his life to reading the collected sayings of Nigel and to doing good works. All he could do was say sorry for the trouble he had caused. He looked forward to much more racist abuse. His new work would be the greatest challenge anyone had known since the second world war.Up bounced Diddy Dave to announce himself to the world again. He had been lying around in the store cupboard waiting to be of use to Nige again and when the summons had come he had answered the call. Thrilled to be a relevant irrelevance again. The rest of his speech was an outpouring of inconsequentiality. No one does inconsequentiality better. He is a man of no importance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is the only party leader to actively invite scrutiny. Primarily because he doesn’t really give a shit. He is on a roll. The polls are going his way and it’s not inconceivable Reform could win the next election. What he would do if he became prime minister is another matter. Panic probably.His method for dealing with his party is to treat them all as children. Listen to him speak and you’d imagine he was a bleeding-heart liberal. Certainly compared to his MPs. Take the death penalty. Personally he wasn’t in favour – too many miscarriages of justice – but he wasn’t going to stop his kids from having their say. If they wanted to kill innocent people, then who was he to disagree? Same with the racists in his party. He didn’t have a problem with immigrants, but if some of his MPs wanted to drown them, then he could go along with that.Nige was rather more hazy on anything that resembled policy. He couldn’t explain how he was going to reopen the mines and the steel furnaces. He couldn’t say how he was going to deport 1.2 million immigrants and separate 200,000 children from their parents.But these were unimportant details. Reform isn’t a party of action. It’s a party of grievance. A vibes party for those who think the country is screwed. And for Nige, the vibes are looking good. Dicky rose to his feet to applaud. Zia did likewise. He’s learning fast.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageThe politics sketchReform UKWalescommentShareReuse this content"

Then it goes further – and tracks down the soldiers who tortured for the Assad regimeJack SealeTue 10 Jun 2025 17.15 EDTShareThe response tothe fall of Bashar al-Assadin December 2024 is an indication of what a wretched age we are living through. What happened during Syria’s civil war ought to have been globally infamous, the sort of dark blip that makes humanity reflect on the terrible things it can do – but with so much destruction, oppression and injustice elsewhere, there is a reckoning still to come. Sara Obeidat’s chilling, profoundly thoughtful documentary takes a significant step towards comprehending the horror and trying to account for it.As the Arab spring protests spread intoSyriain 2011, Shadi Haroun and his brother Hadi organised rallies that they dreamed would topple Assad. When a march ended in a mass shooting by the authorities and arrests of the survivors, Shadi spent time in jail. After his release a few months later, his family begged him not to continue with his activism because they knew the likely consequences. But Shadi had seen first-hand how violent and corrupt the Syrian state had become. It had to be fought, so he and Hadi stepped up their efforts. They were rewarded with almost a decade in an abjectly cruel carceral system.View image in fullscreenSednaya prison, AKA ‘the Human Slaughterhouse’.Photograph: BBCObeidat takes the Haroun brothers back to Harasta, a building on the outskirts of Damascus run by the feared air force intelligence. They point to the high window ledges where inmates would try to find space to sleep, because 400 of them had been put in a room measuring 10 metres by eight. They show us the ceiling pipes in a narrow corridor to which prisoners would be cuffed for 72 hours without food, before “interrogations” that were no more than sadistic beatings.Having survived Harasta, the brothers were transferred somewhere worse: Sednaya, a prison known as “the Human Slaughterhouse”, where Amnesty International estimates up to 13,000 people were executed in one four-year period. Confessions extracted using torture would lead to death sentences handed down by a sham military “field court”. But many prisoners did not make it that far: “heart and respiratory failure” was routinely recorded as the official cause of death for those who did not survive the physical abuse. Obeidat has obtained photographs of some of their bodies, bruised beyond recognition. It wasn’t their hearts that failed them.Shadi and Hadi’s testimony is consistently shocking and unforgettably moving. Hadi recounts how hearing Shadi screaming was worse for him than being tortured himself, so when he heard him cry out, he would start screaming so he could take his brother’s place. He describes how, as the prisoners’ sense of time and place melted away, his elaborate fantasies in which he pretended bulgur wheat rations were delicious fried chicken kept a packed cell of men sane for a few more precious days.View image in fullscreenThe film empathises with the perpetrators without forgiving them … Sgt Omar, a former Syrian air force intelligence officer.Photograph: BBCThe film does not stop at documenting what the victims of Assad went through. It asks who did it to them. And how could they do it? To that end, Obeidat tracked down several regime soldiers who worked at the prisons. They talk about being brainwashed at school and during national service, and about being stripped and beaten during their initiation into the Assad regime, as a warning of what would happen to them if they disobeyed. They assigned numbers to inmates to make it harder for families to track what had become of them. They organised the digging of mass graves. One officer talks about how the prisoners “were all one mass … they were all the same”. Another says whatever guilt he felt was overridden by the knowledge that showing any mercy would mean “you sentence yourself to death”.This is a valuable examination of how totalitarianism sustains itself; how oppressors who fearfully feel they have no other option can be as dangerous as those who take the role of oppressor gladly. Not that they should be excused. As Hadi calmly observes, the option to defect or flee was there, as risky as it might have been. The film strikes a difficult balance, empathising with the perpetrators without forgiving them.As it’s described here, the depravity Syria sunk into might be far beyond human forgiveness. Hussam, a former prison officer at Sednaya who says he hasn’t looked in a mirror for three years because he cannot bear to see himself, recalls a tradition he and his colleagues upheld every Wednesday morning: “execution parties”. At one such event, one of the prisoners who was hanged by the neck didn’t die, so Hussam was ordered to step forward and finish the job by grabbing his legs and pulling. This put him close enough to hear the man’s last words. “Before he died he said one thing: ‘I’m going to tell God what you did.’”Surviving Syria’s Prisons aired on BBC Two and ison iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaPrisonsTortureBashar al-AssadreviewsShareReuse this content"

Britain has a free speech problemArwa MahdawiDespite the ongoing crackdown on protesters in Los Angeles, the US constitution (for now) provides far more freedom of speech than there is in the UKTue 10 Jun 2025 13.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 16.21 EDTShareHello from the US where, if you’re a fan of things such as civil liberties and not getting shot in the leg by masked thugs sporting law enforcement badges, the situation is somewhat suboptimal.Over in Los Angeles, national guard troops have been brought in to rough up protesters who are demonstrating against immigration raids. There were at least 27 attacks on journalists by law enforcement recorded at the protests between 6 and 8 June, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF).One of the most alarming things about the crackdown against protesters in LA is the memo greenlighting it. It acts pre-emptively, a first in the US, authorising the military to be deployed in locations where protests are “likely to occur”. Scarier still, Donald Trump has said hewon’t rule outinvoking theInsurrection Act: an 1807 law that empowers the president to deploy the military inside the US and use it against Americans. All this, of course, comes amid a wider crackdown on campus protests and free speech (particularly pro-Palestine speech).As a British-Palestinian in the US – one with a green card that I’m in the process of trying to renew – I’ve been spending a lot of time lately wondering whether I ought to self-deport before the thought police come for me. I have, after all, engaged in naughty behaviour such as publicly stating that genocide is bad, actually.But fleeing to the UK from the US because I value free speech and the right to protest doesn’t make much sense. The US may be turning into a police state, but its constitution (for now) provides far more freedom of speech than there is in the UK. I hate to say this – like, I really, really hate to say this – but JD Vance had a point when he told Keir Starmer that Britain has a free speech problem during an Oval Office meetingin February. Vance made a similar accusation during the Munich Security Conference,accusing Europe’s leadersof (among other things) censorship.Vance is obviously a raging hypocrite who mainly seems obsessed with the right of religious extremists to harass women having abortions, but he is not wrong about Britain’s free speech problem. Vague and outdated laws mean the police in Britain have far too much power to arrest people for offensive internet speech. Perthe Economist, “British police arrest more than 30 people a day for online posts, double the rate in 2017.”‘It was so wrong’: why were so many people imprisoned over one protest in Bristol?Read moreThe right to protest is also under attack in Britain. Look at the crime and policing bill, which looks likely to come into lawlater this yearand is one of a number of sweeping anti-protest laws recently passed. “Thanks to this authoritarian legislation, police can define almost any demonstration as ‘seriously disruptive’ and impose restrictions on it,”Amnesty International UKwarned in March. “Peaceful tactics … have been criminalised. New powers have been created to issue orders banning people from even attending protests.”And look at the case ofWilliam Plastow, who is accused of taking part in a Palestine Action protest against an Elbit Systems (an Israeli arms manufacturer) factory near Bristol last year. Plastow faces 21 months in jailbeforehis case goes to trial. His mother recently told the Guardian she believes it is the longest anyone will have been held in jail awaiting trial on protest-related charges. There’s also the case of Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, who was charged with aterrorism offencefor allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a gig in London. Kneecap have described this as “political policing” that is intended to stifle criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza.Whilethe Economisthas acknowledged that Vance is right about the precarity of free speech in Britain and Europe, many liberal voices seem reluctant to acknowledge it. The alarmed takes I’ve seen about the US this week from European writers have been valid, but there also needs to be urgent consideration of threats to civil liberties closer to home.Anyway, having to acknowledge that I agree with Vance on anything has been a major shock to my system. Time to self-deport to the sofa to recover.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFreedom of speechOpinionLos AngelesPoliceGazaPalestinian territoriescommentShareReuse this content"

Would you help him bring The Jungle Book to life?Brian LoganTue 10 Jun 2025 11.39 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 12.33 EDTShareComedy smash-hits come in all shapes and sizes. You’ve got your standup, your sketch – and then there are those shows in which semi-naked Australians impersonate penguins to dramatise the western literary canon. Such isGarry Starr: Classic Penguinsby 43-year-old goofball Damien Warren-Smith, which delighted Edinburgh last summer, then hoovered up awards on the Australian festival circuit. After winning the prestigious Best Show gong atMelbourne’s Comedy festival(“for me that’s a Commonwealth gold,” says Warren-Smith, “and Edinburgh’s the Olympics”), this unlike-anything-else comedy set is now returning to the UK, picked up byfringe super-producer Francesca (Fleabag) Moodyand expanded for bigger audiences.The show, which animates a bookshelf full of Penguin classics in 60 minutes, is not a complete departure for its host. Yet another graduate of celebrated French clown schoolEcole Philippe Gaulier, Warren-Smith’s first stunt was to showcase every theatre style in under an hour (Garry Starr Performs Everything, 2018), and his second was to bring all of Greek mythology to life in the same timeframe. It’s a simple formula, as he admits: “Choose a highbrow topic that most people know quite a lot about, then just get it wrong – which makes me stupider than everybody else.” Garry, according to his creator, isn’t a character, he’s just “the most enthusiastic but slightly less intelligent version of myself. He’s like me if I had no inhibitions.”In Classic Penguins, that “eternal optimist and over-reacher” turns his attention towards great books. Clad in tailcoat, flippers and alarmingly little else, our lanky host performs one inexplicable stunt onstage after another – then explains them by revealing the title of the next book off his paperback pile.View image in fullscreen‘Edinburgh’s the Olympics’ … Damien Warren-Smith AKA Garry Starr.Photograph: PA Images/Alamy“I was in a Perth bookshop two years ago,” he says, “and happened to notice those beautiful, aesthetically appealing orange and cream spines on the shelf, and the penny dropped. I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s got to be [my next show].’ I called my producer straight away. I then put together a list of over 100 books, and went through it giving them the Garry treatment. What is the one thing I know about this book already? Frankenstein builds a monster, say. And what could Garry get wrong about it?” Watching the show, the pleasure is intense as you puzzle out Garry’s doofus misinterpretation, what bizarre visual gag or literary pun is now unfolding in front of you.But what flips the show from bookish brain-tease into raise-the-roof party-comedy is the involvement of its audience. “I never made a conscious decision to push things as far as I could [with audience participation],” says Warren-Smith, on Zoom from Oz. “But being on my own, I wanted to playwithpeople.” Being on his own wasn’t always the plan: Warren-Smith has variously worked as an actor, and as part of the clown troupe A Plague of Idiots. His solo career began, reluctantly, when they disbanded. “So now, if I had an idea for a scene that needed two people – well, I couldn’t pay someone to be a plant. So I’d just ask audience members to help.” In Classic Penguins, spectators are duly invited to be shot, tied to the floor, to manhandle our naked host, and join him in bringing Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book to very improbable life.That latter scene is one of Warren-Smith’s favourites, for reasons I can’t reveal without spoilers. Another is his Wind in the Willows skit, the “puerile” (his word) content of which you can probably guess. “There’s about 30% of the audience who just can’t control themselves after that.” What concerns its creator, now the show (and his career) is scaling up, is whether he can keep his percentages that high. “When I saw Ricky Gervais in a stadium, it was completely un-thrilling. If the only way to make money is live, and you have to get bigger to do it – or stay smaller and charge more – that doesn’t interest me. I’d rather continue to make work my way and not be famous or wealthy.”I suspect there might be a middle way, for an act – and a show – whose potency certainly won’t be limited to small rooms. That would be good news for Warren-Smith, because “for 45 minutes after every show as Garry, I am just buzzing. Every single show, I have to pinch myself, because when I was an actor I never found that kind of freedom and pleasure.”But if all else fails, Classic Penguins may have opened up other professional avenues. “On the last night in Edinburgh, this woman came up to me and said, ‘Have you read all these books? Do you read a lot? Would you be interested in being a judge for the Booker prize?’ I was like, ‘Aah, yeah, sure. Drop me an email!’ Thinking this was maybe a crazy person.” He’s since been told it was legit. “And had I not dismissed it quite so much,” he says, just a little wistfully, “maybe I could be a Booker judge by now …”Classic Penguins is atSoho theatre, London, from 14-26 July, then atUnderbelly George Square, Edinburgh, from 30 July to 24 AugustExplore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festivalFestivalsEdinburgh festival 2025PenguinPublishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was 31 years since he had released an album of new material, Ain’t But the One Way, which he had abandoned midway through, vanishing completely from the studio and leaving the producer Stewart Levine to patch together what he could. It was longer still since he had produced any music that was even vaguely close to the standard he had set himself in the late 60s and early 70s – a six-year period bookended by the release of the groundbreaking single Dance to the Music in 1967 and his last truly classic album, Fresh, in 1973 – when he could justifiably have claimed to have changed the face of soul music. Sly and the Family Stone, the multiracial band he had formed in 1966, released a string of classic singles in that time: not just Dance to the Music, but also I Want to Take You Higher, Everyday People, Stand!, Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), Family Affair, If You Want Me to Stay.By contrast, his most recent release, 2011’s I’m Back! Family and Friends, was a desultory collection of rerecordings of old hits, terrible remixes (a dubstep version of Family Affair!) and three new songs. Occasionally, something flickered in the original tracks, a faint trace of his former greatness, but they sounded suspiciously like unfinished demos. It felt of a piece with the handful of gigs he had played with various former members of the Family Stone a few years before: nights where something would spark fleetingly, mixed with disasters such as their 2010 appearance at Coachella, where Stone stopped and started songs at random and launched into a rant about his former manager thatsubsequently occasioned a lawsuit.But, in 2013, a lavish retrospective box set, Higher!, was due out. It told Stone’s story from his early days, when he was a staff producer at Autumn Records in San Francisco, occasionally knocking out a novelty dance track or two under his own name, to 1976’s Family Again, a single that attempted to recreate the astonishing sound of the Family Stone in full flight. But there was no question of him promoting it: his interactions with the media seemed largely restricted to appearances on the gossip website TMZ, whose reporters would doorstep him – at the mobile home where he apparently lived full-time – after a cocaine possession charge, or a lurid report that he was homeless.View image in fullscreenThe US’s first major multiracial band …(from left)Greg Errico, Rose Stone, Sly Stone, Cynthia Robinson, Freddie Stone, Jerry Martini and Larry Graham of Sly and the Family Stone circa 1968.Photograph: SBMG Archive/Sony MusicInstead, I spoke to former members of the Family Stone, whohad incredible tales to tellof the glory days, when the band single-handedly shifted the compass of black American music. They melded psychedelia with rhythm and blues and gospel, helping to usher in one of soul music’s most fertile periods. Artists previously beholden to the wishes of their record labels – Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder among them – felt empowered to strike out on their own artistic paths; it prompted Miles Davis to change tack and record the epochal fusion album Bitches Brew.They also had stories of the consternation caused by the very existence of the US’s first major multiracial band – or, as the trumpeter and vocalist Cynthia Robinson put it, by “seeing different races having fun together on stage”. Just the sight of her walking down the street with the band’s long-haired white saxophonist, Jerry Martini, enraged onlookers, she said: “We had to run! We hadn’t even said anything to them!”I had read Joel Selvin’s eye-popping 1998 oral history of the band, filled with lurid detail and the testimony of former members bitterly airing grievances about their fall from grace. Racked by drug problems and intraband discord, the band’s career had slumped to such an extent that, by 1975, their final show at New York’s 6,000-seat Radio City Music Hall attracted barely 1,000 people. But clearly something had changed: the striking thing about the interviews I did was the awe and reverence in which they now held their former leader. “He affected my life second only to God,” said Martini, who in Selvin’s book had been the most critical of the lot. “Why don’t people try to love him for what he did? He had so much to offer the music business and the world in general. Why is everybody concentrated on drugs or this or that?”View image in fullscreenThe end of an era … Sly and the Family Stone on stage in May 1973.Photograph: Sony BMG/Getty ImagesIt was already shaping up to be a fascinating feature when I got word that Stone wanted to talk to me. I didn’t really believe it and it didn’t seem as if it was going to happen: the negotiations to bring him to the phone went on for weeks and I had a holiday booked. With nothing seemingly happening, I packed my bags and departed for a family-friendly hotel in Cornwall with my wife and kids.We were there when I got a message: call this number; Sly will talk to you tonight. Incredibly, the only place in the hotel where I could get a signal was in the playground, perched on the edge of a bouncy castle. But that didn’t really matter, because, when I rang the number, I got an answering machine: “You called. Or did you? We’ll call back.” There was no option to actually leave a message. I kept trying. Nothing.Finally, 12 hours after the appointed time, he picked up. I explained who I was and why I was calling and he told me, in no uncertain terms, to go and fuck myself: “I don’t give a fuck what you heard, I ain’t telling you anything. You guys send me some money, fair’s fair, I work. I don’t give a fuck about anything.” Then he put the phone down.View image in fullscreen‘He had so much to offer the music business and the world in general’ … Stone poses for a portrait session in 1972.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesThat, I assumed, was that: I had been told to fuck off by one of music’s true, unequivocal geniuses while sitting on a bouncy castle just outside Newquay, which I supposed was a unique experience in itself.The next day, I was told to try again. Back to the bouncy castle I went. Presumably, the record label behind the box set had stumped up some cash, because this time he was charm itself: putting on an English accent when he picked up – “to whom am I speaking?” – and describing at length his plan to form a backing band entirely comprising musicians with albinism, which was a little unexpected, but, the way he explained it, weirdly in keeping with the Family Stone’s initial message of peace and unity. “To me, albinos are the most legitimate minority group of all. All races have albinos. If we all realise that we’ve all got albinos in our families, it’s going to take away from the ridiculous racial tension, if you’re black or you’re white, blah blah blah.”He talked about the mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles, to which Sly and the Family Stone had moved in 1969 and where he made his 1971 masterpiece There’s a Riot Goin’ On, a bleak, experimental album that could be the sound of the utopian hippy dream curdling into something darker, or an expression of the mood in their new home, where drug use was rampant: guns, paranoia, dangerous dogs and a coterie of highly dubious “bodyguards” were much in evidence. A little unexpectedly, he described life there as “beautiful”, although he did concede that the band’s bassist, Larry Graham, had fled the band in fear for his life. “But he’s a great bass player and I figured that when he realises I’m not going to kill him, he’ll be back,” he chuckled.He talked about playing Woodstock, the gig that more than any other sealed Sly and the Family Stone’s ascendancy. By all accounts, they stole the show, taking the stage at 4am and rousing the audience from their sleeping bags with an electrifying performance. But his main memory, he said, was feeling “scared”, intimidated by the size of the crowd and the presence backstage of Jimi Hendrix: “I knew my place. Just to be around Jimi Hendrix … shit. I didn’t want to be running my mouth off.”At the time, I took that as modesty, but I thought about it again, years later, when I saw Questlove’s superb documentarySly Lives! (AKA The Burden of Black Genius), which convincingly posited the theory that its subject’s increasingly uncontrollable drug use and reputation for turning up to gigs late, or not at all, was at least partly down to insecurity and crippling stage fright.View image in fullscreenStone in London in 1973.Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty ImagesStill, his mood was upbeat – he said he had thousands of new songs and that he wanted to “maintain stability” in order that they might be released – until he suddenly cut me off. “Have I talked to you enough now? I’ve got to go to the bathroom. You asked me about regrets,” he said, with a wheezy laugh. “If I don’t take a big shit now, I’ll regret that.”And that was that: 20 minutes in the company of the one of the most enigmatic and confounding figures in pop history. The stuff about albinism got picked up by lot of other news outlets when the article came out, but none of Stone’s thousands of new songs ever saw the light of day. He more or less vanished again for a decade after the interview, save for reports of his protracted legal battle to recover millions in missing royalty payments. He was awarded $5m (£3.3m) by a California court in 2015.View image in fullscreen‘Why don’t people try to love him for what he did?’ Stone performing in July 2007.Photograph: Joelle Diderich/EPAAnd then there was a sudden, deeply unexpected flurry of activity. Questlove had not just made a documentary, but was releasing a Stone autobiography via his publishing imprint Auwa Books. Stone was putatively drug-free at last: not for the first time, a doctor had told him that, unless he stopped smoking crack, he was going to die; he had finally heeded the advice and his daughter Sylvette Phunne Robinsonand his new manager, Arlene Hirschkowitz, had taken it upon themselves to shoo away his umpteen dealers from his home in LA. In 2023,I spoke to him again– or rather I didn’t speak to him. In 2013, his voice had been a rasp, hollowed out by decades of fast living; now, he was 80 and too ill to do interviews at all, except by email: “I have trouble with my lungs, trouble with my voice, trouble with my hearing and trouble with the rest of my body, too,” he wrote.‘I never lived a life I didn’t want to live’: Sly Stone on addiction, ageing and changing music for everRead moreClearly, things had changed: there was no lengthy period of negotiation about the interview, no demands for money, just a series of answers that arrived in my inbox 24 hours after I had sent the questions, at least one of which he took upon himself to correct factually. The answers were reflective, thoughtful and occasionally a little wistful – he was no longer able to make music, he said, but could “still hear music in my mind” – and proud of his musical legacy and vast influence: “I was always happy if someone took the things I was doing and they liked them enough to want to do them on their own.”They were also noticeably light on regrets. He conceded he probably should have got clean sooner, but equally, he said: “I never lived a life I didn’t want to live.” It was an intriguing corrective to the idea that his career amounted to a tragedy: six years of genius followed by decades of chaos and disappointment. Perhaps Stone could have done more, but perhaps he had already done it. He achieved more in those six years than most artists achieve in their lifetime, making music of such quality and originality, such power and funkiness, that you suspect it will be played for the rest of time. If there is anything even remotely like it in the thousands of tracks he amassed in his later years, that is just a bonus.Explore more on these topicsSly StonefeaturesShareReuse this content"

That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.While several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll soon need an iPhone capable of beingupdated to iOS 26–iPhone 11or later – aswatchOS 26is due for release in September. The free update will bring a raft of new features, including an AI motivational workout coach called Workout Buddy, a new wrist-flick gesture to clear notifications, a design revamp and various smart actions for messages, dealing with spam, and controlling the volume. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.At a glanceBest Apple Watch for most people:Series 10 Aluminium£399 at John LewisBest cheapApple Watch:SE (2nd gen)From £219 at AppleBest Apple Watch for battery:Ultra 2From £779 at CurrysThe best Apple Watches you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘The thinnest model yet’: the Apple Watch Series 10.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest Apple Watch for most people:Series 10 AluminiumView image in fullscreenFrom £399 at Apple£399 at John LewisThe Apple Watch Series 10 is the best model for most people, offering the full Apple smartwatch experience in a choice of two sizes. It’s the thinnest model yet, at just under 1cm thick, so it easily slips under shirt cuffs and feels light and compact on the wrist. The 42mm version should fit smaller wrists, while the 46mm version is the bearer of the largest screen on an Apple Watch – if onlyjustover theUltra 2.The screen is a bright and crisp OLED that stays on all the time and can be easily read in direct sunlight or from an angle. The watch feels slick in operation, with the 46mm unit lasting about two days between charges (if it’s not monitoring exercise), or long enough to track a marathon with battery life to spare. The double-tap gesture is handy for cancelling timers, alarms and scrolling through your widgets without having to touch the watch. And with Siri on board, you can set alarms and other basic features quickly, without an internet connection.One of the biggest benefits of the Series 10 Apple Watch is pretty comprehensive health tracking, including ECG (heart rhythm), blood oxygen and skin temperature, plus sleep and menstrual cycle monitoring. Apple’s sports tracking is solid, too, covering running, cycling, and swimming at depths up to 6m. Offline music from Apple Music, Spotify and other third-party apps means you can access your tunes without having to carry your phone with you.However, it’s the deep integration with iOS that makes the Apple Watch the best smartwatch for iPhone users, with Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos and more accessible from your wrist.Note that 4G models are available but require a plan linked to your phone provider. They allow you to stay connected when you’re out of Bluetooth or wifi range, which can be particularly handy for making calls and staying in touch while you’re out exercising without your iPhone in tow.Why should you buy it?The Series 10 offers the best Apple Watch experience in the slimmest and most compact package. Add to this the bright and always-on screen, ECG and handy gesture controls, and it’salsothe best Apple Watch for daily wear.Buy if:you want a great Apple Watch with almost all the featuresDon’t buy if:you want longer battery life or a more rugged designRead our fullApple Watch Series 10 review: thinner, lighter and basically the sameSize:42/46mmThickness:9.7mmScreen brightness:up to 2,000nitsTested battery life:2 daysProcessor:S10Storage:64GBWater resistance:50 metresSensors:HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depthBest cheapApple Watch:SE (2nd gen)View image in fullscreenFrom £219 at Apple£219 at John LewisThe SE is a cut-down version of the Apple Watch that offers the basics for just over half the price of the Series 10. The shape of the second-gen SE is based on theSeries 6from 2020, which means it has an older design and thicker body, but it still comes in a choice of 40mm or 44mm sizes. The OLED screen is smaller than the Series 10 with chunkier bezels. While crisp and good-looking, it’s not as bright nor is it always-on; it lights up only when you turn your wrist – which might be a deal breaker for some.Built around the S8 chip fromthe Series 8, the SE is missing some of the S10’s other nice-to-have features, too: it lacks support for the offline and faster Siri, the useful double-tap gesture, and it has only half the storage (32GB) for offline music and apps. The watch still tracks quite a lot of health and sport metrics, but has an older-generation heart-rate monitor compared with the Series 10. It doesn’t give ECG, blood oxygen and skin temperature measurements, either.What you do get is all the same tie-ins with the iPhone, including Apple Pay, notifications and calls on your wrist. Battery life is about two days, but note the current generation of SE is approaching three years old and could be replaced later this year. And while it’s the cheapest Apple Watch that Apple is selling new, you can often find better refurbished deals on higher-end models.Why should you buy it?The older SE still offers most of the experience that makes an Apple Watch great, but for less money. Some of the more advanced heart-tracking features and the always-on screen are missing, though.Buy if:you want most of what makes the Apple Watch great for lessDon’t buy if:you want an ECG or an always-on screenSize:40/44mmThickness:10.7mmScreen brightness:up to 1,000nitsTested battery life:2 daysProcessor:S8Storage:32GBWater resistance:50 metresSensors:HR (2nd gen)Best Apple Watch for battery:Ultra 2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £779 at CurrysFrom £799 at AppleThe biggest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 2, which is unapologetically beefy compared with its siblings. It comes in only one size – 49mm – but is available in black or natural titanium and has a super scratch-resistant sapphire crystal screen.The Ultra 2 is Apple’s adventure watch, complete with an extra “action” button in bold orange on the side for triggering sports tracking or other functions, plus an extra chunky digital crown that can be easily engaged if you’re wearing gloves. It has a siren for emergencies and a super bright OLED screen that’s 1.5x as bright as the Series 10 and works well if you’re in need of a torch.On the inside it has the same chips and sensors as theSeries 9, matching the health and sports tracking features of the Series 10, including ECG and blood oxygen monitoring. It has a few extras, such as dual-band GPS for higher accuracy in built-up areas or forests, plus a “precision start” setting that gets a GPS and heart rate lock before you start an activity. It also comes with 4G as standard, although it still needs a compatible plan with your phone provider. One of the Ultra 2’s standout features is battery life, which is about three days without exercise monitoring or long enough to track an ultramarathon.Despite being quite big for an Apple Watch, the Ultra 2 still fits under shirt cuffs fairly easily and looks expensive despite its rugged design – which is good because it’s roughly double the starting price of the Series 10.Why should you buy it?The Ultra 2 is the biggest, longest-lasting and most distinctive Apple Watch available and comes with all the features you need to help make the most out of exercise, adventure and just daily life.Buy if:you want the biggest and longest-lasting Apple Watch with extra featuresDon’t buy if:you need a compact model or have smaller wristsRead our fullApple Watch Series Ultra 2 review: faster chips and brighter screensSize:49mmThickness:14.4mmScreen brightness:up to 3,000nitsTested battery life:3 daysProcessor:S9Storage:64GBWater resistance:100 metresSensors:HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depthskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s worth buying refurbished or when it is reduced.Series 8– Good at the time of release in 2022, the Series 8 still has most of the main Apple Watch features with a slightly smaller and dimmer screen. Worth picking up refurbished at a substantial discount.Ultra– For looks, Apple’s original chunky watch is almost identical to the Ultra 2, missing out on only a few minor features such as the double-tap gesture, a less bright screen, precision finding and sleep apnoea notifications. Worth buying refurbished.Replace or spruce up?Wearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.Greater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, though options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges atleast £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteriescosts £95.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.There are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes andsells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.Several third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chainCeX, online stores such asmusicMagpie, and marketplaces such asAmazon,eBayandBack Market.Make sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:Grade A or Excellent– virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.Grade B or Good– in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.Grade C or Fair– in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.Once you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly, and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:Batteryhealth– the battery in the Apple Watch isdesigned to maintain at least 80%of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check thebattery health under batteryvia the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?Charging cable– the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck to charge, whichcosts £29 on its own. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.Buttons– check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.Sensors– the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?Speakers– check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.Wifi– the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.Water resistance– the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50m water resistance?Warranty– what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?Do not buyAnyApple Watch Series 7or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.How I testedView image in fullscreenTesting the ultra-thin Series 10.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianQuick GuideHow I testedShowWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.We change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.We test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why should you trust me?I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 17 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

To ensure that renewal is felt in people’s everyday lives, their jobs, their communities.”A government source added: “We’re turning the tide against the unacceptable housing crisis in this country with the biggest boost to social and affordable housing investment in a generation, delivering on our commitment to get Britain building.”The boost for affordable housing comes after protracted and occasionally fraught negotiations between Rayner and Reeves, which ended over the weekend just days before the review was due to be announced.The announcement will enable the chancellor to promise a generational shift in government investment, as she looks to turn the page on a difficult few weeks during which she has done a U-turn on cutting winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners andunemployment reached its highest level in nearly four years.The housing announcement will come alongsidean extra £15.6bnfor local transport projects and£14.2bn to build a new nuclear power plantat Sizewell C.Rayner was the penultimate cabinet minister to reach agreement with the Treasury, followed on Monday by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, whois reportedto have accepted a settlement that could mean a cut to police numbers.Cooper, Rayner and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, have all endured difficult talks with the Treasury over the past few weeks as Reeves looks to limit departmental spending to just 1.2% above inflation.Miliband was reported to have stormed out of talks with Reeves’s deputy, Darren Jones, who conducted the bulk of the negotiations, while Rayner is said to have insisted on speaking directly to the chancellor.Rayner’s settlement fulfils her demand for a major boost to affordable housing funding, after warnings she would miss the 1.5m homes target this parliament without it. A recent Savillsreportwarned that ministers were further away from hitting that target than they previously admitted.Reeves will announce on Wednesday that she will allocate £39bn to the affordable homes programme for 10 years from 2026-36, to be paid for by the extra capital spending she has freed up by changing the government’s borrowing rules.That money represents a major uplift on the funding provided by the previous government, which allocated £11.8bn for the programme over a five-year period.Reeves will also announce a decade’s worth of social rent increases, alongside a consultation on how to ensure that the cheapest rents rise to meet the most expensive ones.The extra money will help housing associations buy up thousands of new units that have already been built by private developers as part of their affordable housing commitments, but which are sitting empty because associations cannot afford them.Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the NationalHousingFederation, which represents housing associations, called it “the most ambitious affordable homes programme in decades”.She added: “This is a transformational package for social housing and will deliver the right conditions for a decade of renewal and growth.”Mairi MacRae, director of campaigns and policy at Shelter, said: “This increased investment is a watershed moment in tackling the housing emergency. It’s a huge opportunity to reverse decades of neglect and start a bold new chapter for housing in this country.”The announcement will come a day after the government’s planning bill passed its third reading in the Commons, another major plank of the government’s efforts to reach the 1.5m target.Ministers say the changes to the planning regime, which will make it easier for developers to build on previously protected sites, are essential for easing Britain’s housing crisis. However, environmental campaigners saythey will putthousands of sensitive natural habitats at risk.The Guardianrevealed on Tuesdaythat several Labour MPs asked the Treasury to intervene to protect the changes after becoming worried that the housing department would cave in to the demands of some backbenchers for stricter environmental protections.Meanwhile, Rayner has also announced she will repeal a 200-year-old law that criminalises rough sleeping, a move that campaigners said could prevent hundreds of people being arrested for being homeless.The housing secretary said she would remove the Vagrancy Act of 1824 from the statute book within a year, making it impossible for law enforcement officers to arrest people purely for sleeping on the streets.Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025Social housingRachel ReevesAngela RaynerHousingLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier on Monday the boys had appeared in court charged with attempted rape. A Romanian interpreter read them the charges.On Tuesday, the PSNI said it had made a third arrest in connection with the incident and reiterated a public appeal for information. It said a 28-year-old man had been unconditionally released from police custody after questioning.View image in fullscreenProtesters blocking a street during an anti-immigration demonstration in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, on 10 June.Photograph: Peter Murphy/AFP/Getty ImagesThe attacks on Monday damaged two police vehicles and injured 15 officers, some who required hospital treatment. Four houses were damaged by fire and three people evacuated from their homes amid what are being investigated as racially motivated hate attacks.Liam Kelly, the chair of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, which represents officers, said the injuries told a “frightening story of a mob fully intent on inflicting great harm”. He said officers worked tirelessly to defuse a potentially explosive situation and uphold the law.“I have no doubt whatsoever that police officers – far too few, because the service is starved of resources and officer numbers – prevented a pogrom with consequences too painful to contemplate. What we saw was totally mindless, unacceptable and feral,” Kelly said.In a video shared online, a woman who had observed homes being attacked expressed concern that debris could “ricochet” and hit those participating or watching, theIrish News reported.View image in fullscreenRiots took place for a second night in Ballymena on 10 June.Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters“Be careful lads,” she said. A man then informed her that there were people in one of the houses being attacked. She replied: “Aye, but are they local? If they’re local, they need out. If they’re not local, let them fucking stay there.”The assistant chief constable Ryan Henderson said on Tuesday: “Over the coming days, we will have in place a significant policing presence to help protect these communities in Ballymena and prevent any future disorder.”Reinforcements would be sought from Wales and England if necessary, Henderson said.Jim Allister, the Traditional Unionist Voice leader and MP for North Antrim, condemned the violence and said tension had been building in the town, which is 25 miles north of Belfast. “Within Ballymena there has been rising concerns about the sheer scale of migration into the town, and that would have been a factor in the wholly peaceful protest,” he said.The Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, posted on X: “The terrible scenes of civil disorder we have witnessed in Ballymena again this evening have no place in Northern Ireland.“There is absolutely no justification for attacks on PSNI officers or for vandalism directed at people’s homes or property.”Politicians across Northern Ireland’s political spectrum condemned the violence. “There is absolutely no place in our society for such disorder,” said Naomi Long, the justice minister.The health minister, Mike Nesbitt, on Tuesday visited homes that had been damaged. “I understand people have concerns about immigration. There are legitimate ways to express those concerns – last night was not one of them,” he said.There has been a spate of intimidation and attacks against people from abroad in County Antrim in recent years,forcing some to flee.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Jurors returned an 8-1 verdict after a trial that lasted more than six weeks.They were found to have taken payment for supplying the device, which was hidden in a children’s shoe box and planted under a seat in the journalist’s car. It was detonated remotely as she drove away from her home.Under Maltese law, those serving life sentences remain in prison until death. They are not eligible for parole or any other form of early release.Prosecutors had argued on Tuesday that the punishment should send a strong message to the public, both locally and internationally. Press freedom groups across Europe have followed the case closely.“We hope that today’s sentences will be a step towards a safer world for journalists by signalling to potential killers that there are heavy penalties to pay when a journalist is murdered,” Caruana Galizia’s family said in a statement.“The car bomb attack that killed Daphne sent shock waves through Maltese society that reverberated around the world. Her assassination created a sense in society that the people behind her murder were sure of their impunity and that the institutions that were duty-bound to protect her and society had failed.”Two men accused of planting and detonating the device, the brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, areserving 40-year jail terms after pleading guilty. A third man, Vince Muscat, who also admitted his role in the murder, is serving 15 years after turning state’s evidence.Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver who claims he acted as a middleman, secured a presidential pardonin exchange for giving evidenceand is living under police protection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He denies the charges. Delays in bringing the case before a jury have allowed his lawyers to successfully argue for bail, and he was released in February after pledging €50m (£42m) in cash and shares as security.Because they pleaded not guilty, Vella and Agius were the first among the accused to actually stand trial. They were arrested in 2021, based on evidence provided by Muscat. His testimony was crucial in the trial, which heard from 157 witnesses, including the victim’s relatives and members of the FBI, which had assisted local police with the investigation.The court heard that the original plan was to shoot the journalist, with Vella providing the hitmen with rifles and an AK-47. The plans were changed, however, and the killers opted for a bomb instead. It was placed in her car during the night and detonated remotely the next day, using a command sent via text message by George Degiorgio while he was cruising onboard a motor boat.Prosecutors told the court that the motive for the murder was Caruana Galizia’s “journalistic work”.In the same trial, Vella was convicted of complicity in a second, unrelated murder – the killing in 2015 of a Maltese lawyer, Carmel Chircop. Robert Agius’s brother Adrian and George Degiorgio were also found guilty of complicity in the same crime.Explore more on these topicsDaphne Caruana GaliziaJournalist safetyMaltaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was stressed that they were being sanctioned in their personal capacity, placing no restrictions on the ministries they lead. Netanyahu has promised to retaliate.The move was quickly condemned by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who called for the sanctions to be lifted and said the US stood “shoulder to shoulder” with Israel.“These sanctions do not advance US-led efforts to achieve a ceasefire, bring all hostages home, and end the war,” Rubio wrote, adding: “We remind our partners not to forget who the real enemy is.”In a carefully prepared move, for which Israel had little advance notice, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, along with the foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway, announced the sanctions in a joint statement: “We are steadfastly committed to the two-state solution and will continue to work with our partners towards its implementation.“It is the only way to guarantee security and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians and ensure long-term stability in the region, but it is imperilled by extremist settler violence and settlement expansion.“Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. These actions are not acceptable. This is why we have taken action now – to hold those responsible to account.“We will strive to achieve an immediate ceasefire inGaza, the immediate release of the remaining hostages by Hamas, which can have no future role in the governance of Gaza, a surge in aid and a path to a two-state solution.“Today’s measures focus on the West Bank, but of course this cannot be seen in isolation from the catastrophe in Gaza. We continue to be appalled by the immense suffering of civilians, including the denial of essential aid. There must be no unlawful transfer of Palestinians from Gaza or within the West Bank, nor any reduction in the territory of the Gaza Strip.”View image in fullscreenCharred agricultural equipment in the West Bank village of Dayr Dibwan after a reported attack by Israeli settlers on 5 June.Photograph: Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesThe previous UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, said he had planned to take the move against the two ministers last summer, but held back when he was told the decision was too political to take during an election campaign.By building an alliance of five countries, the UK may hope to protect itself from being the sole subject of Israeli and US anger. It may also be intended to stress Israel’s growing international isolation, but that will not disturb Israel as long as it has the protection of the White House.The EU requires unanimity among its 27 states to take parallel action, and would face resistance from Hungary. It is instead looking at possible trade restrictions that only require a qualified majority of EU states to approve them. Pressure has been building for concrete action in Canada, Norway and Australia.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, described the UK decision as unacceptable and said it was “outrageous that elected representatives and members of the government are subjected to these kind of measures”.Smotrich said: “Britain has already tried once to prevent us from settling the cradle of our homeland, and we will not allow it to do so again.”Ben-Gvir said: “We passed Pharaoh, we will also pass Starmer’s wall.”The former defence minister Benny Gantz said: “I vehemently disagree with ministers Smotrich and Ben Gvir on a wide range of issues – but the imposition of British sanctions on ministers in the one and only democracy in the Middle East, the state of Israel, is a profound moral mistake and sends a dangerous message to terrorists.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nobody will let us cause 2 million civilians to die of hunger even though it might be justified and moral until our hostages are returned,” he told a conference hosted by the Israel Hayom newspaper.Ben-Gvir stormed the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem on 26 May and has called for the Muslim world’s third-holiest site to bereplaced with a synagogue. He has also called for the voluntary departure of Palestinian refugees from Gaza.Lammy described Smotrich’s commentsas monstrous and repellantin the Commons a fortnight ago, but he held back from placing sanctions on the two men. He imposed sanctions on a small group of settlers and announced there would be no further talks on an expanded trade deal with Israel.The former Conservative Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said he fully understood why the government had imposed the sanctions. The Labour chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Emily Thornberry, welcomed the move, but said it must not be a substitute for any plans to recognise a Palestinian state.Labour Friends of Israel said: “By their words and deeds, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich’s actions in government have given succour to those who perpetrate disgraceful and utterly unacceptable violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Tories raised £3.3m, Labour £2.3m, and Reform and theLiberal Democratsabout £1.5m each, excluding public funds.However, the donations to Reform show that the party is attracting a wider breadth of donors than before Nigel Farage returned as leader, when it was largely kept afloat by loans from its then leader and now deputy,Richard Tice.View image in fullscreenFiona Cottrell, then known as Fiona Watson, in 1972.Photograph: Lichfield/Getty ImagesFiona Cottrell started giving money last year. Her son, George, is regularly at Farage’s side, including at a party fundraiser earlier this year, on the election campaign trail and at the event to announce Reform’s new chair on Tuesday. His role in the party has been described as an unpaid volunteer but he has alsopaid for tripsby Farage to the US and Brussels.George Cottrell, a former head of fundraising for Ukip, spent eight months in prison in the US in 2016-17 after being accused of offering money-laundering services on the dark web in 2014 – before he worked in politics. He served time for a single count of wire fraud after 20 other charges were dropped as part of a plea deal.His business interests are largely in Montenegro,where he reportedly lost €20m (£16m) in a single poker game. He recently launched a polling and campaigns company in the UK called Geostrategy International.The other big donor to the party over the last quarter was a company called Tisun Investments, controlled by Tice. The company has given £613,000 since the beginning of the year in 33 tranches.Nick Candy, Reform’s treasurer, had pledged to give about £1,000,000 but his donation was not in official filings published by the Electoral Commission on Tuesday. Farage said at a press conference earlier in the day that Candy had given £313,000, and that the party was “extremely grateful” and looking forward to the remaining amount due in the next few months.Two former Conservative donors, Bassim Haidar and Mohamed Amersi, gave £25,000 each to attend Reform’s fundraising event at Oswald’s Club in Mayfair in January.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They received a £1m donation from Jeremy Elliott San, a video games tycoon. The party also received big chunks of cash from longstanding donors, including £250,000 from Flowidea, owned by the Swiss-born banker Sir Henry Angest, and £200,000 from Christopher Rea.It also accepted £50,000 from Neil Record, a businessman who chairs the climate denier lobby group Net Zero Watch, and who hosted the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, for a £14,000 week-long “residential” with her family and political colleagues earlier this year.David Ross, a co-founder of Carphone Warehouse who once funded a holiday in Mustique for Boris Johnson, returned to the party as a big donor for the first time since 2022. He will take up a senior treasurer role in the autumn.Labour raised most of its money from trade unions, including Unite, Unison and GMB, but it was also left £350,000 as a bequest by Reginald Collins, aLabourmember.Farage’s political entity previously received much larger sums of money when it was the Brexit party, including about £10m to cover its 2019 election costs from the crypto and aviation fuel investor Christopher Harborne.Another company controlled by Tice, Britain Means Business, gave £500,000 to Reform before the 2024 election but this company was originally a cross-party campaign to support Brexit.In the months before the election, Reform also received £200,000 from thebusinessman Zia Yusuf, who became the party’s chair last year before resigning last week, and then returning two days later in a different role.Contact Guardian PoliticsExplore more on these topicsReform UKParty fundingConservativesLiberal DemocratsLabourNigel FarageRichard TicenewsShareReuse this content"

About 6 million people in the UK are estimated to have dyslexia, which primarily affects reading and writing skills.Jamie’s Dyslexia Revolution review – a lifetime of pain has led to thisRead moreKyle told the Guardian he had felt “quite emotional” when seeing AI technology used to help young people learn with “incredible empathy, encouragement and knowledge”.“I have already seen how GPTs and other [AI] services have helped me,” said Kyle, who was last month mooted in press reports as a potential future education secretary. “AI gets to know you. AI gets to know how you ask questions and how you think. It fits in around your own individual learning characteristics. AI is an incredible tutor, so there is no question that AI deployed wisely and safely, not just in education but in a young person’s life, can have an incredible levelling-up opportunity.”He said the current problem was that “we don’t have enough human capacity to give dyslexics all of the skilled and specialist support that is unique to the individual characteristics of dyslexics”.He stopped short of arguing AI technology should be allowed to support dyslexic children in exams, where they perform significantly worse in key GCSEs. About 52% of children without any special education needsachieveda grade 5 or above in English and maths last year, compared with 22% among children with a specific learning difficulty, which includes dyslexia.“We are currently reviewing the curriculum and we have to very carefully look at how AI can transform education and help us assess and understand a young person’s abilities into the future,” he said. “But right now I think we have a really robust exam system. It’s very good at judging a young person’s potential.”Kay Carter, the chief executive of theDyslexiaAssociation, said AI was already levelling the playing field for dyslexic pupils. If AI could manage tasks such as memorising facts and rapid recall of information, “the focus [of education] may shift to problem-solving [and] critical thinking, talents which some of those with dyslexia naturally excel at,” she said.She cautioned that AI was not to be a replacement for good teaching but “allows dyslexic students better access to their own learning”.Kyle was speaking at London Tech Week, where he also addressed the row between the government and parts of the creative industries over theuse of copyrighted contentfor training AI models.

Britain’s biggest building society said many of its customers were using cash to help them with weekly budgeting during the period of high inflation.Consumers in Spain and Portugal also turned to cash to buy goods during the power outage in late April that knocked out bank and payment systems, while cyber-attacks on UK businesses and organisations in recent months have undermined faith in electronic transactions.“At a time of uncertainty, at a time of crisis, people do move to cash. They want to make sure they have literally got something under the mattress,” Cleland said. “Even in the UK, there will be times where networks are down and you can only be paying in cash.”Cash began to decline as the favourite form of money in 2014 and by 2017Bank of England datashows debit cards had overtaken cash as the most frequently used payment method.The trend began to reverse in 2022 as inflation began to rise after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The refusal of many shops to accept notes and coins haveprompted campaigners and politiciansto call for a law forcing force retailers to accept them.Cleland said that consumers want cash “to be there but they’re not necessarily using it”. She added that households in financial difficulties also used it for budgeting, with reports of increased use among those hit hard by high inflation.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsBank of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

She ate macaroni while swiping through some funny TikTok videos before getting into bed at 11pm.Russia has stepped up its aerial attacks on Kyiv in recent days. From the safety of Washington, Donald Trump had warned that Vladimir Putin’s response to Ukraine’saudacious Operation Spiderweb attackon Russia’s nuclear-capable bombers a week earlier “wouldn’t be pretty”. But Yakymehuk doesn’t look for that sort of content on TikTok.Air raid sirens, and talk of drones and missiles, have been par for the course for Kyiv’s residents since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion three years ago.A car dealership was destroyed by falling debris from a shot-down missile a couple of years ago, but otherwise the Obolon district in north Kyiv, 6 miles from the government buildings in the city centre, has avoided the worst.“I am a deep sleeper, so I don’t normally hear the drones,” Yakymehuk said as she was queueing with others in front of a blue tent where police were taking down details and volunteers were giving out compensation forms to fill in.“It’s just daily life, I don’t think about it,” she added, squinting up in the morning sun at the demolition workers dangling from cranes at the corner of the 25-storey apartment building as they sought to make the site safe. The window frame of her bedroom had been blown in, and was hanging at an angle.On Monday the drones did wake her. They seemed to be on top of her, she said. And the persistent, nagging buzz of what seemed to be a large number of them was getting louder, as if someone was slowly bringing a electric shaver ever closer to her face.Then the first massive explosion that made her heart jump. And a second. This one sent “sparks” flying across her bedroom window on the fifth floor, she said.Yakymehuk ran down the stairs from her flat, as did others, out of the building and to the bomb shelter – a dusty cellar, in reality, below another building, 100 metres away. The door to it is not always unlocked. But it was tonight. There were hundreds in there already, “maybe 500 people”, she said.Ukraine war briefing: Russia launches attacks on Kyiv and Odesa a day after massive drone bombardmentRead moreOthers in the queue outside the tent on Tuesday morning said they heard 10 explosions in all. Black smoke was still bellowing from the neighbouring industrial estate at mid-morning. This appears to have been the target.One woman in the Obolon district had been killed. Across Kyiv, four were said to be injured.Seven of Kyiv’s 10 districtsreported being hit in one of the largest drone attacks on the city since the war started. Yakymehuk might not sleep so well in future.View image in fullscreenOksana Kodynets with daughter Maria: ‘I thought it was going to be the last night of my life.’Photograph: Dan Boffey/The GuardianKyiv could be any European capital during the day. It is a far cry from the opening months of the war, when it resembled European cities during the pandemic. Then the streets were empty. The shops locked up. There was a nervous energy among the soldiers at checkpoints that would make everyone else anxious. And the Russians wanted Kyiv. They had been at the edge of the city and could come back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The nightlife is lively, restaurants full, and those with money flash it around. Some people are nervous as it gets dark. That’s when the Russian bombers and their drones come, increasingly so in recent weeks, even before Operation Spiderweb. The nerves are especially acute among those who live near factories and industrial estates, which the Kremlin suspects of playing a role in Ukraine’s war effort. They listen in their beds for the drones to drop, breathing a little easier as they pass by. But others, maybe the majority, ignore the air raid sirens and assure themselves that the drones won’t come for them. They get on with it.View image in fullscreenElvira Neehyporenko’s car was damaged when a drone struck her apartment block.Photograph: Dan Boffey/The GuardianIt is only when an attack from the air comes to your own doorstep that the reality of the situation bites, said Elvira Neehyporenko, 34, whose red Honda, parked just below where the Shaheed drone struck, had taken a hefty blow, leaving it with smashed windows and a caved-in roof.Neehyporenko lives in the same block as Yakymehuk but further away from the where the drone struck. She laughed as she admitted that when the explosions began, a little distant at first, it was her dog Molly, an American Staffordshire terrier, who had the sense to run into the bathroom. Neehyporenko, whose boyfriend is in the army and fighting in Kharkiv, followed the dog. She stayed there for a while on the cold tiles, before the biggest explosion forced her down to the first floor, where she stayed for fear of what she had heard was a Russian tactic of striking at people as they flee from damaged buildings.Standing watching all the commotion outside the flats mid-morning on Tuesday was Oksana Kodynets, 23, who lives in the apartment block opposite where the drone struck. She was taking her 18-month-old daughter, Maria, for a walk. Her husband is in the army and had been working an overnight shift in the city. She had been alone last night and was a little shaken this morning, she admitted.She had recorded the sound of the explosions, including the largest one, just over the way, and had been listening to them this morning. It was a kind of metallic sound, nothing like she had heard before, she said, as she played it from her phone. Does she worry? “I did last night,” she said with a half-smile. “I thought it was going to be the last day of my life.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But on her fourth album, it’s more pronounced than ever: the tracks are rooted in Bahraini wedding poems and in fijiri, the songs sung by pearl fishers around the Persian Gulf. The results are enthralling: soloing that feels alternately yearning and exuberant, rich and emotive melodies, the sound – big on vibraphone and electric piano – regularly strafed with fizzing electronics. It’s an album to lose yourself in.Alexis PetridisAnnie and the Caldwells – Can’t Lose My (Soul)A family band who have spent the best part of 40 years honing their God-fearing blend of gospel, funk, disco, southern soul and R&B,Annie and the Caldwellswere once Mississippi’s best-kept secret. They break cover with an album recorded live (although without an audience) in a church in their home town of West Point. You don’t have to share the Caldwells’ faith to find the songs on Can’t Lose My (Soul) life-affirming, their message of hope both infectious and timely. This music is tough, powerful and tightly played, but still raw, blessed with incredible vocals and almost telepathic interplay between the musicians.Read the full review.APArchitects – The Sky, the Earth & All BetweenView image in fullscreenArchitects performing in 2024.Photograph: Katja Ogrin/RedfernsThe British metalcore band made their masterpiece with their 11th album, a triumph of production and pop melody as well as cathartic lyric writing. Each song is its own burning exoplanet of sound, heaving with multitracked detail from granite-shearing drums to floating layers of ambience above, as frontman Sam Carter casts a nihilist’s eye over ravaged psyches and social discord – while getting in a couple of jabs at Architects’ own fanbase.Ben Beaumont-ThomasAya – Hexed!‘Chasing a high through rave music got dark’: Aya on hexes, Huddersfield and her hardcore horror electronicsRead moreAs she explained to us in March, Aya Sinclair’s second album of hardcore electronics is an interrogation of her youth in the north-west, grappling with her queerness, gender identity, panic attacks and substance use. As her voice goes from manic to calm, and breakcore or donk beats collapse into noise, reality seems to get right up in your face then slip from your grip. These tracks bounce and fall like an old tyre down a hillside, and Aya moves with them, chattering one of the best British lyric sheets in years – full of tight rhyme schemes, double meanings, northern slang and joy in the plasticity of language.BBTBad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosThere are worried discussions on social media that there are no good contenders for a 2025 song of the summer – but there’s an hour-long album of them here from Bad Bunny. Latin America’s biggest music star leans even harder into his Puerto Rican heritage: as well as making plenty of reggaeton, he samples classic salsa and creates entirely new songs in that style; adds the scrape of a güiro here or a guitar-led bolero there; and turns DtMF, a song in Puerto Rico’splenagenre, into a mega-streaming smash. Spanish speakers may spota series of semi-veiled political lyrics– but in his vocal tone alone, he still expresses hurt and disappointment better than arguably anyone in pop today.BBTBon Iver – Sable, Fable‘Have the courage to walk away’: Bon Iver on romance, retirement and his rapturous new recordRead moreJustin Vernon has been many things over the course of his career – the rustic singer-songwriter of For Emma, Forever Ago; the Auto-Tune-drenched electronic experimentalist of 22, a Million; a collaborator who provides the unlikely link between Taylor Swift and Swamp Dogg. But, as much as it’s presented as a companion to his stark indie-folk EP Sable (included as a prelude-like first disc), Fable is ultimately an R&B album, brightly hued and poppy even during its most out-there moments: the backing of Day One is lurching and disruptive, but the melody is a killer.Read the full review.APJefre Cantu-Ledesma – Gift SongsNo record this year will have a more apposite title: the five pieces of the Zen priest and hospice worker’s latest record are soothing balms born of the sensitive interplay between Cantu-Ledesma and his new ensemble. The 20-minute opener The Milky Sea sounds like moonlight hitting water, a dappled conjuring of brightness and depth between pianist Omer Shemesh, drummer Booker Stardrum and cellist Clarice Jensen. The three-part eponymous suite comprises patient, open-hearted sketches and a sense of the players in the room together. But pretty much any sense of delineation between instrument and person dissolves on River That Flows Two Ways, a softly ecstatic meditation of pump organ and droning cello that overflows one’s field of perception to drown out life’s hurts for nine minutes.Laura SnapesErika de Casier – LifetimeView image in fullscreenSpellbinding melody … Erika de Casier.Photograph: Amy PeskettTo immerse in Erika De Casier’s surprise-released fourth album feels like slipping into an infinity pool: her down tempo seductions brim with boundless, limpid luxury and possibility. Writing and producing everything for the first time, the Danish-Portuguese musician’s touchstones here are Sade, William Orbit-era Madonna and Janet Jackson. While the sultry beats and period-specific dial tones are on point, Lifetime transcends homage thanks to De Casier’s innovative vision: the celestial rave synths that glimmer through Seasons; how Two Thieves disintegrates from chilly Y2K futurism to dank, time-warped dub; contrasting the immaculate melody of Delusional with a whinnying horn sampled from Insane in the Brain. Almost every song, in fact, has a spellbinding melody: highlight You Can’t Always Get What You Want has a little of Pure Shores in its tender conciliation.LSDestroyer – Dan’s Boogie“I’m into it / If you’reinto it,” Dan Bejar sings on Sun Meet Snow, the wink heavy with indeterminate intimation. Dyed-in-the-wool Destroyer fans may take it as an acknowledgment of Bejar’s commitment to the literary absurdism and sybaritic production that the Canadian songwriter knows we love so well. Dan’s Boogie is another masterclass in it, paring back the dancefloor precision of 2022’s Labyrinthitis for the haunted opulence of Bologna, which seems to reverberate across the empty marble floors of a deserted hotel; the title track’s decadently spiralling arpeggios knocking his rakish lounge act off their piano stool; the darkly manic power pop of Hydroplaning Off the Edge of the World. By “into it”, Bejar may also mean the infinite beauty and ugliness in the world, which he can’t ever look away from and can’t stop showing us: “The sun mostly rises,” he sings on The Ignoramus of Love. “A great golden spike through the heart of the world.”Read the full review.LSDjrum – Under Tangled SilenceProducer Felix Manuel’s crazily ambitious third album is a masterclass of detail and vision, an insatiable swarm of classical piano into tabla and breakcore, all presented as a seamless mix. It warrants the full-hour, headphones-on listening experience, but the many textural highlights along the way include the intent tabla, booming drums and bassy slurps of L’Ancienne, the hyper-kinetic kalimba and blown-out breaks of Three Foxes Chasing Each Other and Sycamore’s torrid rotor blade whirl.LSEdward Skeletrix – Museum MusicSome listeners interpreted the US rapper’s 30-track double album as a satire on hollow trap music, while others found it just plain empty. The lyrics are often dumb, even wilfully horrible at times – but they’re hardly presented as aspirational, and with a slurred melodic flow over corroded-motherboard beats, Skeletrix conjures some terrifically bleak moods. The result is like an album from the “rage rap” generation of Playboi Carti and Ken Carson that’s been burned out and left to drift.BBTJohn Glacier – Like a RibbonOne track on the pseudonymous London rapper’s debut album opens with the words “Since I came to Earth …” It fits: there’s something very otherworldly about the sound of Like a Ribbon. It inhabits a strange and fascinating territory somewhere between UK rap, grime, lo-fi alt-rock, abstract electronica and bass music. Its author floats through it, her voice a deadpan mumble, her lyrics a stream of consciousness: you occasionally feel less like you’re listening to her than eavesdropping. It’s remarkably original and completely enrapturing.Read the full review.APHorsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenGentle melancholy … Chicago indie Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeThe cover of the Chicago indie trio’s second album echoes a classic quilting patch, the eight-point star. Produced by Cate Le Bon, the pared back Phonetics On and On creates a similar kind of simple piecework to beautiful effect, turning gorgeous miniatures from rumbling bass, splayed guitar and discordant violin that owes much to the Raincoats and the Velvets. Their spindly, rickety sound has its edges sanded by their casual tunefulness and gentle melancholy, with fragmentary lyrics that seem to trace a surreptitious search for comfort and fulfilment: “Shepherd wants to drive a flower truck / ‘Cause it smells nice and everyone’s happy,” as they sing, with gnomic loveliness (and no trace of twee), on Rock City.Read the full review.LSEiko Ishibashi – Antigone‘Anger compels me forward’: Drive My Car composer Eiko Ishibashi on evil, experimentation and exploding genreRead moreAfter a couple of soundtracks with Ryusuke Hamaguchi (Drive My Car, Evil Does Not Exist) and some avant garde releases, the Japanese composer-songwriter returns to relatively straightforward songwriting and reaches a new peak of sophistication. Over pattering jazz drums, her decadently rich and symphonic arrangements are never leaden or predictable; digital and analogue sound sources flow together like freshwater meeting the sparkling sea. Even if you don’t understand Japanese, Ishibashi’s lounge-bar singing evokes so much: there’s profound melancholy, tempered with a touch of happy resignation, as well as awed wonder.BBTJapanese Breakfast – For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women)View image in fullscreenShifting … Japanese Breakfast’s lead singer, Michelle Zauner.Photograph: Pak BaeMichelle Zauner’s fourth album represents a distinct shift: it’s her first recorded in a professional studio, with indie super-producer Blake Mills – of Fiona Apple and John Legend fame – at the controls. The results are romantic and lush – orchestrations that lean towards baroque pop on single Orlando in Love and 60s easy listening (Little Girl); adding a Cure-like swirl to the sound of her band on Honey Water. The songs, meanwhile, are great: pensive and questioning, at one remove from the pop-facing sound of 2021’s Jubilee, but no less effective.Read the full review.APJasmine.4.T – You Are the MorningJasmine Cruikshank’s debut album attracted attention for being produced by all three members of Boygenius and released on Phoebe Bridgers’ Saddest Factory label, but it doesn’t really need the celebrity endorsement: You Are the Morning stands entirely on its own merits, revealing Cruikshank to be a fantastic songwriter. Her brand of alt-rock touches on Elliott Smith, Adrianne Lenker and Daniel Johnston, as well as 90s slacker grunge on Elephant and the standout (and Bridgers duet) Guy Fawkes Tesco Dissociation. The lyrics deal with her experience of coming out as a trans woman with unflinching candour, its mood shifting from heartbreaking to utterly joyful.APKin’Gongolo Kiniata – KiniataLike the legendary Konono No 1 before them, Kin’Gongolo Kiniata are testament to the sheer resourcefulness of Kinshasa’s musicians. Its members variously play a homemade one-string guitar, two-string bass and a xylophone fashioned out of discarded plastic bottles (played with a pair of flip-flops); their drummer’s kit features a broken television instead of a bass drum. And, like Konono No 1, the noise they make is visceral and utterly electrifying: a kind of fuzzed-out, wah pedal-heavy punk-funk Afropop, frequently delivered at warp speed, with call-and-response lyrics (in Lingala). It sounds thrillingly evocative of teeming, bustling city life.APskip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

It’s as good a mission statement for DJ Koze’s sprawling vision as any. As the Hamburg producer floats from Japanese folk song to Teutonic balladry and ecstatic psychedelia – all rendered with Koze’s typically iridescent detail and cheekiness – the self-styled Talented Mr Tripley’s guiding ethos for the journey seems to be nothing but radiant appreciation for beauty in whatever form it may take. And if that feels a little woo-woo for your tastes, the pedal-to-the-metal breakbeat of Brushcutter and rainforest rave of Buschtaxi find their own kind of purity in the transcendence of obliteration.Read the full review.LSNao – JupiterThe “sister album” to 2018’s Grammy and Mercury prize-nominated Saturn has been a long time coming – partly because Nao diverted into making her guitar-heavy response to Covid and its accompanying privations, 2021’s And Then Life Was Beautiful, partly because she has been struggling with chronic fatigue syndrome. But the concise 33 minutes of Jupiter are entirely worth the wait: warm, sensual optimistic, densely packed with great songs that variously touch on R&B, disco, Afrobeats and even a touch of the “wonky funk” style with which she first attracted attention.APPerfume Genius – GloryPerfume Genius: ‘I want to feel extremes – but I’m not as self-destructive now’Read moreThere’s a sense in which Mike Hadreas’s seventh album as Perfume Genius feels like a culmination, a collection on which you can hear aspects of all the musical personae he’s inhabited over the years – from the stark confessional singer-songwriter mode of his debut Learning, to the synth-pop of 2014’s Too Bright to the left-field Americana of 2020’s acclaimed Set My Heart on Fire Immediately. He remains an impressively unique songwriting voice throughout, whether fantasising about being kidnapped on In a Row, or musing about what it is to be an ageing gay man on the title track. Glory is experimental and deep yet immediate with it – the Aldous Harding collaboration No Front Teeth really hits. It may well be Hadreas’s best album to date.Read the full review.APPinkPantheress – Fancy ThatFor all the gags about her slender track lengths, good luck keeping up with UK producer PinkPantheress on all 20 minutes and nine tracks of her garage-addled new mix tape. She lassos jungle, emo and samples spanning Basement Jaxx to Sugababes and Panic! at the Disco into a hungry, playful hyperlapse trip through a night out. High on an unruly strain of weed and heady flirtation, she spins the ecstasy into a stupid amount of addictive, sugary choruses. Although Pink broke out as a bedroom producer on TikTok, she – as Smerz do below – makes an unarguable case for goingoutout and letting life happen to you.Read the full review.LSTell us your favourite music album of 2025 so farRead morePloy – It’s Later Than You ThinkThat title carries with it a whiff of Anthropocene-era doom – but mostly the cheery sense that you’ve been lost in dancefloor reverie for hours. Ploy, AKA UK producer Sam Smith, has been putting out releases across UK underground labels such as Hessle Audio and Timedance for a decade now, and the joyous Afro-Latin house on his second album (released by Dekmantel) should be rinsed over the festival season. When in Room rides a rolling groove but frequently rears up in alarm with a digital whinny; Stringz has a weird melody that spelunks its way through a series of K-holes; the title track’s marimba line will rightly be bellowed by topless lads in cross-body bags.BBTAddison Rae – AddisonThe year’s best new pop superstar worships at the altar of Britney and Madonna, has drawn adoration – and collaborations – from Charli xcx and Arca and channels the most evanescent end of Lana Del Rey’s catalogue (plus the non-stop blue jeans/short skirts references) into transcendent dance-pop that’s perfect for this downtempo moment. Her long-awaited debut feels just as sumptuous and luxe as the spoils the 24-year-old Louisianan sings about: while she’s often dissolving into a sort of ecstasy at the prospect of pleasure, the production twists her reveries into unexpected shapes, with incredibly effective key changes and mutant bass lines.LSSherelle – With a VengeanceView image in fullscreenSherelle.Photograph: Sarah Louise BennettIn a world that feels relentless, even galloping out of control, British dance star Sherelle seems determined to find a positive in all that brutal forward motion. Her 160bpm style encompasses Chicago footwork, British jungle and transatlantic techno, and her skill is in maintaining the sci-fi strangeness of those genres while making them as broadly appealing as a dance-chart banger.Read the full review.BBTSmerz – Big City Life‘Rethink it all!’ Why is one Danish school producing nearly every cool alt-pop star?Read moreThe Norwegian duo’s second album feels like both an insider’s guide to a killer night out – they’ve got the skinny on the gossip, fashion, swagger, the “art-school gang” who won’t join the fun – and a dare to keep up with Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt. They deliver their dry observations in side-eye mutters and conspiratorial singsong, loaded enough to make you worry about what they really think aboutyouroutfit and drink of choice; just the way they sing “feisty!” on a song of the same name is unsettling. The instrumentation is similarly uneasy, all captivatingly weird, insular bops that jolt with stabs of treated piano. The tongue-in-cheek vibe might get a bit hollow were it not for how deeply they’re yearning to make a real connection out on the tiles: “I want something huge to hit me / Something out of time,” they sing on Street Style. In You Got Time and I Got Money – a gorgeous devotional drunk on the strings of Bitter Sweet Symphony – they’ve got it.LSLos Thuthanaka – Los ThuthanakaAnyone invested in the potential of the electric guitar needs to hear this overwhelming album by the Bolivian-American sibling duo of Chuquimamani-Condori (FKA Elysia Crampton) and Joshua Chuquimia Crampton. The latter’s riffs are thick smears of raunchy distortion or clearly chirrupping bird calls, played over his sister’s shuffling rhythms and a dense thicket of samples. The final half-hour, across three mind-blowing tracks, pushes you into the heavens and leaves you there, gasping blissfully on a cloud. (Note that it’s only available on Bandcamphere.)BBTWilliam Tyler – Time Indefinite‘I don’t want to retreat any more’: William Tyler on grief, alcoholism and his healing new albumRead moreTyler’s music was once expansive, pushing Americana and krautrock towards transcendence. The Nashville guitarist’s fifth solo album embodies the inverse of that impulse, existing in a staticky, spiralling state of collapse as tape loops and small guitar refrains melt together. It’s largely personal: Tyler made the album while seeking treatment for alcoholism and confronting the limiting personal myths that he had constructed around himself. But it’s hard not to hear this charred, beautiful record – made by a great buff of American history – as a eulogy for his country.LSVenturing – GhostholdingThe US musician Jane Remover released a stunning album in April under her main name, entitled Revengeseekerz: ultra-compressed glitchcore-trap that felt like being hosed down with jagged pixels. Even better is this album from a month prior under her Venturing alias, which is a total stylistic shift: alt-rock lit up by a soulfully overdriven guitar tone, and somewhat evocative of midwest emo. On Recoil, though, she claims to “hate every emo song”, and fair enough – these vignettes of love and youth are sung with breezy confidence and sly amusement, so different from emo’s earnestness.BBTWolfacejoeyy – CupidR&B vocals and spartan rap production have dovetailed in the “sexy drill” sound of recent years, and this is the subgenre’s finest full-length alongside last year’s Cash Cobain album Play Cash Cobain. Wolfacejoeyy’s lower register is a bit reminiscent of Drake in hurt-boyfriend mode, but in his higher range he knocks out a series of perfect pop-R&B melodies that flutter like pink-penned butterflies on a teenage diary. It’s quotable – “I’m sexy and alone in this club, what the fuck?” he croons on Late to the Party, amusingly crestfallen – and the production is excellent, including baile funk touches on Ronaldinho.BBTBilly Woods – GolliwogDavid Attenborough, weed and ‘American apartheid’: the awesome mind of rapper Billy WoodsRead moreYou wouldn’t necessarily have expected one of the best hip-hop albums of the year so far to be an abstract take on the rap subgenre of horrorcore, but Billy Woods’s Golliwog – a dramatic about-turn from 2023’s approachable Maps – is just that. Daunting, difficult, strafed with noise and queasy jazz and soundtrack samples, it’s occasionally harrowing listening (as on Waterproof Mascara, where Woods’s vocals are backed by the sound of a woman sobbing). But it’s also very compelling in the way it blends gothic horror with current events, touching on illegal immigration and financial turmoil. Extreme music for extreme times.Read the full review.APYHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsTalking of extremes: this New York-via-Philly band’s 21-minute debutsoundssickly, full of slurry and clatter that stretches and contracts; skittish and nimble thanks to drummer Sam Pickard’s rototom-heavy kit, which keeps their deranged punk-funk perpetually airborne rather than grounded. Singer Zack Borzone – if you can label him so conventionally – sounds as if he’s wrenching himself apart, singing through electric shocks, crying out hoarsely. There are no choruses, just the ceaseless lurch of incessant mutation. Their closest comparison might be Ireland’s Gilla Band and their incredible 2022 album Most Normal: both dissect rock with the grimly visceral lens of David Cronenberg and offer up an ooze it’s hard not to want to roll about in.Read the full review.LSShare your favouriteYou can tell us your favourite album of the year so far using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

I passed my driving test on the Monday, and on the Friday I made my weekly trip to the library and borrowed The Day of the Jackal byFrederick Forsyth. I had no idea I would one day be a writer myself – at that point I was merely an insatiable reader – but in retrospect that Friday marked an important way station on the journey from one to the other.I gobbled up the book and thought it was fantastic – fast, pacy, exciting, suspenseful and laced with detail and intrigue. Then I thought, wait, what? How was this book working? It was a twin-track thriller – an assassin hunts his target while law enforcement hunts the assassin. But the intended victim was Charles de Gaulle, a real person, the president of France, who had been in the news almost daily until his death in 1970, from ananeurysm. Therefore we all knew the assassin had failed. How did that not short-circuit the will-he-won’t-he suspense that thrillers seemed to require?And the main character was an absolute cipher – a completely blank slate. No backstory, no history, no explanation, no reason, no justification. No description. Not even a name. Yet we all rooted for him. We secretly admired him. We wanted him to succeed.How-to books about writing tell us to create sympathetic, fleshed-out characters, and then place them in great peril, and leave the outcome uncertain until the last page. Forsyth ignored all that. In so doing, he showed us that thehowquestion was as powerful as the who, why, where and when. He showed us that intriguing detail and inside information was compelling in itself. He created a year-zero thriller that reset the whole genre.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I met him in the early 2010s and we began hanging out occasionally and corresponding fairly often – he by typed snail-mail, me by email printed for him by his wife. He said he knew he had to write the book because he was unemployed and broke, but at first he had trouble feeling his way into it. He was a journalist by trade, and his lightbulb moment was to imagine he was doing a book-length true-crime feature about recent events. The result was a novel that changed the rules for all of us that came after.Explore more on these topicsFrederick ForsythLee ChildfeaturesShareReuse this content"

DoesKid Rockhave abrother?No, it’s a 2025 way of describing “letting your kids do nothing in the summer holidays”, also known as a “wild summer”. American parents are fighting back against (or giving up on) expensive, overscheduled summers of camps and activities for their offspring. “What if, some are daring to wonder, my kid does nothing?” theNew York Timesreported.A return to the old ways, huh?When I was young, we were sent out with a penknife, a tin of pipe tobacco and a bottle of dandelionand burdock on the day school broke up. It was strongly suggestedwe should not return home until 1 September.No, you weren’t.No, OK, we weren’t.We spent six weeks bored out of our minds, watching TV and fighting. We’d have loved expensive, overscheduled summers!Well, some US parents are sick of paying through the nose to keep their kids out of trouble – one interviewed by the NYT spent $40,000 (£30,000) on occupying her three children for eight weeks. Inflation is making summer camps unaffordable for many: a survey found 30% of parents go into debt or defer payments. And while the situation isn’t as bad in the UK, it’s still a struggle for parents: research last year found UK summer childcare costs £1,000 a kid on average.Ouch!And kids don’t even seem to enjoy organised summer stuff much: “It was a fight every day to get them to go,” one parent told the NYT. “He cried every single day at drop-off,” a journalist atthe Cutsaid of her son’s summer camp.Readers reply: Should schools take a long summer break – or does it harm children’s learning?Read moreMaybe a bit of boredom isn’t so bad.Being bored is being rebranded as the better option for pushy parents. “I tell them their kid will be more ‘ahead’ with their own experimentation,” a US educational consultant reassures her anxious clients.But “their experimentation” will be whatever the algorithm decides – kids will be glued to YouTube, won’t they?Yes, screen time is a concern, and if the little darlings manage to enable in-app purchases, your iPad could prove a more expensive babysitter than the fanciest camp.If they’re going to be screen rotting all day every day, parents could at least put them to work - give them a bitcoin and a day-trading account and see how much money they can make by September.A bitcoin is currently worth 81 grand – you’d get a lot of fancy summer camps for that.Do say:“We’re having a wild summer.”Don’t say:“Yeah, we’re going large at Glasto, microdosing in Mykonos, then anayahuascaretreat in Peru.

Is it too late to change course?Laura BatesTue 10 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 06.47 EDTShareEverybody knows that young women are not safe. They are not safe in the street, where 86% of those aged 18 to 24 haveexperienced sexual harassment. They are not safe at school, where 79% of young peopletold Ofstedthat sexual assault was common in their friendship groupsand almosta third of 16- to 18-year-old girlsreport experiencing “unwanted sexual touching”. They are not safe inswimming poolsor parks, or atthe beach. They are not even safe online, with the children’s safety charity theNSPCC reportingthat social media sites are “failing to protect girls from harm at every stage”.This will come as no surprise to any woman who has ever used social media. But it is particularly relevant as Meta, the operator of some of the biggest social platforms on the internet, is busily engaged in constructing awhole new world. The company is pumping billions of dollars a year into building its metaverse, a virtual world that it hopes will become the future not just of socialising, but of education, business, shopping and live events. This raises a simple question: if Meta has utterly failed to keep women and girls safe in its existing online spaces, why should we trust it with the future?Mark Zuckerberg has grandly promised: “In the metaverse, you’ll be able to do almost anything you can imagine.”It’s the sort of promise that might sound intensely appealing to some men and terrifying to most women.Indeed, the deeply immersive nature of the metaverse will make the harassment and abuse so many of us endure daily in text-based form on social media feel 100 times more real and will simultaneously make moderation 100 times more difficult. The result is a perfect storm. And I am speaking from experience, not idly speculating: I spent days in the metaverse researching my book,The New Age of Sexism.Less than two hours after I first entered the metaverse, I saw a woman’s avatar being sexually assaultedThere is no single definition of the metaverse, but most people use the term to describe a shared world in which virtual and augmented technologies allow users (represented by avatars) to interact with people, objects and environments. Most of Meta’s virtual world is accessible only to those who pay for the company’s Quest headsets, but a limited number of metaverse spaces can be accessed by any device connected to the internet. Advanced technology such as 3D positional audio, hand tracking and haptic feedback (when controllers use various vibrations to coincide with actions you take) combine to make virtual worlds feel real. Your avatar moves, speaks and gestures when you do, allowing users to interact verbally and physically.Less than two hours after I first entered the metaverse, I saw a woman’s avatar being sexually assaulted. When I approached her to ask her about the experience, she confirmed: “He came up to me and grabbed my ass.”“Does that happen a lot?” I asked.“All the time,” she replied, wearily.I used my haptic controller to “pick up” a bright-yellow marker and moved towards a giant blackboard. “HAVE YOU BEEN ASSAULTED IN THE METAVERSE?” I wrote.The response was near instantaneous. “Yeah, many times,” someone shouted.“I think everybody’s been assaulted in the damn metaverse,” one woman replied immediately, in a US accent.“Unfortunately, it is too common,” a British woman added, nodding.Both women told me they had been assaulted multiple times.During my time in the metaverse, sexual harassment and unwanted sexual comments were almost constant. I heard one player shout: “I’m dragging my balls all over your mother’s face,” to another and witnessed male players making claims about “beating off”, as well as comments about “gang bangs”. My virtual breasts were commented on repeatedly. I did not witness any action taken in response – whether by a moderator or by another player.A damningTechCrunchreportfrom 2022found that human moderators were available only in the main plaza of Meta’s metaverse game Horizon Worlds – and that they seemed more engaged in giving information on how to take a selfie than moderating user behaviour.The NSPCC said, where the means of communication was known, 47% of online grooming offences were on Meta productsMore worryingly still, I visited worlds where I saw what appeared to be young children frequently experiencing attention from adult men they did not know. In one virtual karaoke-style club, the bodies of the singers on stage were those of young women in their early 20s. But based on their voices, I would estimate that many of the girls behind the avatars were perhaps nine or 10 years old. Conversely, the voices of the men commenting on them from the audience, shouting out to them and following them offstage were often unmistakably those of adults.It is particularly incumbent on Meta to solve this problem. Of course, there are other companies, from Roblox to Microsoft, building user-generated virtual-reality gaming platforms and virtual co-working spaces. But, according to NSPCC research, while 150 apps, games and websites were used to groom children online between 2017 and 2023, where the means of communication was known, 47% of online grooming offences took place onproducts owned by Meta.These are not isolated incidents or cherry-picked horror stories. Research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that users were exposed to abusive behaviour every seven minutes in the metaverse. During 11 and a half hours recording user behaviour, the report identified100 potential violationsof Meta’s policies. This included graphic sexual content, bullying, abuse, grooming and threats of violence.View image in fullscreenA woman wearing VR goggles … Meta’s virtual world has been plagued with reports of sexual harassment and abuse.Photograph: AntonioSolano/Getty ImagesIn aseparate report, the CCDH found repeated instances of children being subjected to sexually explicit abuse and harassment, including an adult asking a young user: “Do you have a cock in your mouth?” and another adult shouting: “I don’t want to cum on you,” to a group of underage girls who explicitly told him they were minors.Since its inception, Meta’s virtual world has been plagued with reports of abuse. Users have reported being virtually groped, assaulted and raped. Researchers have also described beingvirtually stalkedin the metaverse by other players, who tail them insistently, refuse to leave them alone and even follow them into different rooms or worlds.In December 2021, a beta tester of the metaverse wrote in the officialFacebookgroup of the Horizon platform: “Not only was I groped last night, but there were other people there who supported this behaviour.”What was even more revealing than the virtual assault itself was Meta’s response. Vivek Sharma, then vice-president of Horizon at Meta, responded to the incident by tellingthe Vergeit was “absolutely unfortunate”. After Meta reviewed the incident, he claimed, it determined that the beta tester didn’t use the safety features built into Horizon Worlds, including the ability to block someone from interacting with you. “That’s good feedback still for us because I want to make [the blocking feature] trivially easy and findable,” he continued.This response was revealing. First, the euphemistic description of the event as “unfortunate”, which made it sound on a par with poor sound quality. Second, the immediate shifting of the blame and responsibility on to the person who experienced the abuse – “she should have been using certain tools to prevent it” – rather than an acknowledgment that it should have been prevented from happening in the first place. And, finally, most importantly, the description of a woman being abused online as “good feedback”.Much subsequent discourse has focused on the question of whether or not a sexual assault or rape carried out in virtual reality should be described as such; whether it might have an impact on the victims similar to a real‑life assault. But this misses the point. First, it is worth noting that the experience of being sexually harassed, assaulted or raped in the metaverse has had a profound and distressing impact on many victims.When it was revealed in 2024 that British police were investigating the virtual gang-rape of a girl below the age of 16 in the metaverse, a senior officer familiar with the casetold the media: “This child experienced psychological traumasimilar to that of someone who has been physically raped”.We can’t let tech companies off the hook because they claim the problem is too big or too unwieldy to tackleSecond, technology to make the metaverse feel physically real is developing at pace. You can already buy full-body suits that promise to “enhance your VR experience with elaborate haptic sensations”. They have sleeves, gloves and vests with dozens of different feedback points. Wearable haptic technology will bring the experience of being virtually assaulted much closer to the physical sensation of real-life victimisation. All the more reason to tackle it now, regardless of how “realistic” it is or isn’t, rather than waiting for things to get worse.But most importantly, regardless of how similar to or different from physical offline harms these forms of abuse are, what matters is that they are abusive, distressing, intimidating, degrading and offensive and that they negatively affect victims. And, as we have already seen with social media, the proliferation of such abuse will prevent women and girls from being able to fully use and benefit from new forms of technology.View image in fullscreenA 3D rendering of a metaverse city.Photograph: Kinwun/Getty ImagesIf Zuckerberg’s vision comes to fruition and the boardrooms, classrooms, operating theatres, lecture halls and meeting spaces of tomorrow exist in virtual reality, then closing those spaces off from women, girls and other marginalised groups, because of the tolerance of various forms of prejudice and abuse in the metaverse, will be devastating. If we allow this now, when the metaverse is (relatively speaking) in its infancy, we are baking inequality into the building blocks of this new world.At the time of the afore­mentioned virtual-reality rape of an underage girl, Meta said in a statement: “The kind of behaviour described has no place on our platform, which is why for all users we have an automatic protection called personal boundary, which keeps people you don’t know a few feet away from you.”Inanother incident, when a researcher experienced a virtual assault, Meta’s comment to the press was: “We want everyone using our services to have a good experience and easily find the tools that can help prevent situations like these and so we can investigate and take action.”The focus always seems to be on users finding and switching on tools to prevent harassment or reporting abuse when it does happen. It is not on preventing abuse and taking serious action against abusers.But in theCCDH researchthat identified 100 potential violations of Meta’s VR policies, just 51 of the incidents could be reported to Meta using a web form created by the platform for this purpose, because the platform refuses to examine policy violations if it cannot match them to a predefined category or username in its database.Worse, not one of those 51 reports of policy violation (including sexual harassment and grooming of minors) was acknowledged by Meta and as a result no action was taken. It’s not much good pointing to your complaints system as the solution to abuse if you don’t respond to complaints.Meta’s safety features will no doubt continue to evolve and adapt – but, once again, in a repeat of what we have already seen happen on social media, women and girls will be the canaries in the coalmines, their abuse and suffering providing companies with useful data points with which to tweak their products and increase their profits. Teenage girls’ trauma: a convenient building material.There is something incredibly depressing about all this. If we are really talking about reinventing the world here, couldn’t we push the boat out a little? Couldn’t we dare to dream of a virtual world in which those who so often face abuse are safe by design – with the prevention and eradication of abuse built in – instead of being tasked with the responsibility of protecting themselves when the abuse inevitably arises?None of this is whining or asking too much. Don’t be fooled into thinking that we are all lucky to be using Meta’s tools for nothing. We are paying for them in the tracking and harvesting of our data, our content, our photographs, our ideas and, as the metaverse develops, our hand and even eye movements. All of it can be scraped and used to train enormously powerful AI tools and predictive behavioural algorithms, access to which can then be sold to companies at gargantuan prices to help them forecast how we as consumers behave. It is not an exaggeration to say that we already pay Meta a very high price for using its platforms. And if the metaverse really does become as widely adopted and as ubiquitous in the fundamental operation of our day-to-day lives as Zuckerberg hopes, there won’t be an easy way to opt out.We can’t let tech companies off the hook because they claim the problem is too big or too unwieldy to tackle. We wouldn’t accept similar excuses for dodging regulation from international food companies, or real-life venues. And the government should be prepared to act in similar ways here, introducing regulation to require proved safety standards at the design stage, before products are rolled out to the public.“Hold on, just building the future here,” Horizon Worlds tells me as I wait to access the metaverse. As we battle to eradicate the endemic harassment and abuse that women and girls face in real-world settings, the metaverse presents a risk of slipping backwards. We are sleepwalking into virtual spaces where men’s entitlement to women’s bodies is once again widespread and normalised with near total impunity.The Guardian invited Meta to reply to this article, but the company did not respond.The New Age of Sexism: How the AI Revolution Is Reinventing Misogyny by Laura Bates is published by Simon & Schuster (£20).

Keir Starmer has not yet celebrated his first anniversary in Downing Street, but the government already moves with the plodding gait of a caretaker administration.There were painful stumbles at the start. The cut to winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners was announced within a month of the general election. Now, in the face of overwhelming opposition, it has beenlargely reversed. Meagre savings to the exchequer were procured at an exorbitant price in political capital.The early display of unsentimental cost-cutting by the chancellor was meant to show thatLabourwas serious about fiscal discipline. The legacy of Tory mismanagement – a £20bn revenue shortfall – could be cited in mitigation.Pensioners were never going to relish the confiscation of their entitlements, just as farmers were sure to complain about the loss of inheritance tax perks and businesses were unlikely to thank the chancellor for hiking their national insurance bills. But maybe some slack would be cut to an incoming government that dared to take tough decisions; maybe the memory of terrible Conservative rule was convertible into credit for their successors.The idea was to advertise Britain, under newly reliable management, as a beacon of orderliness in a chaotic world and a magnet for investment. Prudently rationed public resources would be deployed in ways that stimulate growth – upgrading transport and energy infrastructure; housebuilding. Prosperity would follow, buoying the national mood.This week’s spending review is meant to be a pivotal moment in the execution of that plan. There will be increases in capital and day-to-day spending by £113bn and £190bn respectively; well in excess of what the Tories had proposed before the election. The very opposite of austerity, the Treasury insists.Rachel Reevesboasts of “national renewal” paid as the dividend of fiscal and political stability.But Whitehalldepartments not chosen for munificence face harsh real-terms spending cuts. And the benefit of investment in new trains, homes and power stations won’t be felt for years, decades in some cases.In a more benign climate, a newish government could make a virtue of policy designed for the long term, not bending every announcement for tactical gain. But that amounts to a plea for national forbearance, urging collective sacrifice in anticipation of future reward. After years of stagnant incomes and rising bills, there isn’t much receptiveness among British voters for yet more deferral of gratification.Also, the time to get a reliable mandate for that kind of programme was before the election. The fatal flaw in Labour’s economic strategy was overestimating how much goodwill would be available to the party once it had fulfilled its electoral utility as a tool for ousting the Tories.Keir Starmer won a huge majority by making himself inoffensive to as many people as possible. The campaign started from the premise that Labour loses whenever voters think it is planning a reckless tax-and-spending spree, or suspect that its leader is a leftwing fanatic. Those threats were neutralised with ferocious discipline, but at a cost in clarity about the post-election agenda. Starmer embodied a contradiction – change without upheaval. That was bound to unravel on first contact with the reality of government.In a bygone era, Reeves’s attempt to deflect blame for painful choices on to the Tory legacy might have been more effective. There was obviously a mess to be cleared up and sometimes voters have long memories. Thewinter of discontentwas brandished in evidence to disqualify Labour from office for more than a decade. Endemic sleaze and callous neglect of the public realm in the 90s did the same for the Conservatives. Their recent reign of disrepute should impose another long period of opposition penance.It probably will, but not necessarily to Labour’s benefit. The conventional division of allegiance between two main parties is breaking down, perhaps irrevocably. Reform UK regularly leads in opinion polls. In terms of councils controlled, the Liberal Democrats areGreat Britain’s second-largest party.These might be transient trends. It isn’t unprecedented for smaller parties to capitalise on dissatisfaction with the ruling when the main opposition is still discredited and divided after recent ejection from office. In late 1981, the SDP-Liberal Alliance polled at about 50%. In a general election, 18 months later, they won 23 seats.Reform is not the first party to be led by Nigel Farage and his previous vehicles – Ukip; the Brexit party – didn’t convert their midterm menace into parliamentary seats. But that was when the Conservatives were competitive. In 2019, Farage didn’t even try to rival Boris Johnson,withdrawing more than 300 candidatesto make a Tory majority more likely.There are reasons to think the current fragmentation in party support describes a more durable shift in the structure of British politics. Reform’s ascent, mostly at the expense of the Tories, conforms to an international pattern of populists and nationalists challenging more established rightwing parties and, in the American case, swallowing the old guard whole. The moribund centre-right tradition of English conservatism doesn’t look any closer to resuscitation than the twitching corpse of the pre-Trump Republican party.Powerful social and cultural trends are driving these changes. They express a depth of frustration and disillusionment that is resistant to appeals from candidates who come across as advocates for continuity of the existing system.This helps explain Labour’s failure to sustain its status as the nation’s preferred alternative to the Tories almost as soon as the election was over. The campaign foregrounded safety and reassurance, defining change primarily as a switch of personnel at the top. In the absence of a clear agenda for the future, Starmer and Reeves ended up owning everything that is desultory about the present. In an age of endemic mistrust in politics, there was precious little benefit of the doubt to be earned. Almost overnight, Labour became just another load of politicians, sounding the same, doing unpopular stuff and making excuses for why things aren’t getting any better.That feels unfair to ministers who argue, with justification, that last autumn’s budget and Wednesday’s spending review set Britain on a path that is very different from anything the Tories had in mind. But precious months were wasted where the gap was too hard to discern, when the only visible agenda was painful tinkering with the status quo. The problem is not the trajectory now, but the shallowness of the angle where the lines diverged last July. It is the hesitancy of the steps, the stiff posture, that makes Labour look less like a fresh team with a purposeful stride, more like the familiar retread of a much longer incumbency.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next four yearsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How fortunate for Nigel Farage and ReformMarina HydeFormer party chair Zia Yusuf was out – then he was back in. But the chaos won’t dent the party’s poll ratings one tiny bitTue 10 Jun 2025 08.56 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 13.49 EDTShareIt was a busy week foron-again off-againReform chair Zia Yusuf, whose job over the past 11 months had been to reform Reform. (I know.) Zia quit on Thursday. Had his job split on Friday. Returned on Saturday. Chilled on Sunday. The job split seems to have endured though, as Yusuf will now run a UK version of Doge – as we know, the perfect role for highly emotional men – while this very morning, Nigel Farage was unveiling a new chair: Dr David Bull. David brings extensive experience with witchcraft, ghosts, spirits and beasts from his time as presenter of paranormal reality TV showMost Haunted Live, where he packaged the wailings of reekingly obvious charlatan/compelling spirit medium Derek Acorah for a studio audience. I can’t imagine what this CV could do for Reform, but Nigel Farage must have seen something in it.Derek Acorah crossed permanently to the spirit world in January 2020, but it would be nice to think that shouldn’t be a bar to his being selected as one of those Reform candidates credited with being able to make deep connections with a public that is desperately searching for something beyond the ordinary. It would certainly be a less mad development than some other of the party’s activities this week. On Monday, Farage could be found in Wales promising to reopen Port Talbot steelworks, a plan so nutso that it could only really be believed by conspiracy theorists. Jet fuelcan’t melt steel beams– and Nigel Faragecanre-melt steel furnaces that have cooled solid. Sure thing! Also, he might very well win the next election, so make of that what you will.From theRupert Lowe conflagrationto the Yusuf hokey cokey last weekend, it has to be said that the endless drama in Reform this year hasn’t dented Farage’s party’s poll ratings one tiny bit. In fact, up they climb. My theory is that at some level, people actively like it. They liked Boris Johnson’s fecklessness and chaos too – until, admittedly, they really didn’t. Still, what a run. Asdiscussed here previously, Britain is a majority nutter nation, and in recent history our deepest and most long-lasting political affections have been reserved for figures across the spectrum who had something of the nutter to them. Thatcher, Blair, Johnson … all nutters. Even Corbyn did miles better than he should have, simply by virtue of being a nutter – though he ultimately failed for not being a kindred nutter. Reform give the impression of being long and strong in nutters. “He crawled out under the wire,” twinkled Farage this morning of Yusuf’s “bid for freedom”, “but we got him back in!”“Sorry to put you all through that!” said Yusuf with a slightly strangulated smile. “I did realise the only way I was going to get a couple of days off was to resign and then come back again … I can’t thank Nigel enough for having me back. I regret those tweets, I was exhausted.” As Farage implied, this is just the sort of thing that happens when passionate people care almost too much.For decades, the deepest analysis afforded to the England football side was that they needed to play with more “passion”, and there is now a huge amount of this in the way we assess politicians. Keir Starmer, a sterile lawyer who communicates with all the vim of a recorded “see it, say it, sorted” message, does not reach the parts that need reaching. Farage speaks a more natural language, and consequently gets away with dismissing with one joke a row that would have consumed other parties’ PR machines for weeks. “Reform hit a speed bump last week,” he said in Wales of Yusuf’s resignation and unresignation. “Maybe it’s because we were driving above the recommended 20mph …”Arguably, it was ever thus. Reform keeps refreshing its moniker, but in many ways it’s still the same – like a bankrupt who changes his name each time he moves town and starts another double-glazing business. Ukip, the Brexit party, Reform – every time Nigel leads another one you hear a lot about professional revolution, but at some level they’re still the same outfit where one MEP had some altercation with another one, after whichthe latter collapsedin the European parliament. As Neil Hamilton insisted at the time, this is simply the sort of thing that happens when “passions run high”.But by far the most important part is: it doesn’t seem to matter. What’s changed in a post-Trump world is that chaos and drama can be repolished as political assets. As I say, I think the lack of discipline is part of the appeal. Discipline – what really is there to love about that word for most people? It smacks of being told off, which many have had quite enough of over the past decade of elite cultural policing. Politicians who manage rigidly conventional discipline above almost anything else have become regarded as robotic, while prodigals like Farage are polling like they’re worth laying on a fatted takeaway for.Instead of trying to counter Farage with the very conventions to which he is an adverse reaction, the two main parties should consider how unbelievably badly they’ve cocked things up that Nigel’s rolling drama seems like a good idea. “Can we do it?” wondered Dr David Bull rhetorically this morning of making Farage prime minister. “Well, to quote Bob the Builder: YES WE CAN.” Can’t help thinking it was someone other than Bob the Builder who made “yes we can” into an iconic political slogan … but – to use words which may function equally well as a Reform slogan – let’s not get bogged down in details.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

It feels as if every energy secretary in the last half-decade, facing up to the reality that most of the existing nuclear fleet will be going offline by the early 2030s, has endorsed the Suffolk plant and hailed it as marking the dawn of a new era for the industry. “A golden age for clean energy abundance,” was Ed Miliband’s version on Tuesday.The difference this time is that serious government money is being put on the table, making it possible to have confidence that Sizewell C will actually happen. A final investment decision won’t come until later in the summer, buta £14bn government commitment at this stage, taking the tally to almost £18bn, is not small change. The state’s balance sheet is being put to work; the game now is about rounding up private-sector investors to play a supporting financing role.But, for those who have followed Sizewell’s progress over the years, there was a glaring omission in the announcement. What will consumers pay for Sizewell’s electricity? Will it still be substantially cheaper in real terms than the juice that will be generated at Hinkley Point C in Somerset?The big boast about Sizewell’s relative value didn’t rest on the hopeful (but probably still reasonable) idea that lessons in construction will be learned from Hinkley’s cost overruns and delays. Rather, it was about the exciting financing model – a “regulated asset base”, or RAB, approach. Under an RAB model, investors are able to share some of a project’s construction and operating risks with consumers, so the result should be a lower cost of capital, the critical financial metric when you’re building an asset with an intended life of 60-plus years.Back in the day, there was talk of Sizewell’s electricity being priced in the £70-£75 megawatt hour range using 2012 prices for easy comparison with Hinkley, where the developer, EDF, was given an initial guaranteed strike price of £92.50 when it starts producing. The numbers aren’t exactly like for like because, under RAB, consumers also start paying during the construction phase. But you get the picture: there is supposed to be a headline figure for Sizewell’s output that is impressively lower than Hinkley’s.It wasn’t displayed during Tuesday’s razzmatazz. A benign explanation is that the government can’t talk numbers while it is still negotiating with outside investors. By way of reassurance, Miliband did at least stick to the old idea that, as Sizewell will be a replica of Hinkley, it can be built “a lot more cheaply” and will lead to “lower bills”.But precision matters. If Sizewell’s output is still being priced roughly as advertised when the project was conceived, one can raise a cheer. The country needs reliable baseload supplies and (unless you’re with the Green party) nuclear is the obvious low-carbon option. And the case is only strengthened by the fact that the cost of subsidies for offshore wind will probably rise again in this year’s renewables auction. But we still need to see the hard numbers on Sizewell.Explore more on these topicsSizewell CNils Pratley on financeNuclear powerEnergycommentShareReuse this content"

But I’m finding it surprisingly usefulTue 10 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 07.16 EDTShareAt the start of the year, a friend asked artificial intelligence how to console his 10-year-old on the death of a pet. I thought this was the most ridiculous thing ever, given that ChatGPT didn’t know the pet, or the 10-year-old. And surely the reason a pet’s death occasions such unique grief is that pets are unique, and therefore cannot be imagined by a machine. So I assumed this wouldn’t catch on – but then I have said that about every new invention, including but not limited to mobile phones, Google and Lime bikes.Now everyone uses AI for everything, and I am slowly waking up to its appeal. Anthropic’s Claude is apparently the more emotionally intelligent, but the beauty of it is that it’s never so intelligent that it would tell you to grow up, get some backbone, and stop asking stupid questions. So you can go to it with anything: “My sister is using the same conditioner as me, and now our hair smells the same, which annoys me because my nice-smelling hair is a thing people always notice about me”; “My neighbour is waging a campaign of hate against me. How can I tactfully disengage?”; “My therapist always looks really bored.”The answer always comes back: “I’m sorry this has happened to you.” And I don’t care how clever you are, it is impossible not to be cheered up by this. Sometimes, you’ll even find yourself murmuring: “Thank you, Claude, yes, ithasn’tbeen easy.” What follows is the longest imaginable answer, often with bolstering headings like: “Stand In Your Power; you chose the conditioner”. If I had a criticism, it would be that it has a preference for grasping the nettle, which often looks a lot like needless escalation. But just because it’s a computer doesn’t mean you have to listen; you can just cherrypick the bits you like and ignore the rest, in which respect it is a lot like talking to a friend.I still don’t think it will catch on, and it remains a really bad use of the world’s resources. But it’s a pleasant mini-break in a land where someone, somewhere, has all the answers.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But there’s a way to fix the problemTue 10 Jun 2025 11.05 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 13.41 EDTShareAs the world watchesDonald TrumpandElon Muskpublicly fight over the sweeping legislation moving through Congress, we should not let the drama distract us. There is something deeper afoot: unprecedented wealth concentration – and the unbridled power that comes with such wealth – has distorted our democracy and is driving societal and economic tensions.Musk, the world’s richest man, wields power no one person should have. He has used this power to elect candidates that will enact policies to protect his interests and he even bought his way into government. While at the helm of Doge, Musk dramatically reshaped the government in ways that benefit him – for instance, slashing regulatory agenciesinvestigating his businesses– and hollowed out spending to make way for tax cuts that would enrich him.Musk is just one example of the ways in which unchecked concentration of wealth is eroding US democracy and economic equality. Just 800 families in the US are collectively worth almost$7tn– a record-breaking figure that exceeds the wealth of thebottom half of the US combined.While most of us earn money through labor, these ultra-wealthy individuals let the tax code and their investments do the work for them. Under the current federal income tax system,over halfof the real-world income available to the top 0.1% of wealth-holders (those with $62m or more) goestotally untaxed. As a result, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have gotten away with payingzero dollars in federal income taxes in some years,even when their real sources of income were soaring.On the other side, millions of hard-working Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Their anxiety is growing as tariffs threaten to explode already rising costs.A broken tax code means unchecked wealth-hoarding. The numbers are staggering:$1tn of wealth was created for the 19 richest US households just last year(to put that number into perspective, that is more than the output of the entire Swiss economy). That was the largest one-year increase in wealth ever recorded. I have studied this rapidly ballooning wealth concentration, and like my colleagues who focus on democracy and governance, I am alarmed by the increasingly aggressive power wielded by a small number of ultra-wealthy individuals.The good news is, hope is not lost. We can break up this dangerous concentration of wealth by taxing billionaires. There is growing public support for doing just this, even among Republican voters. A recent Morning Consult poll found that70% of Republicansbelieved “the wealthiest Americans should pay higher taxes”, up from 62% six years ago.With many of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy set to expire this year, legislators have an opportunity to reset the balance driving dangerous wealth-hoarding. Rather than considering raising taxes on middle-class Americans or even households earning above $400,000, they must focus on the immense concentration of wealth among the very top 0.1% of Americans. This would not only break up concentrated wealth, but also generate substantial revenue.One mechanism for achieving this goal is a wealth tax on the ultra-wealthy. The Tax Policy Center recently released an analysis of a new policy called the Five & Dime tax. This proposal would impose a 5% tax on household wealth exceeding $50m and a 10% tax on household wealth over $250m. The Five & Dime tax would raise $6.8tn over 10 years, slow the rate at which the US mints new billionaires, and reduce the billionaires’ share of total US wealth from 4% to 3%.While breaking up dangerous wealth concentration is reason enough to tax billionaires, this revenue could be invested in programs that support working families and in turn boost the economy. Lawmakers could opt for high-return public investments like debt-free college, helping working families afford childcare, expanding affordable housing, rebuilding crumbling infrastructure, and strengthening climate initiatives.Ultimately, taxes on the ultra-rich could transform American society for the better andgrow the economyby discouraging unproductive financial behaviors and promoting fair competition – leading to a more dynamic and efficient system.Critics will inevitably claim such a tax would stifle economic growth or prove too challenging for the IRS to implement. But in our highly educated nation, the idea that growth and innovation comes from just a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals does not withstand scrutiny. And while there are challenges for administering any bold proposal, America has always been up for a challenge.After witnessing the consequences of billionaire governance firsthand under this administration, Americans understand what’s at stake. We are seeing how unchecked, astronomical wealth has corrupted American democracy and stifled the economy. It’s not too late to act. Now it’s time for lawmakers who care about the country’s future to embrace solutions that empower everyone, not just the few at the top.Gabriel Zucman is professor of economics at the University of California Berkeley and the Paris School of EconomicsExplore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionElon MuskDonald TrumpUS domestic policyUS taxationUS CongressUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Last week, the Reform UK MP Sarah Pochin asked the prime minister, Keir Starmer, if he planned to follow other European countries andprohibit burqas.Then the leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, called for bosses to be able toban the burqa in the workplace. Following the example of the former Labour minister Jack Straw, who in 2006sparked the first burqa debateby asking constituents at his surgeries to remove their face coverings, she stated that she does not see constituents at her surgeries if they have their faces covered, “whether it’s a burqa or a balaclava”.These comments from politicians hoping to appease rightwing voters have real repercussions for the safety of Muslim women like me. Muslim women, especially those who wear coverings ranging from the headscarf known as the hijab to the full body and face covering known as the burqa, have become a symbol in UK politics of migration and integration. They – or perhaps the perceived oppressive men in their lives – are outsiders who refuse to live by British values. When politicians call to ban the burqa, they position themselves as defenders of a way of life under threat from outside forces.The timing of this cannot be ignored.Reform, which triumphed at the recent local elections, warns in its manifesto that “unchecked migration has pushed Britain to breaking point”. The Conservatives, keen to claw back any defecting voters, have positioned themselves as equally tough on immigration and integration.When our national leaders parrot catchy soundbites such as “ban the burqa”, what they are really doing is normalising Islamophobia by making it part of mainstream political conversations. Islamophobic incidentsrose by 375%in the week after Boris Johnson called veiled Muslim women “letterboxes” in 2018.As a visibly Muslim woman, I have never felt as afraid as I do right now. Last summer’s far-right riots targeting mosques and calling for Muslims to be taken off the streets are etched into my mind. I was born in this country, it’s my home, yet I can’t shake a feeling of unease.The irony of this debacle is not lost on me. Last time I checked, Britain prided itself in not being the sort of country that told women how to dress. States that do dictate women’s clothing (see: Iran) are vilified as misogynistic and ultra-controlling: the antithesis of the enlightened, liberal west. Why, then, is it OK for the government or corporations in Britain to interfere with the autonomy of women who happen to be Muslim?Of course, some will say that face coverings are inherently misogynistic, and so banning them is about protecting Muslim women. But why should politicians get to decide what is oppressive and what isn’t, without ever really consulting us? It is disingenuous to pretend that Muslim women are uniquely prone to victimhood. Can we truthfully say anything about the way women are expected to live our lives isn’t rooted in patriarchy? Whether it’s the bikini or the push-up bra, miniskirts or high heels, as women we are conditioned to shape our identity under the watchful eye of the male gaze.But I’m sure you’ve heard all of this before, because yet again, here we are: Muslim women defending their right to choose how they exist in British society. What is really being obscured are more pressing issues: inequality, a lack of affordable housing, crumbling public services, a struggling NHS. This was as true in the early 2000s as it is now.Nadeine Asbali is a secondary school teacher in London and the author of Veiled Threat: On Being Visibly Muslim in BritainDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is also adecisive shift in energy policy. Ministers have high hopes of a nuclear energy renaissance. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, described the prospect of a new reactor in Suffolk, Sizewell C, combined with new money for modular reactor development and fusion research, as a “golden age”. This was a striking choice of words from the greenest voice in the cabinet.The Climate Change Committee’s latest advice to the government took a more restrained view of nuclear, whichdrew industryire. Mr Miliband’scommitment to renewable energyis not in doubt. The government has made good progress on wind and solar – although thecancellationof an offshore wind project was a step backwards. Nuclear is meant to complement support for renewables and speed up the transition away from gas. That, at least, is the theory, and Labour’s bet reflects a broadershift across Europe. The other part of the calculation made by ministers including Rachel Reeves – whose department made the announcement – is jobs. Sizewell C is expected to employ 10,000 people, including 1,500 apprentices.Rolls-Royce SMRhas beaten off competition to become the first business in the UK to try to build reactors out of factory-made modules. While this technology remains unproven, the UK has a stronger track record of this kind of manufacture than it does on big, site-specific infrastructure. With this vote of confidence in British business, Labour hopes to gain its own boost from voters, andtake on climate sceptics at the same time. But one need not be anti-nuclear to see that big questions remain unresolved.Costis the most obvious one, with nuclear energy far more expensive than wind – although the price of the latter is rising. Somerset’s Hinkley Point C could costdoublethe original projected price. Ministers seem convinced that things will be better in future, but it is hard to see why.Wasteand safety are the other two perennial problems with nuclear that are often downplayed. Currently, much of the UK’s existing nuclear waste is stored at Sellafield in Cumbria. But safety risks have been raised about thissite, which is not a permanent solution. Another issue is the relationship with defence and the way that investment in civil nuclear schemes can provide ahidden subsidy to the military. A further question is the role of tech companies. The initial decision to invest in small modular reactors (SMRs) appeared to coincide withefforts to court AI businesses. Datacentres’ seemingly unlimited appetite for power has also spurredDonald Trumpto throw his weight behind new nuclear.In a climate emergency, there is a case for nuclear energy as part of a decarbonised energy system. But nuclear alone won’t deliver net zero; it must be part of a wider, coherent strategy that includes energy efficiency and renewables. Ministers must, for example, have stricter green building rules to get to net zero. The Tories’ lax approach to regulation, despite their commitment to a legally binding climate target, was shameful. What is clear is that ministers need to explain this week’s decisions in more detail than they have so far.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There is evidence of large-scale looting, but the real scandal is that the theft appears legal, systemic and driven by foreign interests. In a paper presented to the Association for Heterodox Economicsconferencein London later this month, Andrew Fischer of Erasmus University Rotterdam argues that Zambia’s economy is not being plundered by domestic actors but rather by transnational corporate practices enabled by opaque accounting. His findings point to a staggering extraction of wealth that dwarfs the value of the aid intended to help.Zambia is blessed – or perhaps cursed – with mineral wealth. It is Africa’s second-largest copper producer. The metal, key to the green energy transition, accounts for around 70% of the country’s export earnings. Despite this, in 2020 Zambia became Africa’s first pandemic-era defaulter. It has only just agreed a debtrestructuringwith major creditors. How did a nation so rich in natural resources become so poor? Prof Fischer says this is atextbook exampleof a low-income commodity exporter shaped by foreign capital, where export booms enrich multinationals rather than the country itself. In Zambia’s case, copper may bring in foreign exchange, but much of that money simply flows straight back out.His most striking discovery is the scale and concealment of capital flight. He uncovered billions flowing out of Zambia, hidden in its balance-of-payments data. These were not flagged as “errors and omissions” but obscured in entries considered too elaborate to probe. In2021 alone, $5bn– about 20% of GDP – vanished offshore, just as Zambia was defaulting on its debt. This was in addition to profit remittances of $1.2bn. In contrast, US annual grant aid amounted to just $250m, or 1% of Zambia’s GDP. It’s a sobering difference between a trickle of assistance against a torrent of extraction.Prof Fischerlinksthe outflows to mining giants dominating Zambia’s economy. These firms invested billions from abroad to fund operations, but the money left almost as soon as it arrived. What looked like foreign direct investment during last decade’s mining boom masked a deeper drain: profits repatriated through financial outflows. The numbers areextraordinarilylarge for Zambia: more than $5bn in 2012, $3bn in 2015, and nearly $2bn in 2017. These private sector flows were beyond public scrutiny.Mining companies have long beenaccusedof dodgingtaxesin Zambia. In 2018 the tax authorities slapped an$8bn tax billon the Canadian mining company First Quantum Minerals, which later reportedly settled for$23m.Glencore, an Anglo-Swiss giant, left the country in 2021 after falling out with the authorities. Yet in2023half of Zambia’s copper was exported to Switzerland – that is, bought and sold by Swiss commodity traders like Glencore. AcademicsRita Kesselring and Gregor Doblernoted in 2019 that such firms exploit transfer pricing and a lack of transparency to shift profits abroad.Prof Fischer’s research similarly points tolegal mechanismsembedded in world commerce. He concedes that some outflows may involve wealthy Zambians, but questions whether they could move funds on this scale and complexity. His research exposes a form of wilful blindness. If transnational corporations can legally strip Zambia of its wealth while donors look the other way, then the real scandal isn’t theft. It’s the global economic system itself.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Was a backlash inevitable, and are new tactics needed?ByGaby HinsliffTue 10 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 11.03 EDTShareInside a coffin-like glass box lies the figure of a man, his face streaked with scarlet paint. Above it a video plays on loop, showing the afternoon in June 2020 when an exuberant crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters yanked this statue of the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston from its plinth near Bristol harbour and rolled it triumphantly into the water. Five years on from that cathartic execution, the graffiti-smeared statue occupies the far end of theexhibition on protestat the city’s M Shed museum, in a thicket of placards left behind by the departing crowd. Their slogans – “Silence is violence”; “Racism is a dangerous pandemic too” – evoke the radicalism of a summer that already feels oddly consigned to history, when frustration erupted on to the streets but never quite seemed to be channelled into lasting change.The museum leads visitors to Colston via older stories of resistance figures, once considered shockingly radical but now celebrated without question: Theresa Garnett, the suffragette who brandished a horsewhip at Winston Churchill at Bristol Temple Meads station, or the heroes of the 1963Bristol bus boycott,who walked to work in protest against the bus company’s refusal to hire black drivers (and helped pave the way for the 1965 Race Relations Act). But the legacy of protests at the modern end of the gallery, where the statue lies sandwiched between exhibits on Extinction Rebellion and Occupy, remains, for now, more contested.Trying to clarify what the UK public understands by the perennially slippery term “woke”, in 2022 the pollsters YouGov asked respondents how well it fitted various contemporary causes. The highest match – above trans rights, no-platforming people whose opinions you dislike, stronger action on climate change and the Black Lives Matter movement itself – was with removing historical statues associated with slavery, like that of Colston. Something about this combination of direct action against a highly symbolic target, and revisiting history through a modern social justice lens, meant that 61% considered it woke.For some, that was perhaps a compliment. But by 2022, a word briefly synonymous with enlightened liberal consciousness – borrowed from a phrase used as far back as the 1930s by black Americans, urging each other to “stay woke’” to the threat of racial violence – was already becoming what the then Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeoncalled“a pejorative term of abuse”.The narrative that woke ultimately ate itself, becoming so shrill, sanctimonious and yet simultaneously brittle that a backlash was almost inevitable, has been building ever since it became clear Donald Trump was on course to win a second presidential term. Britain, with its newly elected Labour government, initially seemed sheltered from the prevailing winds. While corporate America scrambled to ditch diversity policies following Trump’s victory,only 11% of British firmssurveyed by the Institute of Directors planned similar changes.View image in fullscreenProtesters surround the statue of Edward Colston after pulling it down during a Black Lives Matter rally, Bristol Harbourside, 7 June 2020.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PABut then came April’s supreme court ruling that “woman” for the purposes of equality law meant “biological woman”, rolling back trans people’s access to sex-segregated spaces. In May’s local elections, Reform party candidates campaigned on promises to sack council diversity officers and block what the party’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, calls “net zero wokery”. Keir Starmer, who five years ago tookthe knee for Black Lives Matter and posted “trans rights are human rights” on Facebook, now leads a government arguing that unchecked migration did “incalculable damage” and advising trans women to use men’s toilets.In parts of the radical left, meanwhile, woke stands accusedof undermining traditional class-based collective struggle with its emphasis on individual identities. The journalist Ash Sarkar, who rose to prominence as a Corbynite activist, describes in her new book Minority Rule hosting an event in 2023 with Extinction Rebellion co-founder Roger Hallam, where he was asked what the left was getting wrong. When he responded that it was because “you’re all being fucking cunts”, Sarkar writes, uproar ensued. One activist declared herself terrified by “the ‘white anger’ in the room”, while another said Hallam had “brought violence” into the space and “everyone had been harmed”. Sarkar was left wondering how people who couldn’t cope with a sweary climate campaigner envisaged leading a revolution. In a round of subsequent book publicity interviews, shesuggestedthat she had moved on from a youthful phase where, “You could point at a floor lamp and be like, ‘neocolonial ideology’.”On all sides, woke has become shorthand less for a set of widely accepted liberal beliefs – few people today would put a slaver on a pedestal – than an associated style of highly online activism, seen as prone to denouncing opponents as morally evil, engaging in competitive victimhood and favouring performative protest over practical change.After four white protesters successfully defended themselves against criminal charges over the Colston statue’s downfall, arguing that Bristol’s then mayor, Marvin Rees, should have done more to remove it legally, Rees – who is of Jamaican heritage – responded by asking whether four black defendants would have been similarly acquitted. If not, he argued in a statement now hung on the wall at M Shed, “then what we saw was an exercise in middle-class white privilege, alongside a declaration of anti-racism”. While symbolic acts could be catalysts for change, he added, without concrete action “they can be more about satisfying the immediate emotional needs of members of privileged groups than about changing the actual political and economic status of people in oppressed groups”. Though over half the Bristol residents and visitors surveyed by M Shed felt positive about Colston falling, perhaps the most tangible legacy of its downfall waslonger sentences for people defacing memorials, rather than changes to the material conditions of black Britons’ lives.Did woke really go too far, or in some ways not far enough? And are there still ways of successfully advancing progressive causes, even in a time of backlash that is frightening for many?Luke Tryl is looking forward to a weekend tending his roof garden when I call. Now in his late 30s, he cut his teeth campaigning for equal marriage at Stonewall, before advising the Conservative equalities minister Nicky Morgan. These days, he runs the cross-party More in Common thinktank, which was founded in memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox to seek common ground in an increasingly polarised world.“Stop acting like being willing to work with Nazis is a fucking virtue, you creep,” was one of the more printable insults the mild-mannered Tryl and his co-author, Ed Hodgson, received on the social media platform Bluesky in February, for publishing a report suggesting that progressive zeal is sometimes its own worst enemy. More in Common’s polling divides the public into seven political tribes, from Established Liberals (affluent centrists) to Loyal Nationalists (typical “red wall” voters) whose views it then tracks in depth. Thesubject of that particular reportwas the Progressive Activist group, a close match for what Conservative politician Suella Braverman once called “Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati”. Though only around one in 10 of the population, Progressive Activists punch above their weight in national conversations by being well-educated, highly engaged – they’re four times as likely as the general population to post political content on social media – and driven to change the world. Five times as likely as other groups to say “woke” was positive for society, they are its beating heart.Pinker’s progress: the celebrity scientist at the centre of the culture warsRead more“Civil society, campaigning, large parts of the civil service – they wouldn’t function without Progressive Activists. These are people prepared to give up big salaries and other perks of the job [for the cause]; they really do care,” says Tryl. “If you ask people about lots of the changes that have been driven by Progressive Activists, they’re ranked high on the list of things the British people say they’re proudest of: advances in women’s rights and gay rights, reductions in outright racism. They make change happen.” Though they would be wise to heed any lessons from the Democrats’ defeat in last year’s presidential election, he says, it would be a mistake to throw the progressive baby out with the bathwater: “There’s a danger that the pendulum will swing too far the other way and get rid of a whole load of stuff that the public actually supports.”Yet Progressive Activists’ fatal flaw, the report argues, is that they’re further from mainstream public opinion on cultural issues than they realise. They’re the only group where a majority thinks that immigration should be as high or higher than it is now, and that protecting people from hate speech matters more than defending free speech (a key rationale behind “no debate” – the idea that trans identities aren’t up for discussion – and “no platforming”). They’re also the group most likely to think social change sometimes requires breaking the law, whereas two-thirds of Britons disapprove of protesters blocking roads or gluing themselves to things.Tryl stresses that being outliers doesn’t invariably make Progressive Activists wrong – perhaps they’re just ahead of the curve, as the suffragettes once were – but it has important tactical implications. His polling shows that Progressive Activists overestimate by a factor of two to three how much others agree with their core beliefs, from abolishing the monarchy to letting children change gender. Consequently they tend to invest too little time on persuasion, focusing instead on mobilising the masses they wrongly imagine are on board. “If you’re reaching out to people, then you’re watering down,” is how Tryl describes this mindset.While successful campaigns usually build the broadest base possible, Progressive Activists also tend to be purists, rejecting supporters who don’t endorse a complete worldview. (More than a quarter wouldn’t campaign alongside someone who believes – as a majority of Britons do – in Israel’s right to exist, for example.) Their yearning for grand systemic change means they can sound dismissive of other people’s small but well-meaning efforts, and they’re also unusually keen on correcting other people’s “mistakes” on diversity issues, something other groups consider likely to cause embarrassment.Core to woke philosophy is what is sometimes called “systemic thinking”, or the idea that society consists of overlapping systems of oppression, fromcapitalismtopatriarchy, which we are socialised not to notice and to which we must be awoken by unpacking the power dynamics hidden in everyday interactions – between men and women, say, or people of different races. Pointing out undercurrents others have missed is therefore very important to progressives – they genuinely think it’s helpful, Tryl says – but not everyone shares their enthusiasm for what quickly descended, in the gladiatorial arena of late-2010s Twitter, into pile-ons and point-scoring: “There’s a group of people who come from a position of ‘I have some questions about this’, but everyone shouts at them, and they become radicalised the other way.”View image in fullscreenFormer home secretary Suella Braverman in 2023. She described some activists as ‘Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati’.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesIronically, given its emphasis on inclusion, there was also one hidden power dynamic that “woke” too often seemed to miss in those heady early days. Class, as defined by education level, is now a biggerdividing linethan race in US politics, and a key predictor of Reform’s success in Britain. Were activists who scolded critics to “educate yourself” or “do the reading”, while speaking the language of undergraduate sociology essays, always likely to grate on the two-thirds of British adults who don’t have degrees?Three years ago, a former Labour party press officer called Chris Clarkepublished a report for the thinktank Progressive Britain, arguing that the way progressives talk may, in part, explain why British liberal parties kept losing elections. Populists such as Trump or the Vote Leave campaign under Dominic Cummings use simple, direct, verb-based language (“build a wall”, “take back control”), which ignores nuances and doesn’t necessarily hold water as policy, but which anyone can follow. Progressive activists, however, sometimes favour more complex, “systemic” language involving mental leaps that aren’t immediately obvious. Slogans such as “global warming is racism” – on the grounds that emissions from (mostly white) big economies disproportionately harm (mostly non-white) developing countries – may sound like pure word salad to those unfamiliar with this style of reasoning, even if they might agree with the underlying principles. British progressives, Clarke tells me, need to spend more time explaining what they actually mean in simple terms, rather than assuming everyone who balks at an unfamiliar argument is a bigot. “My final conclusion was about the importance of joining the dots – making arguments that break it down for people, and which don’t assume the worst of those who don’t buy it.”The less jargon, meanwhile, the better. Two-thirds of Britons can’t even confidently define “net zero”, Tryl says. Support for the policy rises 14 points when it’s explained as “balancing emissions”, which sounds more achievable to people who otherwise think they’re being asked to eradicate all carbon use. The phrase “white privilege” raises hackles in his focus groups – white people typically say they’ve never personally felt privileged – but also, more surprisingly, divides non-white voters too. In a 2021 survey by the racial equality thinktank British Future, 70% of ethnic minority respondents agreed that “it’s easier to get ahead if you are white” but only 59% agreed “there is white privilege in Britain”. Even some big institutions are deterred from talking about racism by confusion over unfamiliar terminology, British Future’s director, Sunder Katwala, told me: “Language anxiety is a tax on having conversations that are overdue.” But it’s also, perhaps, a potential tax on supporters’ patience.Chris Clarke worked for Labour in South Thanet during Farage’s 2015 attempt to win the seat and still winces at the memory of calling it a “poor area” needing investment in front of a voter, before worrying that “poor” was offensive and stumbling through various euphemisms – deprived, less affluent – while the man stared incredulously. By striving to say the right thing, he had simply sounded weird. Clarke remembered that conversation, years later, when listening to Starmer struggle to explain why men can have cervixes.Wrapped up warmly against the winter chill, a gaggle of students holding cardboard signs chants: “1-2-3-4, kick the bigots out the door.” Outside, the pink-haired young organiser of the protest declares that no university should be platforming “views that will make it that trans people end up being killed”.It could be any one of multiple British campus protests, but this is neither the University of Sussex – recentlyfined £585,000by university regulatorsfor failing to protect the free speech of gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock – nor the University of Edinburgh, where pro-trans activists blocked the screening of a documentary they deemed transphobic.TheJanuary 2023 footage is from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and I watched it after listening to the target of the protest explain why, if anything, it only entrenched his views.Robert Wintemute is professor of human rights law at King’s College London, a gay man who worked for decades on anti-discrimination test cases and helped draft the so-called“Yogyakarta Principles”, a founding statement of the campaign for self-identification, or the right for trans people to gain legal recognition in their preferred sexual orientation or gender identity without requiring a doctor’s diagnosis of gender dysphoria. In a 2005 book, he argued that LGB people had “a moral duty to speak out” for the T. His new book, Transgender Rights vs Women’s Rights: From Conflicts to Co-Existence, explains why he changed his mind.Wintemute was teaching a summer school in 2018 when a student asked why, in law, a married person who transitions must seek their spouse’s consent to remain in what would become a same-sex marriage. When Wintemute said the rationale was protecting the spouse’s rights, he was challenged by a trans student who, he says, walked out when the professor said that trans rights don’t trump all others in law. This student, he writes, “did not seem to have considered that non-transgender peoplehavehuman rights”.Wintemute wondered if he had dismissed some women’s concerns about self-ID too quickly. But when he began voicing doubts publicly, a Brussels-based gay rights group for whom he had long done legal work responded by cutting professional ties. “I said, ‘But I don’t work on these rights for you, can’t we agree to disagree?’ But no. It was all or nothing,” Wintemute recalls. For a lawyer used to testing arguments, the “no debate” approach seemed suspicious. “You think the other side’s arguments must be weak if they’re not willing to present them.”Ostracised by old allies, Wintemute started speaking at events organised by the LGB Alliance, a group formed to oppose Stonewall’s 2015 adoption of trans alongside lesbian, gay and bisexual rights. (Though some trans activists consider the Alliance as a hate group, alegal bidby the trans group Mermaids to block its registration as a charity failed in 2023.) It was a lecture Wintemute planned to give in Montreal, on this concept of “divorcing the LGB from the T”, that sparked first an open letter accusing the university of “actively contributing to the genocide of trans people” by hosting him, and then a full-fledged protest. On the day, Wintemute remembers arriving to a chorus of: “Fuck your system, fuckyour hate! Trans rights are not up for debate!” The lecture was abandoned after protesters broke into the room and threw flour.But if the aim was to shut him up, he says, it backfired: TV interviews he gave about the fracas reached more people via YouTube than the lecture would have, and six days later, publishers accepted his book proposal. He wasn’t silenced, but amplified, and if anything encouraged to double down. These days, he argues that perhaps there shouldn’t even be a right to legally change sex on birth certificates and passports. Perhaps you consider this view extreme enough to justify his attempted cancellation, but it is one shared by a startling 50% of the British public,according to the authoritative British Social Attitudes survey.What makes Wintemute’s journey from sympathy with self-ID to hostility towards it worth studying is that it mirrors a strikingly rapid broader shift in public opinion. In 2016, the year a cross-party Commons committee first backed self-ID, the survey found 58% of Britons supported the right to change legal sex and only 17% admitted feeling prejudice against trans people. Within a year, the then prime minister, Theresa May, promised to consult on reforming gender recognition.View image in fullscreenA demonstration in support of trans rights in London, 19 April 2025.Photograph: James Willoughby/Sopa Images/Rex/ShutterstockBut by 2022, the British Social Attitudes survey found public backing for the legal right to change sex had almost halved and admissions of anti-trans prejudice almost doubled, at a time when public opinion became more liberal on other social issues. Though some will blame the press or politicians for stoking a backlash – and More in Common’s report explicitly acknowledges that media outlets can “play a role in fomenting different viewpoints” over culture war issues – Stonewall has historically won gay rights victories in the teeth of a more overtly homophobic tabloid press.In retrospect, Stonewall seemingly fell into the trap – identified by More in Common – of overestimating how mainstream its views were, while gender-critical feminist organisations such as Woman’s Place UK focused on persuading the wavering via open public meetings. Jubilant at what seemed an easy victory on self-ID,Stonewall had adopted a“trans women are women, get over it”stance,declaring that, while willing to engage in debates that furthered understanding, “we do not and will not” acknowledge any conflict between trans rights and women’s sex-based rights. (Some activists insisted it wastransphobic even to say conflict existed, for example over access to domestic violence refuges, though the Equality Act 2010 explicitly anticipates such conflicts.)But refusing to answer difficult questions did not make them go away. Instead they were ultimately settled in the courts, where gender-critical feminists won a string of victories culminating at the supreme court earlier this year. A campaign for self-ID initially enjoying cross-party support had somehow ended not just in defeat but in reverse, with trans people losing hard-won access (at least on the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s interpretation of the ruling) to everything from grassroots sport to public toilets.The man tasked with picking up the pieces is Stonewall’s new CEO Simon Blake. A 51-year-old veteran of the early 2000s battle to repeal Section 28 (which once banned teachers from “promoting” the idea that homosexuality is acceptable), Blake is signalling a return to the more persuasive, gradualist campaigning style of those years. “What I have been really interested in is how much we used to know that you had to win hearts and minds, that you had to have the conversations, that you had to go into places where people didn’t like you, and it was one step at a time,” he says over Zoom. “When I was at the National Union of Students [as chief executive], one of the things which was very different for me generationally was the ‘I’m not going to educate you, Google it’ thing. And you don’t win hearts and minds by saying ‘Google it’.” Campaigns need, he argues, to regain a human touch.“The other bit for me which is different – and that doesn’t mean it’s wrong – is that sense of you’re either 100% or you’re 100% against.” Most people are more complicated than that, Blake says: “We might absolutely support everybody’s rights and freedoms, but we might have some questions that we don’t understand, and some of the things that people don’t understand are where the heat has come in.” That said, he is clear that “conversation has to be respectful”: the sheer hostility trans people often encountered when they did engage was the reason so many retreated into “no debate”.Frustrating as some may find it, Blake also notes that Stonewall victories were often won incrementally and that cultural change can lag behind the legislative kind. The gay age of consent, for example, fell from 21 to 18 in 1994, before dropping to 16 in England, Scotland and Wales in 2000. “Despite the progress we’ve made over the last 20 years, we mustn’t kid ourselves that we’re further along than we are,” says Blake.If Martin Luther King Jr was right that the arc of the moral universe ultimately bends towards justice, then that arc is often interrupted by backlashes and setbacks. When asked for examples of progressive movements that have successfully overcome such challenges, Luke Tryl cites climate campaigners. “Even when things are going the right way, they’re always conscious of losing it – they’re always looking and thinking, ‘OK, that went wrong. Learn and reflect.’” Coincidentally or not, net zero is the “woke” cause to which Starmer has so far stuck most closely while under fire.Joss Garman was 16 when he was first arrested, trying to break into a US airbase. The outgoing director of the European Climate Foundation is still probably best known as the founder of the eco-protest groupPlane Stupid, the Just Stop Oil of its day, which organised sit-ins on airport runways to protest expansion and disrupted aviation industry conferences by setting off rape alarms. But two decades on, Garman thinks the need for protests to shock the public into action on climate is waning.“I do feel there’s still a role for activists to take an issue that’snoton the agenda and put it up there, but I just don’t think that’s where we are with climate now,” he says. “The issue is whether there’s any trust in government or business to deliver solutions that are going to work.” He points out that the red wall voters over whom Downing Street frets are as worried about the planet as anyone else, but potentially more sceptical about politics. “The big proclamations about how this is going to deliver millions of jobs – they’ve heard it all before. People need to actually see and feel the changes.” If explaining how renewables could cut low-earning families’ energy bills seems humdrum compared to stopping traffic, his hunch is it’s more important.Protests can, of course, serve many legitimate purposes beyond changing minds: they can be about inspiring solidarity between activists, expressing high emotion, building resistance (or even starting a revolution). But is the charge levelled against woke – that some of its protests turned potential supporters against them – fair? In an intriguing experiment for the not-for-profit public research initiative Persuasion UK, director Steve Akehurst showed respondents videos of five different climate-related incidents: Just Stop Oil activists spraying paint over the News International building and throwing soup at a Vincent van Gogh painting; Insulate Britain’s road-blocking protest; and Extinction Rebellion’s oil refinery blockade, as well as its more carnivalesque 2019 protest involving parking a big pink boat at Oxford Circus. Akehurst then asked respondents about their views on the climate crisis and compared their answers to those of a control group who were not shown the videos.After watching the soup-throwing and road-blocking videos, viewers became actively more hostile to the protesters’ cause than non-viewers, suggesting these actions may have triggered a backlash. But, intriguingly, viewers of the paint-spraying at News International and the pink boat at Oxford Circus were nudged towards the cause. Akehurst’s conclusion was that protests need an easily understood “villain”, not a painting whose connection with fossil fuels is far from obvious, and to avoid inconveniencing ordinary people just trying to get to work.Garman argues that climate campaigners have made progress in part by building coalitions broad enough to survive changes in the political weather, a lesson learned after David Cameron’s sudden 2013 decision to “cut the green crap” amid Tory fears that his environmental policies were unpopular. “Quite a lot of the climate community has gone out of their way to try to work with Conservatives, work with farmers, work with trade unions,” says Garman.View image in fullscreenJust Stop Oil activists glue themselves to the frame of John Constable’s The Hay Wain, at the National Gallery in London, 4 July 2022.Photograph: Carlos Jasso/AFP/Getty ImagesThat doesn’t, he argues, necessarily always mean selling out. When Labour lost the 2023 Uxbridge byelection, prompting furious debate over whether London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s expansion of his Ulez clean-air charging zone to the borough had backfired, Garman warned on his Substack newsletter that climate campaigners “need to make sure we don’t do stupid shit” at a time when many households are on painfully tight budgets. Yet a year later, Khan was triumphantly re-elected, while Tory attempts to build on the idea of a “woke” war on motorists failed to save them at the general election.The moral is that environmentalists can take risks where they’re sure support runs deep enough, Garman argues: “The extent to which there’s investment in and focus on building public support, that’s the thing that enables us to make so much progress.” His new project is a climate thinktank designed to respond to an era of populist politics, tight budgets and renewed emphasis on energy security.It reflects growing interest within the climate movement in focusing on what Roger Harding, co-director of the small eco-charity Round Our Way, calls “working-class, red wall voters who are not about to become vegan anytime soon” but still worry about the planet. It’s an audience he knows well, having grown up in a lone-parent family with little time to spare for high politics. Round Our Way aims to focus on practical climate impacts people notice in their own back yards, from persistent flooding of local football pitches to rising food costs, aiming to build support from the grassroots up.Both these efforts, and Simon Blake’s at Stonewall, are first responses to questions about the future of progressive movements for which nobody yet has all the answers. But they are attempts to heed the warning lights flashing on the dashboard; to adapt, and survive.“It’s not, ‘How far can we turn the clock back?’ We do want to acknowledge some good things happened,” as British Future’s Sunder Katwala puts it. “I think there’s still a broad consensus for doing diversity and equality well. But it’s a chance to sort the wheat from the chaff.” To be woke was, after all, originally to be vigilant: ever watchful to existential threat, no matter what shape it takes.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readProtestClimate crisisRaceTransgenderActivismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He wanted a response after the lacklustre performance against Andorra in Barcelona on Saturday, albeit in a1-0 World Cup qualifying win. What he got was another line to his brow, plenty to ponder as he begins what could be a long summer debrief. And more boos.There was a bit of zip and personality from Tuchel’s team in the final 25 minutes of regulation time. He made attacking changes, with the Nottingham Forest midfielder, Morgan Gibbs-White – on his home ground – showing up. Eberechi Eze, who played from the start, was good. Morgan Rogers came on up front for Harry Kane, who had givenEnglandan early lead, and there was some pace and energy.England v Senegal: men’s international football friendly – liveRead moreThe problem was that Senegal were 2-1 up by then, having played around and through England far too easily. They were much the better team in the first half, Ismaïla Sarr’s equaliser scant reward for their efforts. The faultlines were pronounced for England at the back; it was a particularly uncomfortable evening for the full-backs, Kyle Walker and Myles Lewis-Skelly. The build-ups from the back were tough to watch. There was an overall timidity.England looked as though they might escape with a draw in this friendly when Jude Bellingham, who came off the bench, took a touch on his thigh before lashing home in the 83rd minute after Levi Colwill had smuggled a corner towards him. That would be scrubbed out when the VAR spotted the ball had come off Colwill’s upper arm.Tuchel went for broke, introducing Ivan Toney for Lewis-Skelly and switching to three at the back. But Senegal had continued to advertise their threat on the counter and with England now leaving the back door open, they stormed through it in stoppage time. Curtis Jones, another England replacement, was dispossessed by Idrissa Gueye and Lamine Camara’s pass was weighted for the substitute, Cheikh Sabaly, to sweep home.Quick GuideRoundup: Depay leads Dutch rout of MaltaShowMemphis Depay equalled Robin van Persie as theNetherlands' all-time leading men's goalscorer with a double in their World Cup qualifying 8-0 rout ofMalta. Depay opened the scoring from the penalty spot and then moved level with Van Persie on 50 goals with his strike just after the 15-minute mark in Groningen. Subsitute Donyell Malen struck twice with Virgil van Dijk, Xavi Simons, Noa Lang and Micky van de Ven also on target.Elsewhere in Group G,FinlanddefeatedPoland2-1 in a game with a lengthy break due to a medical emergency in the crowd, with one supporter taken to hospital in Helsinki. Joel Pohjanpalo scored a penalty and Benjamin Kallman came off the bench to net, with Arsenal's Jakub Kiwior pulling one back. Poland were without Robert Lewandowski, who has withdrawn from international duty after being stripped of the captaincy by the head coach, Michal Probierz.In Group H,Austriaswept aside minnowsSan Marino4-0 thanks to a double from Marko Arnautovic, with Michael Gregoritsch and Christoph Baumgartner also on target in Serravalle. Arnautovic missed out on a hat-trick after his late penalty was saved by Edoardo Colombo. In Bucharest, Florin Tanase and Dennis Man both struck just before half-time asRomaniadefeatedCyprus2-0.In Group K, England's rivalsSerbiaclaimed a 3-0 win overAndorrain Leskovac thanks to an Aleksandar Mitrovic hat-trick, adding a second-half penalty to his two first-half goals.LatviaheldAlbaniato a 1-1 draw in Riga, Latvia's Antonijs Cernomordijs scoring for both teams and Janis Ikaunieks missing a penalty.Isaac Price made the difference at both ends as 10-manNorthern Irelandheld on for a 1-0 friendly win over Iceland. The West Brom midfielder put Northern Ireland ahead, bending his shot into the bottom corner after the referee had played a helpful advantage. After Brodie Spencer was sent off  in the second half, Price cleared Andri Gudjohnsen's header off the line, before goalkeeper Pierce Charles kept out Isak Johannesson's header in stoppage time.Max O'Leary marked his long-awaitedRepublic of Irelanddebut with two vital saves to spare his team's blushes inLuxembourg. The 28-year-old Bristol City keeper denied Danel Sinani and substitute Vincent Thill either side of half-time, while the Ireland captain Nathan Collins headed against the post and substitute Jack Taylor blasted against the bar as the friendly ended goalless.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It was the prompt for thousands of home supporters to stream for the exits, the full-time whistle bringing jeers from those that stayed. “Disgraceful,” bellowed one fan close to the press box. Never before have England lost to an African nation. Has Tuchel had a honeymoon period? It is hard to say, given the opposition in some quarters to his appointment. If he has, it is 100% over.Tuchel wanted Senegal to come and play. No 5-4-1 Andorra-style low block, bus parked, handbrake on. He expects his England team to raise their level significantly against the better opponents. Which for long spells, did not happen.Senegal played. There was a moment early on when the quicksilver Iliman Ndiaye streaked away from Lewis-Skelly up the right before tricking inside Conor Gallagher and playing in Nicolas Jackson with a reverse pass. It was a clear chance for Jackson, who blasted too close to Dean Henderson. The tone was set.Can a visiting team start too well? Camara was certainly emboldened to try a fancy spin on the edge of his own defensive third and when he was robbed by Eze, who played as a No 10-cum-second striker, Senegal were stretched. Eze went left to Gallagher, who went left again for Anthony Gordon, who shot low. Édouard Mendy made a hash of the save. Kane was alive to the rebound.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane pounces to score past Édouard Mendy and put England ahead.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersIt was a weird first-half performance from England. They were static and predictable when they attempted to play out. Where were the options? Tuchel wants time to instil them. He does not have it. England played with fire as Senegal brought the press. Tuchel’s men made errors on the ball. They went down, at times, desperately appealing for fouls. It was tough to watch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sarr made up three yards on Walker, which really should not have happened, while Jackson had run away from the England debutant, Trevoh Chalobah, on to a ball over the top. Senegal had other flickers in the first half. Sarr was left alone to work Henderson with a header and Gueye did likewise when he shot through a crowd.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr celebrates his equaliser as England players look forlorn.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PATuchel had demanded energy, exuberance. It was Senegal who continued to bring it after the restart. There was a reason why Tuchel introduced Gibbs-White just before the hour. The crowd needed a lift. So did England. By then, Senegal might have been ahead, Habib Diarra lifting high following an El Hadji Malick Diouf cross.It was no surprise when Senegal took the lead. Lewis-Skelly was caught out by Kalidou Koulibaly’s ball up the inside right channel and Diarra was away, England wide open. The finish was steered through Henderson’s legs.Gibbs-White was positive while Eze came alive as England tried to respond. There was an outrageous touch and layoff from the latter for Gibbs-White, who drilled too close to Mendy. The pair also combined to tee up Bukayo Saka; his shot was brilliantly saved by the goalkeeper. For a moment, it appeared that Bellingham would be England’s saviour. Instead, Sabaly would twist the knife.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEnglandSenegal football teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But having been intended for both, Lord’s finally gets its chance this week, the defending champions Australia taking on South Africa for the right to lift the oversized Chupa Chup that is the ICC Test Championship Mace.This will probably prompt eyerolls in some territories, even if June ruled out a fair number of them from acting as hosts. Another argument in favour of Lord’s is the ground’s history and prestige coupled with London’s diversity. Despite England not making the final, likewise India and their jet- set supporters, the first four days in St John’s Wood are sold out. Where else in the world could guarantee this turnout for a “neutral” final?We may find out in time, with Jay Shah, the chair of the InternationalCricketCouncil, having stated a desire to move the final elsewhere (and almost certainly to India, one can surmise). But for the next five days – six if a reserve day is triggered by weather – it is the self-styled Home of Cricket that serves as the backdrop for what, in theory, is the pinnacle of the sport’s most storied format.Bavuma says ‘eye-opening’ defeat by Australia inspired South Africa Test transformationRead moreAnd in practice? That is where things get complicated. Only last week,Virat Kohli won the Indian Premier Leagueand immediately placed it “five levels” below anything he had achieved in Test cricket. Given Kohli’s status as the most successful captain in India’s history and trend-settinggalactico, it should follow that the final this week – a match with a cheque worth £2.6m waiting for the victors – is the most important fixture in cricket’s overstuffed calendar.Yet for all the joy ofNew Zealand’s underdog triumphin 2021, orAustralia two yearslater, the WTC final is still to receive this kind of billing. Even this time around there is a case to say that the most impressive feat witnessed during the two-year cycle involved a couple teams who did not make it this far.Whether it is Pat Cummins or Temba Bavumaholding the mace aloft at the end of the week, New Zealand ending 12 years of Indian home dominance last November – storming that spin-heavy citadel for a 3-0 sweep – probably surpasses it.But then perhaps this is missing the point of the WTC. Individual series wins can still sparkle in isolation and to know the best Test team in the world at any point in time, there are rankings available (rankings that currently have Australia in first ahead of England). Instead, its final is about the jeopardy of a one-off shot at silverware, the agony and the ecstasy of high-stakes cricket, and, perhaps more importantly, the journey that saw nine teams whittled down to two.View image in fullscreenNew Zealand hold aloft the World Test mace after beating India in the 2021 final.Photograph: Gareth Copley-ICC/ICC/Getty ImagesIt is here where the detractors pipe up, citing the imbalance of the fixture list and a points percentage table that needs an enigma machine to decode it. As has been widely pointed out – albeit through no fault of their own – South Africa finished top on a diet of quickfire series and despite facing neither England or Australia. The flaws are obvious, the criticisms valid. But while the 2025-27 edition will have the same system, there are moves afoot to create a more coherent competition.Assuming the red weed of franchise T20 cricket has not strangled the sport entirely – and, somewhat grimly, South Africa have no Test cricket at all in their next home summer – a personal view is that an all-plays-all format with (minimum) three-Test series must come in. And if this means four-day Test cricket for some and a four-year cycle, so be it. The only question here would be working out how to divvy up the points when India and Pakistan inevitably don’t play each other.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You only have to rewind to Centurion last December for one such example,South Africa booking their place in the finalwith a nerve-shredding chase against Pakistan and the marauding Mohammad Abbas.As for the head-to-head that day has produced, it may be that an Australia side with more than twice the number of Test caps in its squad still proves too strong. Both teams boast penetrative attacks capable of inducing a collapse but even with Marnus Labuschagne strong-armed into opening, the Australians look better equipped to withstand one.

His side piled up 248 for three, their highest total at home in this format, to set up a 37-run victory over West Indies in the third and final Twenty20 international.Ben Duckett top-scored with 84 off 46 balls as he shared a rollicking opening stand of 120 with Jamie Smith, 135 brought up at the 10-over mark. The destruction calmed down a touch thereafter but West Indies were still invited to pull off their highest successful T20 chase. It never felt on even as Evin Lewis whipped away a first-ball six. Rovman Powell provided respectability with 79 not out off 45, but the reply demanded something gargantuan. The visitors depart without a victory across six white-ball matches.England beat West Indies by 37 runs in third ODI to complete series sweep – live reactionRead moreWest Indies’ pain on this tour has not been restricted to the losing streak, Monday bringing the news of Nicholas Pooran’s retirement from international cricket. Their former white-ball captain missed this tour to rest after playing in the Indian Premier League where he was typically rapid, striking at close to 200, handy prep before next year’s subcontinental T20 World Cup. But at the age of 29 he now belongs to the franchise world, sad to those who still care for the old ways.“I was hoping that it didn’t happen, but in my mind I was already planning that we may have a T20 team without Pooran,” said Daren Sammy, the West Indies head coach. “I’m pretty sure more will follow in that direction. That’s the way T20 cricket is now, especially coming from the West Indies, the challenges we face trying to keep our players motivated to play for the crest.”The evening began with an exhibition by a promising opening partnership. Like Zak Crawley, Smith suits Duckett; the tall right-hander lets the bat flow straight, the shorter southpaw dances around the crease and plots various routes. Duckett reached his half-century off 20 balls, ramping, reversing and greeting Alzarri Joseph with a rocket pull for six.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook and his England teammates with the trophy after completing a T20 series sweep to go with their ODI success.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PASmith began the T20 series as a fill-in for Phil Salt on paternity leave but is demanding all-format recognition. He crushed sixes off Romario Shepherd, including a front-foot launch over extra cover. Smith was dropped next ball, Shimron Hetmyer possibly taken aback by the power of the drive, Shepherd the victim again. The Test keeper finished with a 26-ball 60, finally lacking in strength when he found Hetmyer at deep midwicket off Gudakesh Motie. The in-form Jos Buttler provided an adventurous 10- ball 22, including a no-look ramp off Joseph for four.Sherfane Rutherford was an unlikely saviour for West Indies, his medium pace and wide lines forcing Buttler to miscue, and Duckett slowed down before he was yorked by Akeal Hosein. But a decent over for the visitors never turned into a quiet passage; Motie was on the end of three consecutive Jacob Bethell sixes, 200 brought up in the 17th over. The start of the 18th brought further misery in the field as Rutherford hobbled off clutching his hamstring; it ended with Bethell reverse-flicking a Jason Holder yorker along the turf for four, no line or length safe, the dot ball taking on endangered status.Brook found some discomfort with Joseph’s short ball but he eventually nailed a fine hook for six. Bethell’s final summary was 36 not out from 16, two days on froma match-turning 10-ball 26.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johnson Charles took up 11 balls for nine before whipping Luke Wood to square leg with his 12th. Liam Dawson, Adil Rashid and Bethell all struck in their first overs, forcing catches in the deep, the required rate beyond 15 halfway through the West Indies innings.Shai Hope enjoyed the extra pace of Brydon Carse, nailing consecutive reverse-scoops off the quick. But the touring captain roared in frustration in the same over, an edge popping up for a simple Buttler grab, the knock done for 45. Powell found fine rhythm by the close, taking 15 off a Carse over with some of the most powerful strokes of the evening, but the tension had long gone.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Her Spanish opponent, Cristina Bucșa, is among the more streetwise players in the WTA Tour mid-ranks. But she had no answers as Raducanu raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory in just over an hour.‘Boultercanu’ serve doubles delight as women’s tennis returns to Queen’s ClubRead more“I was quite locked in today, so I’m very pleased with my performance,” Raducanu said, before admitting that trying to be happy on court was part of a broader strategy to help her play better.“Going on to the court ­laughing at certain shots, or if I’m smiling if I have pulled off a great shot, it does help relax you,” she said.“I play my best when my per­sonality is put on the court and I can express myself, and I feel like sometimes when I’ve been constrained to play a certain way, it hasn’t necessarily worked. I just need to be free and expressive, and then certain moments of creativity can come up.”Tougher tests lie ahead, starting on Thursday with the world No 41, Rebecca Sramkova, in the last 16. But for a player who confessed to having “pretty low expectations” just two days ago, there is plenty in Raducanu’s game that appears to be trending in the right direction.The first serve was crisp; the movement sharp. There were few signs of a back spasm that interrupted her preparations last week, even if ­Raducanu said afterwards that she was still managing the problem. “It was one of those days that you feel really good on the court. Sometimes you don’t necessarily feel like that, but when you do have that feeling, you need to capitalise.”And she did. After the players traded early service holds, ­Raducanu broke to lead 3-1 with a deft backhand volley after dragging her opponent across the court before racing through the first set in 25 minutes. While Bucșa put up slightly more resistance in the second, a sharp cross-court backhand put a bow on a very impressive performance.“I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t ­nervous before the match,” ­Raducanu said. “The way I overcame that was a great achievement. I also moved really well, considering I haven’t neces­sarily had much time on the grass.“But I think the biggest thing was that I started the point really well today: serve and return. It was very clean and clinical. I wasn’t giving away too many free points, and also got quite a few good setups and good points from my serve.”This year Raducanu had endured a shock defeat against Bucșa in the first round of the Singapore Open. But from early on at Queen’s Club there was only going to be one winner.“When I saw her name in the draw, knowing that it was going to be a difficult match really focused me,” ­Raducanu said. “With her defence and her slices, it can stay low and shoot on this surface. But I was very, very sharp. I wanted to get every point and score as many as I could, because I lost to her earlier in the year, and I know how tricky she can be.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in a match that featured 13 breaks of serve, Boulter kept her composure and produced her best tennis in the final set to see the match out.“I knew it was going to be a really tough battle,” Boulter said. “She’s someone who’s got a lot of ­credi­bility on these courts.

All the key questions are answered hereGuardian sportTue 10 Jun 2025 14.01 EDTShareHang on, I thought the World Cup was next year …The 2026 World Cup is what is technically known as the Proper World Cup, for national teams. This summer’s tournament is theClubWorld Cup, featuring some (with the emphasis on “some”) of the world’s best domestic teams – Real Madrid, PSG, River Plate and the like.David Squires on … Infantino’s Club World Cup buildup in the land of TrumpRead moreDidn’t that already exist?It did!Manchester City are technically the holders. But if there’s one thing Fifa likes, it’s grossly expanded tournaments and the Club World Cup is no exception. Since the tournament started in 2000, it usually featured six or seven teams representing Fifa’s various confederations. The teams would turn up, play a few knockout games in half-full stadiums – and the whole thing would be done in around 10 days with very few people remembering who actually won the thing by the time next year’s edition came around.Naturally,Fifadecided fans wanted even more of this type of thing and have expanded the tournament: 32 teams will now play 63 games in 11 host cities across the United States over a period of four weeks. Like the most recent World Cup, there will be a group stage with the best two teams from each of the eight groups progressing to the last-16 knockout stage.Right, so the best 32 teams in the world then ...Well … not exactly. With all due respect to Asia, Africa, North America, Central America, the Caribbean and Oceania, the 32 best club teams on Earth are almost certainly in Europe and South America. But this is aWorldCup, so the teams are mainly made up of clubs who have won their respective continental championships over the last four years (so, for example, recent winners of the Champions League get in from Europe).There are more places for teams from stronger federations such as Europe’s Uefa (12 slots) and South America’s Conmebol (six slots) than weaker federations (Oceania’s OFC gets just one). There are some oddities to the qualifying process though. The US got an extra slot as tournament hosts, meaning their domestic champion from 2024 would qualify. Most fans would say that would be the MLS Cup champion, which is decided after a post-season playoff competition (the2024 champion was Los Angeles Galaxy). Instead, Fifa decided the team with the best regular-season record would qualify. That just happened to be Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi, the most famous player in the world. Make of that what you will.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi (left) and Luis Suárez lead an ageing Inter Miami attack at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APAnother MLS team made it in slightly circuitous fashion. Fifa rules mean that two clubs with the same ownership can’t compete at the tournament. That meant Club Léon weredeprived of their slotbecause another Mexican team at the tournament, Pachuca, are under the same ownership group. That led to a playoff between Los Angeles FC and Club América to decide Léon’s replacement, withLAFC winning.And then there is Auckland City. The best two teams in New Zealand, Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix, play in Australia’s A-League, which is part of the Asian Football Confederation. That means Auckland City, as the winner of the OFC Champions League, grabbed the one slot for Oceania.So who is playing?AFC (Asia)Al-Hilal, Saudi Arabia (winners of the 2021 AFC Champions League)Urawa Red Diamonds, Japan (winners of the 2022 AFC Champions League)Al Ain, UAE (winners of the 2023–24 AFC Champions League)Ulsan, South Korea (best-ranked eligible team in the AFC four-year ranking)Caf (Africa)Al-Ahly, Egypt (winners of the 2020–21 Caf Champions League)Wydad, Morocco (winners of the 2021–22 Caf Champions League)Espérance de Tunis, Tunisia (best-ranked eligible team in the Caf four-year ranking)Mamelodi Sundowns, South Africa (second-best ranked eligible team in the Caf four-year ranking)Concacaf (North, Central America, and the Caribbean)Monterrey, Mexico (winners of the 2021 Concacaf Champions League)Seattle Sounders, USA (winners of the 2022 Concacaf Champions League)Pachuca, Mexico (winners of the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup)Los Angeles FC, USA (winners of play-off match)Conmebol (South America)Palmeiras, Brazil (winners of the 2021 Copa Libertadores)Flamengo, Brazil (winners of the 2022 Copa Libertadores)Fluminense, Brazil (winners of the 2023 Copa Libertadores)Botafogo, Brazil (winners of the 2024 Copa Libertadores)River Plate, Argentina (best-ranked eligible team in the Conmebol four-year ranking)Boca Juniors, Argentina (second-best ranked eligible team in the Conmebol four-year ranking)Uefa (Europe)Chelsea, England (winners of the 2020–21 Uefa Champions League)Real Madrid, Spain (winners of the 2021–22 Uefa Champions League)Manchester City, England (winners of the 2022–23 Uefa Champions League)Bayern Munich, Germany (best-ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Paris Saint-Germain, France (second-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Internazionale, Italy (fourth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Porto, Portugal (fifth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Benfica, Portugal (seventh-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Borussia Dortmund, Germany (Third-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Juventus, Italy (Eighth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Atlético Madrid, Spain (Sixth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Red Bull Salzburg, Austria (Ninth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)OFC (Oceania)Auckland City, New Zealand (best OFC Champions League winners in the OFC four-year ranking)Host Nation (USA)Inter Miami, USA (winners of the 2024 MLS Supporters’ Shield)The players must be excited about playing in a World CupPlaying intheWorld Cup is the highlight of any player’s career. Playing in theClub World Cup? Not so much. Fifpro, the global players’ union, said adding another month to an already crowded calendar is a health risk. Consider this: a top player in Europe will face having almost no rest in the summer for three consecutive years if they end up playing at Euro 2024, the 2025 Club World Cup and the 2026 World Cup. Oh, and the latter two tournaments will be played in the hottest months in the US as global heating makes conditions a lot tougher.View image in fullscreenManchester City won the most recent Club World Cup back in 2023, beating Fluminense in the final.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockWhat kind of prize money is involved?Quite a lot. The total prize pool for the tournamentis $1bn. Yes, with a B. Just over half of that total goes to the clubs just for being there, and different teams have received differently-sized payouts for their participation, depending on where they hail from.Oceania’s representative gets $3.58m just for showing up. African, Asian, and North American clubs $9.55m. South American sides get $15.21m, while European teams will get anywhere from $12.81m to $38.19m, depending on what Fifa calls “sporting and commercial criteria” (in other words: how famous and good they are).The remaining $425m is distributed based on performance in the tournament. Teams earn $2m for a win and $1m for a draw in the group stage, $7.5m for making the round of 16, $13.1m for making a quarter-final, $21m for making a semi-final, $30m for making the final, and another $40m for winning the whole dang thing.It should be noted that the prize money mentioned above is awarded to the teams, not the players. Different teams will distribute the winnings to players differently according to a number of factors, but that doesn’t mean players are happy with that arrangement. In MLS, there is an ongoing dispute between the players and the league over a cap on bonuses that would limit each MLS locker room from receiving more than $1m for the tournament, no matter how well they do. The two sides are currently trading proposals, but the tenor of negotiations hasn’t been all that friendly.Manchester City, for their part, has been public about not sharing prizes with their players:“Not even a watch,”said Pep Guardiola.Is there a Trump factor to look out for?Many see this tournament as a test run for the US’s co-hosting of next year’s World Cup, and the results are already … mixed. Donald Trump has issued a travel ban relating to citizens of a number of countries. Athletes participating in the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics areexempt from the ban, but it’s still unclear whether that applies to players at the Club World Cup. Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, met Trump in the White House in March when theyunveiled the new Club World Cup trophy. Trump could completely ignore the tournament, decide to use it as an excuse for self-promotion – as he has with other sports events such as the Super Bowl – or turn on Fifa for a perceived slight. Say one thing for the man: he’s not easy to predict.What are the venues?Rose Bowl– Pasadena, California (Capacity: 88,500). Will host group stage and last-16 matches. Historic stadium that is renowned for hosting many college (gridiron) football games and the 1994 and 1999 World Cup finals.MetLife Stadium– East Rutherford, New Jersey (Capacity: 82,500). Will host group stage matches, quarter-final, both semi-finals and final.

Will host group-stage and last-16 matches. The usual home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins.Camping World Stadium– Orlando, Florida (Capacity: 65,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. Formerly known as the Citrus Bowl, it’s hosted a number of major college gridiron football and in a previous live, games during the 1994 World Cup.Geodis Park– Nashville, Tennessee (Capacity: 30,000). Group-stage matches. This is the home stadium of MLS side Nashville SC, opened in 2022.TQL Stadium– Cincinnati, Ohio (Capacity: 26,000). Group-stage matches. This is the home stadium of MLS side FC Cincinnati, opened in 2021.Inter&Co Stadium– Orlando, Florida (Capacity: 25,000). Group-stage matches. The home venue for MLS side Orlando City, opened in 2017.Audi Field– Washington, D.C. (Capacity: 20,000). Group-stage matches. The home venue of MLS side DC United, opened in 2018.Will anyone watch?The early signs are not great. Consider the tournament’s opening match, between Inter Miami and Al Alhy. Miami are playing in their own city and have one of the greatest players of all time, and yet the match is struggling to sell out with The Athletic reporting that only around 20,000 tickets for the 65,000 capacity Hard Rock Stadium have been sold. If Miami are struggling to sell tickets then it’s worth wondering how many people are going to turn up for Wydad v Al Ain. Having said that, there is huge interest in European giants such as Real Madrid and Chelsea and their games should attract big crowds.10 players to keep an eye onKylian Mbappé, Real Madrid– Heard of him? The French superstar is facing some degree of questioning after his first season in the Spanish capital ended with no major titles. Would a Club World Cup alleviate those doubts?Ousmane Dembélé, PSG– The forward was instrumental in helping PSG capture their coveted Champions League title in May, and he’ll presumably continue to be centre to the European champions’ plans in the USA.Lionel Messi, Inter Miami– The Argentinian superstar has a World Cup to his name…can he add a Club World Cup to that list? Realistically, it may be a tough ask with this Miami team, even with the help of Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and Luis Suárez. But it’ll be fun to watch him in a tournament setting again.Omar Marmoush, Manchester City– The Egyptian made a big impact since joining City in January from Eintracht Frankfurt, scoring eight goals in all competitions including a memorable thunderbolt v Bournemouth.Cole Palmer, Chelsea– Palmer ended his season in great form, even though his overall campaign left something to be desired. The England international leads a Chelsea team stocked with young talent.Denis Bouanga, LAFC– The Gabon international near-singlehandedly dragged LAFC into the tournament with a sublime performance in the one-game play-in versus Club América. Bouanga has long been one of MLS’s most dangerous attackers, and it will be interesting to see him bring it against international competition.Franco Mastantuono, River Plate (for now)– The 17-year-old Mastantuono is seen as one of the brightest up-and-coming talents in Argentina, so much so that he became the youngest-ever debutant for the Argentine national team last week. Real Madrid and River Plate are currently locked in transfer talks according to multiple reports – the only question now is if he’ll stay with his current side through the Club World Cup, or move earlier.View image in fullscreenRiver Plate’s Franco Mastantuono (left) has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid.Photograph: Luciano Gonzalez/EPAThomas Müller, Bayern Munich– the 35-year-old had already bid goodbye to his home fans, but the Club World Cup will be his last competition in a Bayern Munich shirt. The wily forward will want to go out on another high note, after helping Bayern to another Bundesliga title.Weston McKennie, Juventus– Playing in his home country for the first time in competitive club matches, there’s almost no telling what role McKennie will play for Juventus. The US international has played in just about every midfield spot and even occasionally at wingback in what was a disappointing season for Juve, which they’ll hope to put behind them with a solid showing.Estêvão, Palmeiras– The 18-year-old forward, like Mastantuono, is one of his country’s brightest young stars. He’s already earned four senior caps for Brazil and has 13 goals with 12 assists to his name in Brazil’s Serie A. He hasagreed to join Chelseain a transfer after the tournament, so this will be his last chance to make a mark before moving abroad.Who’s going to win?So much will depend on how seriously the clubs take the tournament, and which among them are the freshest after a long European season.PSGare a decent bet, given their demolition of Inter in the Champions League final and their collection of young talent that is willing to work.Real Madrid, of course, can never be counted out in a tournament setting, and Trent Alexander-Arnold will be looking to impress in his first actions for his new club.Manchester Cityclosed a disappointing Premier League season in great form.Is there a chance an outside contender, like Porto, or River Plate, Boca Juniors, or Flamengo could take it? Sure. But given the other sides involved, it’s hard to be all that confident.When are the games and where can I watch?Every game is streamed worldwide in multiple languages on Dazn. You can also follow along on the Guardian – we’ll be live-blogging select games throughout the tournament and have writers on the ground all the way until the final.In the United States, select games

Left-backRayan Aït-Nouri arrived from Wolves for £31mon Monday, while Marcus Bettinelli will replace the departing Scott Carson as third-choice goalkeeper after joining from Chelsea on Tuesday.“This is a dream for me,” said Cherki after completing his move. “To be joining a club like Manchester City and have the opportunity to make the next step in my career here is something very, very special.”“I have worked so hard for this all my life. I love this sport, and I can’t wait to develop further here in Manchester with Pep and his backroom staff,” he added. “I would only leave Lyon for a project I really believe in and everything at City suggests I can develop my game and help the team be successful in the future.”Viana said Cherki, who can play in the middle or as a winger on either flank, is “a player our scouts have watched for a long time. We have all been impressed with his skill and creativity. I am convinced our fans will be excited to see him play.”Cherki, who has spent his entire career to date with his home town club, posted a tribute to Lyon on Instagram after the transfer was confirmed. “Thousands of emotions, hundreds of memories and an indelible imprint on my heart,” he wrote. “I hope to continue making you proud and represent ‘Lyon DNA’ with dignity.”City are close to completing the signing ofthe Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijndersafter a €55m (£46.3m) fee was agreed last week.

The Masters champion visited the venue just outside Pittsburgh at the start of last week on a scouting mission. On Tuesday, he gave a grisly definition of what unfolded.“Last Monday felt impossible,” McIlroy said. “I birdied the last two holes for 81. It felt pretty good, it didn’t feel like I played that badly. It’s much more benign right now than it was that Monday. They had the pins in dicey locations and greens were running at 15.5 [on the stimpmeter]. It was nearly impossible. This morning it was a little softer. The pins aren’t going to be on 3 or 4% slopes all the time.Rory McIlroy annoyed over driver disclosure at US PGA ChampionshipRead more“If you put it in the fairway, it’s certainly playable. But then you just have to think about leaving your ball below the hole and just trying to make as many pars as you can. You get yourself in the way of a few birdies, that’s a bonus.“I’m glad we have spotters out there because last Monday you hit a ball off the fairway and you were looking for a good couple of minutes just to find it. It’s very penal if you miss. Sometimes it’s penal if you don’t miss. The person with the most patience and the best attitude this week is the one that’s going to win.”Oakmont’s rough is notoriously thick, which plays a key role in scores being high. Ángel Cabrera prevailed when five over par in 2007. Jon Rahm said: “There’s going to be times when you miss the fairway by a foot and you’re going to have to punch out 20, 50 yards at best. “At that point, it’s luck of the draw.”In theory, none of this bodes particularly well for McIlroy. He has endured recent struggles with driver in hand, including when missing the cut atlast weekend’s Canadian Open. That club has been replaced before the third major of the year.McIlroy’s issue is not really a technical one, though. Scaling the mountain at Augusta National in April, where hecompleted the career grand slam, has placed the Northern Irishman in intriguing psychological territory. Quite naturally, the resetting of goals has proved tricky.View image in fullscreenBryson DeChambeau is the defending US Open champion after winning at Pinehurst.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty Images“I’m sort of just taking it tournament by tournament at this point,” the world No 2 said. “You dream about the final putt going in at the Masters but you don’t think about what comes next. I think I’ve always been a player that struggles to play after a big event, after I win whatever tournament. I always struggle to show up with motivation the next week because you’ve just accomplished something and you want to enjoy it and you want to relish the fact that you’ve achieved a goal.“Chasing a certain goal for the better part of a decade and a half, I think I’m allowed a little bit of time to relax a little bit.” McIlroy will spend the opening two rounds in the company of fellow European Ryder Cup players Shane Lowry and Justin Rose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You have to hit the fairways, you have to hit greens and you have to two-putt, worst-case scenario. When you’ve got those putts inside 10ft, you’ve got to make them. It’s a great test of golf.”DeChambeau has emerged as LIV Golf’s most valuable asset, which renders the end of his current contract with the Saudi Arabian-backed tour an interesting moment in time. The Californian appears confident of staying within his current playing domain. “Next year is when it ends,” he said of his LIV deal.“We’re looking to negotiate end of this year and I’m very excited. They see the value in me. I see the value in what they can provide, and I believe we’ll come to some sort of resolution on that. Super-excited for the future.“I think that LIV is not going anywhere.

No level of sporting success is worth such a cost.”The rebuke is the most forceful yet against the Enhanced Games, an Olympics-style event set to debut next May in Las Vegas where athletes will be allowed, and in some cases incentivized, to use banned substances under medical supervision.Organizers of the Enhanced Games have positioned the competition as a radical alternative to traditional sport, promising to embrace what they call “superhumanity” by normalizing pharmaceutical and technological enhancement. The event will run 21–24 May 2026 at Resorts World on the Las Vegas Strip and feature sprinting, swimming and weightlifting.While promoters frame the Games as a scientific revolution and a break from what they call the “hypocrisy” of anti-doping regimes, the backlash has been swift and severe.“This is a dangerous clown show, not real sport,” said Travis Tygart, CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency, in an earlier statement. “As we have seen through history, performance-enhancing drugs have taken a terrible physical and mental toll on many athletes. Some have died.”The Enhanced Games’ founder, the Australian entrepreneur Aron D’Souza, insists the event is both ethical and medically sound. Athletes will undergo individualized health profiling, disclose all substances used while competing under the supervision of independent scientific and ethics boards. Traditional anti-doping tests will not be conducted.View image in fullscreenPeter Thiel, center, the tech billionaire known for his libertarian politics and backing of controversial biotech ventures, has been listed as a major investor and “close advisor” to the Enhanced Games.Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images“The Enhanced Games is renovating the Olympic model for the 21st century,” D’Souza said. “In the era of accelerating technological and scientific change, the world needs a sporting event that embraces the future – particularly advances in medical science.”Critics say the model amounts to “don’t ask, don’t tell” for doping. Others see a deeper agenda: a challenge not only to sport’s institutions but to its foundational values. Many have also raised concerns about the political and financial backers of the event.‘Imagine if a 60-year-old broke Usain Bolt’s record’: the story behind the Enhanced Games, the Olympics where everyone dopesRead moreThe latest round of funding includes investment from 1789 Capital – a firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr and Omeed Malik – while tech billionaire Peter Thiel has been listed as a major investor and “close advisor”, according to D’Souza. Avideo announcing the backingappeared to suggest the US president’s personal endorsement. D’Souza has openly welcomed their involvement, describing Trump-aligned figures as “some of the most significant” cultural supporters of the project.The event’s tagline, Live Enhanced, has become both a rallying cry and a provocation. Organizers say they are recruiting athletes who feel alienated by conventional doping restrictions, including former swimming world champion James Magnussen. In February, Greek-Bulgarian swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev recorded a time 0.02sec faster than the longstanding 50m freestyle world record, reportedly while following an enhancement protocol. But the swim was not officially recognized – in part because he wore a polyurethane suit not approved by Fina, swimming’s global governing body.Prize money for the 2026 Games is substantial: up to $500,000 per event, with a $1m bonus for record-breaking performances.Despite mounting criticism, the Enhanced Games show no signs of slowing down. Organizers say discussions are ongoing with sponsors and streaming platforms, though no broadcast partner or marquee athlete has been publicly confirmed. If regulatory pressure builds, the Games’ future could hinge on whether the public sees the venture as scientific progress or a dangerous line crossed.For now, Olympic athletes say the stakes couldn’t be higher.“We stand firmly together for the values of fair play, ethical behaviour and respect,” the IOC andWadaathletes said in Tuesday’s statement. “We will do everything we can to protect the integrity of sport for generations to come.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs in sportInternational Olympic CommitteeWadaDonald Trump JrPeter ThielSport politicsAustralia sportShareReuse this content"

And forAnge Postecoglou, who always bristled at the idea that his wealth of coaching experience had somehow been earned in inferior competitions, perhaps his departure from Tottenham really can be a kind of springboard: to one of these prestigious, equally demanding leagues he keeps talking about. Maybe the struggling Gamba Osaka. Perth Glory could well have a vacancy soon. Motherwell are still looking. A step down? That’s just your old-world, Eurocentric, Prem-brained snobbery showing right through there, mate.And so to Postecoglou’s many rhetorical elisions can be added another:the triumphant sacking. Perhaps it was only in this universe – the post-truth universe – that such a feat was even conceivable. Along with the Europa League trophyhe so stunningly spirited to north London, this may turn out to be the defining legacy of the Postecoglou interregnum. There have been better Premier League managers. There have been more charming and more entertaining Premier League managers. But there may never have been a manager better at defining his own terms of achievement; a managerial reign so evidently built upon a towering silo of nuclear-strength bullshit.Bilbao was a glorious blip for Spurs – and that’s why Levy had to sack Postecoglou | Jonathan WilsonRead moreFrom the very start, Angeball constructed its own bespoke logic as it went along. The journey matters more than the destination. There is a process, and we stick to it. There are principles, and however tough things get, you never deviate from or compromise on them. “Even if we go down to five men, we will have a go,” he said afterhis nine men were defeated by Chelseain November 2023. The idea of Champions League qualification as a goal in its own right, unaccompanied by broader progress: “meaningless”, as he put it in March 2024.In January 2024 he rejected the idea that a single trophy could ever constitute satisfaction or atone for mediocrity elsewhere (“You can’t just sit back and say: ‘I’ve just delivered a trophy, shouldn’t I have some latitude to not be successful?’”). In October 2024 he insisted that Tottenham’s league performance should be regarded as the “most meaningful” measure of his side’s progress.Ange Postecoglou 2023-24: meet Ange Postecoglou 2025. The coach who promised to attack in all circumstances, who disdained the transformative effect of a single trophy, has just won a trophy with the lowest possession recorded in a European final because sometimes – as he put it in Bilbao – “you have to change your approach”. A coach who urged us to judge him on the league now no longer judges himself on the league.A coach who blames Tottenham’s abject league performance on a freak injury crisis also takes no responsibility for that injury crisis, for a style of play in which Tottenham comfortably spend more time in high-intensity sprints than any other Premier League team. A coach who claims he takes no notice of what is said and written about him has spent a suspiciously high proportion of this season reacting to things that have been said and written about him.View image in fullscreenPostecoglou celebrates with the Europa League trophy after his team’s victory over Manchester United.Photograph: Alex Pantling/UEFA/Getty ImagesNone of this is a character judgment or smoking gun in its own right. Changing your mind when the facts change: this is, in fact, entirely normal and rational behaviour. Hypocrisy is what makes us human. Go back through everything I’ve written about Postecoglou over the last two years and I’m sure you’ll find it riddled with compromising contradictions. For what it’s worth, I think the decision to sack Postecoglou now is a big error on Daniel Levy’s part. At a time when Spurs are undergoing all shades of upheaval off the pitch, trying to bolster an underpowered squad, a managerial search and a vibe shift is the last thing they need.Beyond this there is an enduring fascination to Postecoglou, the animal magnetism of the true ideologue. He came to the Premier League with no great reputation or playing record behind him. Tactically, he offered little groundbreaking or novel beyond a hard-running, hard-chasing dogma in which the only solution to every problem is to believe harder in the dogma. The dogma will win your duels. It will head away set pieces for you. And if it doesn’t, it was ultimately your fault for not believing sufficiently in the dogma. In an important sense Postecoglou marked a continuation of the Mourinho-Conte axis: the latest in a series of coaches convinced that their own principles were stronger and worthier than those of the club, determined to prove to the world that Tottenham was terminally sick, yet they alone had the cure.All of a sudden, one February morning, the league is gone; survival secure. The new dogma is defending like hell against continental Europeans on a Thursday. In fact, scratch that: this was always the dogma. There was no old dogma. This was what you were trying to build all along. Of course this has always been Postecoglou’s real superpower: the cult of personality, the ability to render words convincingly true simply by emitting them from your mouth, to build castles and citadels of bullshit, an apparatus of demagoguery so potent and alluring that it supplants all previous logic.Which – and no moral judgements here – is quite interesting, right? A 57-year-old Australian bullshits his way into a Premier League job, to spectacular away wins at Manchester City and Manchester United, to some of the most entertaining football ever seen from a Tottenham team in my lifetime. He convinces players to run themselves past the point of wellness. He convinces them to stick together amid a frightening assemblage of centrifugal forces. He convinces a significant part of the English footballing public that league tables are a form of fraud. And finally to a European title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is talent, as surely as substitutions or being able to put on a small-sided coaching session is talent. And what it exposes – perhaps “indicates” is a better word – is how much of modern football is essentially an act of persuasion. Agents bullshit. So do analysts and marketers and journalists. An entire industry built on pure narrative skill, the ability to make things up on the fly and bring people with you. What matters is not what you say, but the conviction with which you believe it to be true at the time.View image in fullscreenPostecoglou is congratulated by Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, after the Europa League final.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesAnd so the Postecoglou who declared at Celtic that he was “exactly where I want to be” now seeks another fresh start. Perhaps a sideways move to another Premier League club, perhaps even a step up in class to the Greek Super League, the Korean K League, the League of Ireland. This part will not be a problem. Football has no shortage of soiled dreamers, clubs who missed the gold rush, fans whose only real desire is to feel something again. Marseille, Roma, Benfica, Schalke, West Ham. Leeds sacking Daniel Farke in November and going all in on Angeball feels like a perfect fit.There is of course an irony here. In his meticulously cultivated personal branding, Postecoglou often likes to paint himself as a throwback, an outsider, a counter-culturalist, the grizzled underdog. But in his reliance on patter and persuasion, bluster and bluff, he is in fact a very modern footballing phenomenon. This is Ange’s world now, and we’re all bullshitting in it.Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouSportblogTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

Eleven others were being treated in local hospitals for injuries sustained in the attack.Visibly moved at a media conference, the chancellor, Christian Stocker, announced a minute’s silence for 10am on Wednesday to start the period of mourning for the victims of Austria’s deadliest postwar mass shooting.The attack on Tuesday morning in the southern city of Graz was “a dark day in the history of our country”, an act of “unimaginable violence” and “a national tragedy that has shocked us all”, he said.The interior minister, Gerhard Karner, said six of the victims who died at the scene were female and three male.

Police gave the all-clear about 90 minutes later, after a major security operation involving a special forces unit and several helicopters.A police spokesperson told reporters the suspect was a 21-year-old Austrian national who was armed with two weapons that he owned legally, and had no criminal record. His name has not been released.“Everything else, and many other things have been speculated about at this point in time, is simply speculation,” the interior minister told reporters, adding that no further details would be announced because of the active police investigation.“Out of consideration for family members, only reliable information will be released to the public,” Karner said. He said nothing concrete could yet be said about the possible motive of the gunman.Citing police sources, the Kurier and Salzburger Nachrichten newspapers said the gunman was carrying two weapons, a pistol and a shotgun, one of them recently acquired. Police said he had been found dead in a school bathroom.Pupils and staff were evacuated from the 400-pupil BORG Dreierschützengasse high school in Graz and the building was thoroughly searched. Students and families were taken care of by crisis intervention teams at a nearby sports hall.The area around the school was cordoned off and public transport was diverted, with all streets around the school guarded by armed police. A Red Cross spokesperson said 160 responders attended the scene including emergency doctors and paramedics.View image in fullscreenThe shooting took place at the BORG Dreierschützengasse high school.Photograph: Borut Živulovič/ReutersStocker said earlier in a statement there were “no words for the pain and grief all of us in Austria are feeling”. He added: “Today it’s all about compassion. And about being there for one another. In these difficult times, humanity is our strongest force.”Austria’s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, said: “What happened today … strikes our country at the heart. These were young people who had their whole lives ahead of them.A teacher who accompanied them on their journey.”Nothing could ease the pain felt by “the parents, grandparents, siblings and friends of the murdered people at this moment”, he said, adding that the country “stood together, to withstand this pain, together”.Austrians own an estimated 30 firearms for every 100 people, making the country one of the most heavily armed civilian populations in Europe.Machine guns and pump-action guns are banned, but revolvers, pistols and semi-automatic weapons are allowed with official authorisation, and rifles and shotguns with a firearms licence, a valid hunting licence or for members of shooting clubs.Mass shootings, however, are rare. In 2020, four people were killed and 22 injured in a gun attack by a convicted jihadist in Vienna. In November 1997, a 36-year-old mechanic shot dead six people in the town of Mauterndorf before killing himself.Kahr, the Graz mayor, described the shooting as a “terrible tragedy”. The Vienna mayor, Michael Ludwig, urged Austrians to “stand together as a society”, adding: “Hate and violence must never gain the upper hand. Our response to this must be an even stronger commitment to solidarity and respect.”Several European leaders expressed their condolences on Tuesday. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said she was “deeply shocked”, adding that “every child should feel safe at school and be able to learn free from fear and violence”.The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said schools should be “symbols of youth, hope and the future”, adding: “It’s hard to bear when schools become places of death and violence.”Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, posted: “Horrific news from Graz. Our thoughts are with our Austrian friends and neighbours and we mourn with them.” Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said his thoughts were with the victims’ families.Explore more on these topicsAustriaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Along with homebuying, no other life event is linked to such dramatic shifts in consumer behaviour.Data on pregnancy is believed to be more than 200 times more valuable than data on age, gender or location for targeted advertising. The report says period tracking could also be used to target women at different points in their cycle.The three most popular apps had estimated global download figures of a quarter of a billion in 2024. The femtech market – digital products focused on women’s health and wellbeing – will be worth more than $60bn (£44bn) by 2027, the report says.With such intense demand for period tracking, the authors called on public health bodies including theNHSin the UK to develop their own transparent and trustworthy apps to rival those from private companies, with apps allowing permission for data to be used in medical research.“The UK is ideally positioned to solve the question of access to menstrual data for researchers, as well as privacy and data commodification concerns, by developing an NHS app to track menstrual cycles,” said Felsberger, who added that the reproductive health provider Planned Parenthood in the US already had its own app but the UK lacked an equivalent.“Apps that are situated within public healthcare systems, and not driven primarily by profit, will mitigate privacy violations, provide much-needed data on reproductive health, and give people more agency over how their menstrual data is used.”Prof Gina Neff, the executive director of the Minderoo Centre, said: “The use of cycle tracking apps is at an all-time high.Womendeserve better than to have their menstrual tracking data treated as consumer data.”In the UK and EU, period tracking data is considered “special category”, as with that on genetics or ethnicity, and has more legal safeguarding. In the US, data on menstrual cycles has been collected by officials in an attempt to undermine abortion access, the report says.Explore more on these topicsMenstruationWomen's healthWomenAppsData protectionPrivacyNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

A day earlier, she revealed their three-year relationship had continued until the Bad Boy Records founder was arrested in September at a New York hotel, where she’d been planning to meet him.Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, charges that carry a potential penalty of 15 years to life in prison. He has been jailed without bail.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’s ex-girlfriend says she felt obligated to participate in ‘freak-offs’Read moreProsecutors allege Combs used violence, threats and a network of employees and associates to control and abuse women for two decades. His lawyers have told the jury in federal court in Manhattan that although there was domestic violence in his relationships, everything he did sexually was consensual.Earlier in the trial, the R&B singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura testified over four days that Combs physically abused her and that she participated in hundreds of “freak off” sexual performances during a nearly 11-year relationship that ended in 2018.The Associated Press doesn’t name alleged victims of sexual abuse without their consent unless they have shared their identities publicly, as Cassie has.Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Combs, cross-examined Jane on Tuesday by leading her into discussing the drug-fueled sexual marathons choreographed by Combs – which Jane said sometimes happened weekly – by reminding her that she mentioned regrets in earlier testimony.“I resent him for leading me into the lifestyle he led me to,” Jane said. “I resented the way he went about introducing me to this lifestyle.”She said she had agreed to these “hotel nights” while “under a lot of emotional pressure” – and already hooked on love and a desire to stay in a relationship with Combs.Jane testified Monday she began therapy about three months ago. She previously met with lawyers on Combs’s defense team but cut off those meetings in April, days before the trial began.She said she struggles to understand why she kept participating in “hotel nights” even though she only wanted to have sex with Combs, but that the reasons were “becoming more and more clear” as she proceeds with therapy.The manosphere seizes on the Diddy trial to undermine alleged victims: ‘I don’t see no crimes committed’Read moreJane initially felt it was “something very special” to have these secret sexual experiences with Combs. She said she didn’t want to judge him and “really wanted to just go along with these things because if I can be my partner’s escapes than I would be”.Jane said she researched sexual variations in 2022 and came across the words “cuck” and “cuckold”, which seemed to fit the lifestyle she found herself in because she said a man known as a “cuck” derives pleasure seeing “his woman receive pleasure” from another man.In earlier testimony, Jane provided recent examples of Combs acting violently toward a woman while seeking to fulfill his sexual desires.Cassie sued Combs in November 2023 alleging sexual abuse. The lawsuit was settled within hours for $20m, but touched off the criminal investigation into Combs.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

A coup may even be easy to start. The day after is simply unpredictable and harmful to everyone.Brazilcould not go through something like that, and such a hypothesis was never even considered during my government,” he said.Brazil braces for Bolsonaro’s day in court as ex-president testifies over ‘coup plot’Read moreBolsonaro confirmed his allies had considered various options, including the declaration of a state of siege, but did not pursue them because “there was no climate for it, no opportunity; we didn’t even have a minimally solid base to do anything.”The former chiefs of the air force and the army had previously told police that theyopposed Bolsonaro’s plans during those meetings, although they said the former navy commander pledged to back the rightwing autocrat.With a hoarse voice, the far-right leader used the live broadcast of his questioning to turn much of the hearing into a political platform, defending his 2019-2023 administration and repeatedly criticising Lula’s third term.There had been some expectation over his face-off with the case’s lead judge, justice Alexandre de Moraes – the former head of the electoral court, whom Bolsonaro has previously called a “jerk” and a “scoundrel”.But Bolsonaro apologised to Moraes and two other justices for saying in a meeting – a recording of which was submitted as evidence – that they had allegedly received between $30m and $50m each to rig the election.“It was a vent, rhetoric I used,” he said. “So, I apologise. I had no intention of accusing you of any misconduct”.Though he is barred from running for office by an electoral court ruling in a separate case – for spreading lies and attacking the voting system – Bolsonaro joked with Moraes, saying: “I’d like to invite you to be my running mate in 2026.”Smiling, the justice replied: “I’ll pass.”Bolsonaro was the sixth defendant to be questioned since the trial began on Monday of the eight men considered the“nucleus” of the attempted coup. The accused include four former Bolsonaro ministers – three of them army generals; the ex-commander of the navy; and the ex-president’s former right-hand man, Lt Col Mauro Cid.It is the first time that high-ranking military officers have ever faced trial over an attempted coup d’état in Brazil, a country that endured a bloody dictatorship from 1964 to 1985.Journalist and political analyst Miriam Leitãowrote in her column in O Globothat “what was most striking … was the casual atmosphere in which a coup d’état was discussed within the Bolsonaro government.“Everyone knew about it – there were several conversations, meetings in function rooms, inside the presidential palace and at the top of the military hierarchy,” she wrote.The first to testify was Bolsonaro’s former aide-de-camp, Lt Col Mauro Cid, who signed a plea bargain and whose testimony, alongside evidence gathered by the federal police, forms the basis for the prosecution’s case.He reaffirmed that Bolsonaro edited a draft decree that provided for the arrest of several authorities, including members of Congress and supreme court justices, and the creation of a commission to organise new elections.“He [Bolsonaro] shortened the document, removing the authorities’ arrests. Only you would be imprisoned,” Lt Col Cid told Moraes.He also said that his former boss attempted unsuccessfully to find some kind of “fraud” in the electronic voting system, hoping to “convince the armed forces to do something”.Once the defendants’ testimony concludes, the prosecution and defence will have five days to request further inquiries to gather new evidence, which the rapporteur, Moraes, may accept or reject. After that come the final arguments and, ultimately, the trial verdict, which is expected in the second half of the year.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Emmanuel Macron, the French president and co-host of the conference, told delegates on Monday that enough countries had either ratified or formally committed to ratifying the agreement and therefore it could come into force as early as January 2026.Getting at least 60 countries to ratify the treaty, the number necessary for it to be implemented, was a key priority for Macron and the ocean summit.Britain said it would introduce a bill to enable ratification of the treaty by the end of 2025.It will provide the first legal mechanism for the creation of protected areas in the high seas, international waters that cover almost two-thirds of the ocean. This region, hundreds of miles from land, is virtually lawless. When established, the marine protected areas will help conserve the marine life of the high seas, including sharks, whales and sea turtles, which are currently vulnerable to unsustainable and illegal fishing and other extractive activities.Despite their remoteness, the high seas are under growing pressure from overfishing, climate change and the threat of deep sea mining. In April, Donald Trump moved tofast-track deep-sea mining under US law,sidestepping international efforts to regulate the industry.Emma Hardy, the British government’s marine minister, said the treaty would be a major victory for marine protection and crucial for restoring the ocean to good health. Hardy said: “Our oceans are dying. Without urgent action, they will be irreversibly destroyed. That is why the UK will introduce legislation by the end of the year to ratify the high seas treaty, a landmark in protecting marine life around the globe.”The treaty is also vital to achieve the global “30 x 30” target, an international pledge to protect a third of land and sea by 2023, to protect biodiversity.Formally known as the agreement on biodiversity beyond national boundaries, the treaty creates a legal process to establish marine protected areas in the high seas, and establish rules for extractive industries.The UK also joined over 90 countries to reiterate its commitment to an ambitious global plastics treaty when negotiations resume in August this year. The countries issued a “wake up call” urging other countries to join them in committing to a legally binding obligation to end plastic pollution, addressing the full life cycle, production and consumption, of plastics in order to safeguard human health and protect the environment.Britain’s move comes after its proposal to ban destructive bottom trawling in half of all protected areas in England’s seas.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentSeascape: the state of our oceansOceansFranceGreen politicsShareReuse this content"

In September 2024, Canada’sPlanetary Technologies raisedjust over $11m (£8m) from companies including Evok Innovations and BDC Capital to enhance ocean alkalinity, while in 2025, another firm, Equatic, sold60,000 carbon removal credits to Boeing, to enable it to do the same.View image in fullscreenEbb Carbon’s plant at the mouth of Sequim Bay in the Salish Sea in Washington state can remove up to 100 tons of carbon a year.Photograph: PNNLThe sector’s growth – part of the larger carbon removal market – has been astronomic, and has started to ring alarm bells for many ocean scientists across the world.“The jury’s still out on the damage that OAE could do,” says Dr James Kerry, an expert on coral reefs and senior research fellow at James Cook University. He says if too much alkalinity is added to the water, an event called precipitation can occur: carbonates could create minerals in the water that act as pollutants. “It might block light levels; it might be mistaken as food by marine creatures.”Around the world, ocean acidification is rising. As the ocean absorbs 30% of excess atmospheric carbon, it sets up a chain of chemical reactions that results in the ocean’s pH becoming dangerously acidic, which in turn affects humans and marine life.View image in fullscreenDivers monitor the waters around the Ebb Carbon plant in Washington state.Photograph: PNNLGlobal seawater pH has decreased 40% since preindustrial times,with nearly half of that decrease occurring since the 1980s. On the west coast of the Americas, upwellings of deep-sea waters contributed to amass acidification event in 2012which contributed to kelp forests dying along more than 220 miles (350km) of coastline. These shifts in the ocean’s acidity affect the smallest creatures most, in particular crustaceans such as shellfish or crabs, which are unable to build their skeletons in such conditions.While few doubt that ocean acidification is a real and growing problem, the concern is that the science behind geoengineering solutions, which manipulate the Earth’s natural processes to try to solve a problem, is in its infancy. Yet hundreds of millions of dollars are being poured into enacting these solutions.Big companies buy credits in carbon dioxide (CO2) removal projects as a way to offset their own emissions, allowing them to meet their sustainability targets or comply with regulations.Total carbon removal purchases (not just those for marine projects) rose from £41m in 2022 to more than £1.9bn in 2024, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some experts say theindustry could grow to £37bn by 2030, driven by industries that struggle to reduce their emissions, in particular aviation, cement and steel production.We’ll be able to de-acidify the coastal ocean, which is where most of the life forms thriveBen Tarbell, CEO, Ebb Carbon“In all sorts of mitigation approaches, everything is about scale,” said Dr Christopher Gobler of Stony Brook University. “If not scaled large enough, they’ll have no effect. If over-scaled, they could push pH too high, which could create problems for certain organisms, such as sea grasses.”Ben Tarbell, CEO of Ebb, says that the question of scale is “fundamental to any climate solution” and that the firm is conscious of doing this safely and responsibly. “We precisely measure and meter alkalinity that is introduced to the ocean,” he says. “We continuously track key water indicators like pH, and can shut down automatically if any thresholds are approached.”He also points to astudy done with scientists and the local Lower Elwha Klallam tribein Port Angeles, Washington, that the company undertook into testing the effects of alkaline enhancement on salmon in carefully controlled conditions.As the industry moves forward, many are looking to Ebb and its Microsoft deal to see what happens next. Now operating in Washington state in the US at less than 100 tons a year of carbon removal, this summer the company will move to a new plant in Port Angeles, just 30 miles (50km) away, which can remove 1,000 tons of carbon a year.View image in fullscreenAn aerial image showing how acidification affects the colour of seawater off Kalbarri, Western Australia.Photograph: Abstract Aerial Art/Getty Images“This plant will enable us to have confidence to then build much, much bigger plants,” says Tarbell. The company builds its infrastructure on to existing desalination plants. “Our approach to ocean alkalinity enhancement can achieve over 2bn tons of CO2removal a year in the coming decades.”He adds: “We will not fix the entire bulk of the ocean, but we’ll be able to de-acidify the coastal ocean, which is where most of the life forms thrive.”Since the technologies these companies use are new, international and national legislative bodies are struggling to keep up. . While an international legal consensus on how to control ocean alkalinity enhancement is reached, some companies are forging ahead with field trials.View image in fullscreenA beach protest at Gwithian in north Cornwall against Planetary Technologies’ proposed carbon dioxide removal scheme in St Ives Bay.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIn 2022, Canada’s Planetary Technologies drew ire for its experiments inSt Ives Bay inCornwall, UK. Its ocean alkalinity enhancement techniques became the target of a months-long campaign by local people, surfers, wildlife organisations and business owners, who all felt that they were not given sufficient information about what damage these experiments might do.Some, such as Sue Sayer, founder of the Cornwall Seal Group Research Trust, worried about damage to the local ecosystem, in particular the grey seal population. “In the best-case scenario, there are no impacts on the seals; in the worst-case scenario there’s no fish, no seals, no surfers, no tourism, no economy,” she said at the time of the protests.Blue carbon: the hidden CO2 sink that pioneers say could save the planetRead morePlanetary Technologiesno longer operates in the UK, but by 2024 it had announced a new round of funding, including a carbon credit sale to Microsoft. It said in April this year that the Cornish trial “demonstrated great potential” but that it had since decided not to pursue a full programme in Cornwall “due to commercial infeasibility”.When asked about its new round of funding and the Cornwall protests, the company declined to comment.Many scientists are not opposed to exploring the possibilities of geoenginering, especially as the pressure to do something more than simply reduce emissions grows.“The ultimate cause of global ocean acidification is rising CO2to the atmosphere from rising emissions,” says Gobler. But, he says, as the “toolbox” to fight emissions is being developed, “being able to examine the net CO2effect of each approach probably should be a consideration”.Brad Ack, CEO ofOcean Visions, a marine carbon removal nonprofit, underlines this. “There’s one driver line of pain that we’re seeing on the planet, and that is the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And there’s only two ways to affect that. One is to stop putting the CO2in, and the other is to take it out.”View image in fullscreenSue Sayer, founder and chair of the Cornwall Seal Group Research Trust, in north Cornwall.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The ObserverBut many want to look at other solutions first and are worried about the speed of progress of this manmade approach. Kerry suggests looking to more nature-based solutions, such as marine habitat restoration and protection as a way to mitigate the problem.Other issues that firms face is accurately assessing how much carbon is removed by OAE. Factors as varied as water depth, temperature, tides and seafloor variability all affect how much atmospheric carbon is removed and how long it will be sequestered.Dr David Ho, of [C]Worthy, a marine carbon removal nonprofit that offers formulas for techniques such as ocean alkalinity enhancement, believes that carbon removal efforts should be driven at government level. “It makes sense that these companies have to sell credits to survive,” he says. “At the same time, they have no way to prove that what they’re doing is effective – that’s a big problem.”This article was amended on 10 June 2025.

Some fell head first, dying where they stood moments earlier; their carcasses scattered near watering holes across the Okavango delta. Theunexplained deathsin May 2020 alarmed conservationists. By July, at least 350 elephants had died and nobody knew why.“The animals all had their tusks, so poaching was unlikely. A lot of them had obviously died relatively suddenly: they had dropped on to their sternums, which was indicating a sudden loss of muscle function or neural capacity,” says Niall McCann, director of the conservation group National Park Rescue.Nearly five years later, in November 2024, scientists finally published a paper indicating what they believe to be the reason behind the deaths: toxic water caused by an algal bloom.View image in fullscreenFoul-smelling algae along the St Lucie River in Stuart, Florida, in 2016. The algae spoiled coastal waterways and closed beaches.Photograph: Joe Raedle/GettyA sudden shift between dry and wet conditions in 2019 and 2020 created perfect conditions for cyanobacteria that release toxins lethal to the elephants, although the researchers could not make definitive conclusions as samples were not taken quickly enough in 2020 due to the pandemic.“Blooms” are a rapid increase in the amount of algae, often occurring in shallow, slow-moving warm water. They can transform a sea, lake or river into a mass of green, yellow, brown or even red, sometimes for several weeks. Not all blooms are harmful – many sustain important fisheries.Is our first objective to keep the planet’s freshwater ecosystems and climate stable – or is it to feed humanity?Johan Rockström, Potsdam InstituteBut sometimes algae forms such a thick layer that it blocks out sunlight in critical habitats; others can release harmful toxins. When the algae die, they rapidly deplete oxygen in water – often creating “dead zones” where few fish can survive.As the Earth warms, harmful algal blooms are on the rise – evencreeping into polar waters. They are driven by a mixture of pollution from agriculture, runoff from human waste and, increasingly, global heating – sometimes with dramatic consequences for wildlife and humans. As they spread, they are changing the colour of the world’s lakes, rivers and oceans.View image in fullscreenA satellite image of algal blooms in Lake Saint Clair on the US-Canadian border in 2015, showing the run-off from farms compared with the clear Detroit shoreline to the west.Photograph: NasaNearlytwo-thirds of all lakes have changed colourin the past 40 years, according to a recent study. A third are blue – but as temperatures warm, they are likely to turn a murky green or brown, otherresearch has found. The planet’soceans are turning greenas they warm, a result of absorbing more than 90% of excess heat from global warming.At sea, the size and frequency of blooms in coastal areas has risen by 13.2% and 59.2% respectively between 2003 and 2020,according to a 2024 study.In freshwater systems,blooms became 44% more frequentglobally in the 2010s, according to a 2022 global assessment of 248,000 lakes. The rise was largely driven by places in Asia and Africa that remain reliant on agricultural fertiliser. While progress has been made in North America, Europe and Oceania to stabilise blooms, the climate crisis has driven their resurgence in some freshwater systems.The fertilisers that people use to grow plants – including reactive nitrogen and phosphates – also supercharge algal growth. As they are washed off fields and pour into water bodies around the world, they significantly alter how ecosystems function.“Humans are today loading more reactive nitrogen into the biosphere than the natural cycle [is],” said Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. He was co-author of a2023 assessmentthat found that humanity had now gone far beyond the planet’s natural limits for nitrogen and phosphorus.View image in fullscreenAlgae on a stream fed by water from a sewage works by the River Thames near Slough in 2024.Photograph: D Martinez/Reuters“We need to reduce the supply of reactive human nitrogen by over 75%. It’s a dramatic change and there’s a lot of scientific debate about this,” he says.“Most agricultural scientists say that it is not possible because we cannot feed humanity. We have a contradiction here: is our first objective to keep the planet’s freshwater systems, coastal zones, ecosystems and climate stable – or is it to feed humanity?”The jellyfish we have here are way more tolerant of low oxygen in the water than species they would be competing withDenise BreitburgOthers warn that it is not a simple choice between food and the environment. In northern Norway, repeated algal blooms have wiped out millions of farmed salmon and cod in recent years. A single bloomkilled more than seven million salmonin 2019. This year, another haswiped out up to a million more fish.As has just happened in South Australia, where it spanned 8,800 sq km (3,400 sq miles), scores of fish and dead sea life wash up on beaches once ahuge algal bloom spreads. Deep-water sharks, crabs, lobsters and prawns are among those found dead as a result of the toxic blanket created byKarenia mikimotoialgae, with the ocean 2.5C (4.5F) hotter than usual for the season.View image in fullscreenA skate washed up on Kangaroo Island after an algal bloom off South Australia in 2025.

While there are signs that the bloom is waning, it was the fourth consecutive year that California had experienced a significant outbreak.From sewage and scum to swimming in ‘blue gold’: how Switzerland transformed its riversRead moreHowever, not everything dies in a dead zone. Once the putrid expanse of algae has dispersed and those that can swim away have left, aquatic species better adapted to low levels of oxygen, or hypoxia, move in. This has led to a boom injellyfish numbers in many parts of the world.Denise Breitburg, of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, has studied Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the US to experience algal blooms, for decades, says: “The jellyfish we have here are way more tolerant of low oxygen in the water than species they would be competing with for food. They become more efficient predators and can utilise habitat that fin fish are excluded from.”As the world heats, the disruptions that algal blooms cause to ecosystems will be hard to stop, experts warn. Prof Donald Boesch, who helped first identify thedead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, which last year reached 17,000 sq km, the 12th largest in 38 years of records, says the process will get worse if the world does not prevent rising temperatures.“As the liquid heats up, its ability to dissolve gases is reduced, so it holds less oxygen. Warmer surface waters can increase the stratification of layers in the ocean. It means that the warmer waters at the surface are less dense than the bottom waters, so they don’t get mixed up.“It’s going to get worse,” says Boesch.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsWaterThe age of extinctionMarine lifeOceansConservationClimate crisisWildlifeFishfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The effort to change the definition is “politically and/or economically, rather than scientifically, motivated”, the authors write.“They are mixing up the chemical definition of Pfas with a regulatory definition of Pfas,” said Prof Ian Cousins from the University of Stockholm. “The OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] definition was not intended to be a regulatory definition … the confusion it causes will also be damaging and I suspect that causing confusion is one of their objectives.”The authors warn: “An IUpac-endorsed and potentially narrower Pfas definition could confer undue legitimacy … and influence regulatory bodies and others to adopt less protective policies.”If the definition of Pfas were narrowed, it could drastically reduce the scope of regulation regimes currently being worked out in the EU and UK, limiting the number of substances subject to control, undermining monitoring efforts and potentially weakening public health and environmental protections, according to the scientists.Prof Pierangelo Metrangolo, co-chair of the IUpac project, said “the scientific rationale was the vibrant debate in the literature – reflecting differing opinions – and the fact that various regulatory agencies use different definitions. Therefore, we believed an IUpac project was timely.“Currently, the TG [task group] has not finalised any conclusion, yet, and there are no indications that certain subgroups of chemicals would be excluded. More importantly, the IUpac has not ‘endorsed’ anything, yet.”Prof Alex Ford from the University of Portsmouth, said: “Chemical industries and their lobbyists have used deny, deflect, sow doubt and delay tactics in the past to prevent and slow regulation on chemicals.“The UK is still in the process of deciding how it will deal with Pfas compounds. Past experience has shown that confusion over the definition of harmful contaminants can cause substantial delays in their scrutiny and regulation.”The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said it generally followed the OECD definition but that it did not discount the need for narrower definitions in certain contexts.In their paper, the scientists conclude by urging policymakers to continue using the OECD definition as the basis for harmonised regulation. “Justified exemptions can be made … without changing the general definition of what constitutes a Pfas,” they write.Explore more on these topicsPfasChemistryPollutionRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was recovered after its deletion was spotted by the trust and led to about 300 more cases being added to the maternity inquiry.Nearly 2,500 cases are being examined by the senior midwife, Donna Ockenden, and a national team of leading doctors and midwives, whose review is due to conclude in summer 2026.A statement from the Nottingham Affected Families Group said: “Nottingham families would like to thank the police for their determined investigation. We are distressed that they were unable to find who did this.“We are appalled to hear this news, though sadly we are not surprised … To know that there is most likely an individual who is capable of such behaviour is devastating for the already harmed and for the future of NUH safety.“We call for openness at this worrying time and for the individual, their colleagues or anyone who knows anything about this to come forward as a matter of urgency. This is a patient safety emergency.”Anthony May, chief executive of NUH, said: “I would like to thank Nottinghamshire police for their support in investigating this matter and we accept their findings. Upon discovering the issue, the trust informed Nottinghamshire police and engaged fully in the investigation.“We have put appropriate measures in place to secure digital files so that this cannot happen again.”Last week, Nottinghamshire police said theywere investigating possible corporate manslaughterat the trust over the deaths and severe harm of more than 2,000 babies and women.Det Supt Matthew Croome said at the time that the alleged offences related to “circumstances where an organisation has been grossly negligent in the management of its activities, which has then led to a person’s death”.Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsNottinghamshirePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Officials expect tariffs on British cars to be reduced first, because the process is less complex than with aluminium and steel, according to the two people briefed on progress in the talks.Trump and Keir Starmerannounced a “historic” trade agreementlast month that promised relief for key British industries affected by US import taxes. Trump agreed to reduce his 25% aluminium and steel tariffs to zero and slash his 25% tariff to 10% for up to 100,000 British cars a year.Two weeks ago Trumpdoubled US tariffs on steel and aluminium to 50%but said the UK would stay at the 25% rate until 9 July, pending enforcement of the deal and assuming that the British government “complies with relevant aspects”. Ministers and negotiators are nowracing to thrash out the detailsbefore that deadline.A trade department source stressed that the government could not predict the actions of the US administration.The UK is the only country so far that has struck an agreement with the US, though businesses have yet to feel its benefits.Starmer told MPs last Wednesdaythat he hoped the agreement with the US could come into effect “in just a couple of weeks”.Cars are the UK’s biggest export to the US, worth about £9bn last year. The value of the UK’s steel and aluminium exports is much smaller, at about £700m a year, but the US is an important market for them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Options include a free-for-all system until the quota is met, splitting it into 25,000 car exports a quarter, or earmarking a certain number of exports for small and medium-sized manufacturers.One issue the US government is concerned about is steel from other countries being processed in the UK and then exported to the US at a 0% tariff.This has triggered fearsthat the deal could end up excluding the UK’s biggest steelmaker, Indian-owned Tata Steel, because of the origin of some of its products.Lutnick is in London fortrade talks with Chinathat aim to resolve mounting tensions between the world’s two largest economies.

It was the route into the programme – a first step into the pathway towards a career in dance,” he said.“The National Dance CATs are sort of like little beacons across the country, where you can get high-quality specialist dance training without having to go off to a residential school. You can go to a regular school, but also get the kind of intensive training that is absolutely essential if you’re going to compete as professional dancer.”View image in fullscreenArlene Phillips: ‘Every child should have the right to pursue the arts and dance.’Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImagePhillips said: “Every child should have the right to pursue the arts and dance and the opportunity to reach their potential, regardless of their background or where they live.”Bourne called the National Dance CATs the “envy of international dance companies” and said without them we could enter “a world with no more Billy – or Betty – Elliots.”The centres were introduced by the last Labour government in 2004 in an attempt to make dance more equitable.Manchester, Salford, Leeds, Newcastle upon Tyne, Swindon, Ipswich, London, Bournemouth and Exeter all host the centres that have produced dancers who have gone on to work with Wayne McGregor, Akram Khan Dance Company, BalletBoyz, Northern Ballet and Matthew Bourne’s New Adventures.Earlier this yearthe Guardian reportedthat artists, directors and actors had raised the alarm about what they described as a rigged system preventing working-class talent thriving in their industries.There had been speculation before the spending review that more funding could be cut at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and even some suggestions DCMS itselfcould have been abolished– although this was dismissed as “madness” by the culture minister, Chris Bryant.The Department for Education has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsDanceEnglandTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

As she rounded the corner, neighbors began to look in her direction.“Everything was levelled,” she said.Police and experts blamed Tuesday’s attacks on a dissident faction of the once-powerfulFarcguerrilla group.Security expert Elizabeth Dickenson of the International Crisis Group said the attacks were likely the work of a group known as the Central General Staff (EMC).“This is a particularly well-coordinated offensive. It really demonstrates the capacity that the group has built,” she told AFP.“And I think very alarmingly it demonstrates their ability to conduct operations in the metropolitan area of Cali.”Dickenson said the group may be trying to stop an ongoing military operation that is reported to have injured or killed the group’s veteran leader, known as “Iván Mordisco”.Colombia: president says shot candidate had security detail cut on day of attackRead more“They are trying to raise the cost of that military initiative for the government,” said Dickenson.In a statement on Tuesday, the EMC warned the public to stay away from military and police installations, but stopped short of claiming responsibility.The attacks come three days after conservative senator Miguel Uribe, 39, was shot twice in the head at close range by an alleged hitman while campaigning in Bogotá.On Tuesday, a 15-year-old pleaded not guilty to carrying out the attempted assassination. The government believes he was a hired gun.Uribe remains in critical condition, the hospital treating him said on Tuesday.“No family in Colombia should be going through this,” Uribe’s wife, Maria Claudia Tarazona, told reporters outside the hospital. “There is no name for this – it’s not pain, it’s not horror, it’s not sadness.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaFarcAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The star is circled by two gas giants, both still forming and both larger than Jupiter, the biggest planet in the solar system.Astronomers find signal that gives ‘unexpected’ insight into early universeRead moreDr Kielan Hoch, an astrophysicist at theSpaceTelescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, said the planetary system’s youth made it a prime target for astronomers to learn more about the early evolution of planets around faraway stars.“There’s a small handful of multiplanet systems that have been directly imaged,” Hoch said. “And they are a unique laboratory to test planet formation theories as they formed in the same environment.”“Both planets are still forming, which is why they are still bright enough for us to detect,” she added. “The light we are seeing is from their formation as they begin to shrink and condense.”When the team began their observations they were surprised to find both planets in the telescope’s field of view, giving them information on two worlds for the price of one. The outer planet, YSES-1c, is the smaller of the two worlds, and about six times the mass of Jupiter.The telescope revealed high-altitude clouds in the planet’s atmosphere, but instead of being made from water vapour as on Earth, the clouds consist of magnesium silicate dust grains and perhaps some iron. “The iron would indeed precipitate out,” Hoch said.The astronomers described the observations as the first direct detection of such clouds on a planet circling a sun-like star. Further data revealed a disc of material made up of trillions of tonnes of dust particles around the larger inner world, YSES-1b, about 14 times the mass of Jupiter. The findings werepublished in Nature.Hoch said the disc around the inner planet was a “puzzle for formation theories” since both planets must have formed in the same environment. “Why did YSES-1b hold on to material around it while YSES-1c did not?” she said. An added mystery is why a 16m-year-old planet still has a disk of material swirling around it. Astronomers’ theories of planet formation suggest that any encircling dust should have settled after the first 5m years.“We wouldn’t expect the planets to look so different from one another if they formed in the same protoplanetary disk,” Hoch said. “JWST is providing an immense amount of data to continue to refine models and improve our understanding.”The $10bn telescope has transformed astronomy since itlaunchedin December 2021 from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana. The flagship mission has peered back tothe first galaxiesthat lit up the cosmos, spiedstrange new worlds, andwitnessed black holes colliding. It has even spotted tantalising, if controversial,hints of life beyond Earth.Explore more on these topicsSpaceAstronomyJames Webb space telescopenewsShareReuse this content"

Education officials told Agence France-Presse he “appeared to be a student at the school”.Borne said the suspect was “a young man from a family where both parents work, who had not shown any particular difficulties.” He was an anti-bullying representative at the school.She said: “Young people are shocked. They are also very shocked to see that one of their classmates could commit such a horrific act. And this classmate was very well integrated in the middle school.”The teaching assistant, a former hairdresser who had been working at the school since September, received several knife wounds. She was the mother of a young boy. One of her cousins described her as “a very cheerful, very kind person.”About 300 pupils at the school were locked down inside at the time of the boy’s arrest.In March, French police started random searches for knives and other weapons concealed in bags in and around schools.Élisabeth Allain-Moreno, the secretary general of the SE-Unsa teachers’ union, said the teaching assistant was “simply doing her job by welcoming students at the entrance to the school”. She said the attack “shows that nothing can ever be completely secure and that it is prevention that needs to be focused on”.Jean-Rémi Girard, the president of the National Union of Secondary Schools, said: “It’s impossible to be more vigilant 24 hours a day. We can’t say that every student is a danger or a threat, otherwise we’d never get out of bed in the morning.”The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen denounced what she called the “normalisation of extreme violence, encouraged by the apathy of the authorities”. She wrote on social media: “Not a week goes by without a tragedy striking a school. The French people have had enough and are waiting for a firm, uncompromising and determined political response to the scourge of juvenile violence.”At the end of April, after a fatal attack at a school in Nantes, the education ministry reported that 958 random bag checks in schools had led to the seizure of 94 knives.After that knife attack, which left one person dead and three injured, the prime minister, François Bayrou, called for more intensive checks around and inside schools.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Such is the importance of the occasion, the event will also be attended by Italy’s culture minister, Alessandro Giuli.“Florence has been waiting for this moment for a long time,” said Verde. “The metal monster is being removed and Florence’s dazzling beauty can finally return intact and unviolated.”Verde added that the “havoc” caused by the crane had been weighing on the city for far too long, and that he hoped the momentous occasion would mark the beginning of the end of “this cursed construction site”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The push to preserve the fantastical works of ‘Wigan’s Gaudi’Kevin Duffy was an eccentric who sculpted everything from a mini pub to a lion’s den to a Tudor village. But after his death, the future of this outsider artist’s work is in doubtGeorge Francis LeeTue 10 Jun 2025 11.42 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 11.44 EDTShareKevin Duffy’s fairytale was born on a dumping ground. Nobody else could see it, but to him, the overgrown remains of a 1920s bowling green promised untold potential. It was there he spent the last decades of his life creating castles, characters, and crude Tudor facades from chicken wire, cement, and anything else he could salvage, across the land surrounding his Wigan bungalow, spilling over into the family garden centre.Not many people have heard of Duffy – who died in September at 79 – or his work, all housed at his now-closed family business, Rectory Nurseries. But first reactions are often the same: bewilderment followed by unbound wonder and curiosity. After four decades, Duffy’s kingdom is full of nooks and pathways, chapels and dens, monsters and myths – each discovery promising another just around the corner. The Rectory features not just its own miniature pub, but a lion’s den as well as a stalactite-encrusted cave of sirens. One section hosts a small Tudor village, another a crowded antique shop where none of the items are for sale. It’s like wandering into a theme park.View image in fullscreenUnder threat … the sculpture of Mr Darcy.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIain Jackson, a writer and architect who interviewed Duffy for an outsider art publication called Raw Vision in 2008, admits Duffy’s work couldn’t be shown in a gallery, but says, “he still did it; he still had something to say – he was the real deal”. Yet along with his legacy as a much-loved outsider artist, Duffy has left a 1,200 sq foot property full of sculptures, found objects and oddities that nobody is quite sure what to do with.The land that the Rectory sits on is being forced into a sale, leading many locals to ask why Duffy’s work can’t be given protection. An idiosyncratic ground-floor rented flat in Birkenhead known asRon’s Placebecame what was thought to be the first outsider art to get Grade II-listed status last year. But today the Rectory lies stagnant; the gates closed to the public, as vines and trees encroach the Renaissance follies like a post-apocalyptic Portmeirion.“Eccentric” is the word Duffy’s nephew Chris uses to describe him. Duffy variously performed in a husband-and-wife musical duo, worked in a cotton mill, had an encyclopedic knowledge of gardening, and played the left-handed banjo. In the evenings when his family gathered, wearing his cowboy’s neckerchief, he would drink and play music long into the night, outpacing even his most spirited nephews.His eldest sister, Sheila, says he had been a charismatic child, but other than an appreciation for architecture, he wasn’t an obviously creative type. Instead, Duffy grew up to be a grafter, his hands tough like old leather. In around 1978 he started leasing the ground for £1 a year and cleaning it up, eventually building his bungalow in 1991, while selling cuttings for plants and slowly building up his nursery business.Duffy – who has sometimes been called “Wigan’s Gaudi” by visitors to the site – only started making art after Boxing Day in 1994, when his wife, Pat, died suddenly. A stone monument was erected in the garden in her memory, and decades of unrelenting creativity followed. Grief and remembrance feel enshrined in the Rectory. The all-faith chapel – which was originally built tongue-in-cheek from old lavatory bricks with an altar made of scaffolding planks – became a genuine place of reverence and, judging by the amount of touching prayer messages pinned up, was giving the 17th-century Holy Trinity church down the road a run for its money.View image in fullscreen‘The real deal’ … Kevin Duffy at Rectory Nurseries in 2015.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianDuffy’s works weren’t built to stand as individual pieces – instead he used his home-cum-garden centre as an ever-changing exhibition that people, and mostly himself, could enjoy. Layer after layer of strange objects created a magnum opus in over a hundred intertwined sections: a hand-sculpted Mr Darcy; the gravestone of a 58-year-old donkey; a shrine to his late wife and only son Carl, who died aged 56 in 2023.The creations were tied to whatever materials were freely available (or donated) at a given moment. Like the seedlings that fuelled his business, Duffy had a knack for creating something from nothing – “building a lot without buying a thing” as he put it. He once said in avideo made abouthim: “Is it art or is it just a pile of rubbish?”Regardless of the answer, Duffy’s wonderland may yet end up in the bin, and his work is just the latest in a long history of outsider art under threat. From paintingsmistaken for trashto artworks being saved from skips andending up in the Saatchi, the preservation of outsider art often depends on the taste and perseverance of a tenacious few.View image in fullscreenKevin Duffy’s fantasy Tudor village at Rectory Nurseries in 2015.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe loss of its creator looms over the Rectory. “The fact that Kevin is no longer with us is hard enough,” says Sheila, “but having to sell all his years of work just as a commercial venture is very sad.” The family, who don’t own the land, hope that someone will buythe propertyand keep at least some of Kevin’s work. Ideally they’d like it all preserved, but they’re being realistic.After all, as Chris explains, perfection and preservation was never his uncle’s goal. In fact, Duffy enjoyed the look of ivy creeping across his faux battlements, which undoubtedly inflicted structural damage over the years. His bottomless reserves of energy meant the layout of the Rectory could change on a whim of creative inspiration. A greenhouse easily became a village, a potting shed became a chapel.Without Duffy, the Rectory is still changing, as nature begins to reclaim it. Conifers invade the boundaries and ivy multiplies, while sculptures gradually forget their painted colours. It’s a stark reminder of time’s passing, and photos from 10 years ago show a tidier, prouder environment.To some, a bid to conserve Duffy’s visionary environment may be a folly of its own. “I don’t think we have to preserve absolutely everything,” says Jackson. “It existed for a moment. And those people that saw it had the luck and the privilege and that authenticity. There’s a risk of it becoming museum-ified.” But Chris is hopeful about his uncle’s legacy, even so. “No matter what happens to the garden in the future, our Kevin has left his own unique mark on the world and the pictures and memories will be forever.”Explore more on these topicsArtSculptureInstallationNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Initially promoting a utopian vision of racial and sexual unity with catchy, imaginative and anthemic songs, he then morphed into a shadowy, stoned figure whose downbeat music mirrored the disenchantment of the early 1970s.It was in 1968 that his band, Sly and the Family Stone, released the singleEveryday People, an appeal to unity that topped both the US pop and R&B charts for four weeks in early 1969. Everyday People’s catchphrases – “different strokes for different folks”, “we got to live together” – reflected an optimistic, racially inclusive America and ensured that Sly, with his bright smile and brighter threads, became an iconic figure to many. He and his band had a huge US following, their energy and optimism making them flag bearers for the nascent hippie movement, while appealing to both black and white audiences.In 1969 the band released the adventurous album Stand!, which opened with the title track urging listeners to stand against injustice, and was followed by the dissonantDon’t Call Me N* * * * *, Whitey. By now the likes of Miles Davis and Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye were studying Sly: he was an icon of black power and arguably the most influential talent in popular music.The band’spowerful performance at the Woodstock festivalin 1969 – with Sly driving the audience into a frenzy as he chanted I Want to Take You Higher – provided one of the highlights of the Woodstock feature film, and magnified their fame. Then the band relocated to Los Angeles in late 1969, releasingThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), a propulsive funk number that topped the charts in 1970.Sly Stone, pioneering funk and soul musician, dies aged 82Read moreSly then began to shut himself away in a Bel Air mansion, consuming huge quantities of cocaine and angel dust (the hallucinogen PCP). The album There’s a Riot Goin’ On took almost two years to emerge – a lifetime in pop music. It was a Sly Stone solo effort in all but name and its sound was no longer bright and bold but sombre and low-fi, recorded with an early drum machine and a few close friends (the guitaristBobby Womack, the organistBilly Preston) sitting in and getting high.Sly’s record company, Epic, was aghast, fearing it would alienate his audience. But once again Sly proved himself ahead of the pack:Family Affair, the first single to be released from the album, was a US No 1 and has since gone on to become a contemporary music standard.Nothing else on There’s a Riot Goin’ On possessed the commercial potential of Family Affair, but the album was a murky, compelling insight into Sly’s weary but creative mind – and its drug-induced mood of ennui and cynicism appeared to match that of many Americans experiencing a comedown after the excitement and hopes of the 60s. Riot topped the US album charts and effected a profound influence on African-American music. It is now regarded by many as a masterpiece.View image in fullscreenSly and the Family Stone in the early 1970s. Stone is third from left.Photograph: GAB Archive/RedfernsBorn Sylvester Stewart in Denton, Texas, Sly grew up in Vallejo, California. His mother, Alpha, sang and played guitar at a local church, and his father, known as KC, served as a deacon. With his siblings, Sly sang in the Stewart Four, a gospel group that played in churches and even cut a 78 record.He taught himself to play the guitar and soon mastered the organ, harmonica and a number of other instruments, becoming lead vocalist of the Viscaynes, a doo wop group with whom he released two singles in 1960. After studying musical theory and composition at Vallejo Junior College in Fairfield, California, he was hired by Autumn Records, producing pop hits for the Beau Brummels and Bobby Freeman (and writing Freeman’s C’mon and Swim).Sly maintained a hectic schedule during the mid-60s: leading his own band, the Stoners, and working as a DJ at the KSOL radio station in San Francisco, then at KDIA in Oakland, at both of which he was a pioneer in playing contemporary rock music alongside R&B. He formed Sly and the Family Stone in 1966 with his brother Freddie on guitar, Larry Graham on bass, Cynthia Robinson on trumpet, Jerry Martini on saxophone and Greg Errico on drums. His sister Rose joined on electric piano after the release of the group’s little-noticed 1967 debut album, A Whole New Thing. Sly wrote all the material, played guitar and keyboards, and sang, too.Sly and the Family Stone were a radical proposition from the start: a multiracial, mixed sex band who blended elements of contemporary rock with aJames Brown-influenced dance groove. Their afros and long hair, and fashionable clothes, stood outside the R&B mainstream, in which matching suits and processed hair remained the norm. With their harmonising, their habit of using different members to sing individual lines, and Graham’s popping bass technique that would come to be the signature sound of funk, they had a unique feel.Only three months after their second album,Dance to the Music, which contained their first hit single (a Top 10 success in the US and the UK) with the track of the same name, they released Life, an unremarkable collection of songs that produced minor hits with the title track andM’Lady.View image in fullscreenSly Stone performing at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles in 2006.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APA year later came Stand!, and then, as Epic grew frustrated at receiving no new material, a Greatest Hits collection was put out in 1970. It reached No 2 in the US charts and has since gone on to sell more than 5m copies. With Sly working for two years on his next album, Epic’s president, Clive Davis, froze his royalties to force him to get a move on. When Davis finally received There’s a Riot Goin’ On he was shocked by its contents.Although his worries about the album’s unsaleability proved to be ill-founded, Davis did, however, have genuine cause for concern in the years after Riot. Sly’s drug intake escalated, and he became increasingly paranoid and isolated, regularly refusing to perform at concerts (leading to riots by furious audiences) and surrounding himself with thuggish bodyguards. Their threatening behaviour led Errico and Graham to leave the band and the 1973 album, Fresh, although it contained the Top 20 US single If You Want Me to Stay, was not a great commercial success.The following year the album Small Talk proved a critical and commercial failure, and 90% of tickets for a 1975 concert in New York were left unsold. The Family Stone dissolved and Sly attempted a solo career, but subsequent albums failed to sell. In 1977 Epic released him from his contract.For more than four decades he created little. Rarely performing or recording – his last album, Ain’t But the One Way, came out in 1982 – he generally made the news only when arrested for cocaine possession, in court for not having paid tax or fighting with various managers over royalties. A comeback was mooted in 2007 when a European tour was booked, but Sly’s reluctance to perform for more than 20 minutes, plus his new band’s ineptness, meant the performances were widely ridiculed. After that he existed for many years as little more than a ghost, often reported to be living in his van, still a superstar in his own mind.The Burden of Black Genius: documentary examines career of Sly StoneRead moreIn 2023 his autobiography Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again), written with Ben Greenman, was published and Stone gave interviews in which he claimed to be free of his drug addictions. Seemingly, his daughter Sylvette and a new manager, Arlene Hirschkowitz, had combined their efforts to ensure drug dealers no longer had access to Stone. A feature documentary, Sly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black Genius), directed by the musician Questlove, was released in 2024.The popularity of the music he created between 1968 and 1973 had never faded –Prince, D’Angelo and Lenny Kravitz were among the many musicians influenced by him. Indeed, the US critic Joel Selvin wrote that “There are two types of black music: before Sly Stone and after Sly Stone.”He is survived by three children: Sylvester, from his marriage to Kathy Silva, which ended in divorce; Sylvette, from a relationship with his fellow band member Robinson, and Novena, from another relationship.Sly Stone (Sylvester Stewart), musician, born 15 March 1943; died 9 June 2025Explore more on these topicsSly StonePop and rockSoulobituariesShareReuse this content"

And with the acting A-team ofJulianne Mooreand Sydney Sweeney in the leads, and rock-solid support from Fiona Shaw and Domhnall Gleeson, things look promising. But Sweeney is absent from the drama for too long for the central relationship to be satisfyingly dramatised. And after an intriguing opening, the convoluted narrative doesn’t merely jump the shark but lies down and lets the shark jump over it before the pair of them charleston their way across the rolling Pennsylvanian farmland where the film is supposed to be set.Moore plays Kate, a lonely and unhappy grieving woman who trains horses and gives riding lessons on the farm she now precariously owns. She is divorced from a testy and judgemental lawyer called Richard (Kyle MacLachlan), and the woman she subsequently married has died. She gets some companionship from her no-nonsense neighbour and pal Jessie (Shaw). But the one light in her life is her beautiful, smart but fatally spoiled daughter Claire (Sweeney), who is a screwup and drug abuser for whom Kate has lavished all her money on pointless rehab programmes.One night Claire comes back into Kate’s life, poutingly asking for help, and Kate finds herself encountering a very scary dealer of her daughter’s acquaintance. This is the odious Jackie Lyman (Domhnall Gleeson). When things get very nasty and have to be concealed from the police, Kate must decide how far she will go to protect her daughter.There is some enjoyable and creepy business involving a local lake which can be pressed into service as a disposal area for corpses – the movie put me in mind of lake-centred films such as Scott McGehee and David Siegel’s under-remembered 2001 thrillerThe Deep Endwith Tilda Swinton, and classics like John M Stahl’s Leave Her to Heaven from 1945, orGeorge Stevens’s A Place in the Sunfrom 1951. But then the film gets mired in some very credulity-stretching stuff about what has to happen when bodies need to be recovered and the twisty finale is overwrought and silly. The estimable cast all do their utmost but the overall effect is frustratingly implausible.Echo Valley is in cinemas and on Apple TV+ from 13 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsJulianne MooreFiona ShawKyle MacLachlanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Disney has been playing this cynical game since 1994 – releasing their Jungle Book remake (the one starring Jason Scott Lee) the same year DreamWorks was founded – and striking gold with Tim Burton’sAlice in Wonderland(2010), which arrived in theatres just weeks before the original How to Train Your Dragon landed.Materialists review – Celine Song’s Past Lives follow-up is a mixed bagRead moreIt also comes as no surprise that DreamWorks moved with Night Fury speed to revisit a movie that’s only 15 years old. As the recentLilo & Stitchproved, there’s plenty box office gold to mine from introducing new children to a young and beloved property, while banking on the nostalgia that a generation without fully formed frontal lobes would carry for the not-so-distant animated films and TV spinoffs they were weaned on.The younger audiences will no doubt be dazzled by the new How to Train Your Dragon, with its simple and appealing “ET but with Vikings” tale, which now features flesh-and-blood actors, some real landscapes and crashing blue waves (emphasis on “some”) and a still rascally and adorable Toothless – the name given to its central flying reptile. Meanwhile, the slightly older kids will probably find this retread functional and satisfying enough – as my own teens did – while being able to clock the diminishing returns.Director Dean DeBlois, who helmed the original alongside Chris Sanders, returns, staying protective of and faithful to the original, in which an outcast adolescent named Hiccup (voiced with nasally anxiety byJay Baruchel), who is raised in a community insistent on slaying dragons with extreme prejudice, befriends Toothless, the aforementioned Night Fury with the jet-black sleekness of a panther but cuddly nature of a house cat.The script, the gags and the action remain mostly intact. But this time around, real actors and sets become deadweight to a story that soared in larger-than-life animated form.Some of the reasons are pretty obvious to anyone who spent enough time with these live-action remakes. The green screen aesthetics, rendering surrounding environments (not to mention still computer-generated dragons), are less convincing and simply pale in comparison to the glorious images that made the original How to Train Your Dragon stand apart. Some scenes, like an opening night-time siege in which the Vikings of Berk, Hiccup’s village, battle dragons, are so muddy and low contrast that you can’t even make out the action. “The views are nothing to complain about,” says Hiccup, now played by Mason Thames, in the opening narration, where we can barely see a thing.It’s worth noting that the legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins was a visual consultant on the earlier movie. His influence is felt in the elegant animation, when faces and rustic sceneries often appeared beautifully lit by the glow from a nearby fire, or when Berk’s highland mist was just thick enough to achieve an emotional quality. In the most breathtakingly romantic moment from the original, when Toothless carries Hiccup and Astrid, the girl he cozies up to, into the skies, the pink-hued atmosphere tilts on an axis around the characters.The new movie – so often shackled to a more static camera that can’t replicate the dynamic motion of the original (or even find a decent angle) – doesn’t even attempt that shot. Nor do the actors attempt a lot of the fun physical comedy and action from the original. It’s already a struggle for them to just incorporate the dialogue’s humour, written for pixels, into corporeal form.Thames (of The Black Phone fame) plays Hiccup as slightly more petulant than petrified. As Astrid, Nico Parker plays things more cool than spunky, filling in her tough Viking girl performance with shades of bitterness over the class divide between her and Hiccup, whose father Stoic is the village chief. As Stoic, Gerard Butleris the most at home, not only because he’s reprising his role from the original, but because he has his own cartoonish demeanor that works spectacularly in both animation and live-action.If there’s one moment that nearly grasps the visceral thrill of the original, it’s the centrepiece Avatar-like flight sequence, when Hiccup and Toothless sync up and soar through skies. The moment falls short of the simple and pristine beauty from the animated movie, when Toothless carves the clouds with his wings, but it’s got the same rollercoaster momentum as the dragon grazes the water and ducks through cavernous landscapes, the audience riding on his back alongside Hiccup. For many, that sequence will be worth the price of admission.Perhaps another benefit to revisiting the franchise today is the opportunity to absorb the post-9/11 war on terror allegory that DeBlois and Sanders introduced to their original adaptation, in which the dragons rain down destruction from the skies.Cressida Cowell’s 2003 source novel wasn’t about jingoistic and bloodthirsty Vikings who fear and seek to wipe out a misunderstood enemy desperately defending themselves. That element is exclusive to the movies, in which Butler’s Stoic yells: “They’ve killed hundreds of us.” Hiccup, defying the dominant narrative in his community, responds: “And we’ve killed thousands of them.”The way those lines resonate today, as the war on Gaza rages on, will probably go over the heads of the target audience. But it’s a message worth repeating, even when packaged in muddled live-action form.How to Train Your Dragon is out in cinemas on 13 JuneExplore more on these topicsAction and adventure filmsGerard ButlerreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now he has confected a syrupy new musical take on Romeo and Juliet, with music by his brother Evan Kidd Bogart (who won a Grammy for his work on Beyoncé’s single Halo).Bogart retells the basic story but with Shakespeare’s language all removed and replaced with olden-days-effect prose: a kind of bardless Baz Luhrmann. Ultimately – with what I do have to admit is some amiable cheek – Bogart contrives to do for this play whatNahum Tate did for King Lear. It’s really pretty bland, and with each turn in the plot you have to ask what the point of it actually is.Clara Rugaard has an honest stab at Juliet and in an actual production of the play (that is one which hadn’t hobbled itself by amputating its whole linguistic identity), she might have made a real impression. Jamie Ward smoulders and fizzles damply through the role of Romeo. Elsewhere, there’s a whole host of big names phoning in small contributions. Jason Isaacs is Montague (Romeo’s dad),Rupert Everettis Capulet (Juliet’s dad) and Rebel Wilson is weirdly and unwontedly deadpan as Lady Capulet. Derek Jacobi gives it loads as the gentle, avuncular, silver-bearded Friar Lawrence who is on the side of the star-crossed lovers and Dan Fogler is the apothecary whom this production reinvents as Jewish, helping people escaping antisemitism. Romeo gets an actual physical confrontation with Paris (Dennis Andres), the young man that Juliet’s parents have earmarked as her fiance.There is no radical reinterpretation ofRomeo and Juliethere, and the staging, costumes and performances look as if they come from something as trad as Zeffirelli’s 60s version … only it’s modern-language. Not worth the two hours’ traffic of their stage.Juliet & Romeo is in UK cinemas on 11 June, with an Australian release to be confirmed.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsMusicalsRomeo and JulietWilliam ShakespeareJason IsaacsRupert EverettreviewsShareReuse this content"

But then Brexit happenedGaby HinsliffTue 10 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 06.46 EDTSharePolitics is awful.If you want the digested read of Sarah Vine’s memoir on life as a Westminster WAG, that’s it: politics, she writes, is a hateful business that ruined her marriage toMichael Gove, her health and happiness. (Don’t ask what the Cameron years did to anyone else: this book is absolutely not about anyone else.) But like many a passionate hatred, this one started out as love.In the book, Vine describes the “pinch me” moment early in the first Cameron government when she realised she’d made it; that the girl who never felt she fitted in, either growing up in Italy or at her English boarding school, is finally hanging with the cool kids. “Me, Sarah, the awkwardinglesina, friends with the prime minister, being waited on hand and foot by staff at Chequers.”If that makes you want to throw something, you probably won’t enjoy this tale of yearning for political paradise lost, AKA all the boozy nights “swimming in White Ladies” (David Cameron’s favourite cocktail) and hedonistic girls’ trips to Ibiza with her new best friend Sam Cameron which ended when Brexit blew their gilded circle apart. But if you’re less interested in politics than in how a grown woman could end up building so much of her self-esteem on a glittering friendship – well, buckle up for quite a ride.Like the veteran Daily Mail columnist she is, Vine writes unsparingly and grippingly about some deeply intimate subjects: the childhood she says left her feeling worthless; the awful postnatal depression she endured when her children were tiny; the death threat to her husband delivered in an 18th birthday card sent to her daughter; the slow death of their marriage and the commendably civilised divorce they ultimately managed. Rather sportingly, she gives her ex-husband space to explain his version of events at critical points; more unsettlingly, she also interviews and quotes their only-just-adult children. If that seems somewhat lacking in boundaries – well, the Camerons’ inner circle was all about blurred lines.The book opens the morning after the 2016 referendum, with the leave-supporting Gove-Vines queasily confronting victory. Although it’s a moment that changed the country, Vine’s focus is firmly on how it affected her social circle and particularly her once cherished but now broken friendship withSamantha Cameron, the scab she can’t stop picking.View image in fullscreenSamantha Cameron and Sarah Vine at the state opening of Parliament, 2010.Photograph: PAThe clue to why that lost friendship matters so much lies perhaps in her childhood. Her father, she writes, would tell her that she was an accident who would have been aborted if only it was legal; that she was too fat, a dud, a disappointment. Moving in exalted circles as an adult was a way of proving he was wrong. He didn’t even mention her in his father of the bride speech at her wedding, she says, but she could at least look at their A-list guests (including the young Camerons) and think ‘how far I had come that these were my actual friends’. But were they, really?Although it’s politics she mostly blames for pushing her and Gove apart, the strain of trying to keep up with his richer Oxford mates seemingly didn’t help. (Readers who also found the austerity years hard going thanks to David Cameron, but for very different reasons and on considerably smaller salaries, may well struggle to sympathise.) The pressures of government further strain relations between the two couples, especially after Gove gets demoted in a reshuffle. Soon she’s starting to wonder whether Sam Cam sees her more as glorified staff, handy for helping with school runs, than a real friend.When an angry David Cameron tells her she needs to rein in her husband over Brexit, she writes of feeling like a servant ordered about, sensing an “abyss of class” between them. Yet to the reader, it looks more like an abyss of understanding, a failure on her part to grasp how existential this referendum is for the Camerons and the country: even when Samantha lets rip at her over Brexit, she wonders why the fact that their kids grew up together isn’t trumping some stupid political disagreement, as if it were the political not the personal that was trivial at this point.“There was a sense that my career and my husband’s didn’t matter as much as theirs,” she writes at one point, following friction over her taking a job at Sam’s bete noire, the Mail. “That we had to compromise our views and beliefs in order to facilitate their life at Number 10.” To which one can only say: which part of him being prime minister did you not understand? They say it’s lonely at the top. What this book proves is that it can be even lonelier on the way down.How Not to Be a Political Wife by Sarah Vine (HarperCollins Publishers, £20) is out on 19 June.

Writers who land in agents’ inboxes with collections of stories are invariably told to come back when they have a novel, and to write about what they know. Johal’s stories were set in a world he knows intimately – the immigrant communities of west London – but they moved between professions and generations with thrilling confidence.Saraswati is also populated by a large cast of diaspora Punjabis. But where Johal’s collection stood apart from the landscape it was published into, his first novel is a representative example of a ubiquitous 21st-century genre. That genre lacks a name – in 2012, Douglas Coupland proposed “translit”, which didn’t catch on then and certainly won’t now – but its features are all too recognisable. These novels contain multiple narratives, each set in a different country if not continent, often in a different century. Although long by modern standards, they are packed – with events, themes, facts. They address themselves to the big questions of the day, not by the traditional means of examining urban society but through a kind of bourgeois exotic. The characters are paleontologists, mixed media artists, every flavour of activist, but never dentists or electricians. The settings are often remote: tropical islands or frigid deserts.The reader puts these novels together, like jigsaw puzzles. This term won’t catch on either, but one could call them “connection novels”; not in the Forsterian sense of human hearts, but rather the ecological, cultural and financial structures that link the globe. In that sense, they have an ancestor in the post-Vietnam systems novels ofDeLilloandPynchon, except without the playfulness or the genuine paranoia. Connection novels might be the only area of contemporary literary fiction that is dominated by male writers:Richard Powers,Hari Kunzru,David Mitchell. Not coincidentally, they owe a lot to science fiction.Saraswati’s characters are connected, although they don’t know it at first, by DNA. They are the descendants of a proscribed intercaste marriage in 19th-century Punjab. Sejal and Jugaad have seven children, each of whom they name for a river. A century and a half later, their descendants include a Canadian rock musician, a Kenyan archaeology professor and a Mauritian entomologist who specialises in yellow crazy ant removal. The role of connector is played by an Indian journalist who eventually takes over from Johal’s omniscient third-person. Beginning and ending in a near-future version of India, the narrative takes us toSvalbard, Tibet, rural British Columbia and theChagos Islands. Brief interludes after each section tell the family origin story through a series of “qisse” – Punjabi folktales, passed on orally.“Saraswati” was the name of Sejal and Jugaad’s seventh child. It is also the name of a mythical river that, as any Indian will tell you, meets – in a sacred rather than geographical sense – the Ganga and Yamuna at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad). Saraswatiderives its title, and its plot, from a theory that claims that the Saraswati was a real river that originated at Mount Kailash in Tibet and flowed to the Arabian Sea.The novel opens with water returning to a dry well on the Hakra farm: once Sejal and Jugaad’s home, now inherited by a young Londoner called Satnam. The water is a sign not of the workings of heaven but of the melting of Himalayan glaciers. But it is soon seized upon as the former – by frauds as well as true believers, and then by India’s newly elected Hindu nationalist government, which embarks upon a nationwide scheme to revive the ancient Saraswati, in part by abrogating the Indus Waters Treaty (a magnificent bit of novelistic prescience; after the book went to press, India did in fact revoke the treaty in response to a terror attack in Kashmir).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But there is also the more particular business of the suitability of writer and form – of whether Johal is playing to his strengths.There are sections of Saraswati that take the abilities displayed in We Move and extend them. Johal is a brilliant observer of romance: of uncertain beginnings and awkward endings. His heartbreaking account of a sexless but totally real marriage between two Kenyans, one Punjabi, one Black, is a worthy successor toNigel Nicolson’s Portrait of a Marriage. Equally surprising and affecting is the story of Mussafir, a teenager in small-town Sindh with a Swiftie-like passion for an Indian singer.These are not short stories manqué; each could have been its own novel. But the narrative of Saraswati insists on containing them; on moving away from, rather than towards, the writer’s gifts. Johal’s imaginative sympathy is undercut by the homogenising evenness of his prose – every character speaks and thinks in the same register, that of London journalism – and by the heavy-handedness of his attempts at symbolism and satire.Saraswati’s unstable blend of realism and allegory ultimately breaks down in the face of its central theme: modern Hindu nationalism. Like other connection novels, it is full of thorough research: intostubble burning,rinderpestand fringe archaeological theories. When it comes toHindutva, however, reality recedes, and the allegory is less Kafka than it is Marvel Comics. Johal’s India is led by a man called “Narayan Indra” (Indra is the Hindu rain god), whose actions and rhetoric are so cartoonish as to drain away all menace and seriousness. His millenarian ravings are a world away from actually existing Hindutva, which might gesture at past golden ages but is always laser-focused on its present-day target: India’s Muslims.The very best writers have had difficulty following up a debut collection with a novel. One reviewer of Philip Roth’s first novel, Letting Go, suggested that writers “should solve the second book problem the way architects solve the 13th floor problem”, namely by going straight from the first book to the third. The disappointments of Saraswati, if anything, reassure for their indication of a willingness to try but fail.

I cannot be French if that nation does not exist; I can’t be a doctor if no one will grant me a medical degree. Social media, however, promises that we can don or doff identities like so many digital masks. We may become persuaded that identities are private goods over which we have rights of ownership and choice, that we can freely select what we “identify as”. The heightened salience of identity in modern political discourse thus represents an unwitting internalisation of the neoliberal view of humans as atomised individuals who navigate life purely by expressing consumer preferences.The idea that the identity of the speaker should count when assessing his or her argument is what the right used to denounce as “identity politics” (now subsumed under the general concept of “wokeness”), though it is in this way a logical outcome of Thatcherite and Reaganite economics. One strong critique of the critique of identity politics, on the other hand, points out that privileged white males, of the sort who make such complaints, don’t have to worry about their identity because theirs is the default one of power and influence – whereas for various minorities identity might matter much more, not least in how it influences the ways in which privileged white males will treat them.Philosopher Alexander Douglas’s deeply interesting book diagnoses our malaise, ecumenically, as a universal enslavement to identity. An alt-right rabble rouser who denounces identity politics is just as wedded to his identity as a leftwing “activist” is wedded to theirs. And this, Douglas argues persuasively, explains the polarised viciousness of much present argument. People respond to criticisms of their views as though their very identity is being attacked. The response is visceral and emotional. That’s why factchecking conspiracy theories doesn’t work. And it’s not just a social media problem; it’s far worse than that. “If you define yourself by your ethnicity or your taste in music,” Douglas argues, “then youipso factodemarcate yourself against others who do not share in that identity. Here we have the basis for division and intergroup conflict.”What we think of as our own special identity is just a suit of borrowed clothesThe escape route Douglas recommends is nothing so banal, then, as policing misinformation or even just being nicer to one another; no, we should strive to abandon identity all together. He deploys close readings of three thinkers from wildly differing epochs and cultures: the ancient Chinese sage Zhuangzi, the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Benedict Spinoza, and the 20th-century historian-critic René Girard. Each of them, he argues, hints at a similar ideal of enlightenment: to abandon our attachment to identity and become one with the undifferentiated flow of all things.This sounds fluffy and improbable in precis, but we should begin by noticing how fragile our own sense of self really is. Douglas says of his three thinkers: “Look within, they would say, and you will find a mess. Introspection reveals only a confusion of qualities.” Oddly, the author doesn’t mention the great Scottish philosopher David Hume, though his is probably the most famous expression of this idea: that what we call the self is, per Hume, “nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement”.If so, it follows that what we think of as our identity must have been drawn from the example of others. This is the meaning of “mimetic desire” as theorised by Girard: that we choose an admired person to imitate and so teach ourselves to want similar things. “Individualism,” Douglas concludes, “is really conformism to a model.” What we think of as our own special identity is just a suit of borrowed clothes.What, then, is the alternative? It is somehow to psychically merge with the “superdeterminate” nature of Spinoza’s concept of God, who exists everywhere and in every thing. Has any human being achieved such a feat? Perhaps, Douglas suggests, Jesus. Another model for us is Hundun, an emperor with no face in an old Chinese fable. His friends drilled holes into his head in an attempt to give him human features, and thereby killed him.Against Identity is a powerfully strange book, melding such matters with enjoyable references to Evelyn Waugh and Jean-Paul Sartre, and a strongly aphoristic turn of phrase. “The ‘inner voice’,” he writes, “is just the noise of others echoing inside your own emptiness.” To the “romantic lie” that says you can be what you want to be, Douglas counterposes the bracing challenge: Don’t be yourself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Whether readers will agree with its proposed solution is more doubtful. It warns against “making value judgments”, but we should make some value judgments, for example about murderers. And Douglas relays the Taoist advice he finds in Zhuangzi like this: “We would be happier and more peaceful letting things flow, vanish, transform, be indistinct, be ambiguous” – which is all very well, but terrible advice if you’re trying to build a bridge.Against Identity: The Wisdom of Escaping the Self by Alexander Douglas is published by Allen Lane (£20).

They decided against it, however, because it would be able to play original Switch games – and 1990’s Super NES had no backwards compatibility with 1983’s NES. After playing with it for the weekend, I’d say a more accurate name would be the Switch Pro: effectively a modernised and highly refined version of the original console, rather than a whole new generation.The larger screen and more powerful processor are the most obvious upgrades, but every facet of the console is higher spec. The larger Joy-Cons feel more robust and are easier to use – the way they magnetically clip on to the console is very pleasing. The user interface is a graceful if slightly boring iteration of the Switch’s, enhanced with subtle haptic feedback and delightfully subtle bleeps and blips.View image in fullscreenThe wait is over … Gamers line up to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 console on Thursday in New York City.Photograph: Shawn Chen/APThe drop back to a standard LCD screen from the gorgeous Switch OLED model will annoy some, but the quality is decent and the increased display real estate makes a huge difference – it’s not quite up there with the very best handheld PCs, but then it’s significantly cheaper than a top-of-the-range Steam Deck or similar. I tested it with the most cinematic launch games I had – IO Interactive’s extremely good value Hitman World of Assassination: Signature Edition and Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut – and both provided a surprisingly epic experience in handheld mode, aided by the console’s extremely good virtual surround sound (you also get full 5.1-ch Linear PCM surround if you use compatible headphones or TV). Just don’t expect 4K, 60fps visuals as standard.In handheld mode, titles will run at between 720 and 1080p resolution, with 4K reserved for docked mode – though even here, only a few titles currently support full 4K resolutions. Cyberpunk 2077, for example, caps out at 1080p with the framerate at 30fps in Performance mode. In short, don’t expect cutting edge PS5 Pro or PC visuals – we’re looking at something between PS4 and PS5.The set-up is simple enough: switch it on, connect to the internet (via wifi or the ethernet port on the dock) and download an update. If you have a Switch it asks you to place it nearby, then copies across your user details and any games you own. The whole process took me about an hour and was completely painless, though beware – if you skip the transfer process, you won’t get another chance later to port your stuff across from your original Switch. GameShare, which allows you to share compatible games with Switch or Switch 2 owners who don’t have their own copy, is extremely easy too. I tried the local two-player option with Sega’s lovely multiplayer puzzle battler Puyo Puyo Tetris. You simply choose the GameShare option from the game’s main menu, while your friend selects GameShare from the Switch home screen; then the two seamlessly connect and you can start playing together.I’m interested to see how the feature holds up with more complex games, or with more players. For example, Survival Kids allows you to GameShare with two other consoles, which will put greater processing demands on the Switch 2 that’s doing the streaming, and could therefore affect performance. For now, I was impressed, and it will work really well with forthcoming party game Super Mario Party Jamboree.View image in fullscreenReady to go … Mario Kart World for the Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoGameChat, meanwhile, Nintendo’s rather overdue version of in-game video chat, requires you to connect and confirm your identity via your smartphone, and then you’re in. You can buy a Switch 2 Camera (£50) for this, but any old USB webcam will do. I think this may well prove a nice extra for close friends or families keen on playing together while apart; we’ll have to wait and see if any forthcoming games make interesting use of it.There are some extra costs to think about. If you want to play with more than two people you may need another set of Joy-Cons, which will set you back £75, or a Pro Controller at the same price. (I tried out the officially licensed PowerA Advantage pad, which doesn’t have rumble and only works in docked mode, but is a really sturdy option for Mario Kart sessions and very good value at £30.) A subscription to Nintendo Switch Online (needed for online play and, when the introductory offer runs out, GameChat) is £17.99 a year for one account, or £31.49 per year for your family. It’s £34.99/£59.99 a year for the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack, which offers access to a large range of retro Nintendo games from all eras and any extra content for modern games. It’s a decent price when compared with other gaming subscriptions, but still another expense to manage. Finally, you may need a microSD Express card if you start running out of space for new games on the built-in 256GB. A 256GB card will cost around £50. It all adds up.As for battery life, Nintendo is promising between two and 6.5 hours. I did a mixed test in which I played Mario Kart World, downloaded and played Hitman, and used GameShare and GameChat, and got about 3.5 hours, which is not bad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you somehow missed out on the original Switch, absolutely yes – it’s the zenith of Nintendo’s quest to make a hybrid handheld/home console, with a wide range of launch games (though currently only one genuine exclusive must-have inMario Kart World) and the promise of many glorious exclusives to come. If you already have a Switch, it’s worth the upgrade if you can afford it – the larger display, the better controllers, the social applications, all make it worth the outlay. It’s reignited lounge multiplayer in our house, my sons readily deserting their rooms to play Mario Kart together, and while this interest will probably ebb and flow, it’s been nice to have that back.The one incontrovertible truth is that Nintendo’s games cannot be played elsewhere. No smartphone, no PC, no Xbox or PlayStation will give you access to the full-fat Mario, Animal Crossing, Pokémon or Zelda titles, and it is exciting to imagine how those experiences will be translated to a new, beautifully crafted machine with a modest armoury of fresh features. Perhaps the design team at Nintendo were right not to call it Super Switch, but for the next few years, a Switch Pro equivalent is more than good enough.TheNintendo Switch 2is available now; £395.99 in the UK, $699.95 in Australia and $449.95 in the USExplore more on these topicsNintendo Switch 2Nintendo SwitchGamesNintendoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Mildly alarmed, I examined my own thumb to find the same evidence of getting over-absorbed in the knockabout, chaotic fun of our tournaments. You can play Mario Kart online now – even with video chat, in World – but it’s just not the same as playing with people on the couch next to you. I imagine this game will revive living-room multiplayer for millions of families.God only knows how many hours I have spent racing Mario and his pals around their cartoon wonderland circuits since 1992 – this series has accompanied me through my entire life, the reliable mainstay that everyone wants to play with me, no matter how familiar they are with video games in general. I have been caught in months-long time-trial wars with my brother and my gamer friends; I have watched laughing strangers play it endlessly at the gaming pub nights that I used to run; I have dropped in and out of races over long evenings with big groups of friends; I’ve played it with almost everyone I’ve ever dated. Mario Kart World allows for all these playstyles and more, an easy-breezy social game that also lets you getextremelycompetitive.View image in fullscreenMario Kart World comes alive in split-screen multiplayer, as it always has, but the online options are robustPhotograph: NintendoIt comes with a veritable Disneyland of courses: ice palaces, a jungle safari, a dinosaur park, a ski slope, a spaceport themed after the 1983 arcade version of Donkey Kong. Some feel like old Mario Kart courses, with tighter turns and clever shortcuts, designed for power-sliding and boosting around the old-fashioned way. Others are wider, more scenic voyages: every course connects to several others, so you can either race laps or drive between hot-spots on what is now a massive interconnected map, letting you drive from the seaside all the way to Bowser’s Castle at the top of a volcano.Outside of the races you can also roam freely, going off-road or even on to the water, hunting down hidden coins and challenges: difficult trick-courses across lava fields, an unconventional route through the sky balanced on the wings of a seaplane, timed coin-collecting. This world isn’t as populous or as beautiful as something like Forza Horizon’s, but it’s still a trip to explore it with friends and find scenic little spots to gather together. The visual language is that of a group holiday: Polaroid snaps, stickers from local shops, regional foods. It’s a shame that free-roam only works online, mind – two or more players on the same console can race together, but they can’t explore together.Speaking of trips: you can still make a Mario Kart World session feel like a tournament, if you want, running laps and competing to find the best lines through particular courses. But it seems to me that the developers want you to experience it instead as a journey. The Grand Prix competitions link courses together so you’re charting a course across this little continent, seeing all the sights as you go. Driving with 24 players on those wide routes from one course to another, it doesn’t feel so much like a race as a chaotic road trip. This is very much the vibe in Knockout Tour, a Fortnite-style elimination race where you can go from first place to 14th in two seconds and trailing players are thrown out of the race every few minutes.The most important change, however, is not the environment, but the movement. You can now charge up a boost-jump to grind along rails, ride walls, and chain shortcuts through the more ambitious courses. This requires fighting against actual decades’ worth of drift-and-boost muscle memory, and during my first days with Mario Kart World it raised the humiliating possibility that I might now bebadat it, after all these years. But once you’ve got the hang of it, it gives racing a new feel even for those of us who’ve been karting forever, adding a bit of Tony Hawk-esque flair.View image in fullscreenMario Kart World’s new-look Donkey Kong reinvents the venerable ape for a new generation.Photograph: NintendoThe cast of characters is broad and ridiculous. You can race as a cow, or a dolphin, or a new-look Donkey Kong hunkered hilariously over the steering wheel. (Nintendo’s venerable ape has now taken on the look that he sported in the recent Mario movie, and dabs in the air whenever you pull off a trick – I now find him nonspecifically annoying, but then, I am old.) You unlock new vehicles all the time, and new costumes for the ones who wear clothes, primarily Mario and his friends. It is impossible not to smile at Bowser in full biker leathers kicking back on an imitation Harley.There are plenty of different assist options for kids and less skilled players, from motion-controlled steering to auto-acceleration and more: my eight-year-old could play without them, and my five-year-old was kept in the running by turning some of them on. It really is an impressively welcoming game, this, generous and detailed and unfailingly fun, different but with the same spirit. It feels like the culmination of something, a synthesis of different philosophies of fun that still nonetheless comes together. The Switch 2 itself does feel like a swish upgrade rather than an all-new console, so it’s a relief that its headline game shows that Nintendo still has a talent for reinvention.Mario Kart World is available now; £74.99 in the UK, $119.95 in Australia and $79 in the US.Explore more on these topicsNintendo Switch 2Mario KartNintendo SwitchNintendoGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Why are deities such as Hermes and the ‘half-blood’ Percy Jackson having a moment in musical theatre?Arifa AkbarTue 10 Jun 2025 09.39 EDTShareAncient Greek dramas have long thrived on the West End stage. In recent times: Sophie Okonedo’s electrifyingMedea, Brie Larson’s high-wireElektraand Mark Strong’s smoothly politicalOedipus. But the likes of Hades and Eurydice are less often found belting out big numbers alongside a dancing ensemble. Until now, it would seem. Mythological musicals are on the rise: Disney’s Hercules opens this month and Anaïs Mitchell’sHadestownis in its second year at the Lyric whileThe Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musicalis going on tour this summer.Hadestown: how Anaïs Mitchell's lo-fi hit became a sensational musicalRead more“Greek theatre has influenced every facet of our lives, from athletics to religion,” says Cedric Neal, who plays Hermes inHadestown. “What better than for it to be translated to the stage with music, choreography and dance?” Neal has a good point: Greek tragedies, in their original incarnations, were traditionally performed with dance and music, so it is fitting for them to take the guise of full-blown modern musical theatre.Hadestown revolves around two ancient tales: Persephone’s abduction by Hades and the doomed romance between Eurydice, who ventures into Hades’s underworld, and Orpheus, who tries to get her out. Hermes is the show’s narrator, delivering some of the plot through songs incorporating gospel, jazz, folk, bluegrass and soul.View image in fullscreen‘Love will conquer all’ … Chris Jarman and Victoria Hamilton-Barritt in Hadestown.Photograph: Marc BrennerMusic is the purest form of telling a story, Neal says, as it touches heart and soul: “That’s what’s so effective, and affecting, about it.” He believes that these myths, set to music, reflect our lives back at us with an added emotional catch. Neal plays Hermes as pansexual: “Hadestown deals with how complex love can be and what we are willing to do [for it], no matter what the government or church or your parents are saying. The story we are telling reminds us that love will conquer all.”The rock musical The Lightning Thief is another hit, currently at the Other Palace in London. Based on the bestselling Percy Jackson book series by Rick Riordan, the story is certainly ancient – of Poseidon’s half-god son and Zeus’s stolen lightning bolt. But it is also about teenagers living in today’s world, feeling like gawky outsiders.Like Hadestown, it ran both off and on Broadway. This new production is directed by Lizzi Gee, who thinks that musical versions of these ancient stories “can take you even more into fantasy lands” and that they allow you to connect through the heightened emotions of the song and dance.View image in fullscreenGods and outsiders … the cast of The Lightning Thief at the Other Palace.Photograph: Manuel HarlanAs its choreographer as well, she had no difficulty in creating movement around these mythic characters. “I always want to be telling the story through dance and these songs are so narratively driven.” She had gone to producer Paul Taylor-Mills about another idea before he suggested this to her. “He said go away, listen to the soundtrack, and think if it’s something you’d like to do. The second I played the opening number I thought ‘I’m in’. Every song is narrative so I could immediately picture it all, because of the imagery through the songs. It was really clear to me how I would stage it.”The show features Percy’s adolescent posse of “half-bloods” (part human, part Greek god) at summer camp. “For me, it’s trying to portray the kids at Camp Half Blood as people who could represent the youth of today, so that they see themselves on that stage and see their stories being told – Percy with his ADHD and dyslexia … I feel like I wanted to say: ‘These are real people and this is our connection with their stories.’”Its stage design, by Ryan Dawson Laight, does not conjure a traditionally ancient realm but one filled with electricity, water and sewage in the above, beyond and below worlds. Characters wear jeans and hoodies “but with something a little otherly to them …”, she says. What has been rewarding to experience is the impact it has had on audiences. “Teenagers who are maybe struggling with isolation or thinking about who they are and feeling different from other people … are so grateful for something they can connect with and connect to … What is remarkable is how many young boys come to watch the musical. It’s very much connecting to young masculinity.”These mythic stories also offer a counterpoint to the “presentation” of ourselves that we so often get on social media, she feels. They offer an exploration of authentic identity and finding our true selves – that, in a way, is the purpose of the classic quests in ancient stories – and contemporary ones, too.View image in fullscreen‘A story about understanding where you fit in and what your strength is’ … Disney’s Hercules at Theatre Royal Drury Lane.Photograph: Matt Crockett ©️DisneyHercules the Musicalhas been adapted from the 1997 Disney animation film, whose music was composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by David Zippel (both are involved in this Disney stage show). Mythological musicals in animated form are not an especially new-fangled idea: DreamWorks has transposed several ancient, biblical stories to screen, their dramas fuelled by music and song, such as Joseph: King of Dreams and The Prince of Egypt (both these stories have since been adapted for the stage).Aspects of the story in Hercules have been reworked, although many of the loved songs are still there, say co-writers of the book, Robert Horn and Kwame Kwei-Armah. “We hope the audience goes ‘I know the music that was in the movie and now I’m going to accept this iteration …’,” says Kwei-Armah.For Horn, the key question was how to adapt mythology “without losing the DNA of what it is” while making it relevant to contemporary society – just as in the case of The Lightning Thief for Gee. “It is a coming-of-age story, for me, but also a story about understanding where you fit in in the world and what your strength is.”Kwei-Armah’s entry point to the myth was through the original story of Heracles, the divine Greek hero who later became known as Hercules in the Roman canon. “What I find interesting,” he says, “is how the story looks at the qualities that make you a god, the trials you have to go through in order to find out who we are, to find your tribe, to be accepted by the tribe you identify with and not just the tribe that is the dominant tribe. Part of the reason I responded to it so strongly when I was asked to join Robert and the team is that I felt it would be fun to investigate authenticity and the idea of being seen through ancient myth.”While they stayed true to the original story on the whole, they have added some new characters. “We were given free rein, says Horn. “That said, there is a musical element to the movie, and certain songs that are iconic. You don’t want to lose those. Our job is to make those songs work organically even if we have to change the story. People are going to come to hear them.” Kwei-Armah concurs: “Go the Distance makes me cry every time that I hear it so there’s no way we would even think about trying to lose anything like that.”What is so powerful about setting these old stories to music? “The fundamental thing behind a musical is the idea ‘oh no, I can’t say it so I must sing it’,” says Kwei-Armah. Horn adds: “These [mythic] stories are all just a little bit larger than life, so lend themselves organically to being musicalised.”Myths also offer eternally relevant stories, their underlying meanings delivered in metaphorical form, says Kwei-Armah. “We love a metaphor and there’s nothing better than a singing metaphor … Ithink we like being able to look back and see our everlasting selves [in these myths]. That lends itself to a melody.”Herculesis at Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London, from 11 June-28 March 2026.The Lightning Thiefis at the Other Palace, London, until 15 June and then on tour from 15 August-1 November.Hadestownis at the Lyric theatre, London, until 15 February 2026Explore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From hits to label struggles, he revisits the highs and lowsTue 10 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 05.17 EDTShareOmar’s fans are united in believing that he’s a genius that should have been a superstar. “The undisputed architect of what we now know as neo-soul”, goes one YouTube comment, acknowledging that the British musician’s albums predate the genre’s US benchmarks such as D’Angelo’s Brown Sugar and Erykah Badu’s Baduizm. Another: “Really don’t know why Omar didn’t go on to be big worldwide.” And then: “D’Angelo was the closest they [America] had to someone of Omar’s calibre and even he pales in comparison from a wholly musical standpoint.”“That’s dangerous talk!”, the musician laughs when I relay the last quote back to him. But 40 years into his career, he’s proud of his musical legacy. “When I started out at 14, I said I wanted to make music that, as soon as you hear the first four bars, you know it’s me,” he says. “I think I’ve achieved that.” His other goal? “To make pure bangers.”Born Omar Lyefook, the 56-year-old is an MBE-decorated multi-instrumentalist, producer, songwriter and sublime singer, who hasscored a musicaland acted in EastEnders. Stevie Wonder wanted to write a No 1 for him, and he’s worked with the neo-soul era’s US greats, including Badu, Common, and the late Angie Stone. While he may not have their profile, he’s put out music since the mid-80s and his importance is acknowledged not just by YouTube commenters but by successive generations of tastemakers and artists, from livestreaming sensationDJ AG– who recently did a pop-up gig with Omar outside a London McDonald’s – to Children of Zeus. As Konny Kon of that Manchester neo-soul duo puts it: “Omar is a national treasure who laid the foundations. His production should be recognised just as much as his vocals.”I meet Lyefook at the Canary Wharf outpost of plush restaurant chain Boisdale, where he’s playing with supergroupthe British Collective. Their website’s no-messing mission statement: “to put the soul back into British R&B and keep it there.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m just a vibes man’ … Omar in 1992.Photograph: Jean-Marc Lubrano/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images“I live in a world where Prince, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston are still alive,” says Lyefook, and he’s not just feeling nostalgic because of music. “There’s certain things about this era where I’m like, can we rewind? All this madness with Trump, the wars …” He pauses. “It’s a lot to get into. I’m just a vibes man.”That’s modest. Lyefook longs for unity on his optimistic ninth studio albumBrighter the Days, a self-described magnum opus over 18 tracks, originally born of lockdown frustration. “I’m closer to the end than I am the beginning, and I refuse to be negative about stuff,” he says. “I need to find the good in everybody.” In person, he’s exceptionally down-to-earth but on record, he has a supernatural gift for blending genres like funk, jazz, samba, hip-hop and salsa, and on Brighter the Days, he turbo-charges this with lush strings. There’s plenty of transatlantic guests, too, plus others closer to home in Brighton – namely his teenage twin daughters. “I had to pay them proper rates. £200!”Lyefook grew up in a musical family in Kent: those Latin influences could have subconsciously come from his Cuba-born grandmother, his Chinese-Jamaican father is a reggaedrummer who put out his son’s first singles on his label, and his siblings are all musicians. He was classically trained at Guildhall School of Music and Chetham’s, and his first professional gig was playing percussion with Paul Weller’s Style Council in Japan in 1989. Weller offered his studio for Brighter the Days and played on the track On My Own. “That dude had [about] five albums out in one year” recently, Lyefook jokes. “It took me seven to get one out.”His breakout moment was in 1990 withThere’s Nothing Like This– and at the time, there really wasn’t. Riffing on Ohio Players’ Heaven Must Be Like This, the gently sinewy soul-jazz ballad detailed a romantic night in, over a seriously memorable groove. “I just pictured a fireplace, a rug … Fuck knows what ‘champagne wine’ is,” he hoots. The song and album of the same name each went Top 20 when they were rereleased on Norman Jay and Gilles Peterson’s Talkin’ Loud label a year later.Lyefook fondly recalls that time: the acid-jazz explosion, driving hisSaab convertiblearound London clubs and getting his trademark eyebrow piercing. But while he earned the respect of critics, execs at the major label that owned Talkin’ Loud offered less support. “Norman and Gilles being DJs, they’re into the music. The higher ups, they’re not,” he explains “They’d say, ‘there’s no budget for videos’, but then they’re giving budgets to all the rock acts.” Those execs asked for his string sections to be played on synths, “so we don’t have to pay the musicians. Then Jason Donovan had a song out on the same label and he’s got theexactsame string section I was using.”His subsequent albums didn’t break him in the US, despite cameos such as Wu-Tang Clan’s Ol’ Dirty Bastard who was enlisted on 1997 track Say Nothin’ for “10 grand, two hookers and a bottle of Baileys,” laughs Lyefook. “I had nothing to do with it!” Meanwhile, in the UK, “it was one in, one out”. An A&R told his manager: “‘We don’t need Omar, we’ve got Craig David.’ It doesn’t matter where I go, there’s something stopping me from getting that attention.” But he doesn’t like to dwell on it. “If I wasted time thinking about that then it might affect my creativity.”Lyefook has released plenty of albums in the following years, and his track It’s So, a euphoric Afrobeat-style shuffle, has endured in DJ sets since it first lit up dancefloors in 2004. He’s rarely stopped gigging, yet he hasn’t put out an LP since 2017. Instead, there have been forays into acting: in 2022, he was on Albert Square for a two-week stint playing Avery Baker, estranged brother of Mitch Baker. “When they showed me the part, it’s a dude who wears a three-piece suit, smoking a cigar, driving a Bentley and playing the piano in the pub.” So not that far from real life? “Exactly. I was like, ‘This is me’.”Brighter the Days took a while on several fronts: finishing songs, finding a label and finalising paperwork with collaborators (he also underwent brachytherapy in 2024 for early-stage prostate cancer). Lyefook wanted Common, who he’d worked with on the rapper’s seminal 2002 album Electric Circus, but it wasn’t to be. “I’m a big believer in timing. First time I was meant to work with Stevie, it took eight years. Don’t set your watch by him, put it that way.”View image in fullscreenOmar: ‘Don’t set your watch by Stevie Wonder!’Photograph: Linda Nylind/the GuardianIn 1992, he was in LA, and his manager also had Wonder as a client. “He played my album to him. Stevie wants to write my first No 1. Fantastic! Midnight, I got the call: come down to the studio. Finally, he’s ready. We’re talking. And then …” He snores. “So that was the end of that session. I waited all day for him to fall asleep.”“Then seven or eight years later, I got a phone call out of the blue when I’m in London: ‘Yo, man, it’s your boy’. Who’s that? ‘Steve!’ Steve who? ‘Stevie Wonder!’ Yeah, bollocks – sing me something. And he did.”For the next two weeks, “I was like his ambassador. I had to take him to restaurants, clubs, hotels. We finally went to the studio, but the song we started with, it’s alright but it’s not blowing my skirt up. And then I had an idea to take him to my friend’s studio where they were jamming” (the result was the 2006 track,Feeling You).Another session involved the late beatmaker J Dilla who Lyefook had met through Common in Detroit around 2000. “We went to a strip club, J Dilla paid for a stripper, and then we went to the studio. It seemed to be a normal Tuesday for him!” Abeatthat Dilla made with Omar in mind was recently rediscovered by Lyefook’s brother, the producer Scratch Professer, but “it wasn’t ready for this album, probably the next one”.Among the guests that did make it on to Brighter the Days is UK rapper Giggs. “I wasn’t that aware of him before,” says Lyefook – Giggs wrote “Yo, uncs!” as he reached out via Instagram. “That’s what they call me now. Well, it’s better than grandpa.”British rap, he says, can be “gritty, and you got to be hardcore” – very different to the “good times, barbecues, chilling out” vibes of soul (though the pair find mutual ground on We Can Go Anywhere, where Giggs invites you to help yourself to his party buffet). Lyefook appreciates grime, he says, but “it’s so not my world. I mean, Stormzy’s album cover [2017’s Gang Signs and Prayer] was how many men in balaclavas? Great artist, but they didn’t have that in Canterbury.”Lyefook once protested the Mobos for not having a soul category. His peers, including Bluey from Incognito, unrolled posters on the red carpet reading Mobos: Where’s YourSoul? “And so they relented and made it R&B/soul – but those are two different animals,” Lyefook laments. “One year I got nominated and Adele’s in the same category. It’s not just a black and white thing, it’s generational. I’m just filler.”The musician is content these days, however, with his elder statesman role. “It used to be, ‘my sister likes your music’. Then ‘my mum likes your music’. Now it’s ‘mynanlikes your music’,” he quips. “I’ve been lucky – they passed it down through the generations.” While other musicians are part-time, he continues, “I’ve managed to make a career that can pay the bills. It’s not ostentatious. I would love it to be. But the love that I’ve been getting has been enough.”Brighter the Days is out now on Impressive Collective and BBE MusicExplore more on these topicsMusicSoulDance musicPop and rockR&BStevie WonderinterviewsShareReuse this content"

A pot spilling over almost without effort. It’s a remarkable tale; one which (apart from confirming that there is a Father Christmas) tells you a lot about modern publishing and the demise of hoary, leather-bound gents making genteel fortunes between trips to the Reform Club.Operatively our story begins in January 1970. Forsyth, ex-Eastern Daily Press cub reporter, ex-RAF pilot, ex-Reuter man in Paris and Berlin, acrimonious ex-BBC correspondent inBiafra, was also becoming an ex-freelance. No commissions, dwindling cash. Thus, wanting other employment, he finally sat down in a series of hotel rooms and – through 35 days flat – wrote a thriller idly planned seven years before on the French reporting stint.It was called The Day of the Jackal, about a plot to kill de Gaulle. His agent sent it, with diminishing fervour, to four publishers who (perhaps because they were asleep) expressed polite disinterest. By August, Forsyth was getting despondent; as a last throw, he dispatched the manuscript to a French firm. They wrote back enthusiastically. He then sent that letter to Hutchinson, who asked for the book on Friday; on Monday he had a fat three-novel contract. Foreign editions of the Jackal now fill Forsyth’s mantelpiece. Over five years it will make him a conservative £250,000.The Day of the Jackal – the hit we nearly missed | Charles CummingRead moreOne throw, but not the last. A Jackal film, directed by Fred Zinnemann opens in London next week (after ecstatic American reviews). Novel two, The Odessa File, is an even bigger world bestseller, and will top another quarter-million with thousands to spare. Novel three, The Dogs of War, lies a chapter or so from completion, poised for a fresh killing next spring. Unless he casts his royalties to the winds, Forsyth, at 34, is rich for life after, perhaps, 100 days solid typing.And that, astonishingly enough, is precisely where he’ll leave it. Three books and no more. The end of the rainbow. What comes next? Perhaps a little scriptwriting. Maybe some magazine reporting. Holidays at a newly purchased Spanish farmhouse. “I’ve always been a loner.” So back to a lone, freelance, journalistic role using the name to get plum assignments and not caring a fig for cash attached because it’s pleasantly irrelevant.Are the books, in any literary sense, good? Not very. Forsyth admits he writes them the way he does because that’s the only way he can write. Straight narrative, packed with voluminous and sometimes excruciating technical detail (all meticulously researched, which is the true grind). Rather like reading, a 350-page Sunday Times Insight grope. The plotting – which is where he starts – often seems ropy (Odessa ends with a confrontation so stagey that Holmes and Moriarty, wrestling on the brink of the Reichenbach Falls, might pause and blush at the thought of it). Soggy globules of reportage verite litter and throttle action (our Nazi-chasing Odessa here goes to see Lord Russell of Liverpool amongst his rambling roses, just as Forsyth plus notebook did). Sometimes you feel nobody’s read the typescript through before it sped to lucrative presses. There are few intricacies, no proper twists or subtleties.And yet, however crude or cumbersome, both (especially Jackal) are surprisingly effective. They exude a naive zest: coatings of detail, poured like thick chocolate sauce over a mingy scoop of vanilla ice, distract attention, criticism, distrust. Perhaps because he’s never read Eric Ambler orGavin Lyallor any of the other masters of the British thriller in any coordinated way, Forsyth is a true primitive, contributing something different and hugely marketable to a defined genre.His method takes a situation and location he knows intimately (by living and breathing it for months and years rather than a fortnight’s impecunious research trip) then fitting a yarn to that morass of background. All the gossip, all the briefings he absorbed at the time and couldn’t quite print. A few characters are fiction; most are lightly spiced fact. In the wake of Jackal, the French government held a small inquiry to find out who’d leaked their secret service structures.Of itself, this method explains best why he’s quitting. The Dogs of War is about an African coup, an African mess (like Biafra), mercenaries, and big European businesses who pull the bloody strings. The Jackal was France, Odessa, Germany – Dogs, Biafra. That exhausts Forsyth’s three spells of foreign experience. Unless he wrote a thriller about newspaper work in King’s Lynn, he’s finished. The only way of recharging would be to disappear in, say, South America for a couple of years – and even then he’d probably need a mainstream job providing a haphazard spray of facts and insights, piles of fuel to spark an idea.It all seems deceptively simple. You sit in his small flat over a dentist’s surgery near Regent’s Park and imbibe an everyday tale of gold-minting life. Forsyth isn’t a Fleming exotic. His dad sold furs in Ashford, Kent. He doesn’t care much for publicity bandwagons or cocktail promotions. His Foyles’ literary lunch speech set brevity records. The car outside is unchanged by success. He likes jeans, Pernod, an occasional night at Tramps. His girlfriend rings to announce she’s got flu. Frederick hunts for some aspirin to take round.Frederick Forsyth: I was an MI6 agentRead moreA fluent, unflamboyant fellow. Not much interested in home politics. Loathes dictators (and blushes when you raise the Spanish farmhouse). Exposé journalism is what he cares about most; he had a high old time in France last year digging round the drug scene for a colour supplement and causing consternation among the Marseille connections. “That was a 20,000 word spiel that caught a few people below the belt. It was nice, you know, to take a trip round the airfield again and not worry about money. I just let my agent negotiate the bread and got on with it.”Talk reporting and he comes alive. The mechanics of writing – 10 pages a day from eight to 12 in the morning make a 300-page book in 30 days flat – and it’s mere iron discipline. Talk events for keener reaction. “I mean, take Lonhro. If you’d written a novel using those facts last year everybody would have said come on, this is a bit bloody melodramatic. Do it in five years and they’ll say: this was how it was.”The method, in short, won’t be buried with Biafra. Nor can one quite see Forsyth vegetating for ever amid sun and cheap booze. He’s like no other novelist because the business of novel-writing clearly interests him hardly at all; the business of bizarre, digging, living eclipses all else. He’s not an author but a recognisable Fleet Street type – there are at least two on the Guardian – phlegmatically fearless, inquisitive, pragmatic, a bit solitary. “A loner,” he says again. At a guess, I’d think there may be more thrillers five years or so hence, when there’s more experience; but as things stand, The Dogs of War will end a weird interlude and Freddie will drift away into the wide, blue, perilous beyond – leaving behind a predictable cluster of imitators, an agent rolling in bread, and four exceedingly chagrined publishers. “So the name fades. So what?”Explore more on these topicsFrederick ForsythFrom the Guardian archiveFictionThrillersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Seven ways to protect yourselfAs big companies become victims, here’s what you can do, from changing passwords to using two-step authenticationRupert JonesTue 10 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareKeep an eye on your inboxAlmost every week seems to bring news of a cyber-attack on a company, or organisation, and fears over what personal data the hackers have managed to get hold of.Last month, the footwear and sports apparel companyAdidas revealed thatsome of its customers’ personal information had been stolen, although it said passwords, credit card and other payment datawere not compromised.In another incident, the personal data ofhundreds of thousands of legal aid applicantsin England and Wales dating back to 2010 was accessed. And these came hard on the heels of cyber-attacks that caused huge disruption atMarks & Spencerandthe Co-op.Clothing shortages, food waste and millions lost each day: inside the M&S cyber-attack chaosRead moreIf a news story emerges about a cyber incident, and it is a company or organisation that you use, or have used in the past, keep an eye out for an email from it. Affected companies will usually contact customers to give them more information about what happened and what they should do.Sometimes it will be a certain category of customer who has had their data stolen, or only people in certain countries.In the case of Adidas, it appears to be those who have contacted the customer service helpdesk in the past, which will rule out a lot of people. Sometimes, the email will bring good news and say you are not one of those affected.If your data has potentially been accessed, there will usually be some information on action you should take, or a link to a “frequently asked questions” page. In some cases, you may be offered free access to a support service run by a cybersecurity company, or credit reference agency.View image in fullscreenIn the case of Adidas, it appears to be those who had contacted the customer service helpdesk in the past who were affected.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesChange your passwordIf you have had any dealings with a company or organisation that has suffered a cyber-attack, change the password you use for that website, or app, immediately.Always make sure you have strong passwords, and do not use the same one on more than one account.The general advice is make each password at least 12 characters long and use a combination of numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and symbols. Avoid things that are easily guessed or can be found online, such as your pet’s name, your birthday or favourite sports team.“A good way to make your password difficult to crack is by combining three random words to create one,”says the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre. It gives as an example something like Hippo!PizzaRocket1.“Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords,” says the online security company NordVPN.Use two-step authenticationTwo-step authentication is something you can set up for your email and other important online accounts to add an extra layer of security.It involves providing something that only you should have access to – typically it will be code generated by an authenticator app or sent to your phone you have registered with the organisation.Turn two-step authentication on for every service that offers it.View image in fullscreen2F can involve a code being sent to you by text message.Photograph: Prostock-studio/AlamyBeware unsolicited emailsPhishing emails used by fraudsters will often reference a cyber-attack that has been in the news to try to hook people in who are customers or users of that company or organisation.Sometimes fraudsters will have personal information which they obtained via an incident, or other means, which can make them sound more authentic.Do not click on a link or attachment in an email, text message or social media post unless you are absolutely sure it is legitimate. It could take you to a fake website or contain malware designed to steal your personal information.M&S has told potentially affected customers that “you might receive emails, calls or texts claiming to be from M&S when they are not, so do be cautious”. It added: “Remember that we will never contact you and ask you to provide us with personal account information, like usernames, and we will never ask you to give us your password.”If someone says they are from a company or organisation you use, and you cannot be 100% sure who you are dealing with, ignore the email, or hang up and find the official contact details if you want to check with it.View image in fullscreenDo not click on a link or attachment in an email unless you are absolutely sure it is legitimate.Photograph: Tero Vesalainen/AlamyMonitor your credit recordIf your personal data has been stolen, it is worth keeping tabs on your credit record (the detailed file of your financial history used by lenders to assess your creditworthiness) in case fraudsters attempt to take out loans or other products in your name.For example, if your employer has been hit by a cyber-attack, the data that may have been accessed could include your name, address, national insurance number, date of birth, bank account, salary and, sometimes, identity documents such as your passport.There is the potential for this type of information to be combined and used to commit identity fraud.The UK’s main credit reference agencies are Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, and you can access your credit report in different ways – some free, some paid-for.Credit KarmaandClearScoreoffer access to your credit report free for life.Experian offers Identity Plus, which will monitor your personal, financial and credit information and alert you if it detects any suspicious activity. It is a paid-for service, but the cost may be covered for you by an organisation if data you hold with it has been stolen.If you are turned down for a financial product, such as a credit card or loan, despite having a good credit rating, or you stop receiving statements from your bank for no reason, it could be a sign someone has been using your identity.Other, more obvious signs are if you start to get letters relating to debts that are not yours, or your bank statement mentions an item you have not bought.Take care on social mediaMost financial and shopping scams start on social media and tech platforms, say banks. Again, be wary, as fraudsters may have obtained details about you that they can use to convince you that you are having a conversation with someone you know.How to protect yourself from scams: six easy ways to stay safeRead moreThere has been a rise in recent years inso-called “Hi Mum” scams, in which fraudsters pose as loved ones on services such as WhatsApp. Someone might get in touch pretending to be a family member and saying they need cash quickly to pay a bill because they have been locked out of their online banking after getting a new phone.Do not rush into transferring money, even if you are told it is urgent. Take time and check that you are really in touch with a relative or friend.Opt out of registeringWhen shopping online, retailers often offer to store your payment card details for a faster checkout next time (sometimes you have to untick a box to prevent this from happening automatically). In some cases, by agreeing to this, you are giving permission for your details to be stored by a third party rather than the company you are buying from.There is less chance someone will be able to fraudulently obtain your card details if you do not allow them to be stored on more retailers’ systems than is necessary – even if it means it takes slightly longer to buy your items next time you use the site.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksConsumer rightsCybercrimeInternetScamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their latest offense, according to a recent New York Times article:opening bar tabs.Bartenders and drinkers alike spoke to the Times about young people’s hesitancy to leave their credit cards behind the bar, instead preferring to close out and pay after every single drink – no matter how many rounds they order.The piece sparked conversations on TikTok and Reddit about gen Z bar etiquette, which some call nearly irredeemable. “Working a bar that is almost exclusively Gen Z, we stopped opening tabs altogether because they’re so bad at even remembering they have a card,” one personwroteon r/bartenders.‘It’s so boring’: gen Z parents don’t like reading to their kids – and educators are worriedRead moreBut does gen Z have the worst bar etiquette? The Guardian spoke to bartenders across the US about which generation behaves best and discovered that younger folks aren’t the horrible customers so many trend pieces set them up to be. Older drinkers often have worse manners – and they don’t have the excuse of inexperience to let them off the hook.Michaela Giunchigliani works in Sonoma, California, at a boutique winery where she serves people of all ages. “By far the most challenging, stressful, taxing – and I say this with love – are the boomers,” Giunchigliani said. “I find that boomers [roughly those aged between 60 and 80] keep this keen eye on any little thing that they can glob onto and say: ‘Well, you didn’t bend over backwards for me.’ Gen Z doesn’t have that same entitlement.”Rachel Phelps, a bartender in Pittsburgh, agreed that the “50-plus” crowd wins the distinction of most demanding. “They’re going to want to pick where they sit, and they’re going to tell you every minor inconvenience. I used to work at a bar that didn’t have air conditioning, and it was always my fault, according to them.”Gen Z, meanwhile, isn’t nearly as fussy. “If I just perform like the bare minimum of what I’m expected to do, we’re good,” Giunchigliani said.Since the legal drinkers of gen Z haven’t experienced bar culture for that long (the oldest in the cohort are 28) many of them don’t know or care about certain bar rituals. Chloe Richards, who tends bar at dives in Brooklyn and Queens, New York, said gen Z is blissfully ignorant of “buybacks”, the old saloon tradition of getting a free drink or shot after a few rounds. (In 2019, the New York Posteulogizedthe ritual, saying gentrification and higher rents killed it off.)But “old heads”, as Richards calls her gen X-and-up patrons, come in expecting the quid pro quo. “They think that after every three drinks, I’m supposed to give them a free one,” Richards said. “That’s not a real thing or a hard rule: it’s a privilege. If you’re a good customer or a patron, of course, but I don’t owe anybody free anything.”Bartenders also said gone are the days when the youngest drinkers wind up the most wasted by the end of the night. Gen Z came of age during a seismic shift in drinking culture: they’re imbibingmuch lessthan previous generations. This means the getting-sloshed baton falls to an older crowd.View image in fullscreen‘People in their late 30s to early 40s usually have higher tabs, but it comes at a cost,’ says Dimitri Gellis, manager at Fatpour Tap Works in Chicago.Photograph: Thomas Barwick/Getty Images“People in their late 30s to early 40s usually have higher tabs, but it comes at a cost,” said Dimitri Gellis, who manages the Chicago sports bar Fatpour Tap Works. “They think they can still drink like they’re in their 20s, but they can’t hang. They’ll order whiskey on the rocks like pros, but after a few they’re holding onto the wall and they don’t take it well when you cut them off.”Gen Z may be drinking less, but that doesn’t mean their bar hangs can’t last for hours – even if they don’t keep ordering. “Something that drives me fucking nuts is when they get like one drink and use that as an excuse to sit at the bar for five hours,” said a Brooklyn bartender who goes by Priz. “Why go to a bar? One drink is not access to unlimited space at a place. You have to do a little more.”Gen Z’s anxiety manifests at the bar counter, too: some of them haven’t yet nailed the quickest way to order a round. “What’s most annoying to me is when people order their drinks one by one when they’re in a group, especially when they all have to think about it,” Richards said. “For me it’s like, let’s get it going, because you’re slowing down the process. Get it together first before you get my attention.”Most bartenders say they understand why gen Z has a hard time in bars. Many spent formative going-out years in the wake of Covid restrictions. “They’re learning how to do this a bit later than the rest of us did,” Richards said. She gets it, but also that inexperience can mess with her tips. “I think young people are just guessing numbers,” Richards said.Ultimately, bartenders say that there’s no magic age for an ideal patron – their work headaches come from people of all generations. Phelps, the Pittsburgh bartender, added that overall, gen Z’s looking for “experiences” on nights out – it’s not really about drinking anymore. In some ways, that makes them easier to serve.“They want to look cute and take pictures,” she said. “The sloppy behavior is just not there the way it was for us when we were younger. It’s definitely better for the people behind the bar. But also, I’m always like, ‘Have some fun! Do something stupid.’”"

Crisp veg with creamy, tangy dressings makes for fresh, bright salads. Follow our experts’ advice on how to make the best slawAnna BerrillTue 10 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhat’s the trick to great coleslaw?Chris, Paignton, Devon“Coleslaw is such an under-rated salad,” says the Guardian’s Felicity Cloake, whose latest book,Peach Street to Lobster Lane, was published last week. “Familiarity breeds contempt.” (As do those claggy tubs you get in supermarkets.) The whole point of coleslaw is that the veg has to be crisp, which is why Cloake shreds rather than grates the cabbage (a mandoline or food processor is helpful here). “That will leave it less mushy. And, if you have the patience, shred the carrot, too.” Cloake tosses the two with salt, vinegar and a little sugar, then leaves the mix to sit: “This both softens and seasons it.” Then, once drained, bring on the mayo: “Don’t go overboard, though – it should be lightly dressed rather than gloopy.”Conveniently, Jessica Prescott, author ofEpic Salads: For Every Mood, Craving and Occasion, has been working on an essential coleslaw guide, and her dressing template goes like this: “Two tablespoons of something creamy [mayo, sour cream, yoghurt], a tablespoon of something acidic [lemon or lime juice, apple cider vinegar], and citrus zest, if you like. A spoonful of mustard, honey or soy sauce can deepen the flavour.”If mayo is your “something creamy”, Richard Turner, chef/partner ofBodean’s, advises adding some soured cream or creme fraiche, too, though Jack Croft, chef/co-owner ofFallow,FowlandRoe, all in London, would ditch the white stuff altogether. He favours dijon mustard, a splash of good-quality vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a load of fresh herbs (chives, parsley): “That’ll be rich enough without feeling heavy.” Cloake often adds horseradish or mustard, plus finely chopped spring onion or chives.Another good tip for counteracting coleslaw that cloys comes from the queen of country herself,Dolly Parton. In her bookDollyWood Presents Tennessee Mountain Home Cooking, she combines dill pickle brine with mayo, white vinegar and seasoning (and adds a minced pickle to the slaw, too).Whatever your poison, it’s then time to prep the veg, Prescott says: “Thinly slice a quarter of a small green, red, savoy or napa cabbage, soak in cold water, then spin dry for maximum crunch.” You could bolster things with grilled corn (“my absolute favourite”), carrot or cucumber: “Grated, finely diced or thinly sliced all work, but if you’re adding water-heavy veg, sprinkle with salt and let them sit first.” Soft herbs, “finely chopped so they integrate rather than dominate”, are non-negotiable, too, as is setting the lot aside for 15 minutes, so “the flavours get friendly”.Once dressed, “taste, taste, taste”, Turner says, because “a slaw’s character changes over time”. And if you’re not eating it straight away, Croft advises to cover and chill. “Just before serving, season with salt and a good squeeze of lemon – this keeps the slaw fresh, bright and avoids clagginess.”There is, of course, a whole world of slaws beyond coleslaw. Start by mixing up the veg: Turner combines a shredded savoy, two finely sliced onions, a julienned granny smith, a thinly sliced green pepper, a jalapeño and chopped coriander and mint. “Mix 100ml yoghurt, the juice and grated zest of two limes, some salt and sugar, and pour over the vegetables,” says Turner, who chills until ready to serve.“I make one with ribboned mango tossed with sliced red onion, chilli and coriander,” adds Maria Bradford,food writerand chef/owner ofShwen Shwenin Sevenoaks, Kent, who brings that together with a lime and maple dressing. “It’s delicious with grilled meat or a whole baked bass or snapper.” The real takeaway here is that slaws are “one of the most flexible dishes around”, Prescott says, so do your worst: “They’re riffable and always satisfying.”Got a culinary dilemma?

I was told my vehicle would be recovered immediately and assessed for repairs on the next working day, and thatthe service would liaise with my insurer. I was also promised a courtesy car.My car was taken into storage over the weekend. Four days later, it had still not arrived at the nominated garage. It eventually arrived on dayfive, and I was informed it would take up to four days to assess. The courtesy car never happened, and I found my insurer had not been contacted.Ilost faith in the service andasked to take my car back and I was told it would cost £991.71 in cancellation fees, including £254.50for storage over the weekend.I arranged a repair myself which came to £1,200, only marginally more than Accident Assist’s bill for messing me around.RB,YorkThe Accident Assist leaflet is unambiguous. It promises a speedy repair, a courtesy car and hassle- and cost-free handling of insurance claims. You received none of these.The storage charges you have been billed for are astronomical and inflated by the delay in removing your car to the garage on the Monday. An online search suggests average storage costs for a car are between £20 and £45 a week.When I queried them, the AA decided it had made a mistake. The £254.50 storage fee, it now claims, is the cost of transferring your car to the garage, and that the cost of its weekend sojourn, also billed as storage, was only £76. It has agreed to refund you the larger sum and a £150 admin fee.As for the delays, AA’s argument is “these things can happen”. The courtesy car, it says, is granted only when the insurer agrees to pay, and the insurer is contacted only when the car has arrived at the repair garage (four days later in your case). Neither of these caveats are mentioned in the terms and conditions.The AA insists it does not take fees from repairers or storage providers, and that it is funded by “combining a number of services together [for] our insurance customers and breakdown members”.AA Accident Assist says: “When the customer chose to withdraw from making a claim, we instigated the cancellation process, which the customer was advised of on the initial call.“We acknowledge that the incorrectly itemised invoice caused confusion and, upon review, we have agreed to reimburse the customer for this error.”You are now appealing to the Financial Ombudsman Service as you feel you are still out of pocket.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Having been instrumental in the reduction of smartphones to metal and glass slabs devoid of distinguishing features, Samsung hopes that going thinner and lighter with a special Edge edition of its high-end Galaxy S25Androidwill prove design innovation isn’t dead.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The S25 Edge is very thin at just 5.8mm thick –ifyou ignore the camera bump on the back – making it a full 1.5mm thinner than its similarly sized S25+ sibling and about the same thickness as a stack of seven credit cards. Its light 168g weight makes it feel even thinner than the numbers suggest and photos don’t do it justice.The extra thinness costs about £100 more than Samsung’s other 6.7in phone with the S25 Edge priced from £1,099 (€1,259/$1,099/A$1,849) placing it between the £999 S25+ and £1,249S25 Ultra.View image in fullscreenDespite its super-slender frame, the S25 Edge looks like any other large Samsung from the screen side.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe large high-quality 6.7in Oled screen is bright, crisp and smooth with a rapid fingerprint scanner embedded in it. The phone’s light weight makes it easier to hold than other big handsets but it still requires two hands to use the majority of the time. Slap it in a case and the thickness advantage is essentially removed, so the Edge is a phone best used without one.The rest of the phone is very similar to other Samsungs. It has Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, plenty of Ram and at least 256GB of storage. It flies through apps, games or anything else you might want to do with a phone. Samsung’s version of Android 15 (One UI 7) works well with plenty of customisation options, though some of the default settings make it a lot more like Apple’s iOS than you’d expect.It is packed with plenty of Google and Samsung’s most advanced AI tools. Some of them are great, such as Gemini; some are handy occasionally, such as the image editing tools, and others can safely be ignored. TheNow barand live notifications, which show ongoing tasks such as music playing in Spotify, are super handy, appearing on the lock screen and in the task bar on the home screen.Samsung will provide the Edge with software updates until 31 May 2032, making it one of the longest supported phones available.View image in fullscreenThe camera cluster sticks out the back of the S25 Edge for almost the full thickness of the phone again.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.7in QHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X 120HzProcessor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:256 or 512GBOperating system:One UI 7 (Android 15)Camera:200MP + 12MP 0.6x; 12MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, UWB and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins)Dimensions:158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8mmWeight:163gView image in fullscreenThe S25 Edge takes about 80 minutes to fully charge, hitting 50% in 26 minutes using a 25W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Edge’s extreme slender design does come with a few drawbacks, the biggest of which is a small battery with a slightly lower capacity than the regular S25. As a result, despite being a large phone the Edge has fairly short battery life. It will last about a day and a half of light usage between charges, so should see out most days, but it falls just short of thesmallest S25and about a day behindthe the S25 Ultra.It also gets a little hotter than other Samsung models when gaming, but if you play a lot of Fortnite or similar games the small battery capacity is probably already a cut too far.CameraView image in fullscreenThe Samsung camera app is fairly easy to use, while the light weight of the S25 Edge helps with one-handed photography.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe other big trade-off for the svelte frame is in the camera department. It only has two cameras on the back, lacking a telephoto sensor as fitted to the rest of the S25 series.The main camera is an excellent 200-megapixel model that is very similar to that on the S25 Ultra. It is a top-drawer camera that is better than the 50MP main cameras on the S25 and S25+. It shoots great photos across a range of conditions, and manages a very good 2x in-sensor zoom to somewhat negate the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera. The 12MP ultra wide camera is solid and can be used for macrophotography, while the selfie camera is very good.The camera app has the same long list of modes as other S25 models, shoots great video and manages to be fairly easy to use. Overall the main camera is excellent and if you never wish to close the distance to objects with a real zoom, it might be all the camera you need.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe titanium frame and hardened glass feel extremely solid despite the phone’s svelte dimensions.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSamsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.The phone isgenerally repairable. Screen repairscost £259 by authorised service centresand include a battery replacement. Samsung also offers aself-repair programme.The phone contains recycled materials, while Samsung offerstrade-inandrecycling schemesfor old devices. The company publishesannual sustainability reportsand impact assessments forsome individual products.PriceThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge costs from£1,099(€1,259/$1,099/A$1,849).For comparison, theGalaxy S25 Ultracosts£1,249, the S25+ costs£999and theS25costs£799. TheGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XLcosts£799, theOnePlus 13costs£899and theApple iPhone 16 Pluscosts£899.View image in fullscreenDespite being thin and light the S25 Edge is still a big phone and hard to use one-handed without a grip or handle.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianVerdictThe S25 Edge is an interesting move for Samsung. I don’t think many people have looked at their current phone and wished it could be thinner versus lasting longer or having a better camera. Most people use a case and that immediately nullifies the small differences in thickness of most premium devices.But using the Edge has reminded me of just how heavy modern big phones can be. It feels so much lighter in the hand, in your pocket or in your bag while still having a big, quality screen. The battery life is certainly not tremendous, but it hasn’t been terrible either, getting through heavy use days with a little left in the tank.The main camera is excellent but the lack of a good telephoto camera might be a deal-breaker for some. I did miss it. And while it feels very solid with a titanium frame and appears tosurvive aggressive bending, I would not want to sit on it in a back pocket.The S25 Edge is a quality piece of hardware, so if you’ve ever wanted a lighter, thinner, big-screen phone, this is it. But for everyone else better options exist from Samsung or others at this price.Pros:brilliant and large screen, super light weight, very thin, excellent main camera, fast fingerprint scanner, good software with seven years of support, top Android chip, latest AI features,Cons:no telephoto camera, relatively short battery life, expensive, deserves to be used without a case, still a two-handed device.Explore more on these topicsSamsungSmartphonesMobile phonesAndroidreviewsShareReuse this content"

I eventually discovered I had a rare tumorBy the time I got a diagnosis, I had seen four different doctors over the span of six yearsTiffanie DraytonTue 10 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTShareMy baby nephew grabbed my arm, eager to show me his toy trucks.“Don’t ever touch me there again!” I snapped.The confusion and hurt on his face stopped me cold. He couldn’t have known that his tiny hand had caused an intense surge of pain.For years, I’d experienced a stabbing pain in my forearm when it was touched or exposed to cold. I don’t remember when it started, but even putting on a shirt made me wince if the fabric brushed against the area. A cold breeze could trigger agony that felt like needles pressing deep into muscle and bone.Snapping at my nephew made me realize I needed help. But when I reported the pain to my primary care doctor, he couldn’t see anything wrong. I could see a tiny bump underneath the skin, but instead of investigating further, he dismissed my concerns as an overreaction.My pain being dismissed was a regular experience for me as a Black woman. Studieshave shown thatphysicians are more likely to underestimate the pain of Black patients relative to their white counterparts.“It’s probably just a bump or bruise that’s taking a while to heal,” he offered.So I waited for it to heal. It never did. Instead, I continued living with the pain.Gen Z in the US: tell us how you spend your moneyRead moreEventually, I attempted to self-diagnose the issue, Googling my symptoms and weighing possible causes. I concluded that I was likely suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, which often results in numbness, tingling and weakness in the hand and wrist. It didn’t explain the sharp pain, but at least I felt as if I was addressing the problem.I wore a wrist splint and tried different stretches and exercises for relief that never came.Two years later, I saw another primary care doctor for a checkup, hoping for an answer. “Do you type a lot?” he asked.I nodded. As a full-time student and a writer, I spent a lot of time behind a keyboard.“Maybe it’s overuse,” he said.He recommended icing the area and taking a break from my typing habits. But that didn’t work. The pain remained, a searing reminder that something was not OK. Ultimately, each primary care doctor I saw gave me unhelpful diagnoses: a muscle issue, overuse, anxiety – or my imagination.Over half a decade after I first disclosed my pain to a doctor, another one made a simple suggestion: “Maybe you should see a dermatologist.”At 25, I had never been to one. I thought dermatologists were for wealthy women chasing eternal youth, and I generally avoided specialists because I didn’t want to put further pressure on my limited budget. “A lot of people skip their annual derm visits because they either ‘feel fine’, think skin issues are purely cosmetic, think skin cancer is not as common as it is, or just don’t realize how important prevention is,”Dr Mamina Turegano, a board certified dermatologist at Sanova Dermatology in Louisiana.“One of the biggest barriers I see is cost – whether it’s high copays, lack of insurance or out-of-network providers,” she said. “On top of that, dermatologist appointments can be hard to come by, especially in rural areas or underserved communities.” Turegano suggests talking to your insurance company about providers, seeking out community health clinics and asking offices about payment plans or sliding scales.I needed answers a primary care doctor couldn’t provide, so I called my health insurance provider to ask about coverage. Happily, I discovered that medically necessary dermatology istypically covered by health insurance.Within a couple of weeks, I was in a dermatologist’s office explaining my symptoms. She gently touched the area and acknowledged the small nodule beneath the skin.“I’m going to have to open it up and take that out,” she said.I was shocked – I hadn’t even known dermatologists performed surgery. Moments later, my arm was numb and she made a small diagonal incision over the spot. Then she snipped out a pinkish growth and stitched the skin back up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what workedRead moreShortly after, I had a diagnosis: a glomus tumor, which is a rare, typically benign growth. (Malignant glomus tumorsare even rarer.) They arise from glomus cells, which help regulate blood flow and temperature. Most often, they develop under fingernails or on fingertips, but they can appear elsewhere – including the forearm. Though tiny, glomus tumors can cause excruciating pain, especially when touched or exposed to cold. Adults aged 30 to 50 are most likely to experience them, but the reason they developremains unknown.By the time I got this answer, I had seen four different doctors over the span of six years – a delay that mirrors the average experience for many patients with glomus tumors. On average, it takes about seven years for patients to get an accurate diagnosis. In one documented case, thedelay stretched to 40 years.“Oftentimes, patients are seen by more than one physician before they are able to get a diagnosis,” said Dr Chaitanya Mudgal, associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School. “Not for lack of training – just because of how rare and uncommon they are.”Because glomus tumors are small, benign and unfamiliar to many physicians, they’re frequently misdiagnosed or overlooked.“Even MRIs often miss them,” Mudgal said. “They can be as small as a couple millimeters, which is why they are hard to see with the naked eye.”More generally, it’s common for patients to arrive at a specialist’s office after years of having their concerns dismissed.“I see it more often than I’d like – cases where a rash, growth or pigment change was either misdiagnosed or brushed off by a primary care provider,” said Turagano. “I’ve had patients come in after months, sometimes years, of dealing with something that ends up being a rare autoimmune condition or an unusual presentation of skin cancer. That’s why I always advocate for specialist care when it comes to the skin – dermatologists are trained to spot the subtle stuff that others might miss.”Most dermatologists are capable of removing glomus tumors located near the skin – as was true in my case. “Skin surgery is a core part of our training,” said Turegano. “We learn how to remove lesions with precision while minimizing scarring and preserving function and aesthetics, especially in delicate areas like the face.”However, orthopedic surgeons are often best equipped to treat glomus tumors, especially when they are deeper or near bones, nerves or joints. Their knowledge of the musculoskeletal system and access to advanced imaging make them especially effective at spotting growths that might be missed by others – even on MRIs.Surgical removal typically cures glomus tumors, said Mudgal. However, complete removal can be difficult because they are hard to tell apart from normal tissue.After the tumor was removed and the incision healed, my pain disappeared. I no longer had to brace myself for the winter breeze or carefully get dressed. I gave birth to my daughter a few months later and wasn’t preoccupied with fear that her touch would cause me to lash out like I once had at my nephew. I felt so much freedom and relief.The lessons from spending years with a painful, easily curable condition have stayed with me. I always remind family and friends that pain is a real indicator that something is wrong. Even if someone tries to minimize it, it’s worth seeking a definitive diagnosis and treatment.Tiffanie Drayton is a journalist and author whose work explores health, identity, family and personal transformationExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Natural dykes of black igneous rock – cooled magma – jut out into the ocean here. The houses on shore are backdropped by grassy cliffs.We know that this giant proto-crocodile once roamed here because it left behind footprints – which can still be seen today. “This is older than the dinosaurs,” says Malcolm Wilkinson ofArran Geopark, as we crouch down next to the trace fossil. I place my hand in the massive print and attempt to imagine the world millions of years ago, when Scotland sat just north of the equator and the climate was tropical.Arran mapAfter they were made, Malcolm says, these footprints were covered in layers of silt, deposited by water or wind, which protected them from erosion and created a natural mould. Over the next few million years, layers of sediment gathered and compacted on top, cementing the grains and turning the soft mud around the footprint into solid red sandstone. The footprints turned into fossils, and were thrust back to the surface when theAtlantic openedabout 60m years ago, tearing Europe and North America apart.View image in fullscreenMalcolm Wilkinson (left) and the author examine a chirotherium footprint.Photograph: Stuart KennyAs the younger rocks slowly eroded the trackway became visible. Similar prints were first discovered in the Victorian era, and the creature was named chirotherium – “hand-beast” – because the fossils look like giant, human handprints.Just off the west coast of Scotland and reachable in a little over two hours from Glasgow, Arran has long been known for its rocks, regularly welcoming groups of hard hat-clad students on field trips. In April, it becameScotland’s newest Unesco Global Geopark(there are two others, in Shetland and the North West Highlands), in recognition of the world-class geology here, which records tectonic plate collisions and shifting continents.To walk around Arran is to walk through 600m years of Earth’s history, and my plan is to hike the 65-mileArran Coastal Way, which circumnavigates the island, over six days. Thankfully for laymen like myself, the history is spelled out through informative Geopark signage along the way.As the ferry approaches Brodick, the serrated silhouette of the northern mountains comes into focus, the sandstone castle nestled in the greenery below and the mysterious lump of the “Holy Isle” drawing the eye south. The island is divided by the Highland Boundary Fault, a geological line where tectonic plates once collided, separating Scotland’s rolling lowlands from the mountainous highlands.View image in fullscreenA lightning bolt recorded as a fossil in Corrie.Photograph: Stuart KennyOn day one of the Coastal Way I head up Goat Fell, Arran’s highest peak (874 meters), and witness this: the granite mountains of the north have jagged ridgelines and tower over deep glens, sculpted by glaciation, while to the south the scenery is soft and green.That evening I stay at theCorrie Hoteland follow a Geopark leaflet to the spot where a sand dune was struck by lightning 270m years ago, locking it in timea stone’s throw from the centre of the village. Staring at this “fossilised fulgurite” and imagining that desert lightning bolt is like staring into a different universe.Along the coast is another trackway, in a remote spot where Arran’s only coal seam was exposed to the surface. This one was left by a six-foot millipede that lived 300m years ago, and would be easily missed without the small, oak Geopark signpost. A pod of dolphins swims by as I reach it, stealing the scene, jumping joyfully just offshore.Staring at this ‘fossilised fulgurite’ and imagining that desert lightning bolt is like staring into a different universeFour miles north sits the most famous geological site on Arran – Hutton’s Unconformity. James Hutton, the father of modern geology, visited the island in 1787. At Newton Point, a rocky outcrop in the north of Arran, he observed rock contact between gently sloping sandstone and older, steeply dipping schists. This led Hutton to reason that if natural processes had occurred in the past at the same rate observable in his day, this formation, and so the Earth, must be millions and not thousands of years old – as was widely believed by scholars at the time.View image in fullscreenArriving at Lochranza.Photograph: Stuart KennyHappily, a holidaying geologist is on hand to explain this to me, though he is, by his own admission, “more excited about the bloody otter” he’d just spotted.I eat fish and chips at the community-ownedLochranza Country Innand collapse intoLochranza Youth Hostel. A simple (but private) bunk bed provides all the comfort I need. The next day I walk a mighty 19 miles along the boulder-filled coastline and quiet roads around the west of Arran, camping near King’s Cave, where iron age crosses are carved into the stone, and watch gannets dive bomb into the sea as the sun sets over the Kintyre Peninsula.Occasionally, I abandon the geological hunt altogether and stop to watch otters fishingOccasionally, I abandon the geological hunt altogether; stopping to watch otters fishing, indulging in a whisky and chocolate tasting at the newly openedLagg Distillery, or relaxing atThe Lagg Inn, whose leafy beer garden is tucked away next to a river.As my walk happens to coincide with perhaps the sunniest week in Arran since Scotland sat at the equator, it isn’t hard to convince Malcolm to meet me down at Kildonan shore. “This really is a world-class geological site,” he tells me, pointing to the shoreline. While we wait for the tide to reveal our “pre-dinosaur” footprint, Malcolm explains the science of the nearby dyke swarms – the black “walls” jutting into the sea. “They’re magma which was forced up vertically through cracks in the Earth, and have since eroded away,” he says. “This is a record of a time Europe and North America were pulled apart; and the Atlantic was born.”‘Scotland in miniature’: why the Isle of Arran is perfect for a family holidayRead moreSeals lounge around on these globally significant rocks, digesting their breakfast in the sun. “The special thing about Arran is that it has rock types from basically every geological period of the last half billion years,” Malcolm says. “We’ve got the main part of the history of the Earth here – and it’s so accessible.”Off shore sits the microgranite mound of Ailsa Craig, home to an enormous colony of gannets, and Pladda, an island with a scenic lighthouse, sitting on what was once molten magma.View image in fullscreenA view of Brodick Bay with Goat Fell in backdrop.Photograph: Stuart KennyThat evening, via the plummeting waterfalls of Glenashdale, I reach Whiting Bay, and watch an otter scurrying in the sunset before setting up camp. With careful consideration for tide times, my final day skirts along boardwalks and seabed to Lamlash, Arran’s most populous village.I stop for a swim at a secluded bay and oystercatchers (my constant companions on the walk) squeak their farewells. Brodick soon welcomes me back with its sublime mountain vistas. As my ferry sails back to the mainland I gaze back at Goat Fell, and the words of the writer Nan Shepherd come to mind: “the shortsighted cannot love mountains as the longsighted do”.TheCorrie Hotelhas doubles from £115B&B,Lochranza Youth Hostelhas private rooms from £42or dorm beds from £20,Lagg Innhas doubles from £170.For more information, seeVisit ArranExplore more on these topicsScotland holidaysWalking holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With the outbreak of the conflict, the Palestinian from Rafah managed to leave prison, though the circumstances of his release remain unclear to this day.For a while, Abu Shabab vanished from sight. That changed last week when Israeli defence officials acknowledged they had begun arming a clan that calls itself the Anti-Terror Service. It consists of about 100 armed men who operate in eastern Rafah under the command of Abu Shabab, whose nickname is “the Israeli agent” and who is described as a “traitor” on social media in the territory.The officials said the Israel Defense Forces’ goal was “reducing Israeli military casualties” while systematically undermining Hamas. But critics have warned that the Israeli-backed criminal gang could push Gaza to the brink of civil war.Abu Shabab, 32, has emerged as a powerful figure, exerting control over aid routes near the strategically vital Kerem Shalom crossing, while members of his group are accused of looting trucks carrying food, and of having ties to jihadist groups.Last month Jonathan Whittall, the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in occupied Palestinian territories, said: “Theft of aid since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs,under the watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point into Gaza.”When contacted by the Guardian, Whittall said he was “referring to gangs such as Abu Shabab”.In a written interview with the Guardian, Abu Shabab blamed Hamas for the war in Gaza, defended himself from the accusations of looting and insisted his clan was providing security to aid trucks passing from the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza.“My activities are humanitarian and it’s for my people only,” Abu Shabab said. “We are providing security in areas controlled by our national forces and providing support to hundreds of families, with hundreds of people flocking to our areas every day.”View image in fullscreenTrucks waiting at the Kerem Shalom crossing between southern Israel and the Gaza Strip.Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty ImagesSeveral videos circulating on social mediain Gaza from his Facebook profile, verified by the Guardian with his associates, show members of Abu Shabab’s group operating alongside Israeli soldiers in IDF-controlled areas in southern Gaza.Asked if his group was acting in coordination with Israeli forces, Abu Shabab said: “We do not work directly with the Israeli army.”The Times of Israel cited defence sources who said Israel had provided members of Abu Shabab’s faction with Kalashnikov assault rifles, including some weapons seized from Hamas.Since Israel eased its blockade on aid to Gaza, dozens of lorries carrying food have been entering the territory each day, crossing through Kerem Shalom and moving towards Rafah, where Abu Shabab has set up a series of checkpoints.A diplomatic official told CNN that theGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF), the new US-backed organisation tasked by Israel with distributing supplies in the territory, had contact with Abu Shabab, “whether directly or indirectly”.Asked if he had a collaboration with the GHF, which is distributing food at three sites in Rafah, Abu Shabab declined to comment.Reached by the Guardian, a spokesperson for GHF said: “We provide our own security and do not have any local security. Our trucks have never been protected by Abu Shabab or anyone else.”Without providing any evidence supporting his claims, Abu Shabab – whose responses appeared contradictory and were often undermined by his previous statements or by verifiable evidence – blamed Hamas for looting trucks carrying food into Gaza.“We do not take anything from the aid trucks,” said Abu Shabab, who did not respond to calls or texts but corresponded through an email address provided to international news outlets and confirmed by his associates. “Aid is stolen in areas controlled by Hamas.”However, in an interview in November 2024with the New York Times, Abu Shabab admitted that his men had raided half a dozen aid trucks since the start of the war. “We are taking trucks so we can eat, not so we can sell,” he told the paper, saying he was feeding his family.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Since Abu Shabab’s name began appearing in the media, Hamas has publicly declared it is intent on killing him. Abu Shabab has reasons to loathe Hamas. The militant group killed his brother last year and has already tried to kill Abu Shabab at least twice.“The war will not end as long as Hamas insists on its position,” Abu Shabab said.On Wednesday the Israeli news channel i24reportedthat Israeli soldiers clashed with Hamas members in order to protect Abu Shabab from being killed, which resulted in deaths on both sides.Although the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did not name Abu Shabab, he has admitted to having “activated” clans in Gaza that he says oppose Hamas.Netanyahu’s comments sparked a row in Israel, with opposition leadersaccusing the governmentof transferring weapons to a group of thugs and criminals “who identify with [Islamic State]”.Abu Shabab’s links with Israeli forces were confirmed by his family, which issued a statement last week formally disowning him. “We will not accept Yasser’s return to the family. We have no objection to those around him liquidating him immediately,” they said.The rise of Abu Shabab as the first openly acknowledged Palestinian collaborator with Israeli forces since the start of the Gaza war could, according to many analysts, ignite a dangerous new phase of the conflict.In addition to clashes with Hamas, his clan may soon face violent confrontations with rival gangs and members of Gaza’s popular committees,Israeli media report.They say it is the kind of environment where civil wars often take root – and where civilians, once again, are likely to bear the heaviest cost.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But the hunt for their remains is being complicated by some modern-day inhabitants: tens of thousands of US soldiersWritten byJustin McCurryVideo and photos byDavid LeveneTue 10 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 05.46 EDTSharePart 1The Bone HunterToday, the tranquility of this road dissecting the Okinawan jungle is broken only by occasional passing cars and wind rustling through the foliage. For centuries it was a well-worn bridleway in the town of Itoman, on the island’s south-west coast. But 80 years ago, the clip of hooves gave way to the crackle of gunfire, when this sub-tropical Japanese island 1,000 miles south of Tokyo became the scene of the bloodiest battle of the Pacific war.When the fighting ended three months later, 200,000 Japanese and Americans were dead, including an estimated 90,000 civilians – around a quarter of Okinawa’s non-military population. Many died during the US invasion or from starvation; others killed themselves in groups on the orders of the Japanese military, huddling in caves before detonating grenades – an irreversible flight from the terror of the “typhoon of steel” raging outside.View image in fullscreenTakamatsu Gushiken searches inside caves in Itoman, Okinawa, for the remains of victims of the Battle of Okinawa. 23 June 2025 is the 80th anniversary of the end of the battle.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianTakamatsu Gushiken wonders if something similar happened to the owner of a bone fragment he has uncovered deep inside one of the caves, known locally asgama, that dot Okinawa’s southern reaches. In some, Japanese soldiers laid in wait for the advancing Americans; in others, families – usually women and children – prayed for the guns to fall silent.“I think it’s from the hand of a young boy or girl,” says Gushiken, a 71-year-old volunteer “bone hunter” who has spent decades scraping away at the hardened crust of Okinawa’s cave floors in search of remains that would otherwise stay buried where their owners died. “But it is impossible to say if they were killed or committed suicide.”When the battle ended, the corpses of civilians and men in uniform were scattered over the fields. For the survivors, their island now under US military occupation just weeks before the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, life could only restart once they had attended to the dead.“The first thing they did was collect the corpses,” Gushiken explains. “There were lots of dead bodies, on the roads, in villages, even in the back yards of their own homes.”Watch the film10:41The Bone HunterUnearthing the horror of war in OkinawaThis Guardian documentary follows peace activist Takamatsu Gushiken, 71,\n\t\t\t\tsearches for the remains of people who were killed during the Battle of\n\t\t\t\tOkinawa, one of the bloodiest chapters in the second world war. As the\n\t\t\t\tUS seeks to bolster its military presence on the island, due to its\n\t\t\t\tclose proximity to China, Taiwan and North Korea, we explore the\n\t\t\t\tmulti-layered tensions that have haunted the people of Okinawa for 80\n\t\t\t\tyearsDirector and Cinematographer: David LeveneEditor and Executive Producer: Laurence TophamGuardian Reporter: Justin McCurryMusic: Christoffer Moe DitlevsenGraphic Design: Harry FischerAnimation: Joseph PierceLocation Fixers: Naoko Uchima, Chris WillsonProduction Coordinator: Suzy HallCommissioning Editor, Guardian Australia: Bonnie MalkinHead of Documentaries, The Guardian: Lindsay PoultonWatch trailer|1:20Some of the remains have been committed to the earth in perpetuity, buried beneath postwar housing complexes, businesses and other infrastructure, turning Okinawa’s killing fields into countless unmarked graves.As the island prepares to mark 80 years since the end of the battle on 23 June, Gushiken refuses to abandon his mission to uncover as many remains as possible, identify them and return them to their families.Most of the remains of the estimated 188,140 Japanese killed in the battle have been collected and placed in the national cemetery on the island, according to the health ministry. But the government’s DNA matching efforts have been painfully slow and inadequate.“It’s been 80 years, so it’s very difficult to find remains … but they are still there,” says Gushiken, who recalls finding skulls encased in military helmets during childhood insect hunts in the mountains. “And the bones are getting smaller and smaller.”The passage of time, and the chaotic circumstances surrounding the victims’ deaths, mean only a few families will gain any sense of closure. The remains of about 1,400 people found on Okinawa – including hundreds uncovered by Gushiken and other volunteers – sit in storage for possible identification with DNA testing. But so far just six have been identified and returned to their families.Open gallery|0Gushiken is motivated by more than a sense of duty towards the dead of Okinawa – military and civilian, Japanese and American, and, according to estimates, more than 3,500 Koreans who were forced to fight for Imperial Japan, then their country’s colonial ruler.Standing at the edge of a field, he watches diggers remove white, coral-laced soil from a distant quarry. Here and in other locations, he says, Japan’s government, with the support of the US, is engaging in an act of desecration against the unknown number of war dead whose remains have yet to be found, by using the soil where they fell as landfill for the use of a new generation of American soldiers.“Instead, this should be a place where people can go and learn about how people died here,” Gushiken says. “Where they can think about the meaning of war and peace, and pray for the dead.”Part 2One island, two worldsOn 1 April 1945, US troops landed on Okinawa during their push towards mainland Japan, beginning a battle that lasted until late June. About 12,000 Americans and more than 188,000 Japanese died.Hatsue Fukumine recalls seeing US planes fly towards her home on Tarama, a dot in the ocean west of the main Okinawan island. “My mother was deaf and so couldn’t hear the planes,” says Fukumine. “I used to run over to her, gesture and grab her hand as we ran to the air raid shelters.”Tarama, home to a small Japanese garrison, was targeted by air raids and naval bombardment. “There was practically nothing to bomb there,” says Fukumine, who moved to the main island in her teens to work in a pineapple canning factory. She gained her high school graduation certificate at 70 and, now 90, has spent the past decade hosting a weekly community radio show.By the time Fukumine had married and had three children, Okinawa was under US occupation, and would remain effectively ruled from Washington until 1972, two decades longer than the rest of Japan.But the US occupation did not end with Okinawa’s return to Japanese control. Today it is a fortress, as host to more than half of the 47,000 US troops in Japan and about three-quarters of its military bases.Postwar geopolitics thrust the site of the last major battle of the Pacific war into its central role in present-day tensions, amid Chinese claims over disputed parts of the East and South China Seas, and the emergence of a nuclear-armed North Korea. And it is here, in the cobalt-blue seas of Japan’s southernmost prefecture, that the US response to any emergency in the Taiwan strait will begin.View image in fullscreen“[The base is] a betrayal to their comrades-in-arms, to bereaved families and to the people of Japan”While Okinawa’s economic, educational and social development lagged behind the rest of Japan, huge swathes of land were taken over by the US military, as the island became a crucial support base – an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” – during the Korean and Vietnam wars.Today, the island occupies an uneasy place in the Japanese consciousness: holidaymakers flock there in search of sun and immersion in a culture that bears little resemblance to that of the mainland. For all its exotic attraction, this island of 1.4 million has higher levels of unemployment and poverty than anywhere else in Japan. It is a living study in cultural contrasts, from the ubiquitous tattoo parlours and bars catering to servicemen along Gate Street near Kadena, the biggest US air base in east Asia, to quiet villages whose architecture speaks to Okinawa’s time as an independent kingdom, with close trading and cultural ties to China and south-east Asia until it was annexed by Japan in the late 19th century.The eight decades since the battle of Okinawa are also the story of two communities forced to live in proximity, sometimes with success, but often against a backdrop of resentment and suspicion.Those sentiments are at their most visceral in Ginowan, a densely populated city dominated by Futenma, a sprawling marine corps air base whose perimeter is all that divides its helicopters and tilt-rotor Osprey planes from schools, hospitals and homes.After the 1995 abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen, Tokyo and Washington agreed to reduce the US military footprint on Okinawa by closing Futenma and relocating its functions to a more remote location on the island’s north-east coast. In addition, 9,000 US marines would be sent to Guam, Hawaii and other US territories.Construction of the new base, in the fishing village of Henoko, has been delayed by local opposition and a string of legal challenges. On a recent afternoon, barges dumped rubble into the bay – the foundations for an offshore runway – while a Japanese coast guard vessel played cat-and-mouse with protesters in canoes who had breached the site’s floating barrier.View image in fullscreenConstruction of the US military base at Henoko as part of the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe Henoko base is opposed by most islanders, who say it will destroy the marine environment – including one of the few remaining habitats of the dugong – and do little to reduce the US military footprint. It is not expected to be completed until at least 2036 – 40 years after Japan and the US agreed to build it.Political controversy aside, Gushiken believes the base represents a moral affront targeting Okinawa’s war dead and their families: some of the soil and sediment being used to reclaim land in the bay comes from seven former sites of Pacific war battles, where the remains of fallen soldiers and civilians remain buried.Dumping those remains into the sea to build a base for the US troops is, he says, “a betrayal to their comrades-in-arms, to bereaved families and to the people of Japan”.Part 3Tragedy at seaThe battle of Okinawa had become an inevitability a year before American troops came ashore, when the US capture of the Pacific island of Saipan signalled an invasion was only a matter of time.In July 1944, the government, anticipating an American assault on Okinawa, ordered the evacuation of 100,000 older people, women and children to Japan’s main islands and Taiwan.On 21 August 1944, Hisashi Teruya boarded the Tsushima Maru, a transport vessel, at Naha port along with his mother, Shige, and his elder sister, Mitsuko. His father had been conscripted to fight in Siberia.View image in fullscreenTsushima Maru archive photographPhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe following evening their ship was struck by a US torpedo, killing 1,484 of the 1,800 passengers, including 784 schoolchildren.Teruya was asleep when the torpedo struck. “I was four years old at the time, so I don’t remember much,” he says. He has flashbacks of climbing a ladder up to the deck, which was swarming with petrified passengers. They were told to jump into the sea before the badly damaged ship sank, dragging them down with it. “My mother pulled me by the hand, and we jumped.” Moments later, as they clung to the ropes of a large soy sauce barrel, Teruya’s mother instructed him to hold on while she searched for his sister.That was the last time he saw his mother, who died along with his sister. As an approaching typhoon kicked up waves, Teruya drifted for 16 hours before being rescued by a fishing boat. “I was just a little boy, so I can’t remember my mother’s face … only from photos,” he says. “And I don’t remember playing with my sister. I don’t have any of those normal memories.”Teruya, who spent his childhood being passed around by relatives, did not utter a word about the Tsushima Maru tragedy until he was in his early 70s. “I was getting old, so I thought it was time to open up about it,” he says in an interview at a memorial museum devoted to the tragedy.View image in fullscreenHisashi Teruya at the Tsushima-maru Memorial Museum. Hisashi Teruya is a survivor of the catastrophe in which the ship was sunk by an American torpedo attack.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe 85-year-old’s visits to the museum begin with a greeting before the grainy black-and-white photos of Shige and Mitsuko, exhibited on walls alongside images of hundreds of other victims. “I tell them I have come to talk about the Tsushima Maru,” he says. With no family graves to visit, he set up a makeshift altar, his father – who did not survive the war – mother and sister each represented by stones he had found at personally meaningful locations.“It won’t be long until all of the people who lived through the war have gone, so I’m afraid that people will forget what happened,” he says. “I hope that people who come here and learn about the Tsushima Maru will understand the horrors of war and realise that it can never happen again.”At 95, Eiki Senaha has clearer memories of the months his home turned into a battlefield. Then in his teens, he, like other Japanese schoolchildren, had been forced to abandon his studies to help the war effort.“We were mobilised daily to build Kadena airfield,” says Senaha, a celebrated academic who is now president of Meio University. “We carried shovels of dirt from morning till night. In those days, there was no asphalt or cement, so we had to break up rocks to build the runway.”View image in fullscreen“It won’t be long until all of the people who lived through the war have gone”Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIn late March 1945, with the US invasion imminent, Senaha and other students were given a week to spend with their parents before returning to wartime duty. They were advised that this would be a good time to “say goodbye”.But the air raids quickly intensified, forcing Senaha and his family to spend weeks hiding in the mountains. “I could hear the sound of artillery shells,” he says. “When they landed, they exploded and shrapnel would fly everywhere, slicing the branches off trees. I didn’t want to move. My grandmother, who had poor eyesight, never stopped shaking.”Senaha had been told by military officials assigned to his school to kill himself rather than be captured and tortured by American soldiers. But as fires raged around his family’s hideout, he and his relatives emerged with their arms raised to be confronted by dogs and soldiers with guns. “I had decided to come out rather than die,” he said. “I wanted to save my own life.”After a month in a makeshift camp as civilian prisoners, Senaha and his family were allowed to return to their village. It was a miracle that he had survived. “My classmates died in droves. I’m sorry that they died and that I’m still alive. What did they think they were dying for? They died for their families. Not for the emperor. They died for their families, for the people of Okinawa.”Part 4Laying ghosts to restAs darkness falls, Gushiken returns on his moped to a hut outside his home and switches on his desk lamp. He leafs through an illustrated medical dictionary, his focus shifting between its pages to the fragments of bones on his desk.“When I see the state of the bones, like those that were turned to charcoal by flamethrowers, I feel very sad,” he says. “Especially if they belong to children.”On 23 June, the people of Okinawa will gather at the Cornerstone of Peace to mark the day their war ended, less than two months before Japan’s disastrous militarist adventures were halted by two nuclear explosions hundreds of miles away.View image in fullscreenThe Cornerstone of Peace memorial at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman, Okinawa.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe anniversary will be a chance for Gushiken to reflect on how much – and how little – has changed in the eight decades since Japan embraced constitutional democracy, and his island became an American military fortress.“Back then, if people spoke out against the war they were immediately arrested by the military police. There was no such thing as freedom of speech. That’s why it’s important that we speak out now, that we don’t have to do as the government tells us. That we decide which direction the country goes in.”For now, though, Okinawa’s future appears to be out of the hands of Gushiken and the majority of residents who oppose the new base in Henoko. Japan’s government ignored the overwhelming “no” vote delivered in a non-binding referendum in 2019, and the transfer of thousands of Marines, first agreed in 2012, only began this February, when just 105 left for Guam.View image in fullscreen“We, the people, decide the country’s direction”Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianUS-Japan ties, and the regional tensions underpinning their alliance, have transformed since the bodies of soldiers and civilians were committed to Okinawa’s soil. All the more reason, Gushiken says, for both countries to lay the ghosts of the past to rest.“By using the soil to build the base, the Japanese government is stamping on the dignity of people who died in the battle – not just Japanese, but Americans and other people too,” he says. “It’s as if they are being killed all over again.”10:41The Bone Hunter: unearthing the horror of war in Okinawa - documentaryAbout this articleWriter –Justin McCurryVideo and photography -David LeveneMultimedia editor –Laurence TophamLead Designer -Harry FischerInteractive Developers –Alessia AmitranoandPip LevCommissioning editor –Bonnie Malkin"

Now I’m relying on you to act, 3 June). His courage in standing up to the illegal actions of Israel settlers and the state of Israel is inspirational.If individuals who have no protection dare to speak up and defend themselves against decades of oppression and dehumanisation, risking their lives and those of their loved ones, surely our governments have a duty to act, not just issue words of condemnation. These words still fall short of calling appalling acts like starving civilians genocide, and calling the decades of policies and violence against Palestinians ethnic cleansing.Our governments have the power to make a difference, but still they provide arms to and stand by a state that violates international law.All of us who numb ourselves to reports of the numbers of innocent people murdered (though it is not called that either) will have to live with the knowledge that we didn’t do enough. We must protest, inform ourselves about which companies are complicit and boycott them. I am hanging my head in shame that I voted for this government.

I am not one of those people. Forty-nine years’ experience of living in a female body in a world deformed by class, caste and economic and racial inequality – never mind environmental destruction – has only made me wonder quite why it matters so much to some people.A truly progressive society should be moving towards seeing the person first, both beyond and in profound recognition of their politicised identities. One can see biological sex as both fundamental and immaterial at the same time. As I approach 50, it’s clear to me that it’s possible to hold both these thoughts simultaneously. My menopausal womanhood matters as it gets in the way of things I want to do in life. But there’s no way it matters to me above all else, and there’s no chance it gets in the way to a greater degree than the various effects of social and economic inequality.It is a fallacy to suggest that trans inclusivity is more compatible with capitalism than with collective liberation. If the Progress Pride flag is flown from a corporate building – a rare sight in my experience compared with the rainbow Pride flag – it’s not because it “suits them”, in Rustin’s words, to shift attention away from class politics towards individual expression. Perhaps younger people better understand that corporate interests don’t engage with class politics anyway, so how’s a flag going to hurt anyone?I was born with breasts and ovaries, and still have them; I have given birth twice. These facts have had undeniable effects on my life – but so has the disadvantage of my class of birth and the continuing advantage of my whiteness. If I were to look at every aspect of my life through the prism of my reproductive organs, I would be limiting the possibilities of looking at the multiple effects of all those factors in the whole – the effects of which can only lead one to conclude that they are human, a person, first. It’s called intersectionality, and that term was come up with by Kimberlé Crenshaw, who was born in 1959.Lynsey HanleyLiverpoolSusanna Rustin lists several possibilities for why gen Z are more likely to advocate for the inclusion of transgender women in single-sex spaces. One thing she did not mention is that it may be due to the personal relationships that this demographic is more likely to have with transgender individuals, and how much more easily it is to sympathise with the struggles of those we know.As an older member of gen Z, I have had two openly trans peers in my cohort during my time at university, my former neighbour was transgender, and now in my workplace I have a transgender colleague. This resembles the norm – a Guardian article from June 2022suggests that 50% of British gen Zers said they knew at least one transgender person. I would argue that gen Z more openly fights for the inclusion and protections of transgender women because we’re more likely to see them as truly women, rather than “self-identifying” individuals, due to our personal connections with them.

It’s not just about reading more, but about stories that feel relevant, spark curiosity and reflect real lives. Many parents we work with say that books often feel repetitive, irrelevant or dominated by the same voices. When children and parents see themselves and their communities in stories, they enjoy reading more, which supports emotional development and academic success.Yet diversity in children’s books is falling. Thelatest CLPE reportshows that ethnic minority main characters dropped from 14% in 2022 to 7% in 2023, despitenearly 40%of schoolchildren in England being from those backgrounds.Our study with the University of Manchester, due to be published later this year, highlights how representation boosts Black children’s confidence and enjoyment of reading. Diverse stories help children build empathy, understanding and emotional literacy.

A coup may even be easy to start. The day after is simply unpredictable and harmful to everyone.Brazilcould not go through something like that, and such a hypothesis was never even considered during my government,” he said.Brazil braces for Bolsonaro’s day in court as ex-president testifies over ‘coup plot’Read moreBolsonaro confirmed his allies had considered various options, including the declaration of a state of siege, but did not pursue them because “there was no climate for it, no opportunity; we didn’t even have a minimally solid base to do anything.”The former chiefs of the air force and the army had previously told police that theyopposed Bolsonaro’s plans during those meetings, although they said the former navy commander pledged to back the rightwing autocrat.With a hoarse voice, the far-right leader used the live broadcast of his questioning to turn much of the hearing into a political platform, defending his 2019-2023 administration and repeatedly criticising Lula’s third term.There had been some expectation over his face-off with the case’s lead judge, justice Alexandre de Moraes – the former head of the electoral court, whom Bolsonaro has previously called a “jerk” and a “scoundrel”.But Bolsonaro apologised to Moraes and two other justices for saying in a meeting – a recording of which was submitted as evidence – that they had allegedly received between $30m and $50m each to rig the election.“It was a vent, rhetoric I used,” he said. “So, I apologise. I had no intention of accusing you of any misconduct”.Though he is barred from running for office by an electoral court ruling in a separate case – for spreading lies and attacking the voting system – Bolsonaro joked with Moraes, saying: “I’d like to invite you to be my running mate in 2026.”Smiling, the justice replied: “I’ll pass.”Bolsonaro was the sixth defendant to be questioned since the trial began on Monday of the eight men considered the“nucleus” of the attempted coup. The accused include four former Bolsonaro ministers – three of them army generals; the ex-commander of the navy; and the ex-president’s former right-hand man, Lt Col Mauro Cid.It is the first time that high-ranking military officers have ever faced trial over an attempted coup d’état in Brazil, a country that endured a bloody dictatorship from 1964 to 1985.Journalist and political analyst Miriam Leitãowrote in her column in O Globothat “what was most striking … was the casual atmosphere in which a coup d’état was discussed within the Bolsonaro government.“Everyone knew about it – there were several conversations, meetings in function rooms, inside the presidential palace and at the top of the military hierarchy,” she wrote.The first to testify was Bolsonaro’s former aide-de-camp, Lt Col Mauro Cid, who signed a plea bargain and whose testimony, alongside evidence gathered by the federal police, forms the basis for the prosecution’s case.He reaffirmed that Bolsonaro edited a draft decree that provided for the arrest of several authorities, including members of Congress and supreme court justices, and the creation of a commission to organise new elections.“He [Bolsonaro] shortened the document, removing the authorities’ arrests. Only you would be imprisoned,” Lt Col Cid told Moraes.He also said that his former boss attempted unsuccessfully to find some kind of “fraud” in the electronic voting system, hoping to “convince the armed forces to do something”.Once the defendants’ testimony concludes, the prosecution and defence will have five days to request further inquiries to gather new evidence, which the rapporteur, Moraes, may accept or reject. After that come the final arguments and, ultimately, the trial verdict, which is expected in the second half of the year.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

As she rounded the corner, neighbors began to look in her direction.“Everything was levelled,” she said.Police and experts blamed Tuesday’s attacks on a dissident faction of the once-powerfulFarcguerrilla group.Security expert Elizabeth Dickenson of the International Crisis Group said the attacks were likely the work of a group known as the Central General Staff (EMC).“This is a particularly well-coordinated offensive. It really demonstrates the capacity that the group has built,” she told AFP.“And I think very alarmingly it demonstrates their ability to conduct operations in the metropolitan area of Cali.”Dickenson said the group may be trying to stop an ongoing military operation that is reported to have injured or killed the group’s veteran leader, known as “Iván Mordisco”.Colombia: president says shot candidate had security detail cut on day of attackRead more“They are trying to raise the cost of that military initiative for the government,” said Dickenson.In a statement on Tuesday, the EMC warned the public to stay away from military and police installations, but stopped short of claiming responsibility.The attacks come three days after conservative senator Miguel Uribe, 39, was shot twice in the head at close range by an alleged hitman while campaigning in Bogotá.On Tuesday, a 15-year-old pleaded not guilty to carrying out the attempted assassination. The government believes he was a hired gun.Uribe remains in critical condition, the hospital treating him said on Tuesday.“No family in Colombia should be going through this,” Uribe’s wife, Maria Claudia Tarazona, told reporters outside the hospital. “There is no name for this – it’s not pain, it’s not horror, it’s not sadness.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaFarcAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We don’t take this step lightly, but the plan needs to be challenged,” Palairet said.The plan must be robust and transparent, in line with the country’s chief climate law – the climate change response (zero carbon) amendment act – she said.New Zealand will not be ‘guilt-tripped’ over environment, resources minister saysRead moreIn 2019, the Labour government passed thatlandmark climate legislationcommitting the nation to reducing its domestic carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 and meeting its commitments under the Paris climate accords. Governments are legally required to set an emission reductions plan every five years detailing how New Zealand will meet its greenhouse gas targets.The right-wing coalition government has committed to the 2050 net zero emissions target. Its first emissions reduction plan released in December – shows New Zealand is on track to reach emissions targets up until 2030, but will not meet the targets in five years after. The government said it will address those targets in 2030.The plan also says the country is also on track to meet its long-term emissions goal but climate experts warn the government’s methods could end up derailing progress.The legal claim includes two primary challenges. The first argues the government tossed out dozens of credible climate policies – including the clean car discount and a gas transition plan – and did not adequately consult the public over the changes.The lawyers also claim that the government is relying on “high risk” methods such as planting hundreds of thousands of hectares of introduced pine trees to offset emissions, and capturing carbon underground, with few alternatives to fall back on if something goes wrong.Someexperts have warnedachieving a net reduction in emissions primarily through planting trees is impossible to sustain in the long term, as forests could be destroyed though fire or extreme weather and do not store carbon for ever.Dr Christina Hood, the head of energy and climate policy consultancy Compass Climate, told the Guardian the government’s emissions reduction plan was “incredibly shortsighted”.Hood said there is an assumption that as long as New Zealand plants trees, it can emit as much as it likes, but warned that was a “blinkered” approach that ignores the future.“In our law … there’s a responsibility to meet all of the targets, not just the current one.”While New Zealand’s total contribution to global emissions is small at 0.17%, its gross emissions per capita are high. The country has also been among the world’s worst performers on emission increases. Between 1990 and 2018, its emissions rose 57% – the second-greatest increase of all industrialised countries.Climate scientists and environment groups are worried the government’s broader environmental agenda will derail the country’s ability to reduce emissions and protect its unique species.Fast-track to where? The new law opening up New Zealand to a mining boomRead moreSince taking office, the government has promised to restart offshore oil and has set aside $200m of its budget to invest in gas exploration. It plans to boost mineral exports to $3bn by 2035, at the same time it hasslashed funding to conservation and climate initiatives. Thecontroversial new fast-track lawthat is pushing through major infrastructure projects, including mining, has been described as“egregiously damaging”for the environment and risks a path towards a greener future.The minister of climate change, Simon Watts, would not be commenting on the judicial review, as the matter is now before the courts, his office told the Guardian.The Green Party is backing the claim because the government’s plan “is not worth the paper that it is written on”, its co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick told the Guardian.Climate litigation as a form of activism is gaining momentum around the world. In 2024 the high court found theUK government’s climate action plan was unlawful, as there was not enough evidence that there were sufficient policies in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Palairet hopes this case will force the government to come up with a new plan.“The reason why we take a case like this to a court is to scrutinise and question whether the government statements match up with reality.”This article was amended on 11 June 2025 to correct the job title of Jessica PalairetExplore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

However a public health advocate warned policymakers not to be “conned” into a radical tax cut.It comes ahead of a meeting of state and federal health ministers on Friday and after the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, last weekdemanded the Albanese government cut the excise rateto combat an explosion in black market tobacco and an associated rise in organised crime.In Victoria arash of firebombingshave underlined the policing challenges associated with the illegal cigarette trade, with the state’s Labor government also calling for a cut to the excise rate, which has tripled over the past decade – making Australian cigarettes the most expensive in the developed world.Chalmers says cheaper cigarettes will not solve illegal tobacco boom, dismissing NSW premierRead moreWith the Australian Taxation Office estimating about a fifth of tobacco for sale is now illegal, the director of the Australian National University’s tax and transfer policy institute, Bob Breunig, said “the evidence is pretty clear that every time we raise excise at this point we are not reducing smoking at all”.“The point is to get people to smoke less, and it’s not working. I don’t think we should lower it, but freezing it is a good idea, and then doing something that deals with illegal tobacco is the next obvious step,” Breunig said.Chart showing federal revenue from the tobacco excise tax. Revenue dipped after 2020 despite higher taxes.Breunig acknowledged the tax, alongside other complementary measures, had contributed to the halving in smoking rates over the past two decades, from 21% of adults smoking daily in 2005 to just shy of 11% in 2022.“Our tobacco policies have been very successful versus other countries. We’ve had a big success story and we’ve gone as far as we can go with the excise. Now it’s time to pull other levers, such as more education.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOver the past decade, the excise rate per cigarette has tripled from 46c to $1.40. The excise now accounts for $28 of the average $40 price for a packet of 20 cigarettes.For some time a rising tax was associated with the twin benefits of falling smoking rates and rising revenue, but after peaking at $16.3bn in 2019-20, federal excise receipts have plunged.The March budget forecasts tobacco excise receipts will be just $7.4bn in this financial year – the lowest since 2012-13 – and will continue to fall to $6.7bn by the end of the decade.Rather than a sudden collapse in smoking rates, experts point to an explosion in the availability of black market tobacco in recent years.An equivalent of 605.8m cigarettes in illegal tobacco was seized at the border in 2019-20, according to government figures. By 2022-23, border seizures had reached the equivalent of 2.6bn cigarettes before easing to 2.2bn in 2023-24.Chart showing the tobacco excise per 20-pack of cigarettes. The price has climbed significantly from 5$ in 2007 to above $25 by 2025.Jim Chalmers and the federal health minister,Mark Butler, have both ruled out lowering the excise, arguing it will do nothing to reduce the illegal tobacco trade. Instead, they advocate stronger compliance measures.Terry Slevin, the chief executive of the PublicHealthAssociation, agreed, saying he was worried policymakers were being “conned” by the tobacco industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They raised it too high,” Holden said.“Clearly the excise has gotten over a threshold and triggered an illicit market reaction.”Holden said it would take more than a “tweak” to the excise rate to remove the incentive to buy and sell illegal tobacco, suggesting a radical excise reduction for two years.The excise rate increases twice a year, in March and September, in line with the rise in a measure of wages called the average weekly ordinary time earnings. On top of this indexation, the tobacco excise is also climbing by an extra 5% a year for the three years to September 2026.As a share of income, cigarettes are nearly four times more expensive than they were three decades ago.Explore more on these topicsSmokingHealth (Australia news)Tobacco industryHealth (Society)New South WalesVictoriaMark ButlernewsShareReuse this content"

It can therefore disqualify them from means-tested benefits, including universal credit or pension credit, and affects eligibility for social care.The letter adds: “This complicated and stressful situation is putting undue pressure on survivors who are currently making applications to the payment scheme, forcing them to revisit their most traumatic experiences as they weigh up the cost of accepting compensation.”The proposed solution, which is being called Philomena’s law, is to implement an “indefinite capital disregard” – a legal mechanism that ensures compensation is not counted as savings for the purpose of benefits eligibility. Conlon said this model had been used for survivors of the 7/7 and Manchester bombings, as well as the Windrush scandal.“Beyond ensuring that survivors are not forced to choose between compensation and vital benefits, our campaign has also been about shining a light on the mother and baby institutions payment scheme itself,” he said. “Takeup is incredibly low in Britain and we want to ensure that every eligible survivor knows about it and feels empowered to apply.”The bill is named after Philomena Lee, whose story of forced separation from and later search for her lost son inspiredthe Oscar-nominated filmstarring Coogan and Judi Dench.“As one of the people who suffered unimaginable abuse within a mother and baby home, I know that, while financial redress doesn’t fix everything for families like mine, it represents a measure of accountability for what happened,” said Lee.The Irish government’s redress scheme was introduced after an inquiry detailed the horrific experiences of about 56,000 women and about 57,000 children who were placed or born in homes, mostly run by nuns, between 1922 and 1998.In its report published in January 2021, it discovered an alarming number of deaths of babies in the homes and documented the cruelty and neglect suffered. Many women were forced to take part in work and separated from their babies, who were fostered or adopted.Speaking at the Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday, Andrew Western, a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, said UK government ministers were already considering whether to legislate to disregard payment from Ireland’s mother and baby institutions scheme.A decision had yet to be made because talks were continuing within departments and with the Irish government, he said.Explore more on these topicsUK newsIrelandSteve CooganEuropeCatholicismChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Kasidiaris has since appealed against the penalties.For several years the ultra-nationalist found ways to address followers through social media from jail. “It may be a far cry from the heyday of Golden Dawn but Kasidiaris still has a support base of mostly young people who hold regular meetings on the internet to discuss his comeback,” said Dimitris Psarras, a prominent left wing author who has written extensively about the far-right in Greece.“The Spartans were the vitrine of Kasidiaris in parliament,” he said. “While today’s court decision has dealt a crushing blow for a party that, through infighting had already lost support and MPs, it will not affect the appeal of the far-right more generally. Today, sadly, all polls show it is on the rise.”Golden Dawn’s popularity soared during the nation’s near decade-long debt crisis when large segments of the population were hit by austerity measures enacted in exchange for rescue loans from the EU and International Monetary Fund.Although the group had been dismantled by 2023, voters returned three far-right parties to parliament in what Rori, currently a fellow at Oxford University, described as “its most significant presence” in the country since the explosion of the debt crisis.“It’s the first time all strands of the far-right – populist radical, extreme and ultra-conservative religious – are represented simultaneously in parliament,” she said. “We know from the election results that 80 % of voters [for the Spartans] previously supported the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn. While [the party] also attracted people who didn’t vote before, many supporters may now be waiting for Kasidiaris to tell them what to do next.”Explore more on these topicsGreeceGolden Dawn partyEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Jurors returned an 8-1 verdict after a trial that lasted more than six weeks.They were found to have taken payment for supplying the device, which was hidden in a children’s shoe box and planted under a seat in the journalist’s car. It was detonated remotely as she drove away from her home.Under Maltese law, those serving life sentences remain in prison until death. They are not eligible for parole or any other form of early release.Prosecutors had argued on Tuesday that the punishment should send a strong message to the public, both locally and internationally. Press freedom groups across Europe have followed the case closely.“We hope that today’s sentences will be a step towards a safer world for journalists by signalling to potential killers that there are heavy penalties to pay when a journalist is murdered,” Caruana Galizia’s family said in a statement.“The car bomb attack that killed Daphne sent shock waves through Maltese society that reverberated around the world. Her assassination created a sense in society that the people behind her murder were sure of their impunity and that the institutions that were duty-bound to protect her and society had failed.”Two men accused of planting and detonating the device, the brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, areserving 40-year jail terms after pleading guilty. A third man, Vince Muscat, who also admitted his role in the murder, is serving 15 years after turning state’s evidence.Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver who claims he acted as a middleman, secured a presidential pardonin exchange for giving evidenceand is living under police protection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He denies the charges. Delays in bringing the case before a jury have allowed his lawyers to successfully argue for bail, and he was released in February after pledging €50m (£42m) in cash and shares as security.Because they pleaded not guilty, Vella and Agius were the first among the accused to actually stand trial. They were arrested in 2021, based on evidence provided by Muscat. His testimony was crucial in the trial, which heard from 157 witnesses, including the victim’s relatives and members of the FBI, which had assisted local police with the investigation.The court heard that the original plan was to shoot the journalist, with Vella providing the hitmen with rifles and an AK-47. The plans were changed, however, and the killers opted for a bomb instead. It was placed in her car during the night and detonated remotely the next day, using a command sent via text message by George Degiorgio while he was cruising onboard a motor boat.Prosecutors told the court that the motive for the murder was Caruana Galizia’s “journalistic work”.In the same trial, Vella was convicted of complicity in a second, unrelated murder – the killing in 2015 of a Maltese lawyer, Carmel Chircop. Robert Agius’s brother Adrian and George Degiorgio were also found guilty of complicity in the same crime.Explore more on these topicsDaphne Caruana GaliziaJournalist safetyMaltaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But it was the capital that was the focus of Russia’s ferocious barrage.The unrelenting night-time raid stretched over five hours and will be seen as part of a continuing response by the Kremlin to Ukraine’s Operation Spiderweb, whichstruck Russia’s nuclear-capable bomberson Monday last week.The strikes on Tuesday morning, which killed three people, followed a record 419 drones launched atUkrainethe previous night.Ukraine’s air defence systems shot down seven Russian missiles and 213 attack drones, while 64 drones were said to have disappeared from radars or were intercepted by electronic warfare systems.0:56Russian drone strikes hit Kyiv and maternity ward in Odesa – videoThe Ukrainian culture minister, Mykola Tochytskyi, said the attack damaged St Sophia Cathedral, a Unesco world heritage site in the historic centre ofKyiv. A cornice on the main apse of the 11th-century cathedral was destroyed.“The enemy struck at the very heart of our identity again,” Tochytskyi wrote on Facebook about the site he called “the soul of all Ukraine”.In a statement on his Telegram channel, Zelenskyy appeared to criticise the lack of response from the US and others to the recent stepping up of Russia’s attacks. Trump has prevaricated over the question of further economic sanctions on the Kremlin.Zelenskyy said: “Russian strikes with missiles and Shaheds [drones] are louder than the efforts of the United States and others in the world to force Russia to peace. Every night, instead of a ceasefire, there have been massive strikes with Shaheds, cruise missiles and ballistics. Today was one of the largest strikes on Kyiv. Odesa, the Dnipro region and Chernihiv region were also targeted.”Zelenskyy said 250 of the drones were Shaheds, and two of the seven missiles were of “North Korean production”.He added: “Ordinary houses and urban infrastructure were damaged, and even a maternity hospital in Odesa became a Russian target. Thirteen people were injured. Unfortunately, there are fatalities. My condolences to the relatives.“It is important that the response to this and other similar Russian strikes is not the silence of the world but concrete actions. Actions by America, which has the power to force Russia to peace. The actions ofEurope, which has no alternative but to be strong. The actions of others in the world who have called for diplomacy and an end to the war and who have been ignored by Russia. Hard pressure is needed for peace.”The EU was to announcea new package of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, including a proposal to reduce the price at which Russian oil can be sold, from $60 (£44) a barrel to $45.Despite the escalation in attacks on Kyiv, Zelenskyy also announced that further captured soldiers had been exchanged following an agreement at the peace talks last week for each side to free more than 1,000 prisoners.Zelenskyy said Tuesday’s exchange with Russia saw “the return of our injured and severely wounded warriors from Russian captivity” and that further swaps would follow.View image in fullscreenPeople walk among debris as firefighters intervene to put out the fire after drones struck Kyiv.Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty ImagesThe attack on Kyiv hours earlier had started around 1am with the familiar sound of the buzzing of drones followed by explosions that continued throughout the night, with the all-clear only sounding at 5am.As people emerged from bunkers and homes, the city smelled of smoke, with charred residential buildings and the remains of cars on the streets offering evidence of the bombardment.As a result of poor air quality caused by smoke billowing from the sites of the strikes, people in the city were advised on Tuesday morning to keep their windows closed and to avoid unnecessary outdoor activity.Timur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military district, said on Telegram: “A difficult night for all of us. Throughout the night, the enemy relentlessly terrorised Kyiv with attack drones. They targeted civilian infrastructure and peaceful residents of the city.”Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, called for tougher sanctions on Russia and for air defences to strengthen Ukraine after the attack.He said: “Russia rejects any meaningful peace efforts and must face new, devastating sanctions. Already now. There is no more time to wait.”In Odesa, 10 drone strikes injured nine people and killed two, including a 59-year-old man, while a maternity hospital was among the buildings damaged.The Odesa regional governor, Oleh Kiper, said: “The Russians hit a maternity hospital, an emergency medical ward and residential buildings.”Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, claimed Russia had targeted civilian infrastructure. “Russian attacks on civilian targets continue,” he wrote. “Russia lies every day about wanting peace and every day it targets civilians.”Russia’s defence ministry said it had targeted “Ukrainian aviation, missile, armoured vehicle and shipbuilding facilities in Kyiv” with a “group strike”.“The goal of the strikes was achieved. All designated objects were hit,” the ministry said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDrones (military)KyivnewsShareReuse this content"

The price of a barrel of Brent crude has since recovered to about $67.Von der Leyen told reporters on Tuesday that lowering the cap would “restore its effectiveness”.Oilexports, she added, represented one-third of Russian government revenues. “We need to cut this source of revenues.”She expressed confidence the G7 would adopt the lower oil price cap, despite uncertainty about Donald Trump’s appetite to impose sanctions on Vladimir Putin. G7 leaders, including von der Leyen, are due to discuss the proposal in Canada next week.Referring to herrecent discussions with the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, von der Leyen said: “We are very much aligned in the aim to urge Russia by those massive sanctions to come to the negotiation table and to be serious about negotiations that lead towards a just and lasting peace … And therefore I am very confident that we will achieve this goal [the $45 price cap].”Graham is the author of a bill that he says would impose“bone-breaking sanctions”on Putin including a 500% tariff on goods from countries importing Russian oil.As part of the EU’s proposed 18th round of sanctions against Russia, the commission also wants to tighten up measures against the country’s “shadow fleet”, hundreds of old and poorly maintained tankers that enable the Kremlin to export oil to countries such as India at a price above the western-imposed cap.For the first time Brussels is targeting sanctions against the captain of a shadow fleet tanker, an Indian national, according to an unpublished draft sanctions proposal. Officials hope this will have a chilling effect, discouraging others from crewing the vessels, which fly under a flag of convenience.The commission also proposes listing 70 more shadow fleet vessels on its sanctions list, bringing the total under designation to more than 400. One EU diplomat estimated last month that the fleet now stood at about 800 tankers, up from just 100 two years ago.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, claimed sanctions on the shadow fleet were having a marked impact. “When sanctioned, Russia’s shadow fleet tankers cannot dock in ports and Russia has to find new vessels. This costs some more and runs down their profits.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Russia has expressed interest in reviving the gas projects connecting Russia and Germany. EU officials say the measure is necessary to dissuade investors from going back to business as usual.The latest proposals, which would have to be agreed unanimously by the EU’s 27 member states, would also impose restrictions on doing business with 22 banks, cutting them off from the Swift financial messaging system.European leaders last monthvowed to impose “massive” sanctions on Russiaif Putin did not agree to a 30-day ceasefire within days. “We are ramping up pressure on Russia because strength is the only language that Russia will understand,” von der Leyen said.Explore more on these topicsOilCommoditiesEuropean UnionEuropeRussiaUkraineUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

Those probably won’t happen “in our lifetime”, he told the news agency.In aseparate interviewwith the BBC, Huckabee said: “Muslim countries have 644 times the amount of land that are controlled by Israel. So maybe, if there is such a desire for the Palestinian state, there would be someone who would say, we’d like to host it.”When pressed on Palestinian aspirations in theWest Bank, where 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli occupation, Huckabee employed Israeli government terminology, asking: “Does it have to be in Judea and Samaria?”Trump, in his first term, was relatively tepid in his approach to a two-state solution, a longtime pillar of US Middle East policy, and he has given little sign of where he stands on the issue in his second term.The state department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Middle East analysts said the comments made explicit a shift that has been broadly expected.“This is not at all surprising given what we’ve seen in the last four-plus months, including the administration’sopen support for expelling the population of Gaza, the legitimization of Israeli settlement and annexation policies,” said Khaled Elgindy, a scholar at Georgetown University’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and former adviser to Palestinian negotiators.“This is an administration that is committed to Palestinian erasure, both physical and political,” Elgindy said. “The signs were there even in the first Trump term, which nominally supported a Palestinian ‘state’ that was shorn of all sovereignty and under permanent Israeli control. At least now they’ve abandoned the pretense.”Yousef Munayyer, head of Palestine/Israel Program at the Arab Center Washington DC, said Huckabee was merely articulating what US policy has long demonstrated in practice. “Mike Huckabee is saying out loud what US actions have been saying for decades and across different administrations,” he said. “Whatever commitments have been made in statements about a Palestinian state over time, US policy has never matched those stated commitments and only undercut them.”The ambassador’s position has deep roots in his evangelical Christian beliefs and longstanding support for Israeli settlement expansion. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Huckabee said: “There is no such thing as a Palestinian.” In a 2017 visit to the occupiedWest Bank, he rejected the concept of Israeli occupation entirely.“I think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,” said Huckabee at the time. “There are certain words I refuse to use. There is no such thing as a West Bank. It’s Judea and Samaria. There’s no such thing as a settlement. They’re communities, they’re neighborhoods, they’re cities. There’s no such thing as an occupation.”What distinguishes Huckabee, Munayyer argued, has been his willingness to be explicit about objectives that previous officials had kept veiled. “What makes Huckabee unique is that he is shameless enough to admit out loud the goal of erasing the Palestinian people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The United Nations condemned that raid at the time, saying that Israeli authorities had not presented to the UN any credible evidence to justify their declarations.The Guardian later reported that a classified CIA report showed the agency had been unable to find any evidence to support Israel’s description of the group as a “terrorist organization”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMike HuckabeeIsraelGazaWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of others have been injured.After 11 weeks of total siege and a continuing blockade, many inGazaare so hungry they are still risking their lives to walk to centres run by the secretive US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in the hope of getting some supplies.The most vulnerable, including the sick, elderly people and those weakest from hunger, cannot even attempt the dangerous journey.“This system does not intend to address hunger,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said in a post on social media.“Aid deliveries & distribution must be at scale & safe. In Gaza, this can be done only through the United Nations including Unrwa. We have the expertise, the knowledge and community trust.”‘These are traps set for the people’: the story of a mother shot dead searching for food in GazaRead moreIsrael has attempted to shift most food distribution away from humanitarian organisations including UN agencies toGHF, a logistics startupthat has never worked in a conflict zone at scale.GHF hands out food at sites secured by armed guards and under the protection of the Israeli military. Shootings have targeted people travelling to the centres, not inside them or in their immediate vicinity.The killings on Tuesday came hours before GHF began operations, and outside its site, the foundation said in a statement. It has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to “do more” to keep people safe and suggested Palestinians hoping to get food without being shot dead should check social media for safety tips.“It is vital that aid seekers stay on the dedicated passage and closely follow instructions from our Facebook posts,” the GHF statement said. The spokesperson did not respond to a question about how Gaza’s many people who no longer have regular access to electricity or internet connections should seek safety updates.The Israeli military said it was aware of reports of injuries on Tuesday morning after troops fired “warning shots” towards “suspects” in the Wadi Gaza area whom its troops deemed a threat. “The warning shots were fired hundreds of metres from the aid distribution site,” a spokesperson said.The spokesperson said the numbers of casualties reported in Gaza did not “align” with information on injuries from an initial IDF inquiry.The 17 deaths on Tuesday morning brought to 144 the total number of Palestinians who local health authorities say have been killed trying to get food from GHF centres since they first opened.Hours after that attack Israeli authorities deported Greta Thunberg and other activists who hadattempted to sail to the territoryon the Madleen yacht with food and medical aid.1:28Israeli forces halt Gaza-bound aid yacht carrying Greta Thunberg – videoAll rejected the claim that they had entered Israel illegally, because Israeli forces seized the boat in international waters then brought them to an Israeli port by force.In an apparent response to the huge amount of publicity generated by the Madleen even before it set sail, Israel’s foreign ministry on Monday denounced the crew as “celebrities” on a “selfie yacht”.Although they were never expected to reach Gaza, whose shores are guarded by Israel’s navy, the ship intensified international focus on hunger in Gaza.‘We did nothing wrong’: Greta Thunberg accuses Israel of kidnapping yacht crewRead moreIsrael has been under heavy pressure over hunger in Gaza, with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announcing that he had lifted the siege last month after warnings from longstanding allies that the “starvation crisis” there was damaging Israel’s international standing.However, his government has said most food supplies allowed into the territory should go through the GHF.The UN has been able to bring only limited supplies of flour into Gaza since Israel lifted the total siege three weeks ago, and most of that had been taken by starving Palestinians or looted by armed gangs before the UN could distribute it, the deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said on Monday.Israel’s broader military campaign has made education impossible in Gaza, through damage and destruction to more than 90% of school and university buildings, according to a report from the UN’s independent commission of inquiry into the occupiedPalestinian territories.View image in fullscreenDestroyed buildings after the Israeli army carried out airstrikes on two school buildings in Jabaliya, Gaza, on Sunday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMore than 658,000 children in Gaza have been prevented from attending school since the war began. Israeli forces have also destroyed more than half of all religious and cultural sites in Gaza, including archaeological sites, a museum andthe Great Omari mosque.These attacks were part of a “widespread and relentless assault” on the Palestinian people in which Israel’s military had committed war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination, the report found.“We are seeing more and more indications that Israel is carrying out a concerted campaign to obliterate Palestinian life in Gaza,” said Navi Pillay, the chair of the commission.“Israel’s targeting of the educational, cultural and religious life of the Palestinian people will harm the present generations and generations to come, hindering their right to self-determination.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGreta ThunbergMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was stressed that they were being sanctioned in their personal capacity, placing no restrictions on the ministries they lead. Netanyahu has promised to retaliate.The move was quickly condemned by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who called for the sanctions to be lifted and said the US stood “shoulder to shoulder” with Israel.“These sanctions do not advance US-led efforts to achieve a ceasefire, bring all hostages home, and end the war,” Rubio wrote, adding: “We remind our partners not to forget who the real enemy is.”In a carefully prepared move, for which Israel had little advance notice, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, along with the foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway, announced the sanctions in a joint statement: “We are steadfastly committed to the two-state solution and will continue to work with our partners towards its implementation.“It is the only way to guarantee security and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians and ensure long-term stability in the region, but it is imperilled by extremist settler violence and settlement expansion.“Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. These actions are not acceptable. This is why we have taken action now – to hold those responsible to account.“We will strive to achieve an immediate ceasefire inGaza, the immediate release of the remaining hostages by Hamas, which can have no future role in the governance of Gaza, a surge in aid and a path to a two-state solution.“Today’s measures focus on the West Bank, but of course this cannot be seen in isolation from the catastrophe in Gaza. We continue to be appalled by the immense suffering of civilians, including the denial of essential aid. There must be no unlawful transfer of Palestinians from Gaza or within the West Bank, nor any reduction in the territory of the Gaza Strip.”View image in fullscreenCharred agricultural equipment in the West Bank village of Dayr Dibwan after a reported attack by Israeli settlers on 5 June.Photograph: Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesThe previous UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, said he had planned to take the move against the two ministers last summer, but held back when he was told the decision was too political to take during an election campaign.By building an alliance of five countries, the UK may hope to protect itself from being the sole subject of Israeli and US anger. It may also be intended to stress Israel’s growing international isolation, but that will not disturb Israel as long as it has the protection of the White House.The EU requires unanimity among its 27 states to take parallel action, and would face resistance from Hungary. It is instead looking at possible trade restrictions that only require a qualified majority of EU states to approve them. Pressure has been building for concrete action in Canada, Norway and Australia.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, described the UK decision as unacceptable and said it was “outrageous that elected representatives and members of the government are subjected to these kind of measures”.Smotrich said: “Britain has already tried once to prevent us from settling the cradle of our homeland, and we will not allow it to do so again.”Ben-Gvir said: “We passed Pharaoh, we will also pass Starmer’s wall.”The former defence minister Benny Gantz said: “I vehemently disagree with ministers Smotrich and Ben Gvir on a wide range of issues – but the imposition of British sanctions on ministers in the one and only democracy in the Middle East, the state of Israel, is a profound moral mistake and sends a dangerous message to terrorists.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nobody will let us cause 2 million civilians to die of hunger even though it might be justified and moral until our hostages are returned,” he told a conference hosted by the Israel Hayom newspaper.Ben-Gvir stormed the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem on 26 May and has called for the Muslim world’s third-holiest site to bereplaced with a synagogue. He has also called for the voluntary departure of Palestinian refugees from Gaza.Lammy described Smotrich’s commentsas monstrous and repellantin the Commons a fortnight ago, but he held back from placing sanctions on the two men. He imposed sanctions on a small group of settlers and announced there would be no further talks on an expanded trade deal with Israel.The former Conservative Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said he fully understood why the government had imposed the sanctions. The Labour chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Emily Thornberry, welcomed the move, but said it must not be a substitute for any plans to recognise a Palestinian state.Labour Friends of Israel said: “By their words and deeds, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich’s actions in government have given succour to those who perpetrate disgraceful and utterly unacceptable violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

We did nothing wrong.”The UK-flagged Madleen vessel wasseized by Israeli authoritieson Monday about 125 miles (200km) off the coast of Gaza, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organised the voyage. It was towed to the port of Ashdod, where the crew, which also included the French MEP Rima Hassan, were taken into police custody. Some remain in Israel, where they will face deportation hearings.The ship had been attempting to bring a symbolic shipment of aid to Gaza, which has been pushedto the brink of famineafter more than 11 weeks of total siege and severe restrictions that continue to limit the entry of food into the territory.‘The world does not care if we all die’: hunger and despair in the ruins of Gaza CityRead moreDozens of peoplehave been killedwhile trying to collect food from the handful of sites run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which are secured by armed guards and under the protection of the Israeli military. As the prospect of famine looms, questions have swirled over the foundation’scapacity to deliver aid.Thunberg, 22, said on Tuesday that the conditions the crew had faced were “absolutely nothing compared to what people are going through in Palestine and especially Gaza right now”, but said she was “very worried” about her fellow crew members and called for their immediate release.“I was very clear in my testimony that we were kidnapped on international waters and brought against our own will intoIsrael,” she said. “This is yet another intentional violation of rights that is added to the list of countless other violations that Israel is committing.”The stance was echoed by Sergio Toribio, a fellow crew member who was deported to Spain on Tuesday. “It is unforgivable, it is a violation of our rights. It is a pirate attack in international waters,” he told reporters after arriving in Barcelona.1:28Israeli forces halt Gaza-bound aid yacht carrying Greta Thunberg – videoAmnesty International also weighed in, with the organisation’s secretary general noting that the interception of the Madleen in international waters “violates international law”. In a statement, Agnès Callamard added: “The crew were unarmed activists and human rights defenders on a humanitarian mission, they must be released immediately and unconditionally.”Since Israel imposed a naval blockade on Gaza in 2007, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition have made several attempts to carry aid to Gaza.In May, one of their Gaza-bound shipswas damagedin international waters off Malta, with crew members issuing an SOS after what they described as an attack by Israeli drones. Israel’s military declined to comment.In 2010,nine activists were killedwhen Israeli commandos raided a small fleet of ships trying to ferry supplies, including building materials, to Gaza.Thunberg said she hadn’t been able to say goodbye to the rest of the crew, and that it was “unclear” why she had been deported while other crew members remained detained.Adalah, a legal rights group in Israel representing several of the crew members, said eight other passengers had refused deportation and were being held in detention as they waited for their cases to be heard by Israeli authoritiesThe crew had previously been disparaged by Israeli officials, with the foreign ministry labelling the vessel as the “selfie yacht” when it announced its seizure.On Tuesday, officials shared photos of Thunberg, a climate activist who haslong shunned air travel, being boarded on to a flight to France.Speaking after her arrival in Paris, Thunberg said the Gaza-bound ship had been a response to what she described as the “systematic starvation of over 2 million people and the full-blown, livestream genocide”.While aid was critically needed in Gaza, the voyage had also been driven by a broader aim, she said. “Also to send solidarity and say that we see you, we see what is happening and we cannot accept just witnessing all this and doing nothing.”Thunberg, who said it appeared she was now heading back to Sweden, also hit back at Donald Trump after she was asked about his characterisation of her as an “angry person” and suggestion that she should take anger management classes.“I think the world needs many more young angry women, to be honest,” said Thunberg. “Especially with everything going on right now.

Along with homebuying, no other life event is linked to such dramatic shifts in consumer behaviour.Data on pregnancy is believed to be more than 200 times more valuable than data on age, gender or location for targeted advertising. The report says period tracking could also be used to target women at different points in their cycle.The three most popular apps had estimated global download figures of a quarter of a billion in 2024. The femtech market – digital products focused on women’s health and wellbeing – will be worth more than $60bn (£44bn) by 2027, the report says.With such intense demand for period tracking, the authors called on public health bodies including theNHSin the UK to develop their own transparent and trustworthy apps to rival those from private companies, with apps allowing permission for data to be used in medical research.“The UK is ideally positioned to solve the question of access to menstrual data for researchers, as well as privacy and data commodification concerns, by developing an NHS app to track menstrual cycles,” said Felsberger, who added that the reproductive health provider Planned Parenthood in the US already had its own app but the UK lacked an equivalent.“Apps that are situated within public healthcare systems, and not driven primarily by profit, will mitigate privacy violations, provide much-needed data on reproductive health, and give people more agency over how their menstrual data is used.”Prof Gina Neff, the executive director of the Minderoo Centre, said: “The use of cycle tracking apps is at an all-time high.Womendeserve better than to have their menstrual tracking data treated as consumer data.”In the UK and EU, period tracking data is considered “special category”, as with that on genetics or ethnicity, and has more legal safeguarding. In the US, data on menstrual cycles has been collected by officials in an attempt to undermine abortion access, the report says.Explore more on these topicsMenstruationWomen's healthWomenAppsData protectionPrivacyNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

To ensure that renewal is felt in people’s everyday lives, their jobs, their communities.”A government source added: “We’re turning the tide against the unacceptable housing crisis in this country with the biggest boost to social and affordable housing investment in a generation, delivering on our commitment to get Britain building.”The boost for affordable housing comes after protracted and occasionally fraught negotiations between Rayner and Reeves, which ended over the weekend just days before the review was due to be announced.The announcement will enable the chancellor to promise a generational shift in government investment, as she looks to turn the page on a difficult few weeks during which she has done a U-turn on cutting winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners andunemployment reached its highest level in nearly four years.The housing announcement will come alongsidean extra £15.6bnfor local transport projects and£14.2bn to build a new nuclear power plantat Sizewell C.Rayner was the penultimate cabinet minister to reach agreement with the Treasury, followed on Monday by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, whois reportedto have accepted a settlement that could mean a cut to police numbers.Cooper, Rayner and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, have all endured difficult talks with the Treasury over the past few weeks as Reeves looks to limit departmental spending to just 1.2% above inflation.Miliband was reported to have stormed out of talks with Reeves’s deputy, Darren Jones, who conducted the bulk of the negotiations, while Rayner is said to have insisted on speaking directly to the chancellor.Rayner’s settlement fulfils her demand for a major boost to affordable housing funding, after warnings she would miss the 1.5m homes target this parliament without it. A recent Savillsreportwarned that ministers were further away from hitting that target than they previously admitted.Reeves will announce on Wednesday that she will allocate £39bn to the affordable homes programme for 10 years from 2026-36, to be paid for by the extra capital spending she has freed up by changing the government’s borrowing rules.That money represents a major uplift on the funding provided by the previous government, which allocated £11.8bn for the programme over a five-year period.Reeves will also announce a decade’s worth of social rent increases, alongside a consultation on how to ensure that the cheapest rents rise to meet the most expensive ones.The extra money will help housing associations buy up thousands of new units that have already been built by private developers as part of their affordable housing commitments, but which are sitting empty because associations cannot afford them.Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the NationalHousingFederation, which represents housing associations, called it “the most ambitious affordable homes programme in decades”.She added: “This is a transformational package for social housing and will deliver the right conditions for a decade of renewal and growth.”Mairi MacRae, director of campaigns and policy at Shelter, said: “This increased investment is a watershed moment in tackling the housing emergency. It’s a huge opportunity to reverse decades of neglect and start a bold new chapter for housing in this country.”The announcement will come a day after the government’s planning bill passed its third reading in the Commons, another major plank of the government’s efforts to reach the 1.5m target.Ministers say the changes to the planning regime, which will make it easier for developers to build on previously protected sites, are essential for easing Britain’s housing crisis. However, environmental campaigners saythey will putthousands of sensitive natural habitats at risk.The Guardianrevealed on Tuesdaythat several Labour MPs asked the Treasury to intervene to protect the changes after becoming worried that the housing department would cave in to the demands of some backbenchers for stricter environmental protections.Meanwhile, Rayner has also announced she will repeal a 200-year-old law that criminalises rough sleeping, a move that campaigners said could prevent hundreds of people being arrested for being homeless.The housing secretary said she would remove the Vagrancy Act of 1824 from the statute book within a year, making it impossible for law enforcement officers to arrest people purely for sleeping on the streets.Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025Social housingRachel ReevesAngela RaynerHousingLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier on Monday the boys had appeared in court charged with attempted rape. A Romanian interpreter read them the charges.On Tuesday, the PSNI said it had made a third arrest in connection with the incident and reiterated a public appeal for information. It said a 28-year-old man had been unconditionally released from police custody after questioning.View image in fullscreenProtesters blocking a street during an anti-immigration demonstration in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, on 10 June.Photograph: Peter Murphy/AFP/Getty ImagesThe attacks on Monday damaged two police vehicles and injured 15 officers, some who required hospital treatment. Four houses were damaged by fire and three people evacuated from their homes amid what are being investigated as racially motivated hate attacks.Liam Kelly, the chair of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, which represents officers, said the injuries told a “frightening story of a mob fully intent on inflicting great harm”. He said officers worked tirelessly to defuse a potentially explosive situation and uphold the law.“I have no doubt whatsoever that police officers – far too few, because the service is starved of resources and officer numbers – prevented a pogrom with consequences too painful to contemplate. What we saw was totally mindless, unacceptable and feral,” Kelly said.In a video shared online, a woman who had observed homes being attacked expressed concern that debris could “ricochet” and hit those participating or watching, theIrish News reported.View image in fullscreenRiots took place for a second night in Ballymena on 10 June.Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters“Be careful lads,” she said. A man then informed her that there were people in one of the houses being attacked. She replied: “Aye, but are they local? If they’re local, they need out. If they’re not local, let them fucking stay there.”The assistant chief constable Ryan Henderson said on Tuesday: “Over the coming days, we will have in place a significant policing presence to help protect these communities in Ballymena and prevent any future disorder.”Reinforcements would be sought from Wales and England if necessary, Henderson said.Jim Allister, the Traditional Unionist Voice leader and MP for North Antrim, condemned the violence and said tension had been building in the town, which is 25 miles north of Belfast. “Within Ballymena there has been rising concerns about the sheer scale of migration into the town, and that would have been a factor in the wholly peaceful protest,” he said.The Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, posted on X: “The terrible scenes of civil disorder we have witnessed in Ballymena again this evening have no place in Northern Ireland.“There is absolutely no justification for attacks on PSNI officers or for vandalism directed at people’s homes or property.”Politicians across Northern Ireland’s political spectrum condemned the violence. “There is absolutely no place in our society for such disorder,” said Naomi Long, the justice minister.The health minister, Mike Nesbitt, on Tuesday visited homes that had been damaged. “I understand people have concerns about immigration. There are legitimate ways to express those concerns – last night was not one of them,” he said.There has been a spate of intimidation and attacks against people from abroad in County Antrim in recent years,forcing some to flee.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Chicken in Poland is generally produced to different standards from those in the UK, and is cheaper as a result. Morrisons requires that for its UK chicken, poultry must be kept at amaximum stocking densityof 30kg/m2, giving the chickens more space to roam. In Poland, this is up to39kg/m2.The retailer has also begun to sell sirloin steak from Australia, made possible, according to NFU sources, by the unpopular trade deal struck byLiz Trusswith Australia. Australian beef, like Polish chicken, is generally produced to different animal welfare and environmental standards than meat in the UK. Feedlots arecommonly usedand, according to the RSPCA in Australia, the country is ranked D for farm animal welfare compared with B for the UK.Morrisons sponsors the TV showClarkson’s Farmandfrequently reiteratesits commitment to British farmers.Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson, said: “This is appalling fromMorrisons. They seek kudos for their UK sourcing but then sneakily do this, undermining British farmers and undermining their own integrity and brand.”Other supermarkets are also sourcing meat from farther afield than previously.Asdais now selling sirloin and ribeye steaks from Uruguay, priced much lower than their UK counterparts. They are priced at £21.94/kg and £23.70/kg respectively, which is about 20% less than their UK and Irish beef, priced at £27.93/kg for sirloin and £28.81 for ribeye.Stuart Roberts, a beef, sheep and cereal farmer from Hertfordshire, said: “With farmers under pressure from multiple directions I’d be fascinated to learn why Asda have decided this is an appropriate time to start stocking Uruguayan beef. There is no excuse for this huge betrayal of the UK’s hard-working family farms. Consumers and farmers deserve better.”Sainsbury’s has also been found to be stocking wagyu beef from New Zealand.Supermarkets said they were doing this to offer “outstanding value” to customers. The cost of red meat has soared in recent months, with UK farm gate beef prices at 713.3p/kg on 3 May, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), a 43.8% year-on-year increase. The AHDB predicts that beef production will fall by 5% in the next year due to a decline in farming profitability and anexpected cut to subsidies.The NFU livestock board chair, David Barton, said: “It’s deeply concerning to see major retailers now move away from their previous commitments to sourcing British … in favour of imports, many of which have been produced to lower standards. Farmers’ longstanding partnerships with retailers have supported sustainable supply chains, so this shift is alarming.“Decisions to renege on sourcing commitments erode trust and damage farmer confidence at a time when the sector is facing immense challenges and, with increased global insecurity, the need to build sustainable food supply chains has never been more important.“British farmers have invested in higher standards such as reducing antibiotic use in beef and lowering poultry stocking densities in sheds. But delivering these standards comes with additional financial costs. Long-term sourcing commitments from retailers are essential to ensuring that the high welfare British food consumers want remains available.”A Morrisons spokesperson said: “Morrisons remains 100% British on all our meat counters. In our aisles – alongside our New Zealand lamb – we are introducing trials of some imported meat from trusted suppliers to help us offer outstanding value through the seasons and through any supply fluctuations.“We are proud to be the single biggest direct supermarket customer of British farming and are looking to grow the overall volumes of British meat through Myton Food Group.”An Asda spokesperson said: “We always look to offer customers a wide choice of products to suit all budgets, and the country of origin is always clearly labelled on pack so customers can make an informed choice about their purchases. Grass & Grill steaks are provided by a branded partner and available in our stores for a limited time only. All of Asda’s own brand fresh beef continues to be sourced from farms in the UK and Republic of Ireland.”A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We’re proud to work with thousands of British farmers year-round and the vast majority of our beef range is sourced from the UK and Ireland. We have no plans to change this approach. All of our suppliers also have to meet the same rigorous quality standards, regardless of where the product is sourced from.“These seasonal products account for just 0.1% of our beef range and are an example of where there are times we may also source from elsewhere like New Zealand, so that we can continue to meet customer demand. The country of origin is clearly labelled, to help our customers make informed choices when they shop with us.”Explore more on these topicsMeatFarmingSupermarketsMeat industryInternational tradeMorrisonsAsdanewsShareReuse this content"

Is it too late to change course?Laura BatesTue 10 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 06.47 EDTShareEverybody knows that young women are not safe. They are not safe in the street, where 86% of those aged 18 to 24 haveexperienced sexual harassment. They are not safe at school, where 79% of young peopletold Ofstedthat sexual assault was common in their friendship groupsand almosta third of 16- to 18-year-old girlsreport experiencing “unwanted sexual touching”. They are not safe inswimming poolsor parks, or atthe beach. They are not even safe online, with the children’s safety charity theNSPCC reportingthat social media sites are “failing to protect girls from harm at every stage”.This will come as no surprise to any woman who has ever used social media. But it is particularly relevant as Meta, the operator of some of the biggest social platforms on the internet, is busily engaged in constructing awhole new world. The company is pumping billions of dollars a year into building its metaverse, a virtual world that it hopes will become the future not just of socialising, but of education, business, shopping and live events. This raises a simple question: if Meta has utterly failed to keep women and girls safe in its existing online spaces, why should we trust it with the future?Mark Zuckerberg has grandly promised: “In the metaverse, you’ll be able to do almost anything you can imagine.”It’s the sort of promise that might sound intensely appealing to some men and terrifying to most women.Indeed, the deeply immersive nature of the metaverse will make the harassment and abuse so many of us endure daily in text-based form on social media feel 100 times more real and will simultaneously make moderation 100 times more difficult. The result is a perfect storm. And I am speaking from experience, not idly speculating: I spent days in the metaverse researching my book,The New Age of Sexism.Less than two hours after I first entered the metaverse, I saw a woman’s avatar being sexually assaultedThere is no single definition of the metaverse, but most people use the term to describe a shared world in which virtual and augmented technologies allow users (represented by avatars) to interact with people, objects and environments. Most of Meta’s virtual world is accessible only to those who pay for the company’s Quest headsets, but a limited number of metaverse spaces can be accessed by any device connected to the internet. Advanced technology such as 3D positional audio, hand tracking and haptic feedback (when controllers use various vibrations to coincide with actions you take) combine to make virtual worlds feel real. Your avatar moves, speaks and gestures when you do, allowing users to interact verbally and physically.Less than two hours after I first entered the metaverse, I saw a woman’s avatar being sexually assaulted. When I approached her to ask her about the experience, she confirmed: “He came up to me and grabbed my ass.”“Does that happen a lot?” I asked.“All the time,” she replied, wearily.I used my haptic controller to “pick up” a bright-yellow marker and moved towards a giant blackboard. “HAVE YOU BEEN ASSAULTED IN THE METAVERSE?” I wrote.The response was near instantaneous. “Yeah, many times,” someone shouted.“I think everybody’s been assaulted in the damn metaverse,” one woman replied immediately, in a US accent.“Unfortunately, it is too common,” a British woman added, nodding.Both women told me they had been assaulted multiple times.During my time in the metaverse, sexual harassment and unwanted sexual comments were almost constant. I heard one player shout: “I’m dragging my balls all over your mother’s face,” to another and witnessed male players making claims about “beating off”, as well as comments about “gang bangs”. My virtual breasts were commented on repeatedly. I did not witness any action taken in response – whether by a moderator or by another player.A damningTechCrunchreportfrom 2022found that human moderators were available only in the main plaza of Meta’s metaverse game Horizon Worlds – and that they seemed more engaged in giving information on how to take a selfie than moderating user behaviour.The NSPCC said, where the means of communication was known, 47% of online grooming offences were on Meta productsMore worryingly still, I visited worlds where I saw what appeared to be young children frequently experiencing attention from adult men they did not know. In one virtual karaoke-style club, the bodies of the singers on stage were those of young women in their early 20s. But based on their voices, I would estimate that many of the girls behind the avatars were perhaps nine or 10 years old. Conversely, the voices of the men commenting on them from the audience, shouting out to them and following them offstage were often unmistakably those of adults.It is particularly incumbent on Meta to solve this problem. Of course, there are other companies, from Roblox to Microsoft, building user-generated virtual-reality gaming platforms and virtual co-working spaces. But, according to NSPCC research, while 150 apps, games and websites were used to groom children online between 2017 and 2023, where the means of communication was known, 47% of online grooming offences took place onproducts owned by Meta.These are not isolated incidents or cherry-picked horror stories. Research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that users were exposed to abusive behaviour every seven minutes in the metaverse. During 11 and a half hours recording user behaviour, the report identified100 potential violationsof Meta’s policies. This included graphic sexual content, bullying, abuse, grooming and threats of violence.View image in fullscreenA woman wearing VR goggles … Meta’s virtual world has been plagued with reports of sexual harassment and abuse.Photograph: AntonioSolano/Getty ImagesIn aseparate report, the CCDH found repeated instances of children being subjected to sexually explicit abuse and harassment, including an adult asking a young user: “Do you have a cock in your mouth?” and another adult shouting: “I don’t want to cum on you,” to a group of underage girls who explicitly told him they were minors.Since its inception, Meta’s virtual world has been plagued with reports of abuse. Users have reported being virtually groped, assaulted and raped. Researchers have also described beingvirtually stalkedin the metaverse by other players, who tail them insistently, refuse to leave them alone and even follow them into different rooms or worlds.In December 2021, a beta tester of the metaverse wrote in the officialFacebookgroup of the Horizon platform: “Not only was I groped last night, but there were other people there who supported this behaviour.”What was even more revealing than the virtual assault itself was Meta’s response. Vivek Sharma, then vice-president of Horizon at Meta, responded to the incident by tellingthe Vergeit was “absolutely unfortunate”. After Meta reviewed the incident, he claimed, it determined that the beta tester didn’t use the safety features built into Horizon Worlds, including the ability to block someone from interacting with you. “That’s good feedback still for us because I want to make [the blocking feature] trivially easy and findable,” he continued.This response was revealing. First, the euphemistic description of the event as “unfortunate”, which made it sound on a par with poor sound quality. Second, the immediate shifting of the blame and responsibility on to the person who experienced the abuse – “she should have been using certain tools to prevent it” – rather than an acknowledgment that it should have been prevented from happening in the first place. And, finally, most importantly, the description of a woman being abused online as “good feedback”.Much subsequent discourse has focused on the question of whether or not a sexual assault or rape carried out in virtual reality should be described as such; whether it might have an impact on the victims similar to a real‑life assault. But this misses the point. First, it is worth noting that the experience of being sexually harassed, assaulted or raped in the metaverse has had a profound and distressing impact on many victims.When it was revealed in 2024 that British police were investigating the virtual gang-rape of a girl below the age of 16 in the metaverse, a senior officer familiar with the casetold the media: “This child experienced psychological traumasimilar to that of someone who has been physically raped”.We can’t let tech companies off the hook because they claim the problem is too big or too unwieldy to tackleSecond, technology to make the metaverse feel physically real is developing at pace. You can already buy full-body suits that promise to “enhance your VR experience with elaborate haptic sensations”. They have sleeves, gloves and vests with dozens of different feedback points. Wearable haptic technology will bring the experience of being virtually assaulted much closer to the physical sensation of real-life victimisation. All the more reason to tackle it now, regardless of how “realistic” it is or isn’t, rather than waiting for things to get worse.But most importantly, regardless of how similar to or different from physical offline harms these forms of abuse are, what matters is that they are abusive, distressing, intimidating, degrading and offensive and that they negatively affect victims. And, as we have already seen with social media, the proliferation of such abuse will prevent women and girls from being able to fully use and benefit from new forms of technology.View image in fullscreenA 3D rendering of a metaverse city.Photograph: Kinwun/Getty ImagesIf Zuckerberg’s vision comes to fruition and the boardrooms, classrooms, operating theatres, lecture halls and meeting spaces of tomorrow exist in virtual reality, then closing those spaces off from women, girls and other marginalised groups, because of the tolerance of various forms of prejudice and abuse in the metaverse, will be devastating. If we allow this now, when the metaverse is (relatively speaking) in its infancy, we are baking inequality into the building blocks of this new world.At the time of the afore­mentioned virtual-reality rape of an underage girl, Meta said in a statement: “The kind of behaviour described has no place on our platform, which is why for all users we have an automatic protection called personal boundary, which keeps people you don’t know a few feet away from you.”Inanother incident, when a researcher experienced a virtual assault, Meta’s comment to the press was: “We want everyone using our services to have a good experience and easily find the tools that can help prevent situations like these and so we can investigate and take action.”The focus always seems to be on users finding and switching on tools to prevent harassment or reporting abuse when it does happen. It is not on preventing abuse and taking serious action against abusers.But in theCCDH researchthat identified 100 potential violations of Meta’s VR policies, just 51 of the incidents could be reported to Meta using a web form created by the platform for this purpose, because the platform refuses to examine policy violations if it cannot match them to a predefined category or username in its database.Worse, not one of those 51 reports of policy violation (including sexual harassment and grooming of minors) was acknowledged by Meta and as a result no action was taken. It’s not much good pointing to your complaints system as the solution to abuse if you don’t respond to complaints.Meta’s safety features will no doubt continue to evolve and adapt – but, once again, in a repeat of what we have already seen happen on social media, women and girls will be the canaries in the coalmines, their abuse and suffering providing companies with useful data points with which to tweak their products and increase their profits. Teenage girls’ trauma: a convenient building material.There is something incredibly depressing about all this. If we are really talking about reinventing the world here, couldn’t we push the boat out a little? Couldn’t we dare to dream of a virtual world in which those who so often face abuse are safe by design – with the prevention and eradication of abuse built in – instead of being tasked with the responsibility of protecting themselves when the abuse inevitably arises?None of this is whining or asking too much. Don’t be fooled into thinking that we are all lucky to be using Meta’s tools for nothing. We are paying for them in the tracking and harvesting of our data, our content, our photographs, our ideas and, as the metaverse develops, our hand and even eye movements. All of it can be scraped and used to train enormously powerful AI tools and predictive behavioural algorithms, access to which can then be sold to companies at gargantuan prices to help them forecast how we as consumers behave. It is not an exaggeration to say that we already pay Meta a very high price for using its platforms. And if the metaverse really does become as widely adopted and as ubiquitous in the fundamental operation of our day-to-day lives as Zuckerberg hopes, there won’t be an easy way to opt out.We can’t let tech companies off the hook because they claim the problem is too big or too unwieldy to tackle. We wouldn’t accept similar excuses for dodging regulation from international food companies, or real-life venues. And the government should be prepared to act in similar ways here, introducing regulation to require proved safety standards at the design stage, before products are rolled out to the public.“Hold on, just building the future here,” Horizon Worlds tells me as I wait to access the metaverse. As we battle to eradicate the endemic harassment and abuse that women and girls face in real-world settings, the metaverse presents a risk of slipping backwards. We are sleepwalking into virtual spaces where men’s entitlement to women’s bodies is once again widespread and normalised with near total impunity.The Guardian invited Meta to reply to this article, but the company did not respond.The New Age of Sexism: How the AI Revolution Is Reinventing Misogyny by Laura Bates is published by Simon & Schuster (£20).

The price of a barrel of Brent crude has since recovered to about $67.Von der Leyen told reporters on Tuesday that lowering the cap would “restore its effectiveness”.Oilexports, she added, represented one-third of Russian government revenues. “We need to cut this source of revenues.”She expressed confidence the G7 would adopt the lower oil price cap, despite uncertainty about Donald Trump’s appetite to impose sanctions on Vladimir Putin. G7 leaders, including von der Leyen, are due to discuss the proposal in Canada next week.Referring to herrecent discussions with the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, von der Leyen said: “We are very much aligned in the aim to urge Russia by those massive sanctions to come to the negotiation table and to be serious about negotiations that lead towards a just and lasting peace … And therefore I am very confident that we will achieve this goal [the $45 price cap].”Graham is the author of a bill that he says would impose“bone-breaking sanctions”on Putin including a 500% tariff on goods from countries importing Russian oil.As part of the EU’s proposed 18th round of sanctions against Russia, the commission also wants to tighten up measures against the country’s “shadow fleet”, hundreds of old and poorly maintained tankers that enable the Kremlin to export oil to countries such as India at a price above the western-imposed cap.For the first time Brussels is targeting sanctions against the captain of a shadow fleet tanker, an Indian national, according to an unpublished draft sanctions proposal. Officials hope this will have a chilling effect, discouraging others from crewing the vessels, which fly under a flag of convenience.The commission also proposes listing 70 more shadow fleet vessels on its sanctions list, bringing the total under designation to more than 400. One EU diplomat estimated last month that the fleet now stood at about 800 tankers, up from just 100 two years ago.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, claimed sanctions on the shadow fleet were having a marked impact. “When sanctioned, Russia’s shadow fleet tankers cannot dock in ports and Russia has to find new vessels. This costs some more and runs down their profits.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Russia has expressed interest in reviving the gas projects connecting Russia and Germany. EU officials say the measure is necessary to dissuade investors from going back to business as usual.The latest proposals, which would have to be agreed unanimously by the EU’s 27 member states, would also impose restrictions on doing business with 22 banks, cutting them off from the Swift financial messaging system.European leaders last monthvowed to impose “massive” sanctions on Russiaif Putin did not agree to a 30-day ceasefire within days. “We are ramping up pressure on Russia because strength is the only language that Russia will understand,” von der Leyen said.Explore more on these topicsOilCommoditiesEuropean UnionEuropeRussiaUkraineUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

He was inspired by Nordic mythology when he created his “Monsters” characters for a series of picture books in 2015, including Labubu.Ping An Bank’s promotion offered new customers a choice between a Labubu 3.0 blind box and a gift package.However, the Chinese regulator wants to stop the practice of offering customers gifts, which can also include rice, small home appliances and online memberships, because it is concerned that this will increase costs at banks and hurt their profit margins.Banks’ margins are at a record low. China’s central bank cut benchmark interest rates last month for the first time since October in an attempt to shield the economy from the impact of Donald Trump’s trade war. A few days later, the authorities lowered the ceilings on deposit rates to protect banks’ profit margins and discourage savings.Ping An Bank’s marketing campaign went viral on the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, and drew strong interest from savers, but state media said it was “not a long-term solution”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He wanted a response after the lacklustre performance against Andorra in Barcelona on Saturday, albeit in a1-0 World Cup qualifying win. What he got was another line to his brow, plenty to ponder as he begins what could be a long summer debrief. And more boos.There was a bit of zip and personality from Tuchel’s team in the final 25 minutes of regulation time. He made attacking changes, with the Nottingham Forest midfielder, Morgan Gibbs-White – on his home ground – showing up. Eberechi Eze, who played from the start, was good. Morgan Rogers came on up front for Harry Kane, who had givenEnglandan early lead, and there was some pace and energy.England v Senegal: men’s international football friendly – liveRead moreThe problem was that Senegal were 2-1 up by then, having played around and through England far too easily. They were much the better team in the first half, Ismaïla Sarr’s equaliser scant reward for their efforts. The faultlines were pronounced for England at the back; it was a particularly uncomfortable evening for the full-backs, Kyle Walker and Myles Lewis-Skelly. The build-ups from the back were tough to watch. There was an overall timidity.England looked as though they might escape with a draw in this friendly when Jude Bellingham, who came off the bench, took a touch on his thigh before lashing home in the 83rd minute after Levi Colwill had smuggled a corner towards him. That would be scrubbed out when the VAR spotted the ball had come off Colwill’s upper arm.Tuchel went for broke, introducing Ivan Toney for Lewis-Skelly and switching to three at the back. But Senegal had continued to advertise their threat on the counter and with England now leaving the back door open, they stormed through it in stoppage time. Curtis Jones, another England replacement, was dispossessed by Idrissa Gueye and Lamine Camara’s pass was weighted for the substitute, Cheikh Sabaly, to sweep home.Quick GuideRoundup: Depay leads Dutch rout of MaltaShowMemphis Depay equalled Robin van Persie as theNetherlands' all-time leading men's goalscorer with a double in their World Cup qualifying 8-0 rout ofMalta. Depay opened the scoring from the penalty spot and then moved level with Van Persie on 50 goals with his strike just after the 15-minute mark in Groningen. Subsitute Donyell Malen struck twice with Virgil van Dijk, Xavi Simons, Noa Lang and Micky van de Ven also on target.Elsewhere in Group G,FinlanddefeatedPoland2-1 in a game with a lengthy break due to a medical emergency in the crowd, with one supporter taken to hospital in Helsinki. Joel Pohjanpalo scored a penalty and Benjamin Kallman came off the bench to net, with Arsenal's Jakub Kiwior pulling one back. Poland were without Robert Lewandowski, who has withdrawn from international duty after being stripped of the captaincy by the head coach, Michal Probierz.In Group H,Austriaswept aside minnowsSan Marino4-0 thanks to a double from Marko Arnautovic, with Michael Gregoritsch and Christoph Baumgartner also on target in Serravalle. Arnautovic missed out on a hat-trick after his late penalty was saved by Edoardo Colombo. In Bucharest, Florin Tanase and Dennis Man both struck just before half-time asRomaniadefeatedCyprus2-0.In Group K, England's rivalsSerbiaclaimed a 3-0 win overAndorrain Leskovac thanks to an Aleksandar Mitrovic hat-trick, adding a second-half penalty to his two first-half goals.LatviaheldAlbaniato a 1-1 draw in Riga, Latvia's Antonijs Cernomordijs scoring for both teams and Janis Ikaunieks missing a penalty.Isaac Price made the difference at both ends as 10-manNorthern Irelandheld on for a 1-0 friendly win over Iceland. The West Brom midfielder put Northern Ireland ahead, bending his shot into the bottom corner after the referee had played a helpful advantage. After Brodie Spencer was sent off  in the second half, Price cleared Andri Gudjohnsen's header off the line, before goalkeeper Pierce Charles kept out Isak Johannesson's header in stoppage time.Max O'Leary marked his long-awaitedRepublic of Irelanddebut with two vital saves to spare his team's blushes inLuxembourg. The 28-year-old Bristol City keeper denied Danel Sinani and substitute Vincent Thill either side of half-time, while the Ireland captain Nathan Collins headed against the post and substitute Jack Taylor blasted against the bar as the friendly ended goalless.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It was the prompt for thousands of home supporters to stream for the exits, the full-time whistle bringing jeers from those that stayed. “Disgraceful,” bellowed one fan close to the press box. Never before have England lost to an African nation. Has Tuchel had a honeymoon period? It is hard to say, given the opposition in some quarters to his appointment. If he has, it is 100% over.Tuchel wanted Senegal to come and play. No 5-4-1 Andorra-style low block, bus parked, handbrake on. He expects his England team to raise their level significantly against the better opponents. Which for long spells, did not happen.Senegal played. There was a moment early on when the quicksilver Iliman Ndiaye streaked away from Lewis-Skelly up the right before tricking inside Conor Gallagher and playing in Nicolas Jackson with a reverse pass. It was a clear chance for Jackson, who blasted too close to Dean Henderson. The tone was set.Can a visiting team start too well? Camara was certainly emboldened to try a fancy spin on the edge of his own defensive third and when he was robbed by Eze, who played as a No 10-cum-second striker, Senegal were stretched. Eze went left to Gallagher, who went left again for Anthony Gordon, who shot low. Édouard Mendy made a hash of the save. Kane was alive to the rebound.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane pounces to score past Édouard Mendy and put England ahead.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersIt was a weird first-half performance from England. They were static and predictable when they attempted to play out. Where were the options? Tuchel wants time to instil them. He does not have it. England played with fire as Senegal brought the press. Tuchel’s men made errors on the ball. They went down, at times, desperately appealing for fouls. It was tough to watch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sarr made up three yards on Walker, which really should not have happened, while Jackson had run away from the England debutant, Trevoh Chalobah, on to a ball over the top. Senegal had other flickers in the first half. Sarr was left alone to work Henderson with a header and Gueye did likewise when he shot through a crowd.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr celebrates his equaliser as England players look forlorn.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PATuchel had demanded energy, exuberance. It was Senegal who continued to bring it after the restart. There was a reason why Tuchel introduced Gibbs-White just before the hour. The crowd needed a lift. So did England. By then, Senegal might have been ahead, Habib Diarra lifting high following an El Hadji Malick Diouf cross.It was no surprise when Senegal took the lead. Lewis-Skelly was caught out by Kalidou Koulibaly’s ball up the inside right channel and Diarra was away, England wide open. The finish was steered through Henderson’s legs.Gibbs-White was positive while Eze came alive as England tried to respond. There was an outrageous touch and layoff from the latter for Gibbs-White, who drilled too close to Mendy. The pair also combined to tee up Bukayo Saka; his shot was brilliantly saved by the goalkeeper. For a moment, it appeared that Bellingham would be England’s saviour. Instead, Sabaly would twist the knife.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEnglandSenegal football teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Masters champion visited the venue just outside Pittsburgh at the start of last week on a scouting mission. On Tuesday, he gave a grisly definition of what unfolded.“Last Monday felt impossible,” McIlroy said. “I birdied the last two holes for 81. It felt pretty good, it didn’t feel like I played that badly. It’s much more benign right now than it was that Monday. They had the pins in dicey locations and greens were running at 15.5 [on the stimpmeter]. It was nearly impossible. This morning it was a little softer. The pins aren’t going to be on 3 or 4% slopes all the time.Rory McIlroy annoyed over driver disclosure at US PGA ChampionshipRead more“If you put it in the fairway, it’s certainly playable. But then you just have to think about leaving your ball below the hole and just trying to make as many pars as you can. You get yourself in the way of a few birdies, that’s a bonus.“I’m glad we have spotters out there because last Monday you hit a ball off the fairway and you were looking for a good couple of minutes just to find it. It’s very penal if you miss. Sometimes it’s penal if you don’t miss. The person with the most patience and the best attitude this week is the one that’s going to win.”Oakmont’s rough is notoriously thick, which plays a key role in scores being high. Ángel Cabrera prevailed when five over par in 2007. Jon Rahm said: “There’s going to be times when you miss the fairway by a foot and you’re going to have to punch out 20, 50 yards at best. “At that point, it’s luck of the draw.”In theory, none of this bodes particularly well for McIlroy. He has endured recent struggles with driver in hand, including when missing the cut atlast weekend’s Canadian Open. That club has been replaced before the third major of the year.McIlroy’s issue is not really a technical one, though. Scaling the mountain at Augusta National in April, where hecompleted the career grand slam, has placed the Northern Irishman in intriguing psychological territory. Quite naturally, the resetting of goals has proved tricky.View image in fullscreenBryson DeChambeau is the defending US Open champion after winning at Pinehurst.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty Images“I’m sort of just taking it tournament by tournament at this point,” the world No 2 said. “You dream about the final putt going in at the Masters but you don’t think about what comes next. I think I’ve always been a player that struggles to play after a big event, after I win whatever tournament. I always struggle to show up with motivation the next week because you’ve just accomplished something and you want to enjoy it and you want to relish the fact that you’ve achieved a goal.“Chasing a certain goal for the better part of a decade and a half, I think I’m allowed a little bit of time to relax a little bit.” McIlroy will spend the opening two rounds in the company of fellow European Ryder Cup players Shane Lowry and Justin Rose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You have to hit the fairways, you have to hit greens and you have to two-putt, worst-case scenario. When you’ve got those putts inside 10ft, you’ve got to make them. It’s a great test of golf.”DeChambeau has emerged as LIV Golf’s most valuable asset, which renders the end of his current contract with the Saudi Arabian-backed tour an interesting moment in time. The Californian appears confident of staying within his current playing domain. “Next year is when it ends,” he said of his LIV deal.“We’re looking to negotiate end of this year and I’m very excited. They see the value in me. I see the value in what they can provide, and I believe we’ll come to some sort of resolution on that. Super-excited for the future.“I think that LIV is not going anywhere. His Excellency [Yasir al‑Rumayyan] has been steadfast in his belief on team golf and whether everybody believes in it or not, I think it’s a viable option. I think it’s a viable commercial option.”Explore more on these topicsGolfRory McIlroyUS OpenPGA TourEuropean TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

No level of sporting success is worth such a cost.”The rebuke is the most forceful yet against the Enhanced Games, an Olympics-style event set to debut next May in Las Vegas where athletes will be allowed, and in some cases incentivized, to use banned substances under medical supervision.Organizers of the Enhanced Games have positioned the competition as a radical alternative to traditional sport, promising to embrace what they call “superhumanity” by normalizing pharmaceutical and technological enhancement. The event will run 21–24 May 2026 at Resorts World on the Las Vegas Strip and feature sprinting, swimming and weightlifting.While promoters frame the Games as a scientific revolution and a break from what they call the “hypocrisy” of anti-doping regimes, the backlash has been swift and severe.“This is a dangerous clown show, not real sport,” said Travis Tygart, CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency, in an earlier statement. “As we have seen through history, performance-enhancing drugs have taken a terrible physical and mental toll on many athletes. Some have died.”The Enhanced Games’ founder, the Australian entrepreneur Aron D’Souza, insists the event is both ethical and medically sound. Athletes will undergo individualized health profiling, disclose all substances used while competing under the supervision of independent scientific and ethics boards. Traditional anti-doping tests will not be conducted.View image in fullscreenPeter Thiel, center, the tech billionaire known for his libertarian politics and backing of controversial biotech ventures, has been listed as a major investor and “close advisor” to the Enhanced Games.Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images“The Enhanced Games is renovating the Olympic model for the 21st century,” D’Souza said. “In the era of accelerating technological and scientific change, the world needs a sporting event that embraces the future – particularly advances in medical science.”Critics say the model amounts to “don’t ask, don’t tell” for doping. Others see a deeper agenda: a challenge not only to sport’s institutions but to its foundational values. Many have also raised concerns about the political and financial backers of the event.‘Imagine if a 60-year-old broke Usain Bolt’s record’: the story behind the Enhanced Games, the Olympics where everyone dopesRead moreThe latest round of funding includes investment from 1789 Capital – a firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr and Omeed Malik – while tech billionaire Peter Thiel has been listed as a major investor and “close advisor”, according to D’Souza. Avideo announcing the backingappeared to suggest the US president’s personal endorsement. D’Souza has openly welcomed their involvement, describing Trump-aligned figures as “some of the most significant” cultural supporters of the project.The event’s tagline, Live Enhanced, has become both a rallying cry and a provocation. Organizers say they are recruiting athletes who feel alienated by conventional doping restrictions, including former swimming world champion James Magnussen. In February, Greek-Bulgarian swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev recorded a time 0.02sec faster than the longstanding 50m freestyle world record, reportedly while following an enhancement protocol. But the swim was not officially recognized – in part because he wore a polyurethane suit not approved by Fina, swimming’s global governing body.Prize money for the 2026 Games is substantial: up to $500,000 per event, with a $1m bonus for record-breaking performances.Despite mounting criticism, the Enhanced Games show no signs of slowing down. Organizers say discussions are ongoing with sponsors and streaming platforms, though no broadcast partner or marquee athlete has been publicly confirmed. If regulatory pressure builds, the Games’ future could hinge on whether the public sees the venture as scientific progress or a dangerous line crossed.For now, Olympic athletes say the stakes couldn’t be higher.“We stand firmly together for the values of fair play, ethical behaviour and respect,” the IOC andWadaathletes said in Tuesday’s statement. “We will do everything we can to protect the integrity of sport for generations to come.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs in sportInternational Olympic CommitteeWadaDonald Trump JrPeter ThielSport politicsAustralia sportShareReuse this content"

I don’t know. I’m waiting until my dad leaves. When he leaves, then I’ll go. Until then, I’m going to sit here with him.“Colorado opens the season at home against Georgia Tech on 29 August.The Buffaloes finished 9-4 (7-2 Big 12) in Sanders’ second season in 2024 but lost two of their most high-profile players – Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter and quarterback (and coach’s son) Shedeur Sanders – to the 2025 NFL draft.Deion Sanders has dealt with health problems in the recent past. He had two toes amputated in 2022 due to blood clots and also missed the Pac-12 media day in 2023 because of blood clots in his legs.Sanders had been scheduled to speak last weekend at a medical conference in Florida but had to cancel.“Due to an unavoidable last-minute scheduling change, our originally scheduled Foundation Keynote Speaker, Deion Sanders ’Coach Prime,’ is unable to attend. We are grateful for his support and look forward to future opportunities to welcome him,” the Foundation for Sickle Cell Disease Research posted on X.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

All the key questions are answered hereGuardian sportTue 10 Jun 2025 14.01 EDTShareHang on, I thought the World Cup was next year …The 2026 World Cup is what is technically known as the Proper World Cup, for national teams. This summer’s tournament is theClubWorld Cup, featuring some (with the emphasis on “some”) of the world’s best domestic teams – Real Madrid, PSG, River Plate and the like.David Squires on … Infantino’s Club World Cup buildup in the land of TrumpRead moreDidn’t that already exist?It did!Manchester City are technically the holders. But if there’s one thing Fifa likes, it’s grossly expanded tournaments and the Club World Cup is no exception. Since the tournament started in 2000, it usually featured six or seven teams representing Fifa’s various confederations. The teams would turn up, play a few knockout games in half-full stadiums – and the whole thing would be done in around 10 days with very few people remembering who actually won the thing by the time next year’s edition came around.Naturally,Fifadecided fans wanted even more of this type of thing and have expanded the tournament: 32 teams will now play 63 games in 11 host cities across the United States over a period of four weeks. Like the most recent World Cup, there will be a group stage with the best two teams from each of the eight groups progressing to the last-16 knockout stage.Right, so the best 32 teams in the world then ...Well … not exactly. With all due respect to Asia, Africa, North America, Central America, the Caribbean and Oceania, the 32 best club teams on Earth are almost certainly in Europe and South America. But this is aWorldCup, so the teams are mainly made up of clubs who have won their respective continental championships over the last four years (so, for example, recent winners of the Champions League get in from Europe).There are more places for teams from stronger federations such as Europe’s Uefa (12 slots) and South America’s Conmebol (six slots) than weaker federations (Oceania’s OFC gets just one). There are some oddities to the qualifying process though. The US got an extra slot as tournament hosts, meaning their domestic champion from 2024 would qualify. Most fans would say that would be the MLS Cup champion, which is decided after a post-season playoff competition (the2024 champion was Los Angeles Galaxy). Instead, Fifa decided the team with the best regular-season record would qualify. That just happened to be Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi, the most famous player in the world. Make of that what you will.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi (left) and Luis Suárez lead an ageing Inter Miami attack at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APAnother MLS team made it in slightly circuitous fashion. Fifa rules mean that two clubs with the same ownership can’t compete at the tournament. That meant Club Léon weredeprived of their slotbecause another Mexican team at the tournament, Pachuca, are under the same ownership group. That led to a playoff between Los Angeles FC and Club América to decide Léon’s replacement, withLAFC winning.And then there is Auckland City. The best two teams in New Zealand, Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix, play in Australia’s A-League, which is part of the Asian Football Confederation. That means Auckland City, as the winner of the OFC Champions League, grabbed the one slot for Oceania.So who is playing?AFC (Asia)Al-Hilal, Saudi Arabia (winners of the 2021 AFC Champions League)Urawa Red Diamonds, Japan (winners of the 2022 AFC Champions League)Al Ain, UAE (winners of the 2023–24 AFC Champions League)Ulsan, South Korea (best-ranked eligible team in the AFC four-year ranking)Caf (Africa)Al-Ahly, Egypt (winners of the 2020–21 Caf Champions League)Wydad, Morocco (winners of the 2021–22 Caf Champions League)Espérance de Tunis, Tunisia (best-ranked eligible team in the Caf four-year ranking)Mamelodi Sundowns, South Africa (second-best ranked eligible team in the Caf four-year ranking)Concacaf (North, Central America, and the Caribbean)Monterrey, Mexico (winners of the 2021 Concacaf Champions League)Seattle Sounders, USA (winners of the 2022 Concacaf Champions League)Pachuca, Mexico (winners of the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup)Los Angeles FC, USA (winners of play-off match)Conmebol (South America)Palmeiras, Brazil (winners of the 2021 Copa Libertadores)Flamengo, Brazil (winners of the 2022 Copa Libertadores)Fluminense, Brazil (winners of the 2023 Copa Libertadores)Botafogo, Brazil (winners of the 2024 Copa Libertadores)River Plate, Argentina (best-ranked eligible team in the Conmebol four-year ranking)Boca Juniors, Argentina (second-best ranked eligible team in the Conmebol four-year ranking)Uefa (Europe)Chelsea, England (winners of the 2020–21 Uefa Champions League)Real Madrid, Spain (winners of the 2021–22 Uefa Champions League)Manchester City, England (winners of the 2022–23 Uefa Champions League)Bayern Munich, Germany (best-ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Paris Saint-Germain, France (second-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Internazionale, Italy (fourth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Porto, Portugal (fifth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Benfica, Portugal (seventh-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Borussia Dortmund, Germany (Third-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Juventus, Italy (Eighth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Atlético Madrid, Spain (Sixth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)Red Bull Salzburg, Austria (Ninth-best ranked eligible team in the Uefa four-year ranking)OFC (Oceania)Auckland City, New Zealand (best OFC Champions League winners in the OFC four-year ranking)Host Nation (USA)Inter Miami, USA (winners of the 2024 MLS Supporters’ Shield)The players must be excited about playing in a World CupPlaying intheWorld Cup is the highlight of any player’s career. Playing in theClub World Cup? Not so much. Fifpro, the global players’ union, said adding another month to an already crowded calendar is a health risk. Consider this: a top player in Europe will face having almost no rest in the summer for three consecutive years if they end up playing at Euro 2024, the 2025 Club World Cup and the 2026 World Cup. Oh, and the latter two tournaments will be played in the hottest months in the US as global heating makes conditions a lot tougher.View image in fullscreenManchester City won the most recent Club World Cup back in 2023, beating Fluminense in the final.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockWhat kind of prize money is involved?Quite a lot. The total prize pool for the tournamentis $1bn. Yes, with a B. Just over half of that total goes to the clubs just for being there, and different teams have received differently-sized payouts for their participation, depending on where they hail from.Oceania’s representative gets $3.58m just for showing up. African, Asian, and North American clubs $9.55m. South American sides get $15.21m, while European teams will get anywhere from $12.81m to $38.19m, depending on what Fifa calls “sporting and commercial criteria” (in other words: how famous and good they are).The remaining $425m is distributed based on performance in the tournament. Teams earn $2m for a win and $1m for a draw in the group stage, $7.5m for making the round of 16, $13.1m for making a quarter-final, $21m for making a semi-final, $30m for making the final, and another $40m for winning the whole dang thing.It should be noted that the prize money mentioned above is awarded to the teams, not the players. Different teams will distribute the winnings to players differently according to a number of factors, but that doesn’t mean players are happy with that arrangement. In MLS, there is an ongoing dispute between the players and the league over a cap on bonuses that would limit each MLS locker room from receiving more than $1m for the tournament, no matter how well they do. The two sides are currently trading proposals, but the tenor of negotiations hasn’t been all that friendly.Manchester City, for their part, has been public about not sharing prizes with their players:“Not even a watch,”said Pep Guardiola.Is there a Trump factor to look out for?Many see this tournament as a test run for the US’s co-hosting of next year’s World Cup, and the results are already … mixed. Donald Trump has issued a travel ban relating to citizens of a number of countries. Athletes participating in the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics areexempt from the ban, but it’s still unclear whether that applies to players at the Club World Cup. Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, met Trump in the White House in March when theyunveiled the new Club World Cup trophy. Trump could completely ignore the tournament, decide to use it as an excuse for self-promotion – as he has with other sports events such as the Super Bowl – or turn on Fifa for a perceived slight. Say one thing for the man: he’s not easy to predict.What are the venues?Rose Bowl– Pasadena, California (Capacity: 88,500). Will host group stage and last-16 matches. Historic stadium that is renowned for hosting many college (gridiron) football games and the 1994 and 1999 World Cup finals.MetLife Stadium– East Rutherford, New Jersey (Capacity: 82,500). Will host group stage matches, quarter-final, both semi-finals and final. This is the everyday home of the NFL’s New York Giants and Jets, and will be hosting the 2026 World Cup final.View image in fullscreenMetLife Stadium also hosted last year’s Copa América semi-final between Canada and Argentina.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesMercedes-Benz Stadium– Atlanta, Georgia (Capacity: 75,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. The everyday home of the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United of MLS.Bank of America Stadium– Charlotte, North Carolina (Capacity: 75,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches. The usual home of the NFL’s Carolina Panthers and Charlotte FC of MLS.Lincoln Financial Field– Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Capacity: 69,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. The usual home of the Philalphia Eagles of the NFL.Lumen Field– Seattle, Washington (Capacity: 69,000). Will host group-stage matches. The usual home for the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, MLS’s Seattle Sounders, and the NWSL’s Reign FC.Hard Rock Stadium– Miami Gardens, Florida (Capacity: 65,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches. The usual home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins.Camping World Stadium– Orlando, Florida (Capacity: 65,000). Will host group-stage and last-16 matches as well as a quarter-final. Formerly known as the Citrus Bowl, it’s hosted a number of major college gridiron football and in a previous live, games during the 1994 World Cup.Geodis Park– Nashville, Tennessee (Capacity: 30,000). Group-stage matches. This is the home stadium of MLS side Nashville SC, opened in 2022.TQL Stadium– Cincinnati, Ohio (Capacity: 26,000). Group-stage matches. This is the home stadium of MLS side FC Cincinnati, opened in 2021.Inter&Co Stadium– Orlando, Florida (Capacity: 25,000). Group-stage matches. The home venue for MLS side Orlando City, opened in 2017.Audi Field– Washington, D.C. (Capacity: 20,000). Group-stage matches. The home venue of MLS side DC United, opened in 2018.Will anyone watch?The early signs are not great. Consider the tournament’s opening match, between Inter Miami and Al Alhy. Miami are playing in their own city and have one of the greatest players of all time, and yet the match is struggling to sell out with The Athletic reporting that only around 20,000 tickets for the 65,000 capacity Hard Rock Stadium have been sold. If Miami are struggling to sell tickets then it’s worth wondering how many people are going to turn up for Wydad v Al Ain. Having said that, there is huge interest in European giants such as Real Madrid and Chelsea and their games should attract big crowds.10 players to keep an eye onKylian Mbappé, Real Madrid– Heard of him? The French superstar is facing some degree of questioning after his first season in the Spanish capital ended with no major titles. Would a Club World Cup alleviate those doubts?Ousmane Dembélé, PSG– The forward was instrumental in helping PSG capture their coveted Champions League title in May, and he’ll presumably continue to be centre to the European champions’ plans in the USA.Lionel Messi, Inter Miami– The Argentinian superstar has a World Cup to his name…can he add a Club World Cup to that list? Realistically, it may be a tough ask with this Miami team, even with the help of Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and Luis Suárez. But it’ll be fun to watch him in a tournament setting again.Omar Marmoush, Manchester City– The Egyptian made a big impact since joining City in January from Eintracht Frankfurt, scoring eight goals in all competitions including a memorable thunderbolt v Bournemouth.Cole Palmer, Chelsea– Palmer ended his season in great form, even though his overall campaign left something to be desired. The England international leads a Chelsea team stocked with young talent.Denis Bouanga, LAFC– The Gabon international near-singlehandedly dragged LAFC into the tournament with a sublime performance in the one-game play-in versus Club América. Bouanga has long been one of MLS’s most dangerous attackers, and it will be interesting to see him bring it against international competition.Franco Mastantuono, River Plate (for now)– The 17-year-old Mastantuono is seen as one of the brightest up-and-coming talents in Argentina, so much so that he became the youngest-ever debutant for the Argentine national team last week. Real Madrid and River Plate are currently locked in transfer talks according to multiple reports – the only question now is if he’ll stay with his current side through the Club World Cup, or move earlier.View image in fullscreenRiver Plate’s Franco Mastantuono (left) has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid.Photograph: Luciano Gonzalez/EPAThomas Müller, Bayern Munich– the 35-year-old had already bid goodbye to his home fans, but the Club World Cup will be his last competition in a Bayern Munich shirt. The wily forward will want to go out on another high note, after helping Bayern to another Bundesliga title.Weston McKennie, Juventus– Playing in his home country for the first time in competitive club matches, there’s almost no telling what role McKennie will play for Juventus. The US international has played in just about every midfield spot and even occasionally at wingback in what was a disappointing season for Juve, which they’ll hope to put behind them with a solid showing.Estêvão, Palmeiras– The 18-year-old forward, like Mastantuono, is one of his country’s brightest young stars. He’s already earned four senior caps for Brazil and has 13 goals with 12 assists to his name in Brazil’s Serie A. He hasagreed to join Chelseain a transfer after the tournament, so this will be his last chance to make a mark before moving abroad.Who’s going to win?So much will depend on how seriously the clubs take the tournament, and which among them are the freshest after a long European season.PSGare a decent bet, given their demolition of Inter in the Champions League final and their collection of young talent that is willing to work.Real Madrid, of course, can never be counted out in a tournament setting, and Trent Alexander-Arnold will be looking to impress in his first actions for his new club.Manchester Cityclosed a disappointing Premier League season in great form.Is there a chance an outside contender, like Porto, or River Plate, Boca Juniors, or Flamengo could take it? Sure. But given the other sides involved, it’s hard to be all that confident.When are the games and where can I watch?Every game is streamed worldwide in multiple languages on Dazn. You can also follow along on the Guardian – we’ll be live-blogging select games throughout the tournament and have writers on the ground all the way until the final.In the United States, select games will be shown in English on TNT Sports and in Spanish on TUDN, Univision, or UniMas.In the UK, Channel 5 will show a selection of games, including 16 group-stage matches, four last-16 games, two quarter-finals, one semi-final, and the final.In Australia, every game is live on Foxtel and Kayo Sports.Group stageSaturday, 14 June8pm ET / 1am BST: Al Ahly v Inter Miami – Hard Rock Stadium,

Left-backRayan Aït-Nouri arrived from Wolves for £31mon Monday, while Marcus Bettinelli will replace the departing Scott Carson as third-choice goalkeeper after joining from Chelsea on Tuesday.“This is a dream for me,” said Cherki after completing his move. “To be joining a club like Manchester City and have the opportunity to make the next step in my career here is something very, very special.”“I have worked so hard for this all my life. I love this sport, and I can’t wait to develop further here in Manchester with Pep and his backroom staff,” he added. “I would only leave Lyon for a project I really believe in and everything at City suggests I can develop my game and help the team be successful in the future.”Viana said Cherki, who can play in the middle or as a winger on either flank, is “a player our scouts have watched for a long time. We have all been impressed with his skill and creativity. I am convinced our fans will be excited to see him play.”Cherki, who has spent his entire career to date with his home town club, posted a tribute to Lyon on Instagram after the transfer was confirmed. “Thousands of emotions, hundreds of memories and an indelible imprint on my heart,” he wrote. “I hope to continue making you proud and represent ‘Lyon DNA’ with dignity.”City are close to completing the signing ofthe Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijndersafter a €55m (£46.3m) fee was agreed last week.

And forAnge Postecoglou, who always bristled at the idea that his wealth of coaching experience had somehow been earned in inferior competitions, perhaps his departure from Tottenham really can be a kind of springboard: to one of these prestigious, equally demanding leagues he keeps talking about. Maybe the struggling Gamba Osaka. Perth Glory could well have a vacancy soon. Motherwell are still looking. A step down? That’s just your old-world, Eurocentric, Prem-brained snobbery showing right through there, mate.And so to Postecoglou’s many rhetorical elisions can be added another:the triumphant sacking. Perhaps it was only in this universe – the post-truth universe – that such a feat was even conceivable. Along with the Europa League trophyhe so stunningly spirited to north London, this may turn out to be the defining legacy of the Postecoglou interregnum. There have been better Premier League managers. There have been more charming and more entertaining Premier League managers. But there may never have been a manager better at defining his own terms of achievement; a managerial reign so evidently built upon a towering silo of nuclear-strength bullshit.Bilbao was a glorious blip for Spurs – and that’s why Levy had to sack Postecoglou | Jonathan WilsonRead moreFrom the very start, Angeball constructed its own bespoke logic as it went along. The journey matters more than the destination. There is a process, and we stick to it. There are principles, and however tough things get, you never deviate from or compromise on them. “Even if we go down to five men, we will have a go,” he said afterhis nine men were defeated by Chelseain November 2023. The idea of Champions League qualification as a goal in its own right, unaccompanied by broader progress: “meaningless”, as he put it in March 2024.In January 2024 he rejected the idea that a single trophy could ever constitute satisfaction or atone for mediocrity elsewhere (“You can’t just sit back and say: ‘I’ve just delivered a trophy, shouldn’t I have some latitude to not be successful?’”). In October 2024 he insisted that Tottenham’s league performance should be regarded as the “most meaningful” measure of his side’s progress.Ange Postecoglou 2023-24: meet Ange Postecoglou 2025. The coach who promised to attack in all circumstances, who disdained the transformative effect of a single trophy, has just won a trophy with the lowest possession recorded in a European final because sometimes – as he put it in Bilbao – “you have to change your approach”. A coach who urged us to judge him on the league now no longer judges himself on the league.A coach who blames Tottenham’s abject league performance on a freak injury crisis also takes no responsibility for that injury crisis, for a style of play in which Tottenham comfortably spend more time in high-intensity sprints than any other Premier League team. A coach who claims he takes no notice of what is said and written about him has spent a suspiciously high proportion of this season reacting to things that have been said and written about him.View image in fullscreenPostecoglou celebrates with the Europa League trophy after his team’s victory over Manchester United.Photograph: Alex Pantling/UEFA/Getty ImagesNone of this is a character judgment or smoking gun in its own right. Changing your mind when the facts change: this is, in fact, entirely normal and rational behaviour. Hypocrisy is what makes us human. Go back through everything I’ve written about Postecoglou over the last two years and I’m sure you’ll find it riddled with compromising contradictions. For what it’s worth, I think the decision to sack Postecoglou now is a big error on Daniel Levy’s part. At a time when Spurs are undergoing all shades of upheaval off the pitch, trying to bolster an underpowered squad, a managerial search and a vibe shift is the last thing they need.Beyond this there is an enduring fascination to Postecoglou, the animal magnetism of the true ideologue. He came to the Premier League with no great reputation or playing record behind him. Tactically, he offered little groundbreaking or novel beyond a hard-running, hard-chasing dogma in which the only solution to every problem is to believe harder in the dogma. The dogma will win your duels. It will head away set pieces for you. And if it doesn’t, it was ultimately your fault for not believing sufficiently in the dogma. In an important sense Postecoglou marked a continuation of the Mourinho-Conte axis: the latest in a series of coaches convinced that their own principles were stronger and worthier than those of the club, determined to prove to the world that Tottenham was terminally sick, yet they alone had the cure.All of a sudden, one February morning, the league is gone; survival secure. The new dogma is defending like hell against continental Europeans on a Thursday. In fact, scratch that: this was always the dogma. There was no old dogma. This was what you were trying to build all along. Of course this has always been Postecoglou’s real superpower: the cult of personality, the ability to render words convincingly true simply by emitting them from your mouth, to build castles and citadels of bullshit, an apparatus of demagoguery so potent and alluring that it supplants all previous logic.Which – and no moral judgements here – is quite interesting, right? A 57-year-old Australian bullshits his way into a Premier League job, to spectacular away wins at Manchester City and Manchester United, to some of the most entertaining football ever seen from a Tottenham team in my lifetime. He convinces players to run themselves past the point of wellness. He convinces them to stick together amid a frightening assemblage of centrifugal forces. He convinces a significant part of the English footballing public that league tables are a form of fraud. And finally to a European title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is talent, as surely as substitutions or being able to put on a small-sided coaching session is talent. And what it exposes – perhaps “indicates” is a better word – is how much of modern football is essentially an act of persuasion. Agents bullshit. So do analysts and marketers and journalists. An entire industry built on pure narrative skill, the ability to make things up on the fly and bring people with you. What matters is not what you say, but the conviction with which you believe it to be true at the time.View image in fullscreenPostecoglou is congratulated by Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, after the Europa League final.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesAnd so the Postecoglou who declared at Celtic that he was “exactly where I want to be” now seeks another fresh start. Perhaps a sideways move to another Premier League club, perhaps even a step up in class to the Greek Super League, the Korean K League, the League of Ireland. This part will not be a problem. Football has no shortage of soiled dreamers, clubs who missed the gold rush, fans whose only real desire is to feel something again. Marseille, Roma, Benfica, Schalke, West Ham. Leeds sacking Daniel Farke in November and going all in on Angeball feels like a perfect fit.There is of course an irony here. In his meticulously cultivated personal branding, Postecoglou often likes to paint himself as a throwback, an outsider, a counter-culturalist, the grizzled underdog. But in his reliance on patter and persuasion, bluster and bluff, he is in fact a very modern footballing phenomenon. This is Ange’s world now, and we’re all bullshitting in it.Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouSportblogTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

The Socceroos no longer have “one foot in the door”, nor have they “all but qualified”. After their 2-1 win overSaudi Arabiain Jeddah, it’s official: Australia will be at the 2026 World Cup in North America.Half a world away fromAustralia, the final whistle was mostly greeted by silence from those in the stands but nothing could contain the jubilation of the Socceroos. A campaign that began with a winless opening window against Bahrain and Indonesia has now ended with wins over Japan and Saudi Arabia and automatic qualification. Mission accomplished.World Cup qualifiers: Spalletti exits with flat Italy victory, Haaland gives Norway boostRead moreTaking a 19th-minute lead through Abdulrahman Al-Aboud, the hosts threatened to make it interesting for a while. Given they needed to secure a miraculous five-goal win to snatch the Socceroos’ automatic qualification slot, one goal shouldn’t have been enough to trigger panic. But, considering it came just moments after Martin Boyle blazed wide with a chance that could have killed things off, Australian football’s natural inclination for cynicism was bound to stir.But Connor Metcalfe’s first goal for his country on the stroke of half-time restored parity, as well as putting the hosts into a position where they now needed to win 6-1 to do the unthinkable. Then, after playing a magnificent pass to set up the opener, Mitch Duke soared to meet a Boyle free-kick three minutes into the second half to kill off any thoughts of a cataclysmic collapse. A match-winning goal and an assist for Duke was just reward for a devoted servant of the national team, who had only been given five hours’ notice of his call-up following Mathew Leckie’s injury in the A-League Men grand final. Maligned as he may be amongst fans who feel his time has passed, none can deny his role in this qualification.An 82nd-minute penalty gave Salem Al-Dawsari a chance to give the portion of the 24,620 attendees who hadn’t already filed out of the stadium something to cheer, but even that would be denied. Maty Ryan dived to his left to add a signature moment to his 100th cap and ensure qualification would be secured with a win.“We’ve qualified for the World Cup directly first time since Brazil 2014,” said Miloš Degenek, who has resumed a mainstay role in the backline under Popovic. “We’re avoiding all the nerves and the drama that we normally have in the last two World Cups.“It’s a credit to the squad. It’s a credit to the boss what he’s done since he’s taken over. The way he’s turned it around, he’s still undefeated. Look at this window, you beat Japan in Perth, and you come here to a hostile and very difficult environment and you win here. There’s not much more you can want.”A breathtaking game of football that will go down in the annals of Asian football this was not. But given the stakes involved and the final result, few of a green and gold persuasion will care. Arriving in Jeddah with their five-goal safety net, the Australians took the field at the King Abdullah Stadium looking to grind the game out, to make their opponents suffer for every step they took towards an improbable comeback.For a while, it looked like this approach was going to deliver results without much in the way of incident. Coach Tony Popovic and his staff have frequently spoken about being able to dictate the terms of games without the ball, and while the Green Falcons had over 80% of possession across the opening exchanges, this failed to produce an early attempt on Ryan’s goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And in the 19th minute, the host’s first shot, a close-range effort on an angle from Al-Dawsari, was deflected by Ryan into the path of Al-Aboud, who bundled the ball over the line for an opening goal that, after a lengthy VAR review, was allowed to stand. There still existed a four-goal cushion, but a crack in the Socceroos’ armour had now been exposed.Had the Saudis been able to go on and find a second at that point, to heap further pressure on the Australians and try to rally the supporters in the stands, then things may have got very interesting. A chance fell to Musab Al-Juwayr in the 33rd minute, the ball bouncing up invitingly for him after it was sent in from the left, only for his resulting effort to be blasted over the bar. From there, it was never in doubt.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersAustraliaSaudi ArabiaAustralia sportmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The supporter who went tumbling from the upper tier to the lower tier as he celebratedWalespulling level at 3-3 against Belgium on Monday, having trailed 3-0 after 27 minutes, was treated at hospital and got off lightly, the only lasting damage a minor broken bone in his back. “Sore this morning, mind,” 29-year-old Scott Rees posted on social media. Another supporter, in Block B of the King Baudouin Stadium, saw his wallet gain wings after Brennan Johnson’s headed equaliser.It was that kind of night in Brussels. It was a strange one, too, given it was hard for any of the 4,500 travelling supporters to be too downbeat despite ultimatelylosing the game 4-3, an unmarked Kevin De Bruyne bypassing Johnson to ghost in at the back post to snatch an 88th-minute winner. It was not a defeat without any ramifications – Wales are now second in Group J behind North Macedonia and Belgium will surely be favourites to qualify for the World Cup from here – but it was one where pride quickly trumped any disappointment. Stoke’s Sorba Thomas perhaps put it best. “They thought it was done,” said the winger. “We showed the Welsh fight, the Welsh fire.”Craig Bellamy hails Wales’s spirit after ‘crazy’ 4-3 defeat against BelgiumRead moreCraig Bellamy was uncomfortable with his first defeat since taking charge almost 12 months ago being painted as a brave loss. Still, he was delighted with the way his players responded to Jérémy Doku, whose quick feet troubled Wales throughout, making it 3-0. “I don’t like losing, I understand the game but how you lose is more important,” said the Wales manager. “Who are you as a person? Who is your team? I see that and I’m beyond proud. We’re a good team.”As Ben Davies, the Wales captain who recently extended his stay at Tottenham, led his teammates towards the away end after the final whistle, Bellamy was engrossed in conversation with Romelu Lukaku, having enjoyed a word with De Bruyne and Doku. Bellamy did not divulge the details but said those conversations included Belgium’s big-hitters acknowledging Wales’s endearing approach when many would have considered it an exercise in damage limitation.This time last year Wales were fresh off a4-0 pasting by Slovakiawhich ultimately cost Bellamy’spredecessor and former teammate, Rob Page, his job. That was three days after an experimental side laboured to a 0-0 draw against Gibraltar, then 203rd in the Fifa rankings. It is impossible not to recognise the strides Wales have taken under Bellamy. Asked whether they were ahead of schedule on the eve of the Belgium game, the 45-year-old was keen to downplay the turnaround before eventually caving in. “[With] the speed of progress, yeah. I was trying to not but, of course,” he said.Bellamy does not indulge in managerial cliche – just listen to his existential life advice on the eve of the game – and nor does he have time for buzzwords. He cuts to the chase. His record is now one slender, late defeat across 10 matches. “I just think it shows, all the time we’re always asking for time, asking to be patient, it’s a process, blah, blah, blah,” he said. “Get to work. That’s it. Players are cleverer than you think. Players are good footballers. Let them be good footballers. Give them the tools. Work. Run. Press. React. Lose it, get it back.”View image in fullscreenCraig Bellamy applauds the Wales fans after the game. ‘I don’t like losing … but how you lose is more important,’ he said afterwards.Photograph: Rene Nijhuis/MB Media/Getty ImagesThe manager highlighted how both teams gained momentum from the opposition failing to absorb the setback of conceding penalties, both of which were questionable, the first against Johnson for handball and the second against Matz Sels, for colliding with Chris Mepham. Defeat in Belgium will not sit heavy on Bellamy nor his players and they will aim to build on the wave of momentum generated by a promising start to qualifying.“This is like a one-off opportunity for me, I’m only going to be the Wales manager for a short period and it’s an honour,” Bellamy said. “This was the one I always wanted to do so I’m going to enjoy every second. I read something in the Belgium media … ‘Easy way to the USA?’ There’s a lot of life in this group and I saw a lot of life in this team. We ain’t going anywhere. I will have a couple of weeks now of recharging. I’m beyond proud and just really excited about the future.”Explore more on these topicsWalesCraig BellamyWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The former Bournemouth player had just become the most expensive defender in Real Madrid’s history for £50m, but while the 20-year-old talked about “living a dream” on the day he was presented at their Valdebebas training ground, the price didn’t seem to bother him much. Not least because nothing did. “I’m quite calm,” he said. “I am me and I am going to live my life and I do what I like most.“Madrid is the club of my life, I think,” Huijsen had said when he stepped on to the stage in the basketball arena, tapped the mic and asked: “Can you hear me?” He is the son of Dutch footballer Donny, who was sitting in the front row with Huijsen’s mother Mascha ­Wijsmuller. The ­family moved to southern Spain when Dean was five and as a boy he was mad about Málaga, although he said here that Sergio Ramos was his idol.Jobe Bellingham to play at Club World Cup after completing Dortmund moveRead moreHuijsen admitted his initial plan had been to stay at Bournemouth for another season but everything accele­rated, above all his development. A full Spain debut came in March against the Netherlands, at which he was booed by the home fans after choosing to represent Spain, and Madrid’s rebuild under Xabi Alonso brought interest from the Bernabéu to go with the offers from clubs across England and beyond.“A lot was said but I just concentra­ted on my football, giving everything at Bournemouth and trying to finish the season in the right way,” Huijsen said. “I wanted to be here from the first day; once Real Madrid called I didn’t have eyes for any other teams. For me, Real Madrid is the best club in the world and there is no other club when they appear.“I think my first nice memory of Real Madrid wasthe [Champions League] final in 2014in which Sergio Ramos scored in the last minute of added time. I would have been nine. Ramos sent me a message when [the transfer] was official. He’s my biggest idol, the best centre-back in history. I wouldn’t say there is one thing about him [to single out], but all the things he had: he was the most complete centre-back too.”When the final bid came,Madrid matched Bournemouth’s £50m buyout clause, albeit they will pay the almost €60m fee in three instalments. “I don’t think about that,” ­Huijsen said. When he had been asked about it during the recent international break, he had been even more matter‑of‑fact: “It’s the clause I had,” he told AS, “and if it hadn’t been that maybe they would have asked for more.”View image in fullscreenDean Huijsen: ‘I fit very well the football that Xabi [Alonso] wants to play.’Photograph: Antonio Villalba/Real Madrid/Getty ImagesAs for the pressure, when asked about that here, Huijsen replied: “Well you’ve seen me play: I’m quite calm.

Milan’s £21m valuation of Maignan was deemed too high for a player with one year left on his contract. Chelsea were not actively pursuing a new goalkeeper before being offered the chance to sign the 29-year-old. They proposed a fee of £12.7m for the France No 1 and have not ruled out reopening negotiations with Milan later this summer, reasoning that the Serie A club risk losing Maignan on a free next year.There is a bigger prospect of Chelsea revisiting a deal for Gittens when the window reopens on 16 June. They are keen to bring in a right-footed left winger after Jadon Sancho’s return to Manchester United and have already agreed terms on a seven-year deal with Gittens. The 20-year-old has been named in the Dortmund squad for the Club World Cup but he wants to join Chelsea and could yet feature for them in the knockout stages, provided the England Under-21 international does not play for the German club in the group phase.Chelsea, who fly to the US on Friday and begin their campaign by facing the Major League ­Soccer side Los Angeles FC in Atlanta on ­Monday, are relaxed about the situa­tion. They believe their squad is already good enough to reach the last 16 and beyond.View image in fullscreenJamie Gittens has already agreed a seven-year contract with Chelsea.Photograph: Lukas Schulze/Bundesliga/Bundesliga Collection/Getty ImagesThe long-term priority is to ensure they have the right signings in place at the start of next season. The promise of huge prize money for the winners of the Club World Cup was admittedly an incentive for entrants to make signings before the registration cut-off.Enzo Maresca will still be able to field Liam Delap in the US after the striker’s £30m move from Ipswich. Chelsea travel to Philadelphia to play Flamengo and ES Tunis after meeting LAFC.The move for Maignan was an opportunistic one. Maresca likes the former Lille goalkeeper, who has told Milan that he wants to leave, but the head coach has not pushed Chelsea into doing anything. The club saw a chance to sign a player of Maignan’s class and experience for a reduced fee as worth exploring but did not want to be pressured into overpaying.Chelsea remain happy with their quartet of goalkeepers: Robert Sánchez, Filip Jörgensen, Djordje Petrovic and Mike Penders. Sánchez excelled at the end of last season, recovering from a dip in form to help Maresca’s side qualify for the Champions League. There is huge excitement about Penders following the highly rated 19-year-old’s arrival from Genk. Marcus Bettinelli, Chelsea’s previous No 3, has joined Manchester City and Kepa Arrizabalaga is poised to join Arsenal for £5m.Explore more on these topicsChelseaMilanTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Sienna Toohey left seasoned campaigners including Kaylee McKeown in awe with a stunning swim at Australia’s selection trials in Adelaide on Tuesday night.The Albury teenager, who only started swimming because she wanted to play water polo, triumphed in the women’s 100m breaststroke. Toohey’s victory, in a personal best time of 1:06.55, secured her berth at the world titles in Singapore from 27 July to 3 August.Australia’s Olympic swimmers reveal struggles after life in Paris Games fish-bowlRead more“All of these people being my idols, now I get to be on the team with them,” Toohey said. “These are people that I was watching two years ago, saying I want to be like them.”The daughter of the relieving principal at Albury High School, Toohey initially wanted to be a water polo player.“My parents told me that I couldn’t do water polo if I didn’t swim, so I started swimming,” she said. “And then my water polo progressed and my swimming was too at the same time.“I got to the point where I had to choose swimming or water polo. Obviously, I chose swimming – it was the right choice.”Five-time Olympic gold medallist McKeown was among those impressed with Toohey’s feat at the South Australian Aquatic Centre.“I was 16 when I made my first team and it really taught me a lot being with the older guys,” McKeown said after winning the 100m backstroke final on Tuesday night. “I’m excited to see young swimmers coming through the ranks.“The more experience that they can get leading into LA [the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics], we have a really good chance of doing Australia proud.”McKeown, who has told of the mental toll during her decorated career, offered some advice to the precocious Toohey.“Just to enjoy yourself,” McKeown said. “The more you be serious, the more you’re harsh on yourself, you keep just digging yourself in a bit of a hole and it’s quite hard to get out of.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jude Bellingham had a goal controversially disallowed at 2-1 but, after the laboured winagainst Andorra in World Cup qualifyingon Saturday, there was no disguising the paucity of England’s latest ­performance under their ­German coach. England were booed off for the second game in succession.Cheikh Sabaly’s clincher condemns England to sobering defeat by SenegalRead moreTheEnglandhead coach, however, insisted improvement would come and it was premature to worry about the World Cup one year in advance. “We lost a test match so there is no need to panic,” said Tuchel.“We have three qualification games, we have nine points, we have not conceded and we will be competitive in September and we will go for two more victories, 100%. We know more now, we are smarter. It is tough at the moment. I am the first one to dislike and hate losses but we don’t go next week, we go in one year and I think by nature it will get more competitive in the nomination process and in the demands for ­players to be nominated and to be with us in ­September, October, November because we are in a World Cup season.”Tuchel defended his decision to leave Ivan Toney on the bench until the 88th minute, explaining the striker was at his best inside the box and England were not close enough to it when he brought on Morgan Rogers instead. But he conceded the defeat, plus two poor performances, would leave a bad feeling throughout the summer.Tuchel said: “Now we go into a long break with a bad feeling and a loss which is simply not nice and not what we wanted. I will never be glad for a loss. I’m glad for a tough test and challenges. We wanted to feel the quality of a top-20 team and we felt their quality. We felt what it means to them. I heard them in the dressing room before the match, I heard them in the dressing room after the match so I know how much it means to them to play against us. How much joy they expressed if they make this happen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fos and Mark Williams, Hayden Bunton Sr and Jr and umpires Jack McMurray Sr and Jr are the father-son inductees.Pearce and Phillips ended their stellar playing careers at the end of 2022. The five-year player eligibility rule for the hall of fame was changed for women last year. AFLW players can now be inducted within a year of retirement.They were the two obvious players who would benefit first from the rule change.In her speech, Phillips also thanked the “incredible women” who made the AFLW possible and singled out Lee.“You kicked down this door so others could walk through,” she said. “I’m so proud to be by your side and I can’t wait to kick down more doors with you Deb.”Pearce’s last AFLW game was the Melbourne 2022 grand final victory and she called it the best day of her life, even though her twin children Sylvie and Roy were in the room, hamming it up for the TV cameras.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFrom the Pocket: AFL WeeklyFree weekly newsletterJonathan Horn brings expert analysis on the week's biggest AFL storiesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She then switched to Port Adelaide when they joined the league in 2022.When the women’s league started in 2017, marquee players such as Pearce and Phillips were crucial for its profile and credibility.

He was never goalless in a game and coached the Roosters to two premierships.Riewolt went agonisingly close to a premiership, playing in St Kilda’s draw and two losses across 2009-10.

His side piled up 248 for three, their highest total at home in this format, to set up a 37-run victory over West Indies in the third and final Twenty20 international.Ben Duckett top-scored with 84 off 46 balls as he shared a rollicking opening stand of 120 with Jamie Smith, 135 brought up at the 10-over mark. The destruction calmed down a touch thereafter but West Indies were still invited to pull off their highest successful T20 chase. It never felt on even as Evin Lewis whipped away a first-ball six. Rovman Powell provided respectability with 79 not out off 45, but the reply demanded something gargantuan. The visitors depart without a victory across six white-ball matches.England beat West Indies by 37 runs in third ODI to complete series sweep – live reactionRead moreWest Indies’ pain on this tour has not been restricted to the losing streak, Monday bringing the news of Nicholas Pooran’s retirement from international cricket. Their former white-ball captain missed this tour to rest after playing in the Indian Premier League where he was typically rapid, striking at close to 200, handy prep before next year’s subcontinental T20 World Cup. But at the age of 29 he now belongs to the franchise world, sad to those who still care for the old ways.“I was hoping that it didn’t happen, but in my mind I was already planning that we may have a T20 team without Pooran,” said Daren Sammy, the West Indies head coach. “I’m pretty sure more will follow in that direction. That’s the way T20 cricket is now, especially coming from the West Indies, the challenges we face trying to keep our players motivated to play for the crest.”The evening began with an exhibition by a promising opening partnership. Like Zak Crawley, Smith suits Duckett; the tall right-hander lets the bat flow straight, the shorter southpaw dances around the crease and plots various routes. Duckett reached his half-century off 20 balls, ramping, reversing and greeting Alzarri Joseph with a rocket pull for six.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook and his England teammates with the trophy after completing a T20 series sweep to go with their ODI success.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PASmith began the T20 series as a fill-in for Phil Salt on paternity leave but is demanding all-format recognition. He crushed sixes off Romario Shepherd, including a front-foot launch over extra cover. Smith was dropped next ball, Shimron Hetmyer possibly taken aback by the power of the drive, Shepherd the victim again. The Test keeper finished with a 26-ball 60, finally lacking in strength when he found Hetmyer at deep midwicket off Gudakesh Motie. The in-form Jos Buttler provided an adventurous 10- ball 22, including a no-look ramp off Joseph for four.Sherfane Rutherford was an unlikely saviour for West Indies, his medium pace and wide lines forcing Buttler to miscue, and Duckett slowed down before he was yorked by Akeal Hosein. But a decent over for the visitors never turned into a quiet passage; Motie was on the end of three consecutive Jacob Bethell sixes, 200 brought up in the 17th over. The start of the 18th brought further misery in the field as Rutherford hobbled off clutching his hamstring; it ended with Bethell reverse-flicking a Jason Holder yorker along the turf for four, no line or length safe, the dot ball taking on endangered status.Brook found some discomfort with Joseph’s short ball but he eventually nailed a fine hook for six. Bethell’s final summary was 36 not out from 16, two days on froma match-turning 10-ball 26.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johnson Charles took up 11 balls for nine before whipping Luke Wood to square leg with his 12th. Liam Dawson, Adil Rashid and Bethell all struck in their first overs, forcing catches in the deep, the required rate beyond 15 halfway through the West Indies innings.Shai Hope enjoyed the extra pace of Brydon Carse, nailing consecutive reverse-scoops off the quick. But the touring captain roared in frustration in the same over, an edge popping up for a simple Buttler grab, the knock done for 45. Powell found fine rhythm by the close, taking 15 off a Carse over with some of the most powerful strokes of the evening, but the tension had long gone.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Her Spanish opponent, Cristina Bucșa, is among the more streetwise players in the WTA Tour mid-ranks. But she had no answers as Raducanu raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory in just over an hour.‘Boultercanu’ serve doubles delight as women’s tennis returns to Queen’s ClubRead more“I was quite locked in today, so I’m very pleased with my performance,” Raducanu said, before admitting that trying to be happy on court was part of a broader strategy to help her play better.“Going on to the court ­laughing at certain shots, or if I’m smiling if I have pulled off a great shot, it does help relax you,” she said.“I play my best when my per­sonality is put on the court and I can express myself, and I feel like sometimes when I’ve been constrained to play a certain way, it hasn’t necessarily worked. I just need to be free and expressive, and then certain moments of creativity can come up.”Tougher tests lie ahead, starting on Thursday with the world No 41, Rebecca Sramkova, in the last 16. But for a player who confessed to having “pretty low expectations” just two days ago, there is plenty in Raducanu’s game that appears to be trending in the right direction.The first serve was crisp; the movement sharp. There were few signs of a back spasm that interrupted her preparations last week, even if ­Raducanu said afterwards that she was still managing the problem. “It was one of those days that you feel really good on the court. Sometimes you don’t necessarily feel like that, but when you do have that feeling, you need to capitalise.”And she did. After the players traded early service holds, ­Raducanu broke to lead 3-1 with a deft backhand volley after dragging her opponent across the court before racing through the first set in 25 minutes. While Bucșa put up slightly more resistance in the second, a sharp cross-court backhand put a bow on a very impressive performance.“I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t ­nervous before the match,” ­Raducanu said. “The way I overcame that was a great achievement. I also moved really well, considering I haven’t neces­sarily had much time on the grass.“But I think the biggest thing was that I started the point really well today: serve and return. It was very clean and clinical. I wasn’t giving away too many free points, and also got quite a few good setups and good points from my serve.”This year Raducanu had endured a shock defeat against Bucșa in the first round of the Singapore Open. But from early on at Queen’s Club there was only going to be one winner.“When I saw her name in the draw, knowing that it was going to be a difficult match really focused me,” ­Raducanu said. “With her defence and her slices, it can stay low and shoot on this surface. But I was very, very sharp. I wanted to get every point and score as many as I could, because I lost to her earlier in the year, and I know how tricky she can be.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Álvarez, the undisputed super middleweight champion who’s held titles between 154lb and 175lb, will defend his crown against Crawford, the unbeaten four-weight titleholder from 135lb through 154lb. Crawford will move up two weight classes to challenge the Mexican superstar in what has already been billed as the “fight of the century”.The venue has yet to be finalized, though Allegiant Stadium, the 71,835-seat home of the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders, is understood to be the top choice. The date conflicts with a scheduled UNLV college football game against Idaho State, but sources familiar with discussions say talks are under way to move the UNLV game to a different site or reschedule it entirely. T-Mobile Arena, where Álvarez headlined some of his biggest nights and where Crawfordblew out Errol Spence Jrin a welterweight title unification bout in 2023, remains a fallback option.View image in fullscreenThe long-rumored showdown between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford will take place on 13 September in Las Vegas.Composite: NetflixThe bout will be promoted by Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh Season in collaboration with Ultimate Fighting Championship president andDonald Trump confidantDana White and the Saudi entertainment company Sela. It marks White’s first foray into boxing and signals a further deepening of the kingdom’s influence over the sport’s biggest nights.“On 13 September, Canelo and Crawford, two legends of boxing, will finally compete against each other in the fight of the century,” saidTurki al-Sheikh, chairman of the General Entertainment Authority and president of the Saudi Boxing Federation. “Alongside Dana White and Sela, we will deliver something truly incredible in Las Vegas for fans around the world to enjoy through Netflix.”Crawford, 41-0 with 31 knockouts, has already become the first male fighter to claim undisputed championships in two weight classes in the four-belt era, doing so at 140lb and 147lb. In his last outing in August, the Omaha nativedefeated Israil Madrimovto capture the WBA junior middleweight title, making Tuesday’s confirmation all the more remarkable: he will now jump directly to 168lbs to face Álvarez without a tune-up.“My perfect record speaks for itself,” Crawford said. “I am the best fighter in the world and no matter the opponent or weight class, I have always come out on top. On 13 September, my hand will be raised once again as the world watches greatness.”Álvarez, 62-2-2 with 39 knockouts, is coming off a dominant yet pedestrianunanimous decision over William Scullin May, a fight staged in Riyadh as part of his reported $400m four-fight deal with Riyadh Season. That agreement allowed for one bout to be staged outside Saudi Arabia, and Álvarez has opted to return to Las Vegas, where his fanbase traditionally turns out in droves.“I’m super happy to be making history again and this time on a Riyadh Season card that will be broadcast on Netflix,” said Álvarez, who has won six straight since a surprise defeat in adoomed challenge for Dmitry Bivol’s light heavyweight titlein 2022. “On 13 September, I’m ready to show once again that I am the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world.”Crawford attended the Scull fight, where September’s bout was publicly teased in the ring. Despite questions over their ages – Álvarez turns 35 next month, Crawford will be 38 in September – each remains among their sport’s elite talents.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford, left, soundly beat Errol Spence Jr in 2023 to become the first male fighter to claim undisputed championships in two weight classes in the four-belt era.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesThe announcement represents a potentially transformative moment for boxing’s broadcast future. Rather than being offered via traditional pay-per-view, the event will stream to Netflix’s 300m subscribers at no additional cost, echoing the kind of mass accessibility the sport once enjoyed in its network television heyday. Executives are hoping it becomes a landmark moment akin to the Mike Tyson–Jake Paul spectacle Netflix carried in November, which precededthe streamer’s record-smashing broadcastof the NFL’s Christmas Day twin bill and Beyoncé Bowl half-time show. For fans long frustrated by the fragmentation and paywalling of boxing’s top events, the move could mark a new chapter in accessibility.“Turki wants to make the biggest fights that the fans want to see in boxing, and this is right up my alley,” said White, who is launching his own boxing imprint under the UFC’s TKO umbrella. “Are you kidding me that the first boxing fight I’m going to get to promote is Canelo v Crawford? It’s literally a once-in-a-lifetime fight.”A three-city press tour has been planned for later this month to drum up interest in an event that’s certain to attract broad public attention. The fighters will be in Riyadh on 20 June, then travel to New York on 22 June before wrapping up in Las Vegas on 27 June.While both fighters have shown flashes of mortality in recent performances – Álvarez cruised but looked flat in his win over Scull, while Crawford had to rally late to edge Madrimov – the significance of their matchup remains undiminished. A win for Álvarez would further cement his legacy as the face of this boxing era. A victory for Crawford would arguably establish him as the most versatile boxer in recent history.The dream matchup has drawn comparisons to the 1987 superfight between Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler, when Leonard emerged from a three-year retirement to outpoint the fearsome middleweight champion in a tightly contested split decision at Caesars Palace. Like Leonard, Crawford is the smaller, faster fighter taking a calculated risk against a dominant champion in a higher weight class – and, like that fabled night in Las Vegas, the outcome could reshape pound-for-pound conversations for years to come.Explore more on these topicsBoxingCanelo ÁlvarezTerence CrawfordTurki al-SheikhNetflixUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Cousins then appeared to lunge at the man before teammates stepped in.Officials ejected Cousins, but the situation worsened as he left the court. Fans booed and threw drinks and food as Cousins shouted back and flipped his middle finger at the crowd.#BSNPR| [VÍDEO]: Así fue que comenzó la situación de Demarcus Cousins cuando un fanático comenzó a tener una discusión con el jugador desde las gradas.🎥@ElPodcastPPPpic.twitter.com/DkmnvJW4Ux— La Guerra del BSN (@LaGuerraBSN)June 10, 2025At one point, Cousins lunged toward the stands and had to be physically restrained by teammates and security. The moment drew instant comparisons to the infamousMalice at the Palaceincident in 2004, though no further violence occurred.Security eventually escorted Cousins to the locker room, soaked in beer and visibly agitated.No formal discipline had been announced as of Tuesday. BSN officials are reviewing the incident.Cousins returned to Guaynabo this season after playing in Taiwan and Mongolia. He first joined the Mets in 2023.Drafted fifth overall in 2010, Cousins was a dominant NBA big man for much of the 2010s. He averaged 19.6 points and 10.2 rebounds over 11 seasons and made four straight All-Star teams.Injuries, including a torn achilles and ACL, derailed his career. His last NBA appearances came in the 2021–22 season with Denver and Milwaukee.Since then, Cousins has continued playing internationally. His return to the BSN this year was seen as a chance to revive his profile.That opportunity may now be in jeopardy. The Mets have not commented on whether Cousins will face further punishment or remain with the team. BSN president Ricardo Dalmau is expected to address the matter this week.Explore more on these topicsBasketballUS sportsPuerto RicoShareReuse this content"

Very few are talking about the tournament and, it appears, only true diehards will make the trip to the USA for the month-long end-of-season endurance test.Fifa slashed the prices of match tickets after poor uptake from fans and the UK broadcaster showing the tournamentwill be Channel 5, the home of World Seniors Snooker. Meanwhile, many, if indeed not most, players taking part are not overly enamoured by the prospect of losing five weeks of time off to recover from another gruelling campaign.“Fifa can forget it, footballers and clubs will not participate in that tournament,” Carlo Ancelotti, the former Real Madrid head coach, said last year before backtracking on those comments. Money clearly talks and the prospect of securing a winning prize of £97m makes it an enticing prospect for those invited to take part.David Squires on … Infantino’s Club World Cup buildup in the land of TrumpRead moreDespite the damp buildup, some UK-based fans of City andChelseawill be travelling across the Atlantic in order to see their team play. Many of the hardcore are, however, staying away. Anyone wanting to attend has to consider expenditure on flights, hotels, food and match tickets, none of which come cheap. And anyone wanting to see each of their team’s matcheswould need to be in the US for a minimum of 10 days.“There’s a lot of apathy about it among fans,” says Paul Seery who is travelling to theClub World Cupto watch City and will also take in Boca Juniors v Auckland City in order to fulfil a lifelong ambition of seeing the Argentinian club in the flesh. “If you go on [City fans’ forum] Blue Moon and look at the thread, there’s some that are dead against it saying: ‘I’m not watching it.’ But I’m sure if we get to the final, they’ll be standing in front of the telly. I am 65 this year and it’s my last chance to do something like this.”The teams that reach the Club World Cup final on 13 July, a little more than a month before the start of the Premier League season, will contest seven matches in the US. City, for example, will play group matches against Wydad Casablanca, Al Ain and Juventus in Philadelphia, Atlanta and Orlando respectively before potentially heading for knockout ties in Miami and New York, requiring more than 2,000 miles to be covered. Meanwhile, the most affordable tickets for the final are currently retailing at $611 while the very best seats are going for $4,348. Fifa originally wanted to charge $890 for the cheapest final ticket but relented.View image in fullscreenWorkers install the playing surface at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta – Chelsea will open their campaign there against LAFC.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA“I think Fifa shot themselves in the foot because the prices were so ridiculously high,” says Chelsea supporter Chris Rayburn, who will be travelling to the US to watch the Uefa Conference League winners and expects the trip to cost him up to £6,000. “To be sure of getting a ticket, you had to pay up front. Initially if you wanted to do the whole tournament you would have had to fork out £1,600 to buy your tickets. I think we would have brought a lot more supporters had the tickets been reasonably priced. I think my tickets probably came to between £800 and £900 in total for seven games.”Olivier Giroud’s LAFC, Flamengo and ES Tunis stand between Chelsea and the knockout stages, and the prospect of facing Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or Paris Saint-Germain in a competitive game make it an intriguing tournament for those supporters willing to do the miles. There is also the prospect of some great sightseeing in between travelling between cities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So yes, I’d be a bit gutted if you ended up winning a Club World Cup competition and not being there.”For all the flaws and criticism of the Club World Cup, its expanded version is innovative. “No one was interested in the first World Cup but nearly 100 years on, everybody remembers who won the first World Cup and where it was. I’m hoping the Club World Cup’s going to be exactly the same,” says Seery, who is take two weeks of unpaid leave in order to fulfil his trip. “I’m sure it will.”It is becoming increasingly expensive for supporters to follow their teams and sometimes it goes against common sense to do so.

He fell to his knees and began weeping.”The emotion was understandable: McIlroy’s victory at The Open in 2014 left him needing only the Masters to complete his career grand slam. But Augusta gave him fits for years, leaving many wondering if he would ever win that elusive fourth major.Count Gay among those happy that McIlroy pulled it off – even if it refutes the epilogue to his new book, Rory Land: The Up-and-Down World of Golf’s Global Icon,published by Regalo Press.With a little boldness and a lot of luck, McIlroy banishes ghosts of 2011 | Andy BullRead moreIn the final chapter predicted that it was “going to be tough for him with the Masters … It would be Rory’s Great White Whale.” The author has a penchant for literary references. (Based in Virginia, he has four previous, acclaimed books to his credit, with subjects including baseball history and news correspondents during the second world war.) He describes his latest book as irreverent toward McIlroy but reverent toward his family and Northern Irish heritage and history. Its title suggests that McIlroy exists in a unique world all his own. Existing somewhere between Northern Ireland, the UK and the US, Rory Land spans the globe, in the person of the golfer and his faithful family and friends – a concept inspired by a 19th-century short story Gay read decades ago in school,The Man Without a Countryby Edward Everett Hale.Gay said that McIlroy and his team declined to speak with him for the book, but added that after sharing a copy, he received a positive response from a McIlroy representative.After McIlroy’s triumph at Augusta, Gay had to rewrite the epilogue.“It’s wonderful that Rory kind of proved his critics wrong,” Gay says. “He won the Masters, won the career grand slam … I was never, never so happy to be so wrong in my life.”In the last few weeks, the author has been thinking about McIlroy’s chances in this upcoming US Open – andthe brouhaha over the player’s driver. During the PGA Championship, news leaked that McIlroy’s driver was deemed noncomforming. He subsequently opted not to play in the Memorial Tournament run by Jack Nicklaus. Gay calls the driver controversy “much ado about nothing” but adds that McIlroy didn’t help matters by refusing to speak with the media until 4 June, missing a chance to add his own perspective.“We did not learn till Sunday morning, the last day of the PGA [Championship], that at least nine, 10, maybe more of the other guys’ drivers were found to be nonconforming,” Gay says, listing Scottie Scheffler as one of them. It’s a situation in which Gay criticizes the USGA and the PGA of America – and McIlroy: “He owed his fans and the golf community an explanation as to what happened.”The ups and downs mentioned in the book’s subtitle include numerous experiences from McIlroy’s career. There was the scintillating course-record 61he shot as a 16-year-old at Royal Portrush in 2005… andhis returnto the course in 2019, when he disappointed the home crowd by missing the cut in the first Open at the course, and Northern Ireland, in more than a half century.“Not even Scottie Scheffler can play golf with the kind of panache Rory plays it with,” Gay says. “I compare Rory’s golf game to Roger Federer’s tennis game. Not only is it gorgeous to watch, but he plays with a kind of almost poetic sensibility … I never get tired watchingRory McIlroyplay golf, even when he plays poorly.”The book also addresses controversies on and off the greens – including McIlroy’s extensive criticism of the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Tour, before PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan decided on a detente. The narrative discusses McIlroy’s three-year romance with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki during the previous decade: McIlroy ended the relationship with a statement to the press. Additionally, there’s discussion of McIlroy’s professional breakups with his longtime caddie JP Fitzgerald and with his first two agents. Gay says that McIlroy’s first agent, Chubby Chandler, brokered corporate ambassadorships that set up his then-teenage client for financial success, and that while McIlroy’s split with his second agent, Horizon Sports Management, cost him millions of dollars, the golfer is poised for a lucrative future, including through participation in an investment fund and the indoor golf league TGL.Yet the book goes beyond golf greens and tabloid headlines. Gay journeyed to Northern Ireland, where he charted the sacrifices McIlroy’s parents, Gerry and Rosie, made for their prodigy, working multiple jobs to maximise their son’s opportunities. Gay also documented the impact of the Troubles on McIlroy’s Catholic family – including his great-uncle Joseph McIlroy, a self-taught computer engineer,who was killed in Belfast in the early 1970s.“Joseph McIlroy was murdered not only because he lived in a Protestant neighborhood,” Gay says, “but because … certain Protestant extremists believed, his success came at the expense of Protestants. He would have paid for this with his life.”Gay also met with a man who helped mediate an eventual path toward reconciliation in Northern Ireland: Former US senator George Mitchell, the broker of the Good Friday Accords, who has a namesake peace institute at Queen’s University Belfast.As Gay notes, McIlroy “won the world 10-and-under championships in spring 1998, just when the Good Friday agreements were being consummated. He becomes, in many ways, a symbol of the new Northern Ireland – one of the forces that are going to bring Catholics and Protestants, North and South, together. George Mitchell certainly recognizes that.”Mitchell and his son Andrew now tune in to watch McIlroy on TV. The book notes qualities that make McIlroy appealing to fans of all ages, such as kindness and diplomacy. (Gay draws comparisons with a few fictional nice guys: Opie Taylor and Ted Lasso.) McIlroy is great with kids, the author notes, recalling interviews with youngsters at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut about why they love the golfer; meanwhile, his Catholic roots in a Unionist town instilled diplomacy in his dealings with the press and public.Then, as the book describes, there’s his incomparable gifts on the greens – and the seemingly inexplicable occasions when his epic long drives are doomed by the subsequent short game.“His short game in the clutch leaves something to be desired,” Gay says, although he adds that after seven years of hard work with putting coach Brad Faxon, “It’s getting better. He’s playing, right now, much more consistently. His stroke looks better, feels more natural.”Now, this week’s US Open awaits.“If Rory can find a driver he likes, he’s got a very good chance to contend,” Gay says. “The greens at Oakmont are … as fast as any in the country. Rory, for the most part, has putted fast greens very well of late … There’s no reason to believe he will not be equally good at Oakmont.”Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Uber rolled out its first driverless taxis with the US firm Waymo in Austin, Texas, in March, where Tesla is planning to launch a rival autonomous service this month.The Department for Transport (DfT) said the technology would make UK roads safer and that it could create 38,000 jobs and an industry worth £42bn by 2035.The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “The future of transport is arriving.Self-driving carscould bring jobs, investment, and the opportunity for the UK to be among the world leaders in new technology.”The DfT said self-driving vehicles could improve transport for millions of people, adding new public transport options in rural areas and improving accessibility for those unable to drive.Trials of self-driving vehicles have beentaking place in the UKfor more than a decade, using technology from Wayve and fellow British company Oxa (formerly Oxbotica). However, so far allroad tests of cars or buseshave needed a safety driver in the vehicleready to take overthe controls.The Automated Vehicles Act will require self-driving cars to be approved after tests to demonstrate “a level of safety at least as high as competent and careful human drivers”, the department said.Previouspledges to bring robotaxis to London, including a 2018 deal between Oxbotica and Addison Lee, did not come to fruition. The first driverless bus service, launched in Edinburgh in 2023, stopped operatingfor lack of passengers.Autonomous taxi services have, however, operated hundreds of thousands of paid trips in the US. It has not been all plain sailing. General Motorsabandoned its plans for an autonomous serviceafter a number of incidents, including one where a taxi dragged and severely injured a pedestrian. But early reports suggest self-driving taxis are safer and some customers, especially women, prefer hiring a driverless taxi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour’s transport spokesperson in the London assembly, Elly Baker, said it was cause for concern. “Although jobs might be created building and managing driverless cars, existing taxi and private hire drivers shouldn’t risk being left behind,” she said.Black-cab drivers, who have long been threatened by the rise of Uber, appeared unruffled. The general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, Steve McNamara, said: “They are living in fantasy land. We’re probably going to have flying taxis before we have autonomous ones in London.“Most people haven’t got a robot hoover or a robot lawnmower even though they are absolutely fantastic. Are people who don’t trust a robot to cut their grass or clean their house going to trust one to take their kids to school or drive their elderly mum around?”McNamara said autonomous taxis were struggling even in San Francisco’s grid layout. “I’m genuinely not worried. Come back to me in 2040,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSelf-driving carsUberLondonAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Is it too late to change course?Laura BatesTue 10 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 06.47 EDTShareEverybody knows that young women are not safe. They are not safe in the street, where 86% of those aged 18 to 24 haveexperienced sexual harassment. They are not safe at school, where 79% of young peopletold Ofstedthat sexual assault was common in their friendship groupsand almosta third of 16- to 18-year-old girlsreport experiencing “unwanted sexual touching”. They are not safe inswimming poolsor parks, or atthe beach. They are not even safe online, with the children’s safety charity theNSPCC reportingthat social media sites are “failing to protect girls from harm at every stage”.This will come as no surprise to any woman who has ever used social media. But it is particularly relevant as Meta, the operator of some of the biggest social platforms on the internet, is busily engaged in constructing awhole new world. The company is pumping billions of dollars a year into building its metaverse, a virtual world that it hopes will become the future not just of socialising, but of education, business, shopping and live events. This raises a simple question: if Meta has utterly failed to keep women and girls safe in its existing online spaces, why should we trust it with the future?Mark Zuckerberg has grandly promised: “In the metaverse, you’ll be able to do almost anything you can imagine.”It’s the sort of promise that might sound intensely appealing to some men and terrifying to most women.Indeed, the deeply immersive nature of the metaverse will make the harassment and abuse so many of us endure daily in text-based form on social media feel 100 times more real and will simultaneously make moderation 100 times more difficult. The result is a perfect storm. And I am speaking from experience, not idly speculating: I spent days in the metaverse researching my book,The New Age of Sexism.Less than two hours after I first entered the metaverse, I saw a woman’s avatar being sexually assaultedThere is no single definition of the metaverse, but most people use the term to describe a shared world in which virtual and augmented technologies allow users (represented by avatars) to interact with people, objects and environments. Most of Meta’s virtual world is accessible only to those who pay for the company’s Quest headsets, but a limited number of metaverse spaces can be accessed by any device connected to the internet. Advanced technology such as 3D positional audio, hand tracking and haptic feedback (when controllers use various vibrations to coincide with actions you take) combine to make virtual worlds feel real. Your avatar moves, speaks and gestures when you do, allowing users to interact verbally and physically.Less than two hours after I first entered the metaverse, I saw a woman’s avatar being sexually assaulted. When I approached her to ask her about the experience, she confirmed: “He came up to me and grabbed my ass.”“Does that happen a lot?” I asked.“All the time,” she replied, wearily.I used my haptic controller to “pick up” a bright-yellow marker and moved towards a giant blackboard. “HAVE YOU BEEN ASSAULTED IN THE METAVERSE?” I wrote.The response was near instantaneous. “Yeah, many times,” someone shouted.“I think everybody’s been assaulted in the damn metaverse,” one woman replied immediately, in a US accent.“Unfortunately, it is too common,” a British woman added, nodding.Both women told me they had been assaulted multiple times.During my time in the metaverse, sexual harassment and unwanted sexual comments were almost constant. I heard one player shout: “I’m dragging my balls all over your mother’s face,” to another and witnessed male players making claims about “beating off”, as well as comments about “gang bangs”. My virtual breasts were commented on repeatedly. I did not witness any action taken in response – whether by a moderator or by another player.A damningTechCrunchreportfrom 2022found that human moderators were available only in the main plaza of Meta’s metaverse game Horizon Worlds – and that they seemed more engaged in giving information on how to take a selfie than moderating user behaviour.The NSPCC said, where the means of communication was known, 47% of online grooming offences were on Meta productsMore worryingly still, I visited worlds where I saw what appeared to be young children frequently experiencing attention from adult men they did not know. In one virtual karaoke-style club, the bodies of the singers on stage were those of young women in their early 20s. But based on their voices, I would estimate that many of the girls behind the avatars were perhaps nine or 10 years old. Conversely, the voices of the men commenting on them from the audience, shouting out to them and following them offstage were often unmistakably those of adults.It is particularly incumbent on Meta to solve this problem. Of course, there are other companies, from Roblox to Microsoft, building user-generated virtual-reality gaming platforms and virtual co-working spaces. But, according to NSPCC research, while 150 apps, games and websites were used to groom children online between 2017 and 2023, where the means of communication was known, 47% of online grooming offences took place onproducts owned by Meta.These are not isolated incidents or cherry-picked horror stories. Research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that users were exposed to abusive behaviour every seven minutes in the metaverse. During 11 and a half hours recording user behaviour, the report identified100 potential violationsof Meta’s policies. This included graphic sexual content, bullying, abuse, grooming and threats of violence.View image in fullscreenA woman wearing VR goggles … Meta’s virtual world has been plagued with reports of sexual harassment and abuse.Photograph: AntonioSolano/Getty ImagesIn aseparate report, the CCDH found repeated instances of children being subjected to sexually explicit abuse and harassment, including an adult asking a young user: “Do you have a cock in your mouth?” and another adult shouting: “I don’t want to cum on you,” to a group of underage girls who explicitly told him they were minors.Since its inception, Meta’s virtual world has been plagued with reports of abuse. Users have reported being virtually groped, assaulted and raped. Researchers have also described beingvirtually stalkedin the metaverse by other players, who tail them insistently, refuse to leave them alone and even follow them into different rooms or worlds.In December 2021, a beta tester of the metaverse wrote in the officialFacebookgroup of the Horizon platform: “Not only was I groped last night, but there were other people there who supported this behaviour.”What was even more revealing than the virtual assault itself was Meta’s response. Vivek Sharma, then vice-president of Horizon at Meta, responded to the incident by tellingthe Vergeit was “absolutely unfortunate”. After Meta reviewed the incident, he claimed, it determined that the beta tester didn’t use the safety features built into Horizon Worlds, including the ability to block someone from interacting with you. “That’s good feedback still for us because I want to make [the blocking feature] trivially easy and findable,” he continued.This response was revealing. First, the euphemistic description of the event as “unfortunate”, which made it sound on a par with poor sound quality. Second, the immediate shifting of the blame and responsibility on to the person who experienced the abuse – “she should have been using certain tools to prevent it” – rather than an acknowledgment that it should have been prevented from happening in the first place. And, finally, most importantly, the description of a woman being abused online as “good feedback”.Much subsequent discourse has focused on the question of whether or not a sexual assault or rape carried out in virtual reality should be described as such; whether it might have an impact on the victims similar to a real‑life assault. But this misses the point. First, it is worth noting that the experience of being sexually harassed, assaulted or raped in the metaverse has had a profound and distressing impact on many victims.When it was revealed in 2024 that British police were investigating the virtual gang-rape of a girl below the age of 16 in the metaverse, a senior officer familiar with the casetold the media: “This child experienced psychological traumasimilar to that of someone who has been physically raped”.We can’t let tech companies off the hook because they claim the problem is too big or too unwieldy to tackleSecond, technology to make the metaverse feel physically real is developing at pace. You can already buy full-body suits that promise to “enhance your VR experience with elaborate haptic sensations”. They have sleeves, gloves and vests with dozens of different feedback points. Wearable haptic technology will bring the experience of being virtually assaulted much closer to the physical sensation of real-life victimisation. All the more reason to tackle it now, regardless of how “realistic” it is or isn’t, rather than waiting for things to get worse.But most importantly, regardless of how similar to or different from physical offline harms these forms of abuse are, what matters is that they are abusive, distressing, intimidating, degrading and offensive and that they negatively affect victims. And, as we have already seen with social media, the proliferation of such abuse will prevent women and girls from being able to fully use and benefit from new forms of technology.View image in fullscreenA 3D rendering of a metaverse city.Photograph: Kinwun/Getty ImagesIf Zuckerberg’s vision comes to fruition and the boardrooms, classrooms, operating theatres, lecture halls and meeting spaces of tomorrow exist in virtual reality, then closing those spaces off from women, girls and other marginalised groups, because of the tolerance of various forms of prejudice and abuse in the metaverse, will be devastating. If we allow this now, when the metaverse is (relatively speaking) in its infancy, we are baking inequality into the building blocks of this new world.At the time of the afore­mentioned virtual-reality rape of an underage girl, Meta said in a statement: “The kind of behaviour described has no place on our platform, which is why for all users we have an automatic protection called personal boundary, which keeps people you don’t know a few feet away from you.”Inanother incident, when a researcher experienced a virtual assault, Meta’s comment to the press was: “We want everyone using our services to have a good experience and easily find the tools that can help prevent situations like these and so we can investigate and take action.”The focus always seems to be on users finding and switching on tools to prevent harassment or reporting abuse when it does happen. It is not on preventing abuse and taking serious action against abusers.But in theCCDH researchthat identified 100 potential violations of Meta’s VR policies, just 51 of the incidents could be reported to Meta using a web form created by the platform for this purpose, because the platform refuses to examine policy violations if it cannot match them to a predefined category or username in its database.Worse, not one of those 51 reports of policy violation (including sexual harassment and grooming of minors) was acknowledged by Meta and as a result no action was taken. It’s not much good pointing to your complaints system as the solution to abuse if you don’t respond to complaints.Meta’s safety features will no doubt continue to evolve and adapt – but, once again, in a repeat of what we have already seen happen on social media, women and girls will be the canaries in the coalmines, their abuse and suffering providing companies with useful data points with which to tweak their products and increase their profits. Teenage girls’ trauma: a convenient building material.There is something incredibly depressing about all this. If we are really talking about reinventing the world here, couldn’t we push the boat out a little? Couldn’t we dare to dream of a virtual world in which those who so often face abuse are safe by design – with the prevention and eradication of abuse built in – instead of being tasked with the responsibility of protecting themselves when the abuse inevitably arises?None of this is whining or asking too much. Don’t be fooled into thinking that we are all lucky to be using Meta’s tools for nothing. We are paying for them in the tracking and harvesting of our data, our content, our photographs, our ideas and, as the metaverse develops, our hand and even eye movements. All of it can be scraped and used to train enormously powerful AI tools and predictive behavioural algorithms, access to which can then be sold to companies at gargantuan prices to help them forecast how we as consumers behave. It is not an exaggeration to say that we already pay Meta a very high price for using its platforms. And if the metaverse really does become as widely adopted and as ubiquitous in the fundamental operation of our day-to-day lives as Zuckerberg hopes, there won’t be an easy way to opt out.We can’t let tech companies off the hook because they claim the problem is too big or too unwieldy to tackle. We wouldn’t accept similar excuses for dodging regulation from international food companies, or real-life venues. And the government should be prepared to act in similar ways here, introducing regulation to require proved safety standards at the design stage, before products are rolled out to the public.“Hold on, just building the future here,” Horizon Worlds tells me as I wait to access the metaverse. As we battle to eradicate the endemic harassment and abuse that women and girls face in real-world settings, the metaverse presents a risk of slipping backwards. We are sleepwalking into virtual spaces where men’s entitlement to women’s bodies is once again widespread and normalised with near total impunity.The Guardian invited Meta to reply to this article, but the company did not respond.The New Age of Sexism: How the AI Revolution Is Reinventing Misogyny by Laura Bates is published by Simon & Schuster (£20).

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Having been instrumental in the reduction of smartphones to metal and glass slabs devoid of distinguishing features, Samsung hopes that going thinner and lighter with a special Edge edition of its high-end Galaxy S25Androidwill prove design innovation isn’t dead.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The S25 Edge is very thin at just 5.8mm thick –ifyou ignore the camera bump on the back – making it a full 1.5mm thinner than its similarly sized S25+ sibling and about the same thickness as a stack of seven credit cards. Its light 168g weight makes it feel even thinner than the numbers suggest and photos don’t do it justice.The extra thinness costs about £100 more than Samsung’s other 6.7in phone with the S25 Edge priced from £1,099 (€1,259/$1,099/A$1,849) placing it between the £999 S25+ and £1,249S25 Ultra.View image in fullscreenDespite its super-slender frame, the S25 Edge looks like any other large Samsung from the screen side.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe large high-quality 6.7in Oled screen is bright, crisp and smooth with a rapid fingerprint scanner embedded in it. The phone’s light weight makes it easier to hold than other big handsets but it still requires two hands to use the majority of the time. Slap it in a case and the thickness advantage is essentially removed, so the Edge is a phone best used without one.The rest of the phone is very similar to other Samsungs. It has Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, plenty of Ram and at least 256GB of storage. It flies through apps, games or anything else you might want to do with a phone. Samsung’s version of Android 15 (One UI 7) works well with plenty of customisation options, though some of the default settings make it a lot more like Apple’s iOS than you’d expect.It is packed with plenty of Google and Samsung’s most advanced AI tools. Some of them are great, such as Gemini; some are handy occasionally, such as the image editing tools, and others can safely be ignored. TheNow barand live notifications, which show ongoing tasks such as music playing in Spotify, are super handy, appearing on the lock screen and in the task bar on the home screen.Samsung will provide the Edge with software updates until 31 May 2032, making it one of the longest supported phones available.View image in fullscreenThe camera cluster sticks out the back of the S25 Edge for almost the full thickness of the phone again.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.7in QHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X 120HzProcessor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:256 or 512GBOperating system:One UI 7 (Android 15)Camera:200MP + 12MP 0.6x; 12MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, UWB and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins)Dimensions:158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8mmWeight:163gView image in fullscreenThe S25 Edge takes about 80 minutes to fully charge, hitting 50% in 26 minutes using a 25W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Edge’s extreme slender design does come with a few drawbacks, the biggest of which is a small battery with a slightly lower capacity than the regular S25. As a result, despite being a large phone the Edge has fairly short battery life. It will last about a day and a half of light usage between charges, so should see out most days, but it falls just short of thesmallest S25and about a day behindthe the S25 Ultra.It also gets a little hotter than other Samsung models when gaming, but if you play a lot of Fortnite or similar games the small battery capacity is probably already a cut too far.CameraView image in fullscreenThe Samsung camera app is fairly easy to use, while the light weight of the S25 Edge helps with one-handed photography.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe other big trade-off for the svelte frame is in the camera department. It only has two cameras on the back, lacking a telephoto sensor as fitted to the rest of the S25 series.The main camera is an excellent 200-megapixel model that is very similar to that on the S25 Ultra. It is a top-drawer camera that is better than the 50MP main cameras on the S25 and S25+. It shoots great photos across a range of conditions, and manages a very good 2x in-sensor zoom to somewhat negate the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera. The 12MP ultra wide camera is solid and can be used for macrophotography, while the selfie camera is very good.The camera app has the same long list of modes as other S25 models, shoots great video and manages to be fairly easy to use. Overall the main camera is excellent and if you never wish to close the distance to objects with a real zoom, it might be all the camera you need.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe titanium frame and hardened glass feel extremely solid despite the phone’s svelte dimensions.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSamsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.The phone isgenerally repairable. Screen repairscost £259 by authorised service centresand include a battery replacement. Samsung also offers aself-repair programme.The phone contains recycled materials, while Samsung offerstrade-inandrecycling schemesfor old devices. The company publishesannual sustainability reportsand impact assessments forsome individual products.PriceThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge costs from£1,099(€1,259/$1,099/A$1,849).For comparison, theGalaxy S25 Ultracosts£1,249, the S25+ costs£999and theS25costs£799. TheGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XLcosts£799, theOnePlus 13costs£899and theApple iPhone 16 Pluscosts£899.View image in fullscreenDespite being thin and light the S25 Edge is still a big phone and hard to use one-handed without a grip or handle.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianVerdictThe S25 Edge is an interesting move for Samsung. I don’t think many people have looked at their current phone and wished it could be thinner versus lasting longer or having a better camera. Most people use a case and that immediately nullifies the small differences in thickness of most premium devices.But using the Edge has reminded me of just how heavy modern big phones can be. It feels so much lighter in the hand, in your pocket or in your bag while still having a big, quality screen. The battery life is certainly not tremendous, but it hasn’t been terrible either, getting through heavy use days with a little left in the tank.The main camera is excellent but the lack of a good telephoto camera might be a deal-breaker for some. I did miss it. And while it feels very solid with a titanium frame and appears tosurvive aggressive bending, I would not want to sit on it in a back pocket.The S25 Edge is a quality piece of hardware, so if you’ve ever wanted a lighter, thinner, big-screen phone, this is it. But for everyone else better options exist from Samsung or others at this price.Pros:brilliant and large screen, super light weight, very thin, excellent main camera, fast fingerprint scanner, good software with seven years of support, top Android chip, latest AI features,Cons:no telephoto camera, relatively short battery life, expensive, deserves to be used without a case, still a two-handed device.Explore more on these topicsSamsungSmartphonesMobile phonesAndroidreviewsShareReuse this content"

They decided against it, however, because it would be able to play original Switch games – and 1990’s Super NES had no backwards compatibility with 1983’s NES. After playing with it for the weekend, I’d say a more accurate name would be the Switch Pro: effectively a modernised and highly refined version of the original console, rather than a whole new generation.The larger screen and more powerful processor are the most obvious upgrades, but every facet of the console is higher spec. The larger Joy-Cons feel more robust and are easier to use – the way they magnetically clip on to the console is very pleasing. The user interface is a graceful if slightly boring iteration of the Switch’s, enhanced with subtle haptic feedback and delightfully subtle bleeps and blips.View image in fullscreenThe wait is over … Gamers line up to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 console on Thursday in New York City.Photograph: Shawn Chen/APThe drop back to a standard LCD screen from the gorgeous Switch OLED model will annoy some, but the quality is decent and the increased display real estate makes a huge difference – it’s not quite up there with the very best handheld PCs, but then it’s significantly cheaper than a top-of-the-range Steam Deck or similar. I tested it with the most cinematic launch games I had – IO Interactive’s extremely good value Hitman World of Assassination: Signature Edition and Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut – and both provided a surprisingly epic experience in handheld mode, aided by the console’s extremely good virtual surround sound (you also get full 5.1-ch Linear PCM surround if you use compatible headphones or TV). Just don’t expect 4K, 60fps visuals as standard.In handheld mode, titles will run at between 720 and 1080p resolution, with 4K reserved for docked mode – though even here, only a few titles currently support full 4K resolutions. Cyberpunk 2077, for example, caps out at 1080p with the framerate at 30fps in Performance mode. In short, don’t expect cutting edge PS5 Pro or PC visuals – we’re looking at something between PS4 and PS5.The set-up is simple enough: switch it on, connect to the internet (via wifi or the ethernet port on the dock) and download an update. If you have a Switch it asks you to place it nearby, then copies across your user details and any games you own. The whole process took me about an hour and was completely painless, though beware – if you skip the transfer process, you won’t get another chance later to port your stuff across from your original Switch. GameShare, which allows you to share compatible games with Switch or Switch 2 owners who don’t have their own copy, is extremely easy too. I tried the local two-player option with Sega’s lovely multiplayer puzzle battler Puyo Puyo Tetris. You simply choose the GameShare option from the game’s main menu, while your friend selects GameShare from the Switch home screen; then the two seamlessly connect and you can start playing together.I’m interested to see how the feature holds up with more complex games, or with more players. For example, Survival Kids allows you to GameShare with two other consoles, which will put greater processing demands on the Switch 2 that’s doing the streaming, and could therefore affect performance. For now, I was impressed, and it will work really well with forthcoming party game Super Mario Party Jamboree.View image in fullscreenReady to go … Mario Kart World for the Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoGameChat, meanwhile, Nintendo’s rather overdue version of in-game video chat, requires you to connect and confirm your identity via your smartphone, and then you’re in. You can buy a Switch 2 Camera (£50) for this, but any old USB webcam will do. I think this may well prove a nice extra for close friends or families keen on playing together while apart; we’ll have to wait and see if any forthcoming games make interesting use of it.There are some extra costs to think about. If you want to play with more than two people you may need another set of Joy-Cons, which will set you back £75, or a Pro Controller at the same price. (I tried out the officially licensed PowerA Advantage pad, which doesn’t have rumble and only works in docked mode, but is a really sturdy option for Mario Kart sessions and very good value at £30.) A subscription to Nintendo Switch Online (needed for online play and, when the introductory offer runs out, GameChat) is £17.99 a year for one account, or £31.49 per year for your family. It’s £34.99/£59.99 a year for the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack, which offers access to a large range of retro Nintendo games from all eras and any extra content for modern games. It’s a decent price when compared with other gaming subscriptions, but still another expense to manage. Finally, you may need a microSD Express card if you start running out of space for new games on the built-in 256GB. A 256GB card will cost around £50. It all adds up.As for battery life, Nintendo is promising between two and 6.5 hours. I did a mixed test in which I played Mario Kart World, downloaded and played Hitman, and used GameShare and GameChat, and got about 3.5 hours, which is not bad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you somehow missed out on the original Switch, absolutely yes – it’s the zenith of Nintendo’s quest to make a hybrid handheld/home console, with a wide range of launch games (though currently only one genuine exclusive must-have inMario Kart World) and the promise of many glorious exclusives to come. If you already have a Switch, it’s worth the upgrade if you can afford it – the larger display, the better controllers, the social applications, all make it worth the outlay. It’s reignited lounge multiplayer in our house, my sons readily deserting their rooms to play Mario Kart together, and while this interest will probably ebb and flow, it’s been nice to have that back.The one incontrovertible truth is that Nintendo’s games cannot be played elsewhere. No smartphone, no PC, no Xbox or PlayStation will give you access to the full-fat Mario, Animal Crossing, Pokémon or Zelda titles, and it is exciting to imagine how those experiences will be translated to a new, beautifully crafted machine with a modest armoury of fresh features. Perhaps the design team at Nintendo were right not to call it Super Switch, but for the next few years, a Switch Pro equivalent is more than good enough.TheNintendo Switch 2is available now; £395.99 in the UK, $699.95 in Australia and $449.95 in the USExplore more on these topicsNintendo Switch 2Nintendo SwitchGamesNintendoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tension between the two exploded into public view in the middle of last week, with each leveling sharp barbs at the other. Four days into the public feud between the world’s most powerful person and the world’s richest person, though, I declare Musk the loser. An unstoppable force has lost its battle with an immovable object.From my colleaguesHugo Lowell and Andrew Roth:On Thursday, Elon Musk called for Donald Trump’s impeachment and mocked his connections to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as the US president threatened to cancel federal contracts and tax subsidies for Musk’s companies, in an extraordinary social media feud that erupted between the former allies. The direct shots at Trump were the latest twist in the public showdown over a Republican spending bill that Musk had criticized.“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk said in a post on X. He added: “Such ingratitude.”The fallout was immediate. Shares in Tesla, already struggling, slid 15%, knocking about $150bn from its total market value. Consequences for Trump and the Republican party may be farther-flung: midterm elections for positions in the US Congress are not scheduled until the latter half of next year.When Trump and Musk got together, US liberals forecast that the relationship would end in a public, acrimonious disaster. I did not think so. Musk was an extremely powerful and unusually close ally to Trump. Trump’s campaign needed the huge infusion of cash that Musk could provide. The Republican party did as well, and still does.But Trump himself remarked last week that many of his closest advisers seem to leave in dramatic and venomous fashion, victims of what he called “Trump derangement syndrome”. Musk followed the same pattern. One prominent example: Steve Bannon, once Trump’s chief strategist, was fired from the White House but now makes his living podcasting about Trump’s moves. Bannon spent the latter half of last week calling for Musk’s deportation. Trump did not seem to recognize himself as the common denominator in the fiery departures. Like Bannon, though, Musk is already back to backing the president. By Sunday night, he had already pivoted to tweeting about the riots in Los Angeles, retweeting Vice-President JD Vance with supportive US flag emojis and attacking California’s governor, Gavin Newsom.The spat between Musk and Trump highlighted how dependent the US has become on one man’s companies for its space capabilities. In the midst of his meltdown, Musk threatened to decommission SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, which is the only ship that currently provides the US access to the International Space Station. What would the country do without him? In a pinch, perhaps another billionaire’s rockets may have to do, even if they’re carrying Katy Perry.View image in fullscreenTrump and Musk shake hands while attending the NCAA division I wrestling championship in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 22 March.Photograph: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesThe spaceship aspect of the spat threw Musk’s relative weakness into relief. Musk said he would decommission the Dragon spacecraft, then rescinded the ultimatum of his own accord in response to requests on X that he play nice. Trump, by contrast, growled online. He has not taken the ominous message back, though he has not acted on it, either. Trump is no stranger to retribution. It is a major theme of his second administration. Musk, by contrast, throws his punches at people with less power and less money. When he faces foes of similar stature, he folds. Recall his gleeful jabs at Mark Zuckerberg about staging a cage fight between the two in 2023. Zuckerberg has made a fascination with mixed martial arts a facet of his public persona, showing off a toned physique in the process, and seemed likely to trounce Musk, but the X CEO seemed to believe his rival too staid to respond to his goading. He was wrong; Zuckerberg responded by taking up the gauntlet and even suggested a venue. Musk backed out. Repeat in 2025: Trump says he could save money by cancelling Musk’s government contracts; Musk says, “make my day” but then walked back his own bluff.Will this calamitous end to his alliance with Trump harm Musk in the long run? To date, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Musk has lost approximately $90bn of his fortune, an unthinkable amount of money. He remains the wealthiest person in the world by nearly $100bn.Perhaps the loser is democracy itself rather than Musk. On Friday, he polled his followers on whether he should create a new political party geared towards the center. He wants to call it “The America Party”. He has the money to make it happen. Musk has not exhibited centrist political leanings in the past two years, and he has shown himself to be a repulsive rather than a magnetic presence at political rallies, as evidenced by a major loss in a Wisconsin supreme court election earlier this year in which he played a domineering role.Read more about how the Trump-Musk feud reveals the danger of handing the keys of power to one personhere.Read more about the ways Trump and Musk could still hurt each otherhere.Read more about the financial impact of the feud on Teslahere.AI is not as good at making movies as executives say it isView image in fullscreenJohn Wick, directed by Chad Stahelski.Photograph: David Lee/Thunder Road Pictures/AllstarLast Thursday, I attended a showcase of eight short films produced with the generative artificial intelligence tool Runway. In a conversation before the screenings, Runway’s co-founder and chief design officer, Alejandro Matamala-Ortiz, said that two-hour films generated entirely by AI are “just around the corner”. An executive for Lionsgate described toNew Yorkmagazine in a story published the day before how the film studio had gone all in on AI, though more in the invisible process of production than the final footage shown in theaters. Lionsgate has inked a deal with Runway to use some of its archives to train the tech company’s AI.The quality of the films I watched undercuts the way these two executives are talking about AI. Six of the eight short films evoked no emotion. They lacked character and depth, full of placeholder-quality platitudes. Though AI can produce any image you can imagine, the films lacked creativity. The smooth, synthetic texture of many AI-generated images renders them as uninteresting and unstylish as a first thought. If a director can’t be bothered to resurface their images to make them a bit more unique than your average Midjourney output, why watch? One film was an anime revenge story, set off by basic signifiers of Japan, such as falling cherry blossoms, so simplistic as to be boring within five minutes. I laughed out loud at another film that claimed to document the intermittent emergence of cicadas but which consisted mostly of shots of lens flares. I felt like I was watching a showcase of middling student films. The theses of the majority of the films were muddled. The cinematography of nearly all of them was vague and offered no differentiated point of view. Runway claimed to have received 6,000 submissions for the competition, up from 300 in 2022, and I shudder to think of the Clockwork Orange-style eye-peelers that the judges of the competition must have subjected themselves to so as to be able to view all the entries.I said that these shorts had the quality of student films – perhaps that is because the means of production are in the early stages of development, and film-makers are still studying them. Runway has introduced new features for its own tools since closing submissions to it film festival in April. Google has likewise debuted a video generation tool, Veo 3, whoseoutput is more sophisticatedthan what I saw last week.Two films rose above the rest into the realm of the intriguing. A video essay titledTotal Pixel Spaceproved to be thought-provoking. The meditation on the nature of images rendered via computer, both of real events and of things that never happened, highlighted how few of the total possible number of images we see in our lifetimes. It offered a rare piece of insight amid the crowd, so stuffed with unearned wisdom.“Total pixel space represents both the ultimate determinism and the ultimate freedom, every possibility existing simultaneously waiting for consciousness to give it meaning through the act of choice,” read the film’s narration. I found the point salient in relation to the consideration of generated images, which already exist within the parameters of a computer monitor’s pixels but which cannot exist in our physical world, a contrast of circumscribed possibility and fantasy. And, with our limited mortal lives, the film asks us: what will you choose to view with your time and your choice? What will you choose to give meaning to?Total Pixel Space took home the contest’s grand prize. Though successful, the film offers a specific rebuttal of Matamala-Ortiz. If we were to extrapolate from the film festival’s output what path AI films will follow, will we see two-hour video essays? It is extremely rare for that type of film to carry interest for two hours.Another, Editorial, established a character and her inner life, a basic requirement for a live-action film but a seemingly insurmountable bar for AI-made movies. It seems AI still has difficulty generating the same face repeatedly, though with different expressions. Despite its limitations, I would still recommend the short. It deploys a similar kaleidoscopic effect to Everything Everywhere All at Once. Generative AI can render a hundred backgrounds behind a character to create a dazzling montage suggestive of interdimensional travel. The effect seems like one that would make a five-second sequence exceed a film’s entire budget, but with AI, it becomes financially feasible. Editorial uses it to succinct, punchy effect. Perhaps that is the ultimate purpose of AI, an augmentor more than a standalone producer. The Lionsgate VP made a similar point, describing how AI tools could make a $10m movie seem like one with a $100m budget. “We’re going to blow stuff up so it looks bigger and more cinematic,” he told New York magazine.This week’s AI newsLondon AI firm says Getty copyright case poses ‘overt threat’ to industryThe ‘death of creativity’?

Click and set up your inbox there by memorizing a passphrase, which is a series of randomly generated words used as a specific key to unlock the vault where your messages will be stored. Then, you will be able to type messages and send them to Guardian reporters. It works in the same way as sending a text or email with a few important differences. If you were to text a reporter, it is possible that an employer or a country’s cybersecurity force would be able to tell via an analysis of your internet traffic. With Secure Messaging, sending a message to the Guardian will appear no different from regular app traffic to prying eyes. Your activity on your device will seem to the outside as if you were simply browsing the news.Read more about Secure Messaginghere.The wider TechScapePornhub owner to suspend site in France in protest at new verification lawHow did you get my number?

That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.While several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll soon need an iPhone capable of beingupdated to iOS 26–iPhone 11or later – aswatchOS 26is due for release in September. The free update will bring a raft of new features, including an AI motivational workout coach called Workout Buddy, a new wrist-flick gesture to clear notifications, a design revamp and various smart actions for messages, dealing with spam, and controlling the volume. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.At a glanceBest Apple Watch for most people:Series 10 Aluminium£399 at John LewisBest cheapApple Watch:SE (2nd gen)From £219 at AppleBest Apple Watch for battery:Ultra 2From £779 at CurrysThe best Apple Watches you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘The thinnest model yet’: the Apple Watch Series 10.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest Apple Watch for most people:Series 10 AluminiumView image in fullscreenFrom £399 at Apple£399 at John LewisThe Apple Watch Series 10 is the best model for most people, offering the full Apple smartwatch experience in a choice of two sizes. It’s the thinnest model yet, at just under 1cm thick, so it easily slips under shirt cuffs and feels light and compact on the wrist. The 42mm version should fit smaller wrists, while the 46mm version is the bearer of the largest screen on an Apple Watch – if onlyjustover theUltra 2.The screen is a bright and crisp OLED that stays on all the time and can be easily read in direct sunlight or from an angle. The watch feels slick in operation, with the 46mm unit lasting about two days between charges (if it’s not monitoring exercise), or long enough to track a marathon with battery life to spare. The double-tap gesture is handy for cancelling timers, alarms and scrolling through your widgets without having to touch the watch. And with Siri on board, you can set alarms and other basic features quickly, without an internet connection.One of the biggest benefits of the Series 10 Apple Watch is pretty comprehensive health tracking, including ECG (heart rhythm), blood oxygen and skin temperature, plus sleep and menstrual cycle monitoring. Apple’s sports tracking is solid, too, covering running, cycling, and swimming at depths up to 6m. Offline music from Apple Music, Spotify and other third-party apps means you can access your tunes without having to carry your phone with you.However, it’s the deep integration with iOS that makes the Apple Watch the best smartwatch for iPhone users, with Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos and more accessible from your wrist.Note that 4G models are available but require a plan linked to your phone provider. They allow you to stay connected when you’re out of Bluetooth or wifi range, which can be particularly handy for making calls and staying in touch while you’re out exercising without your iPhone in tow.Why should you buy it?The Series 10 offers the best Apple Watch experience in the slimmest and most compact package. Add to this the bright and always-on screen, ECG and handy gesture controls, and it’salsothe best Apple Watch for daily wear.Buy if:you want a great Apple Watch with almost all the featuresDon’t buy if:you want longer battery life or a more rugged designRead our fullApple Watch Series 10 review: thinner, lighter and basically the sameSize:42/46mmThickness:9.7mmScreen brightness:up to 2,000nitsTested battery life:2 daysProcessor:S10Storage:64GBWater resistance:50 metresSensors:HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depthBest cheapApple Watch:SE (2nd gen)View image in fullscreenFrom £219 at Apple£219 at John LewisThe SE is a cut-down version of the Apple Watch that offers the basics for just over half the price of the Series 10. The shape of the second-gen SE is based on theSeries 6from 2020, which means it has an older design and thicker body, but it still comes in a choice of 40mm or 44mm sizes. The OLED screen is smaller than the Series 10 with chunkier bezels. While crisp and good-looking, it’s not as bright nor is it always-on; it lights up only when you turn your wrist – which might be a deal breaker for some.Built around the S8 chip fromthe Series 8, the SE is missing some of the S10’s other nice-to-have features, too: it lacks support for the offline and faster Siri, the useful double-tap gesture, and it has only half the storage (32GB) for offline music and apps. The watch still tracks quite a lot of health and sport metrics, but has an older-generation heart-rate monitor compared with the Series 10. It doesn’t give ECG, blood oxygen and skin temperature measurements, either.What you do get is all the same tie-ins with the iPhone, including Apple Pay, notifications and calls on your wrist. Battery life is about two days, but note the current generation of SE is approaching three years old and could be replaced later this year. And while it’s the cheapest Apple Watch that Apple is selling new, you can often find better refurbished deals on higher-end models.Why should you buy it?The older SE still offers most of the experience that makes an Apple Watch great, but for less money. Some of the more advanced heart-tracking features and the always-on screen are missing, though.Buy if:you want most of what makes the Apple Watch great for lessDon’t buy if:you want an ECG or an always-on screenSize:40/44mmThickness:10.7mmScreen brightness:up to 1,000nitsTested battery life:2 daysProcessor:S8Storage:32GBWater resistance:50 metresSensors:HR (2nd gen)Best Apple Watch for battery:Ultra 2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £779 at CurrysFrom £799 at AppleThe biggest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 2, which is unapologetically beefy compared with its siblings. It comes in only one size – 49mm – but is available in black or natural titanium and has a super scratch-resistant sapphire crystal screen.The Ultra 2 is Apple’s adventure watch, complete with an extra “action” button in bold orange on the side for triggering sports tracking or other functions, plus an extra chunky digital crown that can be easily engaged if you’re wearing gloves. It has a siren for emergencies and a super bright OLED screen that’s 1.5x as bright as the Series 10 and works well if you’re in need of a torch.On the inside it has the same chips and sensors as theSeries 9, matching the health and sports tracking features of the Series 10, including ECG and blood oxygen monitoring. It has a few extras, such as dual-band GPS for higher accuracy in built-up areas or forests, plus a “precision start” setting that gets a GPS and heart rate lock before you start an activity. It also comes with 4G as standard, although it still needs a compatible plan with your phone provider. One of the Ultra 2’s standout features is battery life, which is about three days without exercise monitoring or long enough to track an ultramarathon.Despite being quite big for an Apple Watch, the Ultra 2 still fits under shirt cuffs fairly easily and looks expensive despite its rugged design – which is good because it’s roughly double the starting price of the Series 10.Why should you buy it?The Ultra 2 is the biggest, longest-lasting and most distinctive Apple Watch available and comes with all the features you need to help make the most out of exercise, adventure and just daily life.Buy if:you want the biggest and longest-lasting Apple Watch with extra featuresDon’t buy if:you need a compact model or have smaller wristsRead our fullApple Watch Series Ultra 2 review: faster chips and brighter screensSize:49mmThickness:14.4mmScreen brightness:up to 3,000nitsTested battery life:3 daysProcessor:S9Storage:64GBWater resistance:100 metresSensors:HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depthskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s worth buying refurbished or when it is reduced.Series 8– Good at the time of release in 2022, the Series 8 still has most of the main Apple Watch features with a slightly smaller and dimmer screen. Worth picking up refurbished at a substantial discount.Ultra– For looks, Apple’s original chunky watch is almost identical to the Ultra 2, missing out on only a few minor features such as the double-tap gesture, a less bright screen, precision finding and sleep apnoea notifications. Worth buying refurbished.Replace or spruce up?Wearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.Greater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, though options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges atleast £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteriescosts £95.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.There are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes andsells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.Several third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chainCeX, online stores such asmusicMagpie, and marketplaces such asAmazon,eBayandBack Market.Make sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:Grade A or Excellent– virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.Grade B or Good– in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.Grade C or Fair– in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.Once you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly, and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:Batteryhealth– the battery in the Apple Watch isdesigned to maintain at least 80%of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check thebattery health under batteryvia the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?Charging cable– the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck to charge, whichcosts £29 on its own. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.Buttons– check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.Sensors– the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?Speakers– check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.Wifi– the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.Water resistance– the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50m water resistance?Warranty– what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?Do not buyAnyApple Watch Series 7or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.How I testedView image in fullscreenTesting the ultra-thin Series 10.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianQuick GuideHow I testedShowWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.We change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.We test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why should you trust me?I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 17 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

Seven ways to protect yourselfAs big companies become victims, here’s what you can do, from changing passwords to using two-step authenticationRupert JonesTue 10 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareKeep an eye on your inboxAlmost every week seems to bring news of a cyber-attack on a company, or organisation, and fears over what personal data the hackers have managed to get hold of.Last month, the footwear and sports apparel companyAdidas revealed thatsome of its customers’ personal information had been stolen, although it said passwords, credit card and other payment datawere not compromised.In another incident, the personal data ofhundreds of thousands of legal aid applicantsin England and Wales dating back to 2010 was accessed. And these came hard on the heels of cyber-attacks that caused huge disruption atMarks & Spencerandthe Co-op.Clothing shortages, food waste and millions lost each day: inside the M&S cyber-attack chaosRead moreIf a news story emerges about a cyber incident, and it is a company or organisation that you use, or have used in the past, keep an eye out for an email from it. Affected companies will usually contact customers to give them more information about what happened and what they should do.Sometimes it will be a certain category of customer who has had their data stolen, or only people in certain countries.In the case of Adidas, it appears to be those who have contacted the customer service helpdesk in the past, which will rule out a lot of people. Sometimes, the email will bring good news and say you are not one of those affected.If your data has potentially been accessed, there will usually be some information on action you should take, or a link to a “frequently asked questions” page. In some cases, you may be offered free access to a support service run by a cybersecurity company, or credit reference agency.View image in fullscreenIn the case of Adidas, it appears to be those who had contacted the customer service helpdesk in the past who were affected.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesChange your passwordIf you have had any dealings with a company or organisation that has suffered a cyber-attack, change the password you use for that website, or app, immediately.Always make sure you have strong passwords, and do not use the same one on more than one account.The general advice is make each password at least 12 characters long and use a combination of numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and symbols. Avoid things that are easily guessed or can be found online, such as your pet’s name, your birthday or favourite sports team.“A good way to make your password difficult to crack is by combining three random words to create one,”says the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre. It gives as an example something like Hippo!PizzaRocket1.“Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords,” says the online security company NordVPN.Use two-step authenticationTwo-step authentication is something you can set up for your email and other important online accounts to add an extra layer of security.It involves providing something that only you should have access to – typically it will be code generated by an authenticator app or sent to your phone you have registered with the organisation.Turn two-step authentication on for every service that offers it.View image in fullscreen2F can involve a code being sent to you by text message.Photograph: Prostock-studio/AlamyBeware unsolicited emailsPhishing emails used by fraudsters will often reference a cyber-attack that has been in the news to try to hook people in who are customers or users of that company or organisation.Sometimes fraudsters will have personal information which they obtained via an incident, or other means, which can make them sound more authentic.Do not click on a link or attachment in an email, text message or social media post unless you are absolutely sure it is legitimate. It could take you to a fake website or contain malware designed to steal your personal information.M&S has told potentially affected customers that “you might receive emails, calls or texts claiming to be from M&S when they are not, so do be cautious”. It added: “Remember that we will never contact you and ask you to provide us with personal account information, like usernames, and we will never ask you to give us your password.”If someone says they are from a company or organisation you use, and you cannot be 100% sure who you are dealing with, ignore the email, or hang up and find the official contact details if you want to check with it.View image in fullscreenDo not click on a link or attachment in an email unless you are absolutely sure it is legitimate.Photograph: Tero Vesalainen/AlamyMonitor your credit recordIf your personal data has been stolen, it is worth keeping tabs on your credit record (the detailed file of your financial history used by lenders to assess your creditworthiness) in case fraudsters attempt to take out loans or other products in your name.For example, if your employer has been hit by a cyber-attack, the data that may have been accessed could include your name, address, national insurance number, date of birth, bank account, salary and, sometimes, identity documents such as your passport.There is the potential for this type of information to be combined and used to commit identity fraud.The UK’s main credit reference agencies are Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, and you can access your credit report in different ways – some free, some paid-for.Credit KarmaandClearScoreoffer access to your credit report free for life.Experian offers Identity Plus, which will monitor your personal, financial and credit information and alert you if it detects any suspicious activity. It is a paid-for service, but the cost may be covered for you by an organisation if data you hold with it has been stolen.If you are turned down for a financial product, such as a credit card or loan, despite having a good credit rating, or you stop receiving statements from your bank for no reason, it could be a sign someone has been using your identity.Other, more obvious signs are if you start to get letters relating to debts that are not yours, or your bank statement mentions an item you have not bought.Take care on social mediaMost financial and shopping scams start on social media and tech platforms, say banks. Again, be wary, as fraudsters may have obtained details about you that they can use to convince you that you are having a conversation with someone you know.How to protect yourself from scams: six easy ways to stay safeRead moreThere has been a rise in recent years inso-called “Hi Mum” scams, in which fraudsters pose as loved ones on services such as WhatsApp. Someone might get in touch pretending to be a family member and saying they need cash quickly to pay a bill because they have been locked out of their online banking after getting a new phone.Do not rush into transferring money, even if you are told it is urgent. Take time and check that you are really in touch with a relative or friend.Opt out of registeringWhen shopping online, retailers often offer to store your payment card details for a faster checkout next time (sometimes you have to untick a box to prevent this from happening automatically). In some cases, by agreeing to this, you are giving permission for your details to be stored by a third party rather than the company you are buying from.There is less chance someone will be able to fraudulently obtain your card details if you do not allow them to be stored on more retailers’ systems than is necessary – even if it means it takes slightly longer to buy your items next time you use the site.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksConsumer rightsCybercrimeInternetScamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mildly alarmed, I examined my own thumb to find the same evidence of getting over-absorbed in the knockabout, chaotic fun of our tournaments. You can play Mario Kart online now – even with video chat, in World – but it’s just not the same as playing with people on the couch next to you. I imagine this game will revive living-room multiplayer for millions of families.God only knows how many hours I have spent racing Mario and his pals around their cartoon wonderland circuits since 1992 – this series has accompanied me through my entire life, the reliable mainstay that everyone wants to play with me, no matter how familiar they are with video games in general. I have been caught in months-long time-trial wars with my brother and my gamer friends; I have watched laughing strangers play it endlessly at the gaming pub nights that I used to run; I have dropped in and out of races over long evenings with big groups of friends; I’ve played it with almost everyone I’ve ever dated. Mario Kart World allows for all these playstyles and more, an easy-breezy social game that also lets you getextremelycompetitive.View image in fullscreenMario Kart World comes alive in split-screen multiplayer, as it always has, but the online options are robustPhotograph: NintendoIt comes with a veritable Disneyland of courses: ice palaces, a jungle safari, a dinosaur park, a ski slope, a spaceport themed after the 1983 arcade version of Donkey Kong. Some feel like old Mario Kart courses, with tighter turns and clever shortcuts, designed for power-sliding and boosting around the old-fashioned way. Others are wider, more scenic voyages: every course connects to several others, so you can either race laps or drive between hot-spots on what is now a massive interconnected map, letting you drive from the seaside all the way to Bowser’s Castle at the top of a volcano.Outside of the races you can also roam freely, going off-road or even on to the water, hunting down hidden coins and challenges: difficult trick-courses across lava fields, an unconventional route through the sky balanced on the wings of a seaplane, timed coin-collecting. This world isn’t as populous or as beautiful as something like Forza Horizon’s, but it’s still a trip to explore it with friends and find scenic little spots to gather together. The visual language is that of a group holiday: Polaroid snaps, stickers from local shops, regional foods. It’s a shame that free-roam only works online, mind – two or more players on the same console can race together, but they can’t explore together.Speaking of trips: you can still make a Mario Kart World session feel like a tournament, if you want, running laps and competing to find the best lines through particular courses. But it seems to me that the developers want you to experience it instead as a journey. The Grand Prix competitions link courses together so you’re charting a course across this little continent, seeing all the sights as you go. Driving with 24 players on those wide routes from one course to another, it doesn’t feel so much like a race as a chaotic road trip. This is very much the vibe in Knockout Tour, a Fortnite-style elimination race where you can go from first place to 14th in two seconds and trailing players are thrown out of the race every few minutes.The most important change, however, is not the environment, but the movement. You can now charge up a boost-jump to grind along rails, ride walls, and chain shortcuts through the more ambitious courses. This requires fighting against actual decades’ worth of drift-and-boost muscle memory, and during my first days with Mario Kart World it raised the humiliating possibility that I might now bebadat it, after all these years. But once you’ve got the hang of it, it gives racing a new feel even for those of us who’ve been karting forever, adding a bit of Tony Hawk-esque flair.View image in fullscreenMario Kart World’s new-look Donkey Kong reinvents the venerable ape for a new generation.Photograph: NintendoThe cast of characters is broad and ridiculous. You can race as a cow, or a dolphin, or a new-look Donkey Kong hunkered hilariously over the steering wheel. (Nintendo’s venerable ape has now taken on the look that he sported in the recent Mario movie, and dabs in the air whenever you pull off a trick – I now find him nonspecifically annoying, but then, I am old.) You unlock new vehicles all the time, and new costumes for the ones who wear clothes, primarily Mario and his friends. It is impossible not to smile at Bowser in full biker leathers kicking back on an imitation Harley.There are plenty of different assist options for kids and less skilled players, from motion-controlled steering to auto-acceleration and more: my eight-year-old could play without them, and my five-year-old was kept in the running by turning some of them on. It really is an impressively welcoming game, this, generous and detailed and unfailingly fun, different but with the same spirit. It feels like the culmination of something, a synthesis of different philosophies of fun that still nonetheless comes together. The Switch 2 itself does feel like a swish upgrade rather than an all-new console, so it’s a relief that its headline game shows that Nintendo still has a talent for reinvention.Mario Kart World is available now; £74.99 in the UK, $119.95 in Australia and $79 in the US.Explore more on these topicsNintendo Switch 2Mario KartNintendo SwitchNintendoGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there’s a way to fix the problemTue 10 Jun 2025 11.05 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 13.41 EDTShareAs the world watchesDonald TrumpandElon Muskpublicly fight over the sweeping legislation moving through Congress, we should not let the drama distract us. There is something deeper afoot: unprecedented wealth concentration – and the unbridled power that comes with such wealth – has distorted our democracy and is driving societal and economic tensions.Musk, the world’s richest man, wields power no one person should have. He has used this power to elect candidates that will enact policies to protect his interests and he even bought his way into government. While at the helm of Doge, Musk dramatically reshaped the government in ways that benefit him – for instance, slashing regulatory agenciesinvestigating his businesses– and hollowed out spending to make way for tax cuts that would enrich him.Musk is just one example of the ways in which unchecked concentration of wealth is eroding US democracy and economic equality. Just 800 families in the US are collectively worth almost$7tn– a record-breaking figure that exceeds the wealth of thebottom half of the US combined.While most of us earn money through labor, these ultra-wealthy individuals let the tax code and their investments do the work for them. Under the current federal income tax system,over halfof the real-world income available to the top 0.1% of wealth-holders (those with $62m or more) goestotally untaxed. As a result, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have gotten away with payingzero dollars in federal income taxes in some years,even when their real sources of income were soaring.On the other side, millions of hard-working Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Their anxiety is growing as tariffs threaten to explode already rising costs.A broken tax code means unchecked wealth-hoarding. The numbers are staggering:$1tn of wealth was created for the 19 richest US households just last year(to put that number into perspective, that is more than the output of the entire Swiss economy). That was the largest one-year increase in wealth ever recorded. I have studied this rapidly ballooning wealth concentration, and like my colleagues who focus on democracy and governance, I am alarmed by the increasingly aggressive power wielded by a small number of ultra-wealthy individuals.The good news is, hope is not lost. We can break up this dangerous concentration of wealth by taxing billionaires. There is growing public support for doing just this, even among Republican voters. A recent Morning Consult poll found that70% of Republicansbelieved “the wealthiest Americans should pay higher taxes”, up from 62% six years ago.With many of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy set to expire this year, legislators have an opportunity to reset the balance driving dangerous wealth-hoarding. Rather than considering raising taxes on middle-class Americans or even households earning above $400,000, they must focus on the immense concentration of wealth among the very top 0.1% of Americans. This would not only break up concentrated wealth, but also generate substantial revenue.One mechanism for achieving this goal is a wealth tax on the ultra-wealthy. The Tax Policy Center recently released an analysis of a new policy called the Five & Dime tax. This proposal would impose a 5% tax on household wealth exceeding $50m and a 10% tax on household wealth over $250m. The Five & Dime tax would raise $6.8tn over 10 years, slow the rate at which the US mints new billionaires, and reduce the billionaires’ share of total US wealth from 4% to 3%.While breaking up dangerous wealth concentration is reason enough to tax billionaires, this revenue could be invested in programs that support working families and in turn boost the economy. Lawmakers could opt for high-return public investments like debt-free college, helping working families afford childcare, expanding affordable housing, rebuilding crumbling infrastructure, and strengthening climate initiatives.Ultimately, taxes on the ultra-rich could transform American society for the better andgrow the economyby discouraging unproductive financial behaviors and promoting fair competition – leading to a more dynamic and efficient system.Critics will inevitably claim such a tax would stifle economic growth or prove too challenging for the IRS to implement. But in our highly educated nation, the idea that growth and innovation comes from just a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals does not withstand scrutiny. And while there are challenges for administering any bold proposal, America has always been up for a challenge.After witnessing the consequences of billionaire governance firsthand under this administration, Americans understand what’s at stake. We are seeing how unchecked, astronomical wealth has corrupted American democracy and stifled the economy. It’s not too late to act. Now it’s time for lawmakers who care about the country’s future to embrace solutions that empower everyone, not just the few at the top.Gabriel Zucman is professor of economics at the University of California Berkeley and the Paris School of EconomicsExplore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionElon MuskDonald TrumpUS domestic policyUS taxationUS CongressUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But as helicopters fly overhead, those lines can also create commonalityTue 10 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTShareIn Los Angeles, it’s not uncommon to hear the buzzing of a police helicopter overhead. The sound is almost background noise in this city. A reminder that somewhere, something is happening, something you aren’t a part of. It’sout there, but it’s notright here. But more and more, that sound has begun to jolt us out of our complacency. In the last five years, that sound has heralded the uprising over the killing of George Floyd and the devastation of the Eaton and Palisades fires. Instead of the usual – a high-speed police chase, a burglary or some other fodder for local news sensationalism – that sound means you are living on the doorstep of history once again. This last weekend reminds us that our city is under siege from a federal government eager for a fight. That our immigrant neighbors are being disappeared, apparentlywithoutdue process.I’ve gotten texts from family and friends asking if I’m OK as this all transpires. Most people outside LA don’t realize just how big this place is. That in these moments, it can feel like the events are happening in another world. You might see someone pouring a water bottle over their head on the sidewalk, trying their best to mitigate the damage caused by teargas. Google Maps shows you the 101 freeway is closed – a bright red line through your morning commute. Co-workers offer uneasy glances. After all, you have to go to work. You have to keep going. You can’t stop for one second to truly reflect on what you’re witnessing, or you might get washed away by the crushing demands of even the simplest life.During this year’s fires, I had to move houses. The movers came and dutifully trudged up and down stairs, lifted boxes and drove back out into the red horizon. Some restaurants remained open, serving food despite the toxic air and general sense of dread that consumed the region. Many of those people, who did all they could to earn a living so we could approximate normalcy, were immigrants from countries like Mexico, El Salvador, Venezuela and anywhere in between. They were also the ones who kept restaurants open during Covid lockdowns or drove for Uber Eats, again, so I could feel normal in abnormal times.And they’re doing it again, but the danger is even more immediate. People are being taken from their jobs, their homes, their schools – without warning and without their rights. For a lot of us in LA, it can feel like it’s happening somewhere else. Downtown, the suburbs – but itishappening here. Within the arbitrary geographical lines that form the city of LA and the surrounding county. Those lines, like the ones that we created to divide us into nation-states, do matter, even if they aren’t natural. They matter because they are how we identify, how we form communities. The world is not borderless, even though some of us might wish it to be. They exist, for better or worse.Right now, it does feel like it’s for the worse. Donald Trump and his administration see those lines and they weaponize them; they use them to create fear and chaos in our cities. They grab human beings and toss them over those arbitrary lines, denying them their dignity – the dignity that is enshrined in our constitution for all peoples. In a moment like this, it’s easy to curse the very notion of those arbitrary lines, as they cause so much misery. But those lines also create commonality. More than ever, those of us in LA should look at who and what is within our city limits. Not because we should fear what’s outside, but because we should care about what’s inside. We should always care, no matter where cruelty takes place, but even more so when the cruelty happens to those who share our home.LA might be the greatest empathy test humanity ever devised. A nearly 500-square-mile city, with close to 4 million residents spread out all the way to the ocean. To live in LA is to have the opportunity to live a fully internal life. I never saw the fires. I barely saw the smoke. The devastation was relegated to my TV screen, my smartphone. It’s a city built on privacy, isolation and riddled with neighborhoods surrounded by gates and private security. Mike Davis’s seminal history of LA urbanism,City of Quartz, built its narrative around the idea of LA as a panopticon fueled by greed, riddled with paranoia and beholden to the prison-industrial complex. It made such a mark on our city’s culture because it’s often true. This can be a dark, lonely place. But it can be a haven, too, if you look up from the ground, peer out from behind your own anxiety and believe in the idea that there is more out there than what is happening directly in front of you.This is a moment where we have the power to decide what kind of city we want to live in. We can cede our agency, our will and our community to brute force or we can live together. We can pass the empathy test and make it clear to the world that LA is not a bastion of unchecked individualism, but a city of communal spirit and diversity. I don’t know what the solution to this crisis is. Governor Newsom is suing to repel the national guard order, but it will take time, and the president hasnot shown much interest in abiding by court rulings. All I know is that this will not end unless the city and its population stands firm on its values and morals. That it stands together even if it’s so easy to see what’s happening as just another reason for bad traffic.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsLos AngelesOpinionUS immigrationLos Angeles Ice protestscommentShareReuse this content"

Now he’s talking about sending ‘troops everywhere’Tue 10 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 12.15 EDTShareDonald Trump was on his way to Camp David for a meeting with military leaders on Sunday when he was asked by reporters about possibly invoking the Insurrection Act,allowing direct military involvementin civilian law enforcement. Demonstrations against Trump’s draconian immigration arrests had been growing in Los Angeles, and some of them had turned violent. Trump’s answer? “We’re going to have troops everywhere,” hesaid.I know Trump is “a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag”, toborrow the wordsof the Republican senator Rand Paul, and that this president governs using misdirection, evasion and (especially) exaggeration, but we should still be worried by this prospect he raises of sending “troops everywhere”.Already, Trump and his administration have taken the unprecedented steps of calling up thousands of national guard soldiers to Los Angeles against the wishes of the California governor, ofdeployinga battalion of hundreds of marines to “assist” law enforcement in Los Angeles, and of seeking tobanthe use of masks by protesters whiledefendingthe use of masks for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents. Needless to say, none of this would be happening if these times were normal.What makes this moment abnormal is not the fact that Los Angeles witnessed days ofmostly peacefulprotests against massive and destructive immigration arrests. We’ve seen such protests countless times before in this country. Nor is it the fact that pockets of such protests turned violent. That too is hardly an aberration in our national history. What makes these times abnormal is the administration’s deliberate escalation of the violence, a naked attempt to ratchet up conflict to justify the imposition of greater force and repression over the American people.The Steady State, a non-partisan coalition of more than 280 former national security professionals, has issued a warning over these events. “The use of federal military force in the absence of local or state requests, paired with contradictory mandates targeting protestors, is a hallmark of authoritarian drift,” the statementreads. “Our members – many of whom have served in fragile democracies abroad – have seen this pattern before. What begins as provocative posturing can rapidly metastasize into something far more dangerous.”The hypocrisy of this administration is simply unbearable. If you’re an actual insurrectionist, such as those who participated in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by destroying federal property and attacking law enforcement officers, you’llreceivea pardon or a commutation of your sentence. But if you join the protests against Ice raids in Los Angeles, you face military opposition.Then there’s Stephen Miller. The White House deputy chief of staff unironicallypostson social media that “this is a fight to save civilization” with no apparent awareness that it is this administration that is destroying our way of life, only to replace it with something far more violent and sinister.Are we about to see Trump invoke the Insurrection Act? It’s certainly possible. On the White House lawn on Monday, Trump explicitly called the protesters in Los Angeles “insurrectionists”, perhaps preparing the rhetorical groundwork for invoking the act. And by invoking the Insurrection Act, Trump would be able to use the US military as a law enforcement entity inside the borders of the US – a danger to American liberty.The Insurrection Act has been used about 30 times throughout American history, with the last time being in Los Angeles in 1992. Then, the governor, Pete Wilson, asked the federal government for help as civil disturbances grew after the acquittal of four white police officers who brutally beat Rodney King, a Black man, during a traffic arrest. The only time a president has invoked the Insurrection Act against a governor’s wishes has been when Lyndon Johnson sent troops to Alabama in 1965. But Johnson used the troops to protect civil rights protesters. Now, Trump may use the same act to punish immigration rights protesters.One part of the Insurrection Act allows the president to send troops to suppress “any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy” in a state that “opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws”. According to Joseph Nunn at theBrennan Center, “[t]his provision is so bafflingly broad that it cannot possibly mean what it says, or else it authorizes the president to use the military against any two people conspiring to break federal law”.No doubt, Trump finds that provision to be enticing. What we’re discovering during this administration is how much of American law is written with so little precision. Custom and the belief in the separation of powers have traditionally reigned in the practice of the executive branch. Not so with Trump, who is dead set on grabbing as much power as quickly as possible, and all for himself as the leader of the executive branch. To think that this power grab won’t include exercising his control of the military by deploying “troops everywhere”, whether now or at another point in the future, is naive.Such a form of governance, with power concentrated in an individual, is certainly a form of tyranny. But tyranny, as Hannah Arendt reminds us in On Violence, is also “the most violent and least powerful of forms of government”. And while a government may have the means to inflict mass violence, it is ultimately the people who hold the power. These are the lessons we need to be studying, and implementing on our streets everywhere, while we still can.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS immigrationDonald TrumpUS militaryUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer has not yet celebrated his first anniversary in Downing Street, but the government already moves with the plodding gait of a caretaker administration.There were painful stumbles at the start. The cut to winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners was announced within a month of the general election. Now, in the face of overwhelming opposition, it has beenlargely reversed. Meagre savings to the exchequer were procured at an exorbitant price in political capital.The early display of unsentimental cost-cutting by the chancellor was meant to show thatLabourwas serious about fiscal discipline. The legacy of Tory mismanagement – a £20bn revenue shortfall – could be cited in mitigation.Pensioners were never going to relish the confiscation of their entitlements, just as farmers were sure to complain about the loss of inheritance tax perks and businesses were unlikely to thank the chancellor for hiking their national insurance bills. But maybe some slack would be cut to an incoming government that dared to take tough decisions; maybe the memory of terrible Conservative rule was convertible into credit for their successors.The idea was to advertise Britain, under newly reliable management, as a beacon of orderliness in a chaotic world and a magnet for investment. Prudently rationed public resources would be deployed in ways that stimulate growth – upgrading transport and energy infrastructure; housebuilding. Prosperity would follow, buoying the national mood.This week’s spending review is meant to be a pivotal moment in the execution of that plan. There will be increases in capital and day-to-day spending by £113bn and £190bn respectively; well in excess of what the Tories had proposed before the election. The very opposite of austerity, the Treasury insists.Rachel Reevesboasts of “national renewal” paid as the dividend of fiscal and political stability.But Whitehalldepartments not chosen for munificence face harsh real-terms spending cuts. And the benefit of investment in new trains, homes and power stations won’t be felt for years, decades in some cases.In a more benign climate, a newish government could make a virtue of policy designed for the long term, not bending every announcement for tactical gain. But that amounts to a plea for national forbearance, urging collective sacrifice in anticipation of future reward. After years of stagnant incomes and rising bills, there isn’t much receptiveness among British voters for yet more deferral of gratification.Also, the time to get a reliable mandate for that kind of programme was before the election. The fatal flaw in Labour’s economic strategy was overestimating how much goodwill would be available to the party once it had fulfilled its electoral utility as a tool for ousting the Tories.Keir Starmer won a huge majority by making himself inoffensive to as many people as possible. The campaign started from the premise that Labour loses whenever voters think it is planning a reckless tax-and-spending spree, or suspect that its leader is a leftwing fanatic. Those threats were neutralised with ferocious discipline, but at a cost in clarity about the post-election agenda. Starmer embodied a contradiction – change without upheaval. That was bound to unravel on first contact with the reality of government.In a bygone era, Reeves’s attempt to deflect blame for painful choices on to the Tory legacy might have been more effective. There was obviously a mess to be cleared up and sometimes voters have long memories. Thewinter of discontentwas brandished in evidence to disqualify Labour from office for more than a decade. Endemic sleaze and callous neglect of the public realm in the 90s did the same for the Conservatives. Their recent reign of disrepute should impose another long period of opposition penance.It probably will, but not necessarily to Labour’s benefit. The conventional division of allegiance between two main parties is breaking down, perhaps irrevocably. Reform UK regularly leads in opinion polls. In terms of councils controlled, the Liberal Democrats areGreat Britain’s second-largest party.These might be transient trends. It isn’t unprecedented for smaller parties to capitalise on dissatisfaction with the ruling when the main opposition is still discredited and divided after recent ejection from office. In late 1981, the SDP-Liberal Alliance polled at about 50%. In a general election, 18 months later, they won 23 seats.Reform is not the first party to be led by Nigel Farage and his previous vehicles – Ukip; the Brexit party – didn’t convert their midterm menace into parliamentary seats. But that was when the Conservatives were competitive. In 2019, Farage didn’t even try to rival Boris Johnson,withdrawing more than 300 candidatesto make a Tory majority more likely.There are reasons to think the current fragmentation in party support describes a more durable shift in the structure of British politics. Reform’s ascent, mostly at the expense of the Tories, conforms to an international pattern of populists and nationalists challenging more established rightwing parties and, in the American case, swallowing the old guard whole. The moribund centre-right tradition of English conservatism doesn’t look any closer to resuscitation than the twitching corpse of the pre-Trump Republican party.Powerful social and cultural trends are driving these changes. They express a depth of frustration and disillusionment that is resistant to appeals from candidates who come across as advocates for continuity of the existing system.This helps explain Labour’s failure to sustain its status as the nation’s preferred alternative to the Tories almost as soon as the election was over. The campaign foregrounded safety and reassurance, defining change primarily as a switch of personnel at the top. In the absence of a clear agenda for the future, Starmer and Reeves ended up owning everything that is desultory about the present. In an age of endemic mistrust in politics, there was precious little benefit of the doubt to be earned. Almost overnight, Labour became just another load of politicians, sounding the same, doing unpopular stuff and making excuses for why things aren’t getting any better.That feels unfair to ministers who argue, with justification, that last autumn’s budget and Wednesday’s spending review set Britain on a path that is very different from anything the Tories had in mind. But precious months were wasted where the gap was too hard to discern, when the only visible agenda was painful tinkering with the status quo. The problem is not the trajectory now, but the shallowness of the angle where the lines diverged last July. It is the hesitancy of the steps, the stiff posture, that makes Labour look less like a fresh team with a purposeful stride, more like the familiar retread of a much longer incumbency.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next four yearsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But if you’re not a regular gym goer, it can feel intimidating to know where to begin. What is the difference between sets and reps? How many should you do? What if you don’t want to turn into the Hulk?The latest viral fitness trend of doing 100 kettlebell swings a day for 30 days might seem like a straightforward way in. TikTokers’videosshowing themdoing the challengeseem to have struck a chord, racking up millions of views, and promising the regime can flatten your stomach, make your glutes stronger and help with back pain.But experts warn people – especially beginners – to treat the trend with caution. While they encourage people of all ages to start strength training, for some, doing 100 kettlebell swings a day might be an “injury waiting to happen”.What are the health benefits?Kettlebell training has been shown to increase muscle mass, which makes your bones stronger, and has been shown in some cases to help reduce fat mass as well as improve back and neck pain, says Dr Kim Way, an exercise physiologist and lecturer at Deakin University. However, those studies have not assessed doing 100 kettlebell swings a day – typically they have examined some form of kettlebell exercises two to three times a week, Way says.Lift, rest, recover: how to start weightliftingRead more“There’s certainly a lot of difference in … the amount of stress that’s being placed on the body, in terms of exercising every day versus having some recovery to allow for the body to essentially adapt,” Way says.Associate Prof Justin Keogh, an exercise scientist at Bond University, says the health benefits also depend on the weight of the kettlebell used. A heavier weight will help increase strength, muscle power and mass, while doing more repetitions with fewer rest periods will improve strength and endurance, may reduce body fat, and can have cardiovascular health benefits, he says.Kettlebell swings can be advantageous because you have to coordinate different upper and lower body segments and it mirrors the movement patterns that are “more similar to what life throws at us”, Keogh says.What could go wrong?Doing 100 kettlebell swings a day carries the risk of “going a little bit too hard, too early”, Keogh says. “The chance that your hamstrings, lower back, forearms, etc, are going to feel really tight the next three or four days … is pretty high, and then you might not want to do any exercise over those next couple of days.”Keogh encourages people to start strength training carefully and gradually intensify their workouts in order to minimise the chance of what’s known as delayed onset muscle soreness, which occurs when muscles that haven’t been used to the level of exertion get quite sore for several days post-exercise.Way agrees 100 kettlebell swings is “quite a lot of swinging”, especially if done every day. “What I see with trends like this is that you’re getting people excited about an exercise, which is great … but exposing people, especially if they haven’t had any exposure to an exercise, that’s just an injury waiting to happen because you haven’t had the time to allow your body to adapt to the muscle stress, and the joint stress, that potentially this exercise will be placing on the system,” they say.Way is also concerned people might not be developing the correct technique. “While the kettlebell swing might not necessarily look like a super complex movement – and compared to other exercises, it might not be – but even if you’ve just got a little part that’s a bit wrong, it can put yourself into an area of potential injury.”They encourage people to find resources to ensure that they’re using the correct technique. Way also advises if a person is new to exercise, they should listen to their body because if they start to fatigue, “this is where technique can really quickly break down” and make injury more likely.Should everyone, no matter their age, be doing strength training?Our genes largely determine the maximum size and strength of our bones, which is what’s called “peak bone mass”, but exercise can also influence whether we reach our full bone mass potentialby the age of 25-30. People generally begin to lose bone mass from the age of around 40 onwards. Keogh says it’s better to begin resistance training earlier because then your muscle and bone mass will reach a higher peak. “But again, we do know that regardless of the age that you start resistance training, you will get benefits compared to those people who [aren’t].”What actually counts as resistance training? Does it have to involve weights?Way says that types of exercise like yoga and pilates, which require us to use our body weight as a form of resistance, are “a great way” to get into resistance training. However, people should keep in mind that if they use body weight exercises for their main form of resistance training there probably is a “ceiling effect” once you are strong with your own body weight. Then using external weights – whether at the gym or finding weights at home through using cans of food or filling backpacks – can be helpful to get some resistance.Strengthen your heart, bones – and maybe even your brain: a beginner’s guide to weight training at any ageRead moreWay emphasises “it doesn’t need to be a lot” – sometimes the big fear people have is that to do weight training they have to emulate bodybuilders online who are training for two or three hours each time.“It actually can be pretty simple,” Way says. You can just strip it down, allocating five to eight exercises targeting your main muscle groups (your chest muscles, back muscles and leg muscles), and doing two to three sets, anywhere between eight and 15 repetitions.“When you’re trying to get into exercise, the best form of movement is always going to be the one that you enjoy,” Way says. “Resistance training or weight training is definitely a great one, because it gives you a really big host of benefits.”Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

How fortunate for Nigel Farage and ReformMarina HydeFormer party chair Zia Yusuf was out – then he was back in. But the chaos won’t dent the party’s poll ratings one tiny bitTue 10 Jun 2025 08.56 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 13.49 EDTShareIt was a busy week foron-again off-againReform chair Zia Yusuf, whose job over the past 11 months had been to reform Reform. (I know.) Zia quit on Thursday. Had his job split on Friday. Returned on Saturday. Chilled on Sunday. The job split seems to have endured though, as Yusuf will now run a UK version of Doge – as we know, the perfect role for highly emotional men – while this very morning, Nigel Farage was unveiling a new chair: Dr David Bull. David brings extensive experience with witchcraft, ghosts, spirits and beasts from his time as presenter of paranormal reality TV showMost Haunted Live, where he packaged the wailings of reekingly obvious charlatan/compelling spirit medium Derek Acorah for a studio audience. I can’t imagine what this CV could do for Reform, but Nigel Farage must have seen something in it.Derek Acorah crossed permanently to the spirit world in January 2020, but it would be nice to think that shouldn’t be a bar to his being selected as one of those Reform candidates credited with being able to make deep connections with a public that is desperately searching for something beyond the ordinary. It would certainly be a less mad development than some other of the party’s activities this week. On Monday, Farage could be found in Wales promising to reopen Port Talbot steelworks, a plan so nutso that it could only really be believed by conspiracy theorists. Jet fuelcan’t melt steel beams– and Nigel Faragecanre-melt steel furnaces that have cooled solid. Sure thing! Also, he might very well win the next election, so make of that what you will.From theRupert Lowe conflagrationto the Yusuf hokey cokey last weekend, it has to be said that the endless drama in Reform this year hasn’t dented Farage’s party’s poll ratings one tiny bit. In fact, up they climb. My theory is that at some level, people actively like it. They liked Boris Johnson’s fecklessness and chaos too – until, admittedly, they really didn’t. Still, what a run. Asdiscussed here previously, Britain is a majority nutter nation, and in recent history our deepest and most long-lasting political affections have been reserved for figures across the spectrum who had something of the nutter to them. Thatcher, Blair, Johnson … all nutters. Even Corbyn did miles better than he should have, simply by virtue of being a nutter – though he ultimately failed for not being a kindred nutter. Reform give the impression of being long and strong in nutters. “He crawled out under the wire,” twinkled Farage this morning of Yusuf’s “bid for freedom”, “but we got him back in!”“Sorry to put you all through that!” said Yusuf with a slightly strangulated smile. “I did realise the only way I was going to get a couple of days off was to resign and then come back again … I can’t thank Nigel enough for having me back. I regret those tweets, I was exhausted.” As Farage implied, this is just the sort of thing that happens when passionate people care almost too much.For decades, the deepest analysis afforded to the England football side was that they needed to play with more “passion”, and there is now a huge amount of this in the way we assess politicians. Keir Starmer, a sterile lawyer who communicates with all the vim of a recorded “see it, say it, sorted” message, does not reach the parts that need reaching. Farage speaks a more natural language, and consequently gets away with dismissing with one joke a row that would have consumed other parties’ PR machines for weeks. “Reform hit a speed bump last week,” he said in Wales of Yusuf’s resignation and unresignation. “Maybe it’s because we were driving above the recommended 20mph …”Arguably, it was ever thus. Reform keeps refreshing its moniker, but in many ways it’s still the same – like a bankrupt who changes his name each time he moves town and starts another double-glazing business. Ukip, the Brexit party, Reform – every time Nigel leads another one you hear a lot about professional revolution, but at some level they’re still the same outfit where one MEP had some altercation with another one, after whichthe latter collapsedin the European parliament. As Neil Hamilton insisted at the time, this is simply the sort of thing that happens when “passions run high”.But by far the most important part is: it doesn’t seem to matter. What’s changed in a post-Trump world is that chaos and drama can be repolished as political assets. As I say, I think the lack of discipline is part of the appeal. Discipline – what really is there to love about that word for most people? It smacks of being told off, which many have had quite enough of over the past decade of elite cultural policing. Politicians who manage rigidly conventional discipline above almost anything else have become regarded as robotic, while prodigals like Farage are polling like they’re worth laying on a fatted takeaway for.Instead of trying to counter Farage with the very conventions to which he is an adverse reaction, the two main parties should consider how unbelievably badly they’ve cocked things up that Nigel’s rolling drama seems like a good idea. “Can we do it?” wondered Dr David Bull rhetorically this morning of making Farage prime minister. “Well, to quote Bob the Builder: YES WE CAN.” Can’t help thinking it was someone other than Bob the Builder who made “yes we can” into an iconic political slogan … but – to use words which may function equally well as a Reform slogan – let’s not get bogged down in details.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Some are shocked by it, some are not. The well-known venture capitalist Josh Wolfe went sofar as to poston X that “Apple [had] just GaryMarcus’d LLM reasoning ability” – coining a new verb (and a compliment to me),referring to“the act of critically exposing or debunking the overhyped capabilities of artificial intelligence … by highlighting their limitations in reasoning, understanding, or general intelligence”.Apple did thisby showing thatleading models such as ChatGPT, Claude and Deepseek may “look smart – but when complexity rises, they collapse”. In short, these models are very good at a kind of pattern recognition, but often fail when they encounter novelty that forces them beyond the limits of their training, despite being,as the paper notes, “explicitly designed for reasoning tasks”.As discussed later, there is a loose end that the paper doesn’t tie up, but on the whole, its force is undeniable. So much so that LLM advocatesare already partly concedingthe blow while hinting at, or at least hoping for, happier futures ahead.In many ways the paper echoes and amplifies an argument thatI have been makingsince 1998: neural networks of various kinds can generalisewithin a distribution of data they are exposed to, but their generalisations tend to break down beyond that distribution.A simple example of this is that I once trained an older model to solve a very basic mathematical equation using only even-numbered training data. The model was able to generalise a little bit: solve for even numbers it hadn’t seen before, but unable to do so for problems where the answer was an odd number.More than a quarter of a century later, when a task is close to the training data, these systems work pretty well. But as they stray further away from that data, they often break down, as they did in the Apple paper’s more stringent tests.Such limits arguably remain the singlemost important serious weaknessin LLMs.The hope, as always, has been that “scaling” the models by making them bigger, would solve these problems. The new Apple paper resoundingly rebuts these hopes. They challenged some of the latest, greatest, most expensive models with classic puzzles, such as theTower of Hanoi– and found that deep problems lingered. Combined with numerous hugely expensive failures in efforts to build GPT-5 level systems, this is very bad news.The Tower of Hanoi is a classic game with three pegs and multiple discs, in which you need to move all the discs on the left peg to the right peg, never stacking a larger disc on top of a smaller one. With practice, though, a bright (and patient) seven-year-old can do it.WhatApplefound was that leading generative models could barely do seven discs, getting less than 80% accuracy, and pretty much can’t get scenarios with eight discs correct at all. It is truly embarrassing that LLMs cannot reliably solve Hanoi.And, as the paper’s co-lead-author Iman Mirzadeh told me via DM, “it’s not just about ‘solving’ the puzzle. We have an experiment where we give the solution algorithm to the model, and [the model still failed] … based on what we observe from their thoughts, their process is not logical and intelligent”.The new paper also echoes and amplifies several arguments that Arizona State University computer scientist Subbarao Kambhampati has been making about the newly popular LRMs. He has observed that people tend to anthropomorphise these systems,to assume they usesomething resembling “steps a human might take when solving a challenging problem”. And he has previously shown that in fact they have the same kind of problem that Apple documents.If you can’t use a billion-dollar AI system to solve a problem that Herb Simon (one of the actual godfathers of AI)solved with classical(but out of fashion)AI techniques in 1957, the chances that models such as Claude or o3 are going to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) seem truly remote.So what’s the loose thread that I warn you about? Well, humans aren’t perfect either. On a puzzle like Hanoi, ordinary humans actually have a bunch of (well-known) limits that somewhat parallel what the Apple team discovered. Many (not all) humans screw up on versions of the Tower of Hanoi with eight discs.But look, that’s why we invented computers, and for that matter calculators: to reliably compute solutions to large, tedious problems. AGI shouldn’t be about perfectly replicating a human, it should be about combining the best of both worlds; human adaptiveness with computational brute force and reliability. We don’t want an AGI that fails to “carry the one” in basic arithmetic just because sometimes humans do.Whenever people ask me why I actuallylikeAI (contrary to the widespread myth that I am against it), and think that future forms of AI (though not necessarily generative AI systems such as LLMs) may ultimately be of great benefit to humanity, I point to the advances in science and technology we might make if we could combine the causal reasoning abilities of our best scientists with the sheer compute power of modern digital computers.What the Apple paper shows, most fundamentally, regardless of how you define AGI, is that these LLMs that have generated so much hype are no substitute for good, well-specified conventional algorithms. (They also can’t play chess as well as conventional algorithms, can’t fold proteins like special-purpose neurosymbolic hybrids, can’t run databases as well as conventional databases, etc.)What this means for business is that you can’t simply drop o3 or Claude into some complex problem and expect them to work reliably. What it means for society is that we can never fully trust generative AI; its outputs are just too hit-or-miss.One of the most striking findings in the new paper was that an LLM may well work in an easy test set (such as Hanoi with four discs) and seduce you into thinking it has built a proper, generalisable solution when it has not.To be sure, LLMs will continue to have their uses, especially for coding and brainstorming and writing, with humans in the loop.But anybody who thinks LLMs are a direct route to the sort of AGI that could fundamentally transform society for the good is kidding themselves.This essay was adapted from Gary Marcus’s newsletter,Marcus on AIGary Marcus is a professor emeritus at New York University, the founder of two AI companies, and the author of six books, including Taming Silicon ValleyExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionComputingAppleChatGPTcommentShareReuse this content"

But this time, I’ve never felt so afraidNadeine AsbaliSince the riots last summer British Muslims have felt a deep unease in our own countryTue 10 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 04.07 EDTShareHere we are again, debating the right of Muslim women to wear what they want. Last week, the Reform UK MP Sarah Pochin asked the prime minister, Keir Starmer, if he planned to follow other European countries andprohibit burqas.Then the leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, called for bosses to be able toban the burqa in the workplace. Following the example of the former Labour minister Jack Straw, who in 2006sparked the first burqa debateby asking constituents at his surgeries to remove their face coverings, she stated that she does not see constituents at her surgeries if they have their faces covered, “whether it’s a burqa or a balaclava”.These comments from politicians hoping to appease rightwing voters have real repercussions for the safety of Muslim women like me. Muslim women, especially those who wear coverings ranging from the headscarf known as the hijab to the full body and face covering known as the burqa, have become a symbol in UK politics of migration and integration. They – or perhaps the perceived oppressive men in their lives – are outsiders who refuse to live by British values. When politicians call to ban the burqa, they position themselves as defenders of a way of life under threat from outside forces.The timing of this cannot be ignored.Reform, which triumphed at the recent local elections, warns in its manifesto that “unchecked migration has pushed Britain to breaking point”. The Conservatives, keen to claw back any defecting voters, have positioned themselves as equally tough on immigration and integration.When our national leaders parrot catchy soundbites such as “ban the burqa”, what they are really doing is normalising Islamophobia by making it part of mainstream political conversations. Islamophobic incidentsrose by 375%in the week after Boris Johnson called veiled Muslim women “letterboxes” in 2018.As a visibly Muslim woman, I have never felt as afraid as I do right now. Last summer’s far-right riots targeting mosques and calling for Muslims to be taken off the streets are etched into my mind. I was born in this country, it’s my home, yet I can’t shake a feeling of unease.The irony of this debacle is not lost on me. Last time I checked, Britain prided itself in not being the sort of country that told women how to dress. States that do dictate women’s clothing (see: Iran) are vilified as misogynistic and ultra-controlling: the antithesis of the enlightened, liberal west. Why, then, is it OK for the government or corporations in Britain to interfere with the autonomy of women who happen to be Muslim?Of course, some will say that face coverings are inherently misogynistic, and so banning them is about protecting Muslim women. But why should politicians get to decide what is oppressive and what isn’t, without ever really consulting us? It is disingenuous to pretend that Muslim women are uniquely prone to victimhood. Can we truthfully say anything about the way women are expected to live our lives isn’t rooted in patriarchy? Whether it’s the bikini or the push-up bra, miniskirts or high heels, as women we are conditioned to shape our identity under the watchful eye of the male gaze.But I’m sure you’ve heard all of this before, because yet again, here we are: Muslim women defending their right to choose how they exist in British society. What is really being obscured are more pressing issues: inequality, a lack of affordable housing, crumbling public services, a struggling NHS. This was as true in the early 2000s as it is now.Nadeine Asbali is a secondary school teacher in London and the author of Veiled Threat: On Being Visibly Muslim in BritainDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is a symbol of human compassion in a world that has decided to look awayTue 10 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 04.07 EDTShareImagine this: over the weekend, Britain – shocked by the scale of suffering inGaza– decided to bypass international norms and institutions, and used its navy to deliver much-needed food, baby formula and medical supplies to the Gaza Strip’s ports.This, of course, did not happen. Instead, it was left to activists on the Madleen, including Greta Thunberg, to make asymbolic attempt to break the blockadeof aid and raise awareness of a looming “starvation crisis”. In the early hours of Monday morning, the ship was boarded by Israeli soldiers, allegedly in international waters, and the crew were taken to Israeli ports in anticipation of being repatriated. Lawyers for the activists have claimed that this is overreach by the Israeli armed forces, but the crew should consider their treatment light-touch.In 2010, the Israeli militarystormed another aid flotilla and killed 10 activists in the process.Since the news broke, Israel’s propaganda machine has gone into overdrive,dismissing the Madleenas a “selfie yacht”, a line echoed bywestern media outlets. “There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip – they do not involve Instagram selfies,” declared a shamelessIsraeli Foreign Ministry. Israel knows all about those ways, because it has systematically blocked them.It’s worth noting that the Freedom Flotilla Coalition – the movement behind the Madleen – was launched in 2010, 13 years before 7 October. The blockade on the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza has been in place for nearly two decades. As an adviser to the former Israeliprime minister Ehud Olmertput it: “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.”In 2012, theIsraeli newspaper Haaretzpublished a leaked official document in which government officials calculated the minimum number of calories required for a human not to starve. The point: to make life miserable for the people of Gaza without incurring global outrage through mass starvation.A year before 7 October, the World Food Programme warned of the “dire humanitarian situation there”, noting that around half of Gaza’s caged population was “severely food insecure”.In the past 20 months, Israel has ratcheted up the blockade. Even former prime minister Olmert, for decades a member of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, denounced his state for committing grave war crimes as a matter of official policy. On 10 October 2023, for example,Israeli general Ghassan Alian– who headed the Israeli military department supposedly charged with humanitarian aid – declared that the “citizens of Gaza” had collective guilt, and that “human beasts are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza. No electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell – you will get hell.” This was just one of multiple statements of criminal and genocidal intent that left no doubt about the crime to come.Western states chose to ignore these warnings.In March 2024, the then foreign secretary David Cameron wrote a damning letter to Alicia Kearns, a fellow Tory who headed the House of Commons Foreign Affairs committee. He detailed multiple ways that Israel was blocking aid from entering Gaza, including deliberately not opening more land routes, not opening them for long enough and imposing excessive screening requirements. “The main blockers remain arbitrary denials by the government of Israel,” he explained, “and lengthy clearance procedures, including multiple screenings and narrow opening windows in daylight hours.” British-funded aid languished at the border for nearly three weeks waiting for approval, he stated. Yet the British government imposed no sanctions and continued to arm a state it knew was intentionally starving a civilian population.According to ProPublica in 2024, it was revealed that the two foremost US authorities on humanitarian assistance concluded that Israel haddeliberately blockeddeliveries of food and medicine into Gaza. Under US legislation, this should have immediately triggered the suspension of weapons shipments – but the Biden administration did not accept the findings. You may not be aware of either of these reports, because they received precious little coverage from a western media that has deceived its audiences about Israel’s genocidal intent and behaviour.One of the definitions of genocide, according to the 1948 UN convention, is “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”. This is an accurate description of what Israel has been doing in Gaza.It has killed 452aid workers, systematically killed police officers charged with protecting aid, destroyed infrastructure needed to carry humanitarian aid, blocked fuel and water needed to cook food. More than95% of agricultural landhas been rendered unusable by Israeli attacks, 81% of cropland has been damaged and83% of plant lifehas been destroyed. Almost all of itscattle and poultryare dead; milk production is nearly halted.Israel has criminalised Unrwa, Gaza’s main humanitarian agency, and three months ago imposed a total blockade. It then replaced the existing humanitarian structures with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).Its purpose, as Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich declared, was to allow the entry of the “minimum necessary” so that “the world does not stop us and accuse us of war crimes”. Stop what? Well, Smotrich openly declares that Israel will expel all surviving Palestinians from Gaza. Not only does the GHF provide far too little and often unusable aid, but it also set up aid points in the south to deliberately empty Gaza’s north. Israeli troops then repeatedly massacred starving Palestinians, replacing the existing humanitarian structures with what Tory MP Kit Malthouse called “a shooting gallery, an abattoir”.The Madleen did not make it to Gaza’s shores. Yet its crew exposed an obscenity that has repulsed western citizens, who will one day force their governments to cease their complicity – which is why, in the end,Israelwill lose.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He was responding to a furious online backlash directed mostly at the town’s police after they posted a message on social media urging the residents of Santa Fe to show “civility” by not sitting in the streets in the late hours disturbing neighbours.This plea for respect for the public space was hardly a draconian law and order crackdown: it was a reasonably worded reminder. “We know that putting chairs or tables outside the door is a tradition in many towns,” it said, “but public spaces are regulated. If the police ask you to remove them, do so out of respect and in the interests of coexistence.”Unfortunately for the police, it was accompanied by a photograph not of 3am revellers or anyone engaging in antisocial behaviour, but six older women sitting outdoors on plastic garden chairs, enjoying what looks like a peaceful chat. The angry reaction (“Go and arrest drug dealers!”, or “All these women want is a quiet moment with their neighbours. Why don’t you take care of real crimes!”) was a reminder that inSpain, the authorities mess with community rituals involving older people at their peril.Perhaps the reaction also betrayed a sadness that the custom of sitting outdoors chatting, still practised in villages and some small towns, especially in the hottest months, is slowly fading as rural Spain becomesincreasingly depopulated.In cities, you certainly don’t see women or anyone else putting their own chairs on the pavement outside their front doors. But the routine of outdoor conversation and intergenerational use of public space is very much alive.Sitting and talking in public spaces is a tradition that dates back centuries and is closely intertwined with the history of women’s rights in Spain. Women’s search forindependence and common spacesto talk outside the home can be traced to the middle ages – from separate bourgeois parlours to artisan work conducted outdoors. And it was not confined to regions with warmer weather.In León, a province in north-west Spain, people once gathered around the fireplace on bleak midwinter nights for thefilandón, a session of storytelling named after the spinners who worked together while exchanging tales. This cherished oral tradition is now beingrevived in León, with local novelists holding events in nature reserves such as Babia, passing the filandóndown to a new generation. In some villages in northern La Rioja, you still see women chatting as they sew espadrilles outside their shopfronts.It is only natural in the digital age that such ways of living and communing fade, but there is still a strong appreciation in Spain for the value of a neighbourly gathering, wherever it happens. In cities, it might take place in the lobby of an apartment building, often around the doorman. In mine, I find comfort in seeing the same older women and men, often with a dog in their midst, sitting on a bench by the mailbox almost every day. The daily chatter proved very useful during therecent blackout, as neighbours readily shared tips, food and information. One of the regulars is a retired engineer who once worked for a major power company, and he gave us the clearest explanation of how the outrage would be resolved.Thinking of a trip to Barcelona this summer? Beware – here’s what you’ll find | Stephen BurgenRead moreIn town squares, it’s common to see people of all ages sitting and chatting in the same space. Older women on the public benches, children running around them, teenagers kicking a football, all together and not necessarily drinking, as is often the case elsewhere. Summer heatwaves make late-evening gatherings outdoors a natural form of relief. Stepping outside for no particular purpose is often calledtomando el fresco(“taking the breeze”, if you are lucky to catch it).In the biggest Spanish cities, newly pedestrianised areas offer convivial shared outdoor spaces all year round. More modest thanBarcelona’s superblocks, the newly refurbished and pedestrianisedOlavide Squarein central Madrid, for example, has become a model of the ideal public space. It has teenagers playing ping pong, kids and dogs running about, people of all ages reading or scrolling on their phones in deckchairs, occasionally browsing from a public library stand, and of course older women deep in conversation until late. Even in shabbier squares, people of all generations still gather in proximity with ease.What is changing is that Madrid’s conservative local government is increasingly promoting a privatised model of public space, with extended restaurant and bar terraces occupying most of the pavements, leaving little space for people to gather without being obliged to consume something.Respecting public space, as the Santa Fe police requested, means keeping it truly public. And that is key to fostering conversation not just with friends, but with neighbours, casual acquaintances and strangers.Conversation in public, shared spaces has a special power in these polarised, lonely, even dehumanising times. A sense of community requires much more than a few chairs on the pavement, but it is a good place to start.María Ramírez is a journalist and the deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in SpainExplore more on these topicsSpainOpinionOlder peopleEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

But what does that mean for progressives who see the need for real reform?Mon 9 Jun 2025 23.57 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 01.02 EDTShareIn his National Press Club address on Tuesday the prime minister laid down an existential challenge to those who cheered the loudest on election night when Peter Dutton and his miserable crew were confined to the dustbin of history.In making the case that trust in government is underpinned byeconomic stability and keeping election promises, the PM is saying the quiet bit out loud: his government will push back on calls to “show more ambition” in the wake of its thumping win.Setting markers on what he perceives to be the limit to his mandate is, on one level, a legitimate interpretation of the election and a credible template for embedding Labor government for the next decade.In mypost-election column, I argued even this limited mandate is ambitious and wide-ranging: building renewables, new homes and health infrastructure; consolidating the care economy; mediating AI and regulating big tech.Anthony Albanese has an opportunity to build a legacy of real reform. Will he take it? | Julianne SchultzRead moreBut at a time of rolling and intensifying crises in geopolitics, technology, climate and inequality, is it enough to say this is the limit of the government’s work? More profoundly, how can a government determined to occupy the centre ground be shepherded to more ambition?The new government’s approval of the long-term expansion of gas on the North-West Shelf, its neglect of the Uluru statement from the heart and the repercussions of our defence relationship with an unhinged US are causing legitimate angst.It would be understandable and natural to respond to these positions with anger and dissent but in this new environment the traditional political pressure points are not so readily available.Those who dreamed of progressive minority government have been sent to the sidelines. The Greens may have a Senate veto power but this will need to be exercised judiciously lest it become a proxy for frustrating the aforementioned mandate.Add the fact that the Labor left now holds not just the leadership but a majority of cabinet positions, and the institutional mechanisms for prosecuting more progressive policy appear limited.This operating environment lays down real challenges for progressive groups that normally lead the charge, the not-for-profits, member organisations and unions whose leaders areconvening in Old Parliament House this weekto survey the political landscape.Business-as-usual campaigning driven by anger, passion and the demands of funders for quick wins risks marginalising progressives to the fringes of the national debate.To adapt to these new conditions, progressive groups need to confront the situation as dispassionately as the prime minister.First, they need tocome to terms with what the election was really about: a vote for stability against the chaos of Dutton, not a contest between visions of radical change but a contrast of tone and approach.Second, they should look for opportunities to campaign alongside government where there is common ground and common purpose. The rollout of renewable energy in regional Australia is a case in point: that agenda ran the real risk of being sidelined by a lack of community social licence, which was wrongly taken as a given as advocates moved on to the next fight before fully banking the one in from of them.Third, they need to identify the issues that are beyond the current mandate and build long-term strategies to extend the government’s ambitions. To be clear, this does not mean putting the planet, poverty or peace on the backburner. But at the beginning of a cycle where the government has such a strong majority, this ambition needs to be earned not simply demanded.The final lesson is that the vast majority of voters are motivated by their own material needs, not a broader ideological or moral imperative. Building ambition around this reality is critical in securing common cause.It is important that the Albanese government learns the right lessons from its victory, starting with recognising that despite the arithmetic thumping, Labor’s primary vote was lower than Mark Latham’s 2004 disaster.Australia chose the nice guy over the tough guy. But Labor is going to need momentum to meet the challenge | Peter LewisRead moreIt is now easy to forget how fraught the situation was before the final run home, when there was still a real chance that the government would make history as the first one-term government in a century.For too much of its first term it drifted from crisis to crisis, too reactive to the white noise of the Murdoch press and too ready to pick a fight with the Greens as a proof point of its centrist bona fides.It also left it late to build a coherent story about why it was there and what it was trying to achieve. Apart from defending things like Medicare and opposing things like nuclear power, there is still a confusion about what the government is actually there to do.Finally, while the government has the power to pass laws and allocate spending, it cannot do everything. Through the first term its tendency to hoard power left it exposed and isolated. Working more collaboratively with civil society through sharing its mission and embracing friction will only make it more resilient.Ultimately the prime minister is right: his government, like all governments, exists as an expression of the trust of the people. Rewarding that trust by building a shared consensus to tackle our cascading crises is the only credible pathway to securing the lasting change that the moment demands.Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that undertook research for Labor in the last election and conducts qualitative research for Guardian Australia.

Would you help him bring The Jungle Book to life?Brian LoganTue 10 Jun 2025 11.39 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 12.33 EDTShareComedy smash-hits come in all shapes and sizes. You’ve got your standup, your sketch – and then there are those shows in which semi-naked Australians impersonate penguins to dramatise the western literary canon. Such isGarry Starr: Classic Penguinsby 43-year-old goofball Damien Warren-Smith, which delighted Edinburgh last summer, then hoovered up awards on the Australian festival circuit. After winning the prestigious Best Show gong atMelbourne’s Comedy festival(“for me that’s a Commonwealth gold,” says Warren-Smith, “and Edinburgh’s the Olympics”), this unlike-anything-else comedy set is now returning to the UK, picked up byfringe super-producer Francesca (Fleabag) Moodyand expanded for bigger audiences.The show, which animates a bookshelf full of Penguin classics in 60 minutes, is not a complete departure for its host. Yet another graduate of celebrated French clown schoolEcole Philippe Gaulier, Warren-Smith’s first stunt was to showcase every theatre style in under an hour (Garry Starr Performs Everything, 2018), and his second was to bring all of Greek mythology to life in the same timeframe. It’s a simple formula, as he admits: “Choose a highbrow topic that most people know quite a lot about, then just get it wrong – which makes me stupider than everybody else.” Garry, according to his creator, isn’t a character, he’s just “the most enthusiastic but slightly less intelligent version of myself. He’s like me if I had no inhibitions.”In Classic Penguins, that “eternal optimist and over-reacher” turns his attention towards great books. Clad in tailcoat, flippers and alarmingly little else, our lanky host performs one inexplicable stunt onstage after another – then explains them by revealing the title of the next book off his paperback pile.View image in fullscreen‘Edinburgh’s the Olympics’ … Damien Warren-Smith AKA Garry Starr.Photograph: PA Images/Alamy“I was in a Perth bookshop two years ago,” he says, “and happened to notice those beautiful, aesthetically appealing orange and cream spines on the shelf, and the penny dropped. I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s got to be [my next show].’ I called my producer straight away. I then put together a list of over 100 books, and went through it giving them the Garry treatment. What is the one thing I know about this book already? Frankenstein builds a monster, say. And what could Garry get wrong about it?” Watching the show, the pleasure is intense as you puzzle out Garry’s doofus misinterpretation, what bizarre visual gag or literary pun is now unfolding in front of you.But what flips the show from bookish brain-tease into raise-the-roof party-comedy is the involvement of its audience. “I never made a conscious decision to push things as far as I could [with audience participation],” says Warren-Smith, on Zoom from Oz. “But being on my own, I wanted to playwithpeople.” Being on his own wasn’t always the plan: Warren-Smith has variously worked as an actor, and as part of the clown troupe A Plague of Idiots. His solo career began, reluctantly, when they disbanded. “So now, if I had an idea for a scene that needed two people – well, I couldn’t pay someone to be a plant. So I’d just ask audience members to help.” In Classic Penguins, spectators are duly invited to be shot, tied to the floor, to manhandle our naked host, and join him in bringing Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book to very improbable life.That latter scene is one of Warren-Smith’s favourites, for reasons I can’t reveal without spoilers. Another is his Wind in the Willows skit, the “puerile” (his word) content of which you can probably guess. “There’s about 30% of the audience who just can’t control themselves after that.” What concerns its creator, now the show (and his career) is scaling up, is whether he can keep his percentages that high. “When I saw Ricky Gervais in a stadium, it was completely un-thrilling. If the only way to make money is live, and you have to get bigger to do it – or stay smaller and charge more – that doesn’t interest me. I’d rather continue to make work my way and not be famous or wealthy.”I suspect there might be a middle way, for an act – and a show – whose potency certainly won’t be limited to small rooms. That would be good news for Warren-Smith, because “for 45 minutes after every show as Garry, I am just buzzing. Every single show, I have to pinch myself, because when I was an actor I never found that kind of freedom and pleasure.”But if all else fails, Classic Penguins may have opened up other professional avenues. “On the last night in Edinburgh, this woman came up to me and said, ‘Have you read all these books? Do you read a lot? Would you be interested in being a judge for the Booker prize?’ I was like, ‘Aah, yeah, sure. Drop me an email!’ Thinking this was maybe a crazy person.” He’s since been told it was legit. “And had I not dismissed it quite so much,” he says, just a little wistfully, “maybe I could be a Booker judge by now …”Classic Penguins is atSoho theatre, London, from 14-26 July, then atUnderbelly George Square, Edinburgh, from 30 July to 24 AugustExplore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festivalFestivalsEdinburgh festival 2025PenguinPublishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The push to preserve the fantastical works of ‘Wigan’s Gaudi’Kevin Duffy was an eccentric who sculpted everything from a mini pub to a lion’s den to a Tudor village. But after his death, the future of this outsider artist’s work is in doubtGeorge Francis LeeTue 10 Jun 2025 11.42 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 11.44 EDTShareKevin Duffy’s fairytale was born on a dumping ground. Nobody else could see it, but to him, the overgrown remains of a 1920s bowling green promised untold potential. It was there he spent the last decades of his life creating castles, characters, and crude Tudor facades from chicken wire, cement, and anything else he could salvage, across the land surrounding his Wigan bungalow, spilling over into the family garden centre.Not many people have heard of Duffy – who died in September at 79 – or his work, all housed at his now-closed family business, Rectory Nurseries. But first reactions are often the same: bewilderment followed by unbound wonder and curiosity. After four decades, Duffy’s kingdom is full of nooks and pathways, chapels and dens, monsters and myths – each discovery promising another just around the corner. The Rectory features not just its own miniature pub, but a lion’s den as well as a stalactite-encrusted cave of sirens. One section hosts a small Tudor village, another a crowded antique shop where none of the items are for sale. It’s like wandering into a theme park.View image in fullscreenUnder threat … the sculpture of Mr Darcy.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIain Jackson, a writer and architect who interviewed Duffy for an outsider art publication called Raw Vision in 2008, admits Duffy’s work couldn’t be shown in a gallery, but says, “he still did it; he still had something to say – he was the real deal”. Yet along with his legacy as a much-loved outsider artist, Duffy has left a 1,200 sq foot property full of sculptures, found objects and oddities that nobody is quite sure what to do with.The land that the Rectory sits on is being forced into a sale, leading many locals to ask why Duffy’s work can’t be given protection. An idiosyncratic ground-floor rented flat in Birkenhead known asRon’s Placebecame what was thought to be the first outsider art to get Grade II-listed status last year. But today the Rectory lies stagnant; the gates closed to the public, as vines and trees encroach the Renaissance follies like a post-apocalyptic Portmeirion.“Eccentric” is the word Duffy’s nephew Chris uses to describe him. Duffy variously performed in a husband-and-wife musical duo, worked in a cotton mill, had an encyclopedic knowledge of gardening, and played the left-handed banjo. In the evenings when his family gathered, wearing his cowboy’s neckerchief, he would drink and play music long into the night, outpacing even his most spirited nephews.His eldest sister, Sheila, says he had been a charismatic child, but other than an appreciation for architecture, he wasn’t an obviously creative type. Instead, Duffy grew up to be a grafter, his hands tough like old leather. In around 1978 he started leasing the ground for £1 a year and cleaning it up, eventually building his bungalow in 1991, while selling cuttings for plants and slowly building up his nursery business.Duffy – who has sometimes been called “Wigan’s Gaudi” by visitors to the site – only started making art after Boxing Day in 1994, when his wife, Pat, died suddenly. A stone monument was erected in the garden in her memory, and decades of unrelenting creativity followed. Grief and remembrance feel enshrined in the Rectory. The all-faith chapel – which was originally built tongue-in-cheek from old lavatory bricks with an altar made of scaffolding planks – became a genuine place of reverence and, judging by the amount of touching prayer messages pinned up, was giving the 17th-century Holy Trinity church down the road a run for its money.View image in fullscreen‘The real deal’ … Kevin Duffy at Rectory Nurseries in 2015.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianDuffy’s works weren’t built to stand as individual pieces – instead he used his home-cum-garden centre as an ever-changing exhibition that people, and mostly himself, could enjoy. Layer after layer of strange objects created a magnum opus in over a hundred intertwined sections: a hand-sculpted Mr Darcy; the gravestone of a 58-year-old donkey; a shrine to his late wife and only son Carl, who died aged 56 in 2023.The creations were tied to whatever materials were freely available (or donated) at a given moment. Like the seedlings that fuelled his business, Duffy had a knack for creating something from nothing – “building a lot without buying a thing” as he put it. He once said in avideo made abouthim: “Is it art or is it just a pile of rubbish?”Regardless of the answer, Duffy’s wonderland may yet end up in the bin, and his work is just the latest in a long history of outsider art under threat. From paintingsmistaken for trashto artworks being saved from skips andending up in the Saatchi, the preservation of outsider art often depends on the taste and perseverance of a tenacious few.View image in fullscreenKevin Duffy’s fantasy Tudor village at Rectory Nurseries in 2015.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe loss of its creator looms over the Rectory. “The fact that Kevin is no longer with us is hard enough,” says Sheila, “but having to sell all his years of work just as a commercial venture is very sad.” The family, who don’t own the land, hope that someone will buythe propertyand keep at least some of Kevin’s work. Ideally they’d like it all preserved, but they’re being realistic.After all, as Chris explains, perfection and preservation was never his uncle’s goal. In fact, Duffy enjoyed the look of ivy creeping across his faux battlements, which undoubtedly inflicted structural damage over the years. His bottomless reserves of energy meant the layout of the Rectory could change on a whim of creative inspiration. A greenhouse easily became a village, a potting shed became a chapel.Without Duffy, the Rectory is still changing, as nature begins to reclaim it. Conifers invade the boundaries and ivy multiplies, while sculptures gradually forget their painted colours. It’s a stark reminder of time’s passing, and photos from 10 years ago show a tidier, prouder environment.To some, a bid to conserve Duffy’s visionary environment may be a folly of its own. “I don’t think we have to preserve absolutely everything,” says Jackson. “It existed for a moment. And those people that saw it had the luck and the privilege and that authenticity. There’s a risk of it becoming museum-ified.” But Chris is hopeful about his uncle’s legacy, even so. “No matter what happens to the garden in the future, our Kevin has left his own unique mark on the world and the pictures and memories will be forever.”Explore more on these topicsArtSculptureInstallationNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It was 31 years since he had released an album of new material, Ain’t But the One Way, which he had abandoned midway through, vanishing completely from the studio and leaving the producer Stewart Levine to patch together what he could. It was longer still since he had produced any music that was even vaguely close to the standard he had set himself in the late 60s and early 70s – a six-year period bookended by the release of the groundbreaking single Dance to the Music in 1967 and his last truly classic album, Fresh, in 1973 – when he could justifiably have claimed to have changed the face of soul music. Sly and the Family Stone, the multiracial band he had formed in 1966, released a string of classic singles in that time: not just Dance to the Music, but also I Want to Take You Higher, Everyday People, Stand!, Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), Family Affair, If You Want Me to Stay.By contrast, his most recent release, 2011’s I’m Back! Family and Friends, was a desultory collection of rerecordings of old hits, terrible remixes (a dubstep version of Family Affair!) and three new songs. Occasionally, something flickered in the original tracks, a faint trace of his former greatness, but they sounded suspiciously like unfinished demos. It felt of a piece with the handful of gigs he had played with various former members of the Family Stone a few years before: nights where something would spark fleetingly, mixed with disasters such as their 2010 appearance at Coachella, where Stone stopped and started songs at random and launched into a rant about his former manager thatsubsequently occasioned a lawsuit.But, in 2013, a lavish retrospective box set, Higher!, was due out. It told Stone’s story from his early days, when he was a staff producer at Autumn Records in San Francisco, occasionally knocking out a novelty dance track or two under his own name, to 1976’s Family Again, a single that attempted to recreate the astonishing sound of the Family Stone in full flight. But there was no question of him promoting it: his interactions with the media seemed largely restricted to appearances on the gossip website TMZ, whose reporters would doorstep him – at the mobile home where he apparently lived full-time – after a cocaine possession charge, or a lurid report that he was homeless.View image in fullscreenThe US’s first major multiracial band …(from left)Greg Errico, Rose Stone, Sly Stone, Cynthia Robinson, Freddie Stone, Jerry Martini and Larry Graham of Sly and the Family Stone circa 1968.Photograph: SBMG Archive/Sony MusicInstead, I spoke to former members of the Family Stone, whohad incredible tales to tellof the glory days, when the band single-handedly shifted the compass of black American music. They melded psychedelia with rhythm and blues and gospel, helping to usher in one of soul music’s most fertile periods. Artists previously beholden to the wishes of their record labels – Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder among them – felt empowered to strike out on their own artistic paths; it prompted Miles Davis to change tack and record the epochal fusion album Bitches Brew.They also had stories of the consternation caused by the very existence of the US’s first major multiracial band – or, as the trumpeter and vocalist Cynthia Robinson put it, by “seeing different races having fun together on stage”. Just the sight of her walking down the street with the band’s long-haired white saxophonist, Jerry Martini, enraged onlookers, she said: “We had to run! We hadn’t even said anything to them!”I had read Joel Selvin’s eye-popping 1998 oral history of the band, filled with lurid detail and the testimony of former members bitterly airing grievances about their fall from grace. Racked by drug problems and intraband discord, the band’s career had slumped to such an extent that, by 1975, their final show at New York’s 6,000-seat Radio City Music Hall attracted barely 1,000 people. But clearly something had changed: the striking thing about the interviews I did was the awe and reverence in which they now held their former leader. “He affected my life second only to God,” said Martini, who in Selvin’s book had been the most critical of the lot. “Why don’t people try to love him for what he did? He had so much to offer the music business and the world in general. Why is everybody concentrated on drugs or this or that?”View image in fullscreenThe end of an era … Sly and the Family Stone on stage in May 1973.Photograph: Sony BMG/Getty ImagesIt was already shaping up to be a fascinating feature when I got word that Stone wanted to talk to me. I didn’t really believe it and it didn’t seem as if it was going to happen: the negotiations to bring him to the phone went on for weeks and I had a holiday booked. With nothing seemingly happening, I packed my bags and departed for a family-friendly hotel in Cornwall with my wife and kids.We were there when I got a message: call this number; Sly will talk to you tonight. Incredibly, the only place in the hotel where I could get a signal was in the playground, perched on the edge of a bouncy castle. But that didn’t really matter, because, when I rang the number, I got an answering machine: “You called. Or did you? We’ll call back.” There was no option to actually leave a message. I kept trying. Nothing.Finally, 12 hours after the appointed time, he picked up. I explained who I was and why I was calling and he told me, in no uncertain terms, to go and fuck myself: “I don’t give a fuck what you heard, I ain’t telling you anything. You guys send me some money, fair’s fair, I work. I don’t give a fuck about anything.” Then he put the phone down.View image in fullscreen‘He had so much to offer the music business and the world in general’ … Stone poses for a portrait session in 1972.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesThat, I assumed, was that: I had been told to fuck off by one of music’s true, unequivocal geniuses while sitting on a bouncy castle just outside Newquay, which I supposed was a unique experience in itself.The next day, I was told to try again. Back to the bouncy castle I went. Presumably, the record label behind the box set had stumped up some cash, because this time he was charm itself: putting on an English accent when he picked up – “to whom am I speaking?” – and describing at length his plan to form a backing band entirely comprising musicians with albinism, which was a little unexpected, but, the way he explained it, weirdly in keeping with the Family Stone’s initial message of peace and unity. “To me, albinos are the most legitimate minority group of all. All races have albinos. If we all realise that we’ve all got albinos in our families, it’s going to take away from the ridiculous racial tension, if you’re black or you’re white, blah blah blah.”He talked about the mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles, to which Sly and the Family Stone had moved in 1969 and where he made his 1971 masterpiece There’s a Riot Goin’ On, a bleak, experimental album that could be the sound of the utopian hippy dream curdling into something darker, or an expression of the mood in their new home, where drug use was rampant: guns, paranoia, dangerous dogs and a coterie of highly dubious “bodyguards” were much in evidence. A little unexpectedly, he described life there as “beautiful”, although he did concede that the band’s bassist, Larry Graham, had fled the band in fear for his life. “But he’s a great bass player and I figured that when he realises I’m not going to kill him, he’ll be back,” he chuckled.He talked about playing Woodstock, the gig that more than any other sealed Sly and the Family Stone’s ascendancy. By all accounts, they stole the show, taking the stage at 4am and rousing the audience from their sleeping bags with an electrifying performance. But his main memory, he said, was feeling “scared”, intimidated by the size of the crowd and the presence backstage of Jimi Hendrix: “I knew my place. Just to be around Jimi Hendrix … shit. I didn’t want to be running my mouth off.”At the time, I took that as modesty, but I thought about it again, years later, when I saw Questlove’s superb documentarySly Lives! (AKA The Burden of Black Genius), which convincingly posited the theory that its subject’s increasingly uncontrollable drug use and reputation for turning up to gigs late, or not at all, was at least partly down to insecurity and crippling stage fright.View image in fullscreenStone in London in 1973.Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty ImagesStill, his mood was upbeat – he said he had thousands of new songs and that he wanted to “maintain stability” in order that they might be released – until he suddenly cut me off. “Have I talked to you enough now? I’ve got to go to the bathroom. You asked me about regrets,” he said, with a wheezy laugh. “If I don’t take a big shit now, I’ll regret that.”And that was that: 20 minutes in the company of the one of the most enigmatic and confounding figures in pop history. The stuff about albinism got picked up by lot of other news outlets when the article came out, but none of Stone’s thousands of new songs ever saw the light of day. He more or less vanished again for a decade after the interview, save for reports of his protracted legal battle to recover millions in missing royalty payments. He was awarded $5m (£3.3m) by a California court in 2015.View image in fullscreen‘Why don’t people try to love him for what he did?’ Stone performing in July 2007.Photograph: Joelle Diderich/EPAAnd then there was a sudden, deeply unexpected flurry of activity. Questlove had not just made a documentary, but was releasing a Stone autobiography via his publishing imprint Auwa Books. Stone was putatively drug-free at last: not for the first time, a doctor had told him that, unless he stopped smoking crack, he was going to die; he had finally heeded the advice and his daughter Sylvette Phunne Robinsonand his new manager, Arlene Hirschkowitz, had taken it upon themselves to shoo away his umpteen dealers from his home in LA. In 2023,I spoke to him again– or rather I didn’t speak to him. In 2013, his voice had been a rasp, hollowed out by decades of fast living; now, he was 80 and too ill to do interviews at all, except by email: “I have trouble with my lungs, trouble with my voice, trouble with my hearing and trouble with the rest of my body, too,” he wrote.‘I never lived a life I didn’t want to live’: Sly Stone on addiction, ageing and changing music for everRead moreClearly, things had changed: there was no lengthy period of negotiation about the interview, no demands for money, just a series of answers that arrived in my inbox 24 hours after I had sent the questions, at least one of which he took upon himself to correct factually. The answers were reflective, thoughtful and occasionally a little wistful – he was no longer able to make music, he said, but could “still hear music in my mind” – and proud of his musical legacy and vast influence: “I was always happy if someone took the things I was doing and they liked them enough to want to do them on their own.”They were also noticeably light on regrets. He conceded he probably should have got clean sooner, but equally, he said: “I never lived a life I didn’t want to live.” It was an intriguing corrective to the idea that his career amounted to a tragedy: six years of genius followed by decades of chaos and disappointment. Perhaps Stone could have done more, but perhaps he had already done it. He achieved more in those six years than most artists achieve in their lifetime, making music of such quality and originality, such power and funkiness, that you suspect it will be played for the rest of time. If there is anything even remotely like it in the thousands of tracks he amassed in his later years, that is just a bonus.Explore more on these topicsSly StonefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But on her fourth album, it’s more pronounced than ever: the tracks are rooted in Bahraini wedding poems and in fijiri, the songs sung by pearl fishers around the Persian Gulf. The results are enthralling: soloing that feels alternately yearning and exuberant, rich and emotive melodies, the sound – big on vibraphone and electric piano – regularly strafed with fizzing electronics. It’s an album to lose yourself in.Alexis PetridisAnnie and the Caldwells – Can’t Lose My (Soul)A family band who have spent the best part of 40 years honing their God-fearing blend of gospel, funk, disco, southern soul and R&B,Annie and the Caldwellswere once Mississippi’s best-kept secret. They break cover with an album recorded live (although without an audience) in a church in their home town of West Point. You don’t have to share the Caldwells’ faith to find the songs on Can’t Lose My (Soul) life-affirming, their message of hope both infectious and timely. This music is tough, powerful and tightly played, but still raw, blessed with incredible vocals and almost telepathic interplay between the musicians.Read the full review.APArchitects – The Sky, the Earth & All BetweenView image in fullscreenArchitects performing in 2024.Photograph: Katja Ogrin/RedfernsThe British metalcore band made their masterpiece with their 11th album, a triumph of production and pop melody as well as cathartic lyric writing. Each song is its own burning exoplanet of sound, heaving with multitracked detail from granite-shearing drums to floating layers of ambience above, as frontman Sam Carter casts a nihilist’s eye over ravaged psyches and social discord – while getting in a couple of jabs at Architects’ own fanbase.Ben Beaumont-ThomasAya – Hexed!‘Chasing a high through rave music got dark’: Aya on hexes, Huddersfield and her hardcore horror electronicsRead moreAs she explained to us in March, Aya Sinclair’s second album of hardcore electronics is an interrogation of her youth in the north-west, grappling with her queerness, gender identity, panic attacks and substance use. As her voice goes from manic to calm, and breakcore or donk beats collapse into noise, reality seems to get right up in your face then slip from your grip. These tracks bounce and fall like an old tyre down a hillside, and Aya moves with them, chattering one of the best British lyric sheets in years – full of tight rhyme schemes, double meanings, northern slang and joy in the plasticity of language.BBTBad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosThere are worried discussions on social media that there are no good contenders for a 2025 song of the summer – but there’s an hour-long album of them here from Bad Bunny. Latin America’s biggest music star leans even harder into his Puerto Rican heritage: as well as making plenty of reggaeton, he samples classic salsa and creates entirely new songs in that style; adds the scrape of a güiro here or a guitar-led bolero there; and turns DtMF, a song in Puerto Rico’splenagenre, into a mega-streaming smash. Spanish speakers may spota series of semi-veiled political lyrics– but in his vocal tone alone, he still expresses hurt and disappointment better than arguably anyone in pop today.BBTBon Iver – Sable, Fable‘Have the courage to walk away’: Bon Iver on romance, retirement and his rapturous new recordRead moreJustin Vernon has been many things over the course of his career – the rustic singer-songwriter of For Emma, Forever Ago; the Auto-Tune-drenched electronic experimentalist of 22, a Million; a collaborator who provides the unlikely link between Taylor Swift and Swamp Dogg. But, as much as it’s presented as a companion to his stark indie-folk EP Sable (included as a prelude-like first disc), Fable is ultimately an R&B album, brightly hued and poppy even during its most out-there moments: the backing of Day One is lurching and disruptive, but the melody is a killer.Read the full review.APJefre Cantu-Ledesma – Gift SongsNo record this year will have a more apposite title: the five pieces of the Zen priest and hospice worker’s latest record are soothing balms born of the sensitive interplay between Cantu-Ledesma and his new ensemble. The 20-minute opener The Milky Sea sounds like moonlight hitting water, a dappled conjuring of brightness and depth between pianist Omer Shemesh, drummer Booker Stardrum and cellist Clarice Jensen. The three-part eponymous suite comprises patient, open-hearted sketches and a sense of the players in the room together. But pretty much any sense of delineation between instrument and person dissolves on River That Flows Two Ways, a softly ecstatic meditation of pump organ and droning cello that overflows one’s field of perception to drown out life’s hurts for nine minutes.Laura SnapesErika de Casier – LifetimeView image in fullscreenSpellbinding melody … Erika de Casier.Photograph: Amy PeskettTo immerse in Erika De Casier’s surprise-released fourth album feels like slipping into an infinity pool: her down tempo seductions brim with boundless, limpid luxury and possibility. Writing and producing everything for the first time, the Danish-Portuguese musician’s touchstones here are Sade, William Orbit-era Madonna and Janet Jackson. While the sultry beats and period-specific dial tones are on point, Lifetime transcends homage thanks to De Casier’s innovative vision: the celestial rave synths that glimmer through Seasons; how Two Thieves disintegrates from chilly Y2K futurism to dank, time-warped dub; contrasting the immaculate melody of Delusional with a whinnying horn sampled from Insane in the Brain. Almost every song, in fact, has a spellbinding melody: highlight You Can’t Always Get What You Want has a little of Pure Shores in its tender conciliation.LSDestroyer – Dan’s Boogie“I’m into it / If you’reinto it,” Dan Bejar sings on Sun Meet Snow, the wink heavy with indeterminate intimation. Dyed-in-the-wool Destroyer fans may take it as an acknowledgment of Bejar’s commitment to the literary absurdism and sybaritic production that the Canadian songwriter knows we love so well. Dan’s Boogie is another masterclass in it, paring back the dancefloor precision of 2022’s Labyrinthitis for the haunted opulence of Bologna, which seems to reverberate across the empty marble floors of a deserted hotel; the title track’s decadently spiralling arpeggios knocking his rakish lounge act off their piano stool; the darkly manic power pop of Hydroplaning Off the Edge of the World. By “into it”, Bejar may also mean the infinite beauty and ugliness in the world, which he can’t ever look away from and can’t stop showing us: “The sun mostly rises,” he sings on The Ignoramus of Love. “A great golden spike through the heart of the world.”Read the full review.LSDjrum – Under Tangled SilenceProducer Felix Manuel’s crazily ambitious third album is a masterclass of detail and vision, an insatiable swarm of classical piano into tabla and breakcore, all presented as a seamless mix. It warrants the full-hour, headphones-on listening experience, but the many textural highlights along the way include the intent tabla, booming drums and bassy slurps of L’Ancienne, the hyper-kinetic kalimba and blown-out breaks of Three Foxes Chasing Each Other and Sycamore’s torrid rotor blade whirl.LSEdward Skeletrix – Museum MusicSome listeners interpreted the US rapper’s 30-track double album as a satire on hollow trap music, while others found it just plain empty. The lyrics are often dumb, even wilfully horrible at times – but they’re hardly presented as aspirational, and with a slurred melodic flow over corroded-motherboard beats, Skeletrix conjures some terrifically bleak moods. The result is like an album from the “rage rap” generation of Playboi Carti and Ken Carson that’s been burned out and left to drift.BBTJohn Glacier – Like a RibbonOne track on the pseudonymous London rapper’s debut album opens with the words “Since I came to Earth …” It fits: there’s something very otherworldly about the sound of Like a Ribbon. It inhabits a strange and fascinating territory somewhere between UK rap, grime, lo-fi alt-rock, abstract electronica and bass music. Its author floats through it, her voice a deadpan mumble, her lyrics a stream of consciousness: you occasionally feel less like you’re listening to her than eavesdropping. It’s remarkably original and completely enrapturing.Read the full review.APHorsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenGentle melancholy … Chicago indie Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeThe cover of the Chicago indie trio’s second album echoes a classic quilting patch, the eight-point star. Produced by Cate Le Bon, the pared back Phonetics On and On creates a similar kind of simple piecework to beautiful effect, turning gorgeous miniatures from rumbling bass, splayed guitar and discordant violin that owes much to the Raincoats and the Velvets. Their spindly, rickety sound has its edges sanded by their casual tunefulness and gentle melancholy, with fragmentary lyrics that seem to trace a surreptitious search for comfort and fulfilment: “Shepherd wants to drive a flower truck / ‘Cause it smells nice and everyone’s happy,” as they sing, with gnomic loveliness (and no trace of twee), on Rock City.Read the full review.LSEiko Ishibashi – Antigone‘Anger compels me forward’: Drive My Car composer Eiko Ishibashi on evil, experimentation and exploding genreRead moreAfter a couple of soundtracks with Ryusuke Hamaguchi (Drive My Car, Evil Does Not Exist) and some avant garde releases, the Japanese composer-songwriter returns to relatively straightforward songwriting and reaches a new peak of sophistication. Over pattering jazz drums, her decadently rich and symphonic arrangements are never leaden or predictable; digital and analogue sound sources flow together like freshwater meeting the sparkling sea. Even if you don’t understand Japanese, Ishibashi’s lounge-bar singing evokes so much: there’s profound melancholy, tempered with a touch of happy resignation, as well as awed wonder.BBTJapanese Breakfast – For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women)View image in fullscreenShifting … Japanese Breakfast’s lead singer, Michelle Zauner.Photograph: Pak BaeMichelle Zauner’s fourth album represents a distinct shift: it’s her first recorded in a professional studio, with indie super-producer Blake Mills – of Fiona Apple and John Legend fame – at the controls. The results are romantic and lush – orchestrations that lean towards baroque pop on single Orlando in Love and 60s easy listening (Little Girl); adding a Cure-like swirl to the sound of her band on Honey Water. The songs, meanwhile, are great: pensive and questioning, at one remove from the pop-facing sound of 2021’s Jubilee, but no less effective.Read the full review.APJasmine.4.T – You Are the MorningJasmine Cruikshank’s debut album attracted attention for being produced by all three members of Boygenius and released on Phoebe Bridgers’ Saddest Factory label, but it doesn’t really need the celebrity endorsement: You Are the Morning stands entirely on its own merits, revealing Cruikshank to be a fantastic songwriter. Her brand of alt-rock touches on Elliott Smith, Adrianne Lenker and Daniel Johnston, as well as 90s slacker grunge on Elephant and the standout (and Bridgers duet) Guy Fawkes Tesco Dissociation. The lyrics deal with her experience of coming out as a trans woman with unflinching candour, its mood shifting from heartbreaking to utterly joyful.APKin’Gongolo Kiniata – KiniataLike the legendary Konono No 1 before them, Kin’Gongolo Kiniata are testament to the sheer resourcefulness of Kinshasa’s musicians. Its members variously play a homemade one-string guitar, two-string bass and a xylophone fashioned out of discarded plastic bottles (played with a pair of flip-flops); their drummer’s kit features a broken television instead of a bass drum. And, like Konono No 1, the noise they make is visceral and utterly electrifying: a kind of fuzzed-out, wah pedal-heavy punk-funk Afropop, frequently delivered at warp speed, with call-and-response lyrics (in Lingala). It sounds thrillingly evocative of teeming, bustling city life.APskip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

It’s as good a mission statement for DJ Koze’s sprawling vision as any. As the Hamburg producer floats from Japanese folk song to Teutonic balladry and ecstatic psychedelia – all rendered with Koze’s typically iridescent detail and cheekiness – the self-styled Talented Mr Tripley’s guiding ethos for the journey seems to be nothing but radiant appreciation for beauty in whatever form it may take. And if that feels a little woo-woo for your tastes, the pedal-to-the-metal breakbeat of Brushcutter and rainforest rave of Buschtaxi find their own kind of purity in the transcendence of obliteration.Read the full review.LSNao – JupiterThe “sister album” to 2018’s Grammy and Mercury prize-nominated Saturn has been a long time coming – partly because Nao diverted into making her guitar-heavy response to Covid and its accompanying privations, 2021’s And Then Life Was Beautiful, partly because she has been struggling with chronic fatigue syndrome. But the concise 33 minutes of Jupiter are entirely worth the wait: warm, sensual optimistic, densely packed with great songs that variously touch on R&B, disco, Afrobeats and even a touch of the “wonky funk” style with which she first attracted attention.APPerfume Genius – GloryPerfume Genius: ‘I want to feel extremes – but I’m not as self-destructive now’Read moreThere’s a sense in which Mike Hadreas’s seventh album as Perfume Genius feels like a culmination, a collection on which you can hear aspects of all the musical personae he’s inhabited over the years – from the stark confessional singer-songwriter mode of his debut Learning, to the synth-pop of 2014’s Too Bright to the left-field Americana of 2020’s acclaimed Set My Heart on Fire Immediately. He remains an impressively unique songwriting voice throughout, whether fantasising about being kidnapped on In a Row, or musing about what it is to be an ageing gay man on the title track. Glory is experimental and deep yet immediate with it – the Aldous Harding collaboration No Front Teeth really hits. It may well be Hadreas’s best album to date.Read the full review.APPinkPantheress – Fancy ThatFor all the gags about her slender track lengths, good luck keeping up with UK producer PinkPantheress on all 20 minutes and nine tracks of her garage-addled new mix tape. She lassos jungle, emo and samples spanning Basement Jaxx to Sugababes and Panic! at the Disco into a hungry, playful hyperlapse trip through a night out. High on an unruly strain of weed and heady flirtation, she spins the ecstasy into a stupid amount of addictive, sugary choruses. Although Pink broke out as a bedroom producer on TikTok, she – as Smerz do below – makes an unarguable case for goingoutout and letting life happen to you.Read the full review.LSTell us your favourite music album of 2025 so farRead morePloy – It’s Later Than You ThinkThat title carries with it a whiff of Anthropocene-era doom – but mostly the cheery sense that you’ve been lost in dancefloor reverie for hours. Ploy, AKA UK producer Sam Smith, has been putting out releases across UK underground labels such as Hessle Audio and Timedance for a decade now, and the joyous Afro-Latin house on his second album (released by Dekmantel) should be rinsed over the festival season. When in Room rides a rolling groove but frequently rears up in alarm with a digital whinny; Stringz has a weird melody that spelunks its way through a series of K-holes; the title track’s marimba line will rightly be bellowed by topless lads in cross-body bags.BBTAddison Rae – AddisonThe year’s best new pop superstar worships at the altar of Britney and Madonna, has drawn adoration – and collaborations – from Charli xcx and Arca and channels the most evanescent end of Lana Del Rey’s catalogue (plus the non-stop blue jeans/short skirts references) into transcendent dance-pop that’s perfect for this downtempo moment. Her long-awaited debut feels just as sumptuous and luxe as the spoils the 24-year-old Louisianan sings about: while she’s often dissolving into a sort of ecstasy at the prospect of pleasure, the production twists her reveries into unexpected shapes, with incredibly effective key changes and mutant bass lines.LSSherelle – With a VengeanceView image in fullscreenSherelle.Photograph: Sarah Louise BennettIn a world that feels relentless, even galloping out of control, British dance star Sherelle seems determined to find a positive in all that brutal forward motion. Her 160bpm style encompasses Chicago footwork, British jungle and transatlantic techno, and her skill is in maintaining the sci-fi strangeness of those genres while making them as broadly appealing as a dance-chart banger.Read the full review.BBTSmerz – Big City Life‘Rethink it all!’ Why is one Danish school producing nearly every cool alt-pop star?Read moreThe Norwegian duo’s second album feels like both an insider’s guide to a killer night out – they’ve got the skinny on the gossip, fashion, swagger, the “art-school gang” who won’t join the fun – and a dare to keep up with Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt. They deliver their dry observations in side-eye mutters and conspiratorial singsong, loaded enough to make you worry about what they really think aboutyouroutfit and drink of choice; just the way they sing “feisty!” on a song of the same name is unsettling. The instrumentation is similarly uneasy, all captivatingly weird, insular bops that jolt with stabs of treated piano. The tongue-in-cheek vibe might get a bit hollow were it not for how deeply they’re yearning to make a real connection out on the tiles: “I want something huge to hit me / Something out of time,” they sing on Street Style. In You Got Time and I Got Money – a gorgeous devotional drunk on the strings of Bitter Sweet Symphony – they’ve got it.LSLos Thuthanaka – Los ThuthanakaAnyone invested in the potential of the electric guitar needs to hear this overwhelming album by the Bolivian-American sibling duo of Chuquimamani-Condori (FKA Elysia Crampton) and Joshua Chuquimia Crampton. The latter’s riffs are thick smears of raunchy distortion or clearly chirrupping bird calls, played over his sister’s shuffling rhythms and a dense thicket of samples. The final half-hour, across three mind-blowing tracks, pushes you into the heavens and leaves you there, gasping blissfully on a cloud. (Note that it’s only available on Bandcamphere.)BBTWilliam Tyler – Time Indefinite‘I don’t want to retreat any more’: William Tyler on grief, alcoholism and his healing new albumRead moreTyler’s music was once expansive, pushing Americana and krautrock towards transcendence. The Nashville guitarist’s fifth solo album embodies the inverse of that impulse, existing in a staticky, spiralling state of collapse as tape loops and small guitar refrains melt together. It’s largely personal: Tyler made the album while seeking treatment for alcoholism and confronting the limiting personal myths that he had constructed around himself. But it’s hard not to hear this charred, beautiful record – made by a great buff of American history – as a eulogy for his country.LSVenturing – GhostholdingThe US musician Jane Remover released a stunning album in April under her main name, entitled Revengeseekerz: ultra-compressed glitchcore-trap that felt like being hosed down with jagged pixels. Even better is this album from a month prior under her Venturing alias, which is a total stylistic shift: alt-rock lit up by a soulfully overdriven guitar tone, and somewhat evocative of midwest emo. On Recoil, though, she claims to “hate every emo song”, and fair enough – these vignettes of love and youth are sung with breezy confidence and sly amusement, so different from emo’s earnestness.BBTWolfacejoeyy – CupidR&B vocals and spartan rap production have dovetailed in the “sexy drill” sound of recent years, and this is the subgenre’s finest full-length alongside last year’s Cash Cobain album Play Cash Cobain. Wolfacejoeyy’s lower register is a bit reminiscent of Drake in hurt-boyfriend mode, but in his higher range he knocks out a series of perfect pop-R&B melodies that flutter like pink-penned butterflies on a teenage diary. It’s quotable – “I’m sexy and alone in this club, what the fuck?” he croons on Late to the Party, amusingly crestfallen – and the production is excellent, including baile funk touches on Ronaldinho.BBTBilly Woods – GolliwogDavid Attenborough, weed and ‘American apartheid’: the awesome mind of rapper Billy WoodsRead moreYou wouldn’t necessarily have expected one of the best hip-hop albums of the year so far to be an abstract take on the rap subgenre of horrorcore, but Billy Woods’s Golliwog – a dramatic about-turn from 2023’s approachable Maps – is just that. Daunting, difficult, strafed with noise and queasy jazz and soundtrack samples, it’s occasionally harrowing listening (as on Waterproof Mascara, where Woods’s vocals are backed by the sound of a woman sobbing). But it’s also very compelling in the way it blends gothic horror with current events, touching on illegal immigration and financial turmoil. Extreme music for extreme times.Read the full review.APYHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsTalking of extremes: this New York-via-Philly band’s 21-minute debutsoundssickly, full of slurry and clatter that stretches and contracts; skittish and nimble thanks to drummer Sam Pickard’s rototom-heavy kit, which keeps their deranged punk-funk perpetually airborne rather than grounded. Singer Zack Borzone – if you can label him so conventionally – sounds as if he’s wrenching himself apart, singing through electric shocks, crying out hoarsely. There are no choruses, just the ceaseless lurch of incessant mutation. Their closest comparison might be Ireland’s Gilla Band and their incredible 2022 album Most Normal: both dissect rock with the grimly visceral lens of David Cronenberg and offer up an ooze it’s hard not to want to roll about in.Read the full review.LSShare your favouriteYou can tell us your favourite album of the year so far using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Why are deities such as Hermes and the ‘half-blood’ Percy Jackson having a moment in musical theatre?Arifa AkbarTue 10 Jun 2025 09.39 EDTShareAncient Greek dramas have long thrived on the West End stage. In recent times: Sophie Okonedo’s electrifyingMedea, Brie Larson’s high-wireElektraand Mark Strong’s smoothly politicalOedipus. But the likes of Hades and Eurydice are less often found belting out big numbers alongside a dancing ensemble. Until now, it would seem. Mythological musicals are on the rise: Disney’s Hercules opens this month and Anaïs Mitchell’sHadestownis in its second year at the Lyric whileThe Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musicalis going on tour this summer.Hadestown: how Anaïs Mitchell's lo-fi hit became a sensational musicalRead more“Greek theatre has influenced every facet of our lives, from athletics to religion,” says Cedric Neal, who plays Hermes inHadestown. “What better than for it to be translated to the stage with music, choreography and dance?” Neal has a good point: Greek tragedies, in their original incarnations, were traditionally performed with dance and music, so it is fitting for them to take the guise of full-blown modern musical theatre.Hadestown revolves around two ancient tales: Persephone’s abduction by Hades and the doomed romance between Eurydice, who ventures into Hades’s underworld, and Orpheus, who tries to get her out. Hermes is the show’s narrator, delivering some of the plot through songs incorporating gospel, jazz, folk, bluegrass and soul.View image in fullscreen‘Love will conquer all’ … Chris Jarman and Victoria Hamilton-Barritt in Hadestown.Photograph: Marc BrennerMusic is the purest form of telling a story, Neal says, as it touches heart and soul: “That’s what’s so effective, and affecting, about it.” He believes that these myths, set to music, reflect our lives back at us with an added emotional catch. Neal plays Hermes as pansexual: “Hadestown deals with how complex love can be and what we are willing to do [for it], no matter what the government or church or your parents are saying. The story we are telling reminds us that love will conquer all.”The rock musical The Lightning Thief is another hit, currently at the Other Palace in London. Based on the bestselling Percy Jackson book series by Rick Riordan, the story is certainly ancient – of Poseidon’s half-god son and Zeus’s stolen lightning bolt. But it is also about teenagers living in today’s world, feeling like gawky outsiders.Like Hadestown, it ran both off and on Broadway. This new production is directed by Lizzi Gee, who thinks that musical versions of these ancient stories “can take you even more into fantasy lands” and that they allow you to connect through the heightened emotions of the song and dance.View image in fullscreenGods and outsiders … the cast of The Lightning Thief at the Other Palace.Photograph: Manuel HarlanAs its choreographer as well, she had no difficulty in creating movement around these mythic characters. “I always want to be telling the story through dance and these songs are so narratively driven.” She had gone to producer Paul Taylor-Mills about another idea before he suggested this to her. “He said go away, listen to the soundtrack, and think if it’s something you’d like to do. The second I played the opening number I thought ‘I’m in’. Every song is narrative so I could immediately picture it all, because of the imagery through the songs. It was really clear to me how I would stage it.”The show features Percy’s adolescent posse of “half-bloods” (part human, part Greek god) at summer camp. “For me, it’s trying to portray the kids at Camp Half Blood as people who could represent the youth of today, so that they see themselves on that stage and see their stories being told – Percy with his ADHD and dyslexia … I feel like I wanted to say: ‘These are real people and this is our connection with their stories.’”Its stage design, by Ryan Dawson Laight, does not conjure a traditionally ancient realm but one filled with electricity, water and sewage in the above, beyond and below worlds. Characters wear jeans and hoodies “but with something a little otherly to them …”, she says. What has been rewarding to experience is the impact it has had on audiences. “Teenagers who are maybe struggling with isolation or thinking about who they are and feeling different from other people … are so grateful for something they can connect with and connect to … What is remarkable is how many young boys come to watch the musical. It’s very much connecting to young masculinity.”These mythic stories also offer a counterpoint to the “presentation” of ourselves that we so often get on social media, she feels. They offer an exploration of authentic identity and finding our true selves – that, in a way, is the purpose of the classic quests in ancient stories – and contemporary ones, too.View image in fullscreen‘A story about understanding where you fit in and what your strength is’ … Disney’s Hercules at Theatre Royal Drury Lane.Photograph: Matt Crockett ©️DisneyHercules the Musicalhas been adapted from the 1997 Disney animation film, whose music was composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by David Zippel (both are involved in this Disney stage show). Mythological musicals in animated form are not an especially new-fangled idea: DreamWorks has transposed several ancient, biblical stories to screen, their dramas fuelled by music and song, such as Joseph: King of Dreams and The Prince of Egypt (both these stories have since been adapted for the stage).Aspects of the story in Hercules have been reworked, although many of the loved songs are still there, say co-writers of the book, Robert Horn and Kwame Kwei-Armah. “We hope the audience goes ‘I know the music that was in the movie and now I’m going to accept this iteration …’,” says Kwei-Armah.For Horn, the key question was how to adapt mythology “without losing the DNA of what it is” while making it relevant to contemporary society – just as in the case of The Lightning Thief for Gee. “It is a coming-of-age story, for me, but also a story about understanding where you fit in in the world and what your strength is.”Kwei-Armah’s entry point to the myth was through the original story of Heracles, the divine Greek hero who later became known as Hercules in the Roman canon. “What I find interesting,” he says, “is how the story looks at the qualities that make you a god, the trials you have to go through in order to find out who we are, to find your tribe, to be accepted by the tribe you identify with and not just the tribe that is the dominant tribe. Part of the reason I responded to it so strongly when I was asked to join Robert and the team is that I felt it would be fun to investigate authenticity and the idea of being seen through ancient myth.”While they stayed true to the original story on the whole, they have added some new characters. “We were given free rein, says Horn. “That said, there is a musical element to the movie, and certain songs that are iconic. You don’t want to lose those. Our job is to make those songs work organically even if we have to change the story. People are going to come to hear them.” Kwei-Armah concurs: “Go the Distance makes me cry every time that I hear it so there’s no way we would even think about trying to lose anything like that.”What is so powerful about setting these old stories to music? “The fundamental thing behind a musical is the idea ‘oh no, I can’t say it so I must sing it’,” says Kwei-Armah. Horn adds: “These [mythic] stories are all just a little bit larger than life, so lend themselves organically to being musicalised.”Myths also offer eternally relevant stories, their underlying meanings delivered in metaphorical form, says Kwei-Armah. “We love a metaphor and there’s nothing better than a singing metaphor … Ithink we like being able to look back and see our everlasting selves [in these myths]. That lends itself to a melody.”Herculesis at Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London, from 11 June-28 March 2026.The Lightning Thiefis at the Other Palace, London, until 15 June and then on tour from 15 August-1 November.Hadestownis at the Lyric theatre, London, until 15 February 2026Explore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But then Brexit happenedGaby HinsliffTue 10 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 10 Jun 2025 06.46 EDTSharePolitics is awful.If you want the digested read of Sarah Vine’s memoir on life as a Westminster WAG, that’s it: politics, she writes, is a hateful business that ruined her marriage toMichael Gove, her health and happiness. (Don’t ask what the Cameron years did to anyone else: this book is absolutely not about anyone else.) But like many a passionate hatred, this one started out as love.In the book, Vine describes the “pinch me” moment early in the first Cameron government when she realised she’d made it; that the girl who never felt she fitted in, either growing up in Italy or at her English boarding school, is finally hanging with the cool kids. “Me, Sarah, the awkwardinglesina, friends with the prime minister, being waited on hand and foot by staff at Chequers.”If that makes you want to throw something, you probably won’t enjoy this tale of yearning for political paradise lost, AKA all the boozy nights “swimming in White Ladies” (David Cameron’s favourite cocktail) and hedonistic girls’ trips to Ibiza with her new best friend Sam Cameron which ended when Brexit blew their gilded circle apart. But if you’re less interested in politics than in how a grown woman could end up building so much of her self-esteem on a glittering friendship – well, buckle up for quite a ride.Like the veteran Daily Mail columnist she is, Vine writes unsparingly and grippingly about some deeply intimate subjects: the childhood she says left her feeling worthless; the awful postnatal depression she endured when her children were tiny; the death threat to her husband delivered in an 18th birthday card sent to her daughter; the slow death of their marriage and the commendably civilised divorce they ultimately managed. Rather sportingly, she gives her ex-husband space to explain his version of events at critical points; more unsettlingly, she also interviews and quotes their only-just-adult children. If that seems somewhat lacking in boundaries – well, the Camerons’ inner circle was all about blurred lines.The book opens the morning after the 2016 referendum, with the leave-supporting Gove-Vines queasily confronting victory. Although it’s a moment that changed the country, Vine’s focus is firmly on how it affected her social circle and particularly her once cherished but now broken friendship withSamantha Cameron, the scab she can’t stop picking.View image in fullscreenSamantha Cameron and Sarah Vine at the state opening of Parliament, 2010.Photograph: PAThe clue to why that lost friendship matters so much lies perhaps in her childhood. Her father, she writes, would tell her that she was an accident who would have been aborted if only it was legal; that she was too fat, a dud, a disappointment. Moving in exalted circles as an adult was a way of proving he was wrong. He didn’t even mention her in his father of the bride speech at her wedding, she says, but she could at least look at their A-list guests (including the young Camerons) and think ‘how far I had come that these were my actual friends’. But were they, really?Although it’s politics she mostly blames for pushing her and Gove apart, the strain of trying to keep up with his richer Oxford mates seemingly didn’t help. (Readers who also found the austerity years hard going thanks to David Cameron, but for very different reasons and on considerably smaller salaries, may well struggle to sympathise.) The pressures of government further strain relations between the two couples, especially after Gove gets demoted in a reshuffle. Soon she’s starting to wonder whether Sam Cam sees her more as glorified staff, handy for helping with school runs, than a real friend.When an angry David Cameron tells her she needs to rein in her husband over Brexit, she writes of feeling like a servant ordered about, sensing an “abyss of class” between them. Yet to the reader, it looks more like an abyss of understanding, a failure on her part to grasp how existential this referendum is for the Camerons and the country: even when Samantha lets rip at her over Brexit, she wonders why the fact that their kids grew up together isn’t trumping some stupid political disagreement, as if it were the political not the personal that was trivial at this point.“There was a sense that my career and my husband’s didn’t matter as much as theirs,” she writes at one point, following friction over her taking a job at Sam’s bete noire, the Mail. “That we had to compromise our views and beliefs in order to facilitate their life at Number 10.” To which one can only say: which part of him being prime minister did you not understand? They say it’s lonely at the top. What this book proves is that it can be even lonelier on the way down.How Not to Be a Political Wife by Sarah Vine (HarperCollins Publishers, £20) is out on 19 June.

Swift said the visits made her “fear for my safety and the safety of my family”.Wagner must stay at least 100 yards away from Swift. A more permanent order will potentially be put in place after a hearing on 30 June.Swift has faced numerous stalkers over the years. In 2017,29-year-old Mohammed Jaffar was sent to a psychiatric facilityin New York after he made dozens of calls to Swift’s management company and then entered her Tribeca apartment building. In2018, Roger Alvarado broke into Swift’s home, used her shower and slept in her bed – he was jailed for nine months, then sentenced to a longer term after another break-in. The same yearJulius Sandrock was arrestedafter travelling more than 1,000 miles to Swift’s home with ammunition, a knife, rope and gloves found in his car.Six other peoplewere convicted of stalking Swift in the following years, including an incident in 2020 in which a man crashed his car into her apartment building and attempted to gain entry.Last week, Swift announced that she had bought back the master recordings of her first six albums. In 2019, those masters had been sold by her first record label Big Machine to music manager Scooter Braun, who had in turn sold them to a private equity firm. Swift retaliated with a project to re-record the albums, generating huge sales with each release.Terms of the new deal are undisclosed. Announcing it, Swift said: “All I’ve ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy.”Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

Kureishi, who had a catastrophic fall thatleft him paralysed, will appear online with a “very personal perspective on repair”.Niven said she was also striving to broaden the festival’s appeal, both to increase its audience but also to much more accurately reflect what people read.That includes putting on the formerScotlandfootballer turned pundit Ally McCoist with his new autobiography Dear Scotland, and the Gavin and Stacey writer and co-star Ruth Jones, who will take part in the festival’s “Front List” strand of celebrity writers at the 1,000-seat capacity McEwan Hall.Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister, will discuss her new memoir Frankly with Kirsty Wark, originally billed as the book’s launch event, though Sturgeon has since added in several talks earlier in the week, beginning with an event in Manchester.Among the 700 events in this year’s edition of the festival, which before the Covid crisis laid claim to be the world’s largest literature festival, will be a greatly expanded series of cookery shows, after the few it staged last year “went gangbusters”, Niven said.There will be seven cookery demonstrations at a cookery school featuring chefs such as Sabrina Ghayour offering Persian cuisine, lunch with Rosie Kellett and Spanish cookery with José Pizarro, where the audience will eat the meals they make.Tickets will be sought after: there will be 44 tickets for each, with several three-hour-long cookery events costing up to £100 a head – among the most expensive tickets of all the festivals this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Mrs (Debra Michaels) has never had an orgasm and would like to experience it now, in her middle years. Her GP makes the mistake of dismissing it, reminding her that she is in menopause and packing her off for a dementia test.But this quest for the most elusive thing in her life is not whimsy, nor the middle-class sexual bohemianism of Miranda July’s novelAll Fours, although Mojisola Adebayo’s script might be considered an offshoot of “hot-flush noir” but with radical edges around sexuality, gender, class and race.The journey here relates to abuse, trauma, misogyny, Christian evangelism and mixed heritage relationships in what appears to be a near-future world, which looks much like our own, and is intent on reducing the pleasure and freedom of women and girls of colour.The analogy to space travel gives the story its levity: Brexit is in the past; Spexit (a government programme that relocates immigrants to space and is odiously reminiscent of theRwanda scheme) is the present. Afrofuturist elements come in beautiful black and white animations (by Candice Purwin) projected on a back screen, which deal with difficult subject matter in a beguiling and naive way. Miriam Nabarro’s set features the home of Mrs and hangs at a tilt, with luminous edges, as if its own lonely planet. Musical interludes bring foot-tapping beats (by Sun Ra, Queen, Jamila Woods and others) but also stop the story short, plucking us out of the dark depths of the drama.A Tamasha co-production first performed in 2023, it is directed by Gail Babb and delivered in a prevailingly bright tone. Michaels navigates the shifts between light and dark well, sometimes speaking in rhyme. Slowly, her character tells us of a past marked by teenage sexual assault and a passionless marriage to a man whose death leaves her finally free to explore her queerness.Mrs’s son, a DJ (Bradley Charles), plays records in a booth on the side of the stage and occasionally chips in but this is essentially a monologue in which she tells us her story and animates various others: a friendship with a young girl who has undergone FGM, and the medical prejudice faced by an intersex friend. In between, there is African mythology and folklore which is beautifully illustrated on the screen but brief and not entirely tied together.Mrs’s interstellar voyage into untrammelled new territory is a quest for joy and healing too; she finds lift-off in a wonderful, tear-inducing ending.AtBrixton House, London, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreSexualityGenderRaceWomenreviewsShareReuse this content"

Disney has been playing this cynical game since 1994 – releasing their Jungle Book remake (the one starring Jason Scott Lee) the same year DreamWorks was founded – and striking gold with Tim Burton’sAlice in Wonderland(2010), which arrived in theatres just weeks before the original How to Train Your Dragon landed.Materialists review – Celine Song’s Past Lives follow-up is a mixed bagRead moreIt also comes as no surprise that DreamWorks moved with Night Fury speed to revisit a movie that’s only 15 years old. As the recentLilo & Stitchproved, there’s plenty box office gold to mine from introducing new children to a young and beloved property, while banking on the nostalgia that a generation without fully formed frontal lobes would carry for the not-so-distant animated films and TV spinoffs they were weaned on.The younger audiences will no doubt be dazzled by the new How to Train Your Dragon, with its simple and appealing “ET but with Vikings” tale, which now features flesh-and-blood actors, some real landscapes and crashing blue waves (emphasis on “some”) and a still rascally and adorable Toothless – the name given to its central flying reptile. Meanwhile, the slightly older kids will probably find this retread functional and satisfying enough – as my own teens did – while being able to clock the diminishing returns.Director Dean DeBlois, who helmed the original alongside Chris Sanders, returns, staying protective of and faithful to the original, in which an outcast adolescent named Hiccup (voiced with nasally anxiety byJay Baruchel), who is raised in a community insistent on slaying dragons with extreme prejudice, befriends Toothless, the aforementioned Night Fury with the jet-black sleekness of a panther but cuddly nature of a house cat.The script, the gags and the action remain mostly intact. But this time around, real actors and sets become deadweight to a story that soared in larger-than-life animated form.Some of the reasons are pretty obvious to anyone who spent enough time with these live-action remakes. The green screen aesthetics, rendering surrounding environments (not to mention still computer-generated dragons), are less convincing and simply pale in comparison to the glorious images that made the original How to Train Your Dragon stand apart. Some scenes, like an opening night-time siege in which the Vikings of Berk, Hiccup’s village, battle dragons, are so muddy and low contrast that you can’t even make out the action. “The views are nothing to complain about,” says Hiccup, now played by Mason Thames, in the opening narration, where we can barely see a thing.It’s worth noting that the legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins was a visual consultant on the earlier movie. His influence is felt in the elegant animation, when faces and rustic sceneries often appeared beautifully lit by the glow from a nearby fire, or when Berk’s highland mist was just thick enough to achieve an emotional quality. In the most breathtakingly romantic moment from the original, when Toothless carries Hiccup and Astrid, the girl he cozies up to, into the skies, the pink-hued atmosphere tilts on an axis around the characters.The new movie – so often shackled to a more static camera that can’t replicate the dynamic motion of the original (or even find a decent angle) – doesn’t even attempt that shot. Nor do the actors attempt a lot of the fun physical comedy and action from the original. It’s already a struggle for them to just incorporate the dialogue’s humour, written for pixels, into corporeal form.Thames (of The Black Phone fame) plays Hiccup as slightly more petulant than petrified. As Astrid, Nico Parker plays things more cool than spunky, filling in her tough Viking girl performance with shades of bitterness over the class divide between her and Hiccup, whose father Stoic is the village chief. As Stoic, Gerard Butleris the most at home, not only because he’s reprising his role from the original, but because he has his own cartoonish demeanor that works spectacularly in both animation and live-action.If there’s one moment that nearly grasps the visceral thrill of the original, it’s the centrepiece Avatar-like flight sequence, when Hiccup and Toothless sync up and soar through skies. The moment falls short of the simple and pristine beauty from the animated movie, when Toothless carves the clouds with his wings, but it’s got the same rollercoaster momentum as the dragon grazes the water and ducks through cavernous landscapes, the audience riding on his back alongside Hiccup. For many, that sequence will be worth the price of admission.Perhaps another benefit to revisiting the franchise today is the opportunity to absorb the post-9/11 war on terror allegory that DeBlois and Sanders introduced to their original adaptation, in which the dragons rain down destruction from the skies.Cressida Cowell’s 2003 source novel wasn’t about jingoistic and bloodthirsty Vikings who fear and seek to wipe out a misunderstood enemy desperately defending themselves. That element is exclusive to the movies, in which Butler’s Stoic yells: “They’ve killed hundreds of us.” Hiccup, defying the dominant narrative in his community, responds: “And we’ve killed thousands of them.”The way those lines resonate today, as the war on Gaza rages on, will probably go over the heads of the target audience. But it’s a message worth repeating, even when packaged in muddled live-action form.How to Train Your Dragon is out in cinemas on 13 JuneExplore more on these topicsAction and adventure filmsGerard ButlerreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now he has confected a syrupy new musical take on Romeo and Juliet, with music by his brother Evan Kidd Bogart (who won a Grammy for his work on Beyoncé’s single Halo).Bogart retells the basic story but with Shakespeare’s language all removed and replaced with olden-days-effect prose: a kind of bardless Baz Luhrmann. Ultimately – with what I do have to admit is some amiable cheek – Bogart contrives to do for this play whatNahum Tate did for King Lear. It’s really pretty bland, and with each turn in the plot you have to ask what the point of it actually is.Clara Rugaard has an honest stab at Juliet and in an actual production of the play (that is one which hadn’t hobbled itself by amputating its whole linguistic identity), she might have made a real impression. Jamie Ward smoulders and fizzles damply through the role of Romeo. Elsewhere, there’s a whole host of big names phoning in small contributions. Jason Isaacs is Montague (Romeo’s dad),Rupert Everettis Capulet (Juliet’s dad) and Rebel Wilson is weirdly and unwontedly deadpan as Lady Capulet. Derek Jacobi gives it loads as the gentle, avuncular, silver-bearded Friar Lawrence who is on the side of the star-crossed lovers and Dan Fogler is the apothecary whom this production reinvents as Jewish, helping people escaping antisemitism. Romeo gets an actual physical confrontation with Paris (Dennis Andres), the young man that Juliet’s parents have earmarked as her fiance.There is no radical reinterpretation ofRomeo and Juliethere, and the staging, costumes and performances look as if they come from something as trad as Zeffirelli’s 60s version … only it’s modern-language. Not worth the two hours’ traffic of their stage.Juliet & Romeo is in UK cinemas on 11 June, with an Australian release to be confirmed.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsMusicalsRomeo and JulietWilliam ShakespeareJason IsaacsRupert EverettreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now those are the two things that I love most about myself.” It would be almost impossible to watch this documentary about the trans model and activist without feeling a surge of admiration for her resilience and grace. Bergdorf hit the headlines with a hiring-and-firing scandal in 2017 whenL’Oréal sacked her as the face of a UK campaignfollowing Facebook comments she wrote in response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.Watching the backlash in Love & Rage, we see that Bergdorf didn’t hide away. She went on Good Morning Britain, where Piers Morgan snapped at her like an angry yorkshire terrier. Bergdorf is willing to share a platform with people who deny her existence, and it looks incredibly bruising at times. There’s a clip of her on a TV debate with Germaine Greer; it’s upsetting enough to watch, heaven knows how Bergdorf felt. Her response to Greer is gentle but insistent: “We exist, we deserve respect like anyone else.” The film follows Bergdorf as she hires new management (I could have lived without her managers explaining their marketing strategies) and her rise to appearing on the cover of Vogue.Bergdorf grew up in a sleepy suburb of Essex and as a child hid copies of the fashion bible under her bed. The only black kid in school, she was bullied; she later found her people at university in Brighton, moved to London and began the medical process of transition aged 24. Her hyper-feminine appearance, she says, is a form of self-defence. She can cope with people taking shots at this put-together version of herself: “It’s like armour.” But clearly it takes a toll, and her openness about her mental health, like everything, is commendable.Love & Rage:Munroe Bergdorfis in UK cinemas on 10 and 11 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMunroe BergdorfTransgenderreviewsShareReuse this content"

I cannot be French if that nation does not exist; I can’t be a doctor if no one will grant me a medical degree. Social media, however, promises that we can don or doff identities like so many digital masks. We may become persuaded that identities are private goods over which we have rights of ownership and choice, that we can freely select what we “identify as”. The heightened salience of identity in modern political discourse thus represents an unwitting internalisation of the neoliberal view of humans as atomised individuals who navigate life purely by expressing consumer preferences.The idea that the identity of the speaker should count when assessing his or her argument is what the right used to denounce as “identity politics” (now subsumed under the general concept of “wokeness”), though it is in this way a logical outcome of Thatcherite and Reaganite economics. One strong critique of the critique of identity politics, on the other hand, points out that privileged white males, of the sort who make such complaints, don’t have to worry about their identity because theirs is the default one of power and influence – whereas for various minorities identity might matter much more, not least in how it influences the ways in which privileged white males will treat them.Philosopher Alexander Douglas’s deeply interesting book diagnoses our malaise, ecumenically, as a universal enslavement to identity. An alt-right rabble rouser who denounces identity politics is just as wedded to his identity as a leftwing “activist” is wedded to theirs. And this, Douglas argues persuasively, explains the polarised viciousness of much present argument. People respond to criticisms of their views as though their very identity is being attacked. The response is visceral and emotional. That’s why factchecking conspiracy theories doesn’t work. And it’s not just a social media problem; it’s far worse than that. “If you define yourself by your ethnicity or your taste in music,” Douglas argues, “then youipso factodemarcate yourself against others who do not share in that identity. Here we have the basis for division and intergroup conflict.”What we think of as our own special identity is just a suit of borrowed clothesThe escape route Douglas recommends is nothing so banal, then, as policing misinformation or even just being nicer to one another; no, we should strive to abandon identity all together. He deploys close readings of three thinkers from wildly differing epochs and cultures: the ancient Chinese sage Zhuangzi, the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Benedict Spinoza, and the 20th-century historian-critic René Girard. Each of them, he argues, hints at a similar ideal of enlightenment: to abandon our attachment to identity and become one with the undifferentiated flow of all things.This sounds fluffy and improbable in precis, but we should begin by noticing how fragile our own sense of self really is. Douglas says of his three thinkers: “Look within, they would say, and you will find a mess. Introspection reveals only a confusion of qualities.” Oddly, the author doesn’t mention the great Scottish philosopher David Hume, though his is probably the most famous expression of this idea: that what we call the self is, per Hume, “nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement”.If so, it follows that what we think of as our identity must have been drawn from the example of others. This is the meaning of “mimetic desire” as theorised by Girard: that we choose an admired person to imitate and so teach ourselves to want similar things. “Individualism,” Douglas concludes, “is really conformism to a model.” What we think of as our own special identity is just a suit of borrowed clothes.What, then, is the alternative? It is somehow to psychically merge with the “superdeterminate” nature of Spinoza’s concept of God, who exists everywhere and in every thing. Has any human being achieved such a feat? Perhaps, Douglas suggests, Jesus. Another model for us is Hundun, an emperor with no face in an old Chinese fable. His friends drilled holes into his head in an attempt to give him human features, and thereby killed him.Against Identity is a powerfully strange book, melding such matters with enjoyable references to Evelyn Waugh and Jean-Paul Sartre, and a strongly aphoristic turn of phrase. “The ‘inner voice’,” he writes, “is just the noise of others echoing inside your own emptiness.” To the “romantic lie” that says you can be what you want to be, Douglas counterposes the bracing challenge: Don’t be yourself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Whether readers will agree with its proposed solution is more doubtful. It warns against “making value judgments”, but we should make some value judgments, for example about murderers. And Douglas relays the Taoist advice he finds in Zhuangzi like this: “We would be happier and more peaceful letting things flow, vanish, transform, be indistinct, be ambiguous” – which is all very well, but terrible advice if you’re trying to build a bridge.Against Identity: The Wisdom of Escaping the Self by Alexander Douglas is published by Allen Lane (£20).

The result is insightful and a vivid time capsule for the grim and mendacious era of the “war on terror”, during which Blix was tasked with discovering the truth about Saddam’s supposed weapons. The film is also unexpectedly spiky, with Blix at one stage threatening to walk out, as Stocklassová presses him on his apparent fence-sitting, then as now, insisting on an absence of evidence for WMD but also reluctant to commit himself definitively to this being evidence of absence, and apparently unable to state where the onus of proof lies.But as he himself says … how do you prove a negative? How do you prove that there is not a mouse in this room at this very moment? After 9/11, Blix found himself at the very centre of international pain and American dysfunction, with the US government grimly set on finding someone to lash out against, and Saddam’sIraq, already semi-defeated in the first Gulf war of 1991, being the obvious candidate. America needed the fiction of Iraq’s “weapons of mass destruction” as the pretext – although it was presmably their absolute conviction that there were no WMD that emboldened them to attack. (Osama Bin Laden was actually discovered in Pakistan, a nuclear power on whom regime change could not be imposed.)So Blix – calm, professional, conscientious and diplomatic, showing up at various Iraqi sites with his UN team in the burning heat and finding nothing – was the face of this objective, non-partisan assessment. He didn’t realise until it was too late, and perhaps still doesn’t realise, that the protracted theatre of his polite frustration was being used by the US government to build up the necessary drumbeat of rage to facilitate the final assault: Blix the dupe, Blix the chump, Blix the internationalist liberal being laughed at by Saddam.Stocklassová suggests that over the 20 years since then, the calamity of the Iraq war led to the rise of Islamic State, to the tidal wave of refugees and to the new mainstream normalisation of the far right. She could be correct. Yet Blix’s inspections seem part of a different world; certainly Putin didn’t feel the need to go through the motions of a UN inspector who could confirm or fail to disprove his allegations of a Nazified Ukraine aggressor. Blix himself is good-natured and decent; his faith in the primacy of facts still has something heroic about it.Blix Not Bombs is on True Story from 13 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsHans BlixIraqUnited NationsSaddam HusseinreviewsShareReuse this content"

This film follows the story of two incarcerated brothers, matching it with the confessions of more than 40 former regime operatives, from intelligence officers to prison guards. They describe actions so dark and cruel, they are hard even to comprehend.Jack SealeWho Do You Think You Are?8pm, BBC OneDiane Morgan’s comic creation Mandy was once on an episode of Who Are You, Do You Think?

Natural dykes of black igneous rock – cooled magma – jut out into the ocean here. The houses on shore are backdropped by grassy cliffs.We know that this giant proto-crocodile once roamed here because it left behind footprints – which can still be seen today. “This is older than the dinosaurs,” says Malcolm Wilkinson ofArran Geopark, as we crouch down next to the trace fossil. I place my hand in the massive print and attempt to imagine the world millions of years ago, when Scotland sat just north of the equator and the climate was tropical.Arran mapAfter they were made, Malcolm says, these footprints were covered in layers of silt, deposited by water or wind, which protected them from erosion and created a natural mould. Over the next few million years, layers of sediment gathered and compacted on top, cementing the grains and turning the soft mud around the footprint into solid red sandstone. The footprints turned into fossils, and were thrust back to the surface when theAtlantic openedabout 60m years ago, tearing Europe and North America apart.View image in fullscreenMalcolm Wilkinson (left) and the author examine a chirotherium footprint.Photograph: Stuart KennyAs the younger rocks slowly eroded the trackway became visible. Similar prints were first discovered in the Victorian era, and the creature was named chirotherium – “hand-beast” – because the fossils look like giant, human handprints.Just off the west coast of Scotland and reachable in a little over two hours from Glasgow, Arran has long been known for its rocks, regularly welcoming groups of hard hat-clad students on field trips. In April, it becameScotland’s newest Unesco Global Geopark(there are two others, in Shetland and the North West Highlands), in recognition of the world-class geology here, which records tectonic plate collisions and shifting continents.To walk around Arran is to walk through 600m years of Earth’s history, and my plan is to hike the 65-mileArran Coastal Way, which circumnavigates the island, over six days. Thankfully for laymen like myself, the history is spelled out through informative Geopark signage along the way.As the ferry approaches Brodick, the serrated silhouette of the northern mountains comes into focus, the sandstone castle nestled in the greenery below and the mysterious lump of the “Holy Isle” drawing the eye south. The island is divided by the Highland Boundary Fault, a geological line where tectonic plates once collided, separating Scotland’s rolling lowlands from the mountainous highlands.View image in fullscreenA lightning bolt recorded as a fossil in Corrie.Photograph: Stuart KennyOn day one of the Coastal Way I head up Goat Fell, Arran’s highest peak (874 meters), and witness this: the granite mountains of the north have jagged ridgelines and tower over deep glens, sculpted by glaciation, while to the south the scenery is soft and green.That evening I stay at theCorrie Hoteland follow a Geopark leaflet to the spot where a sand dune was struck by lightning 270m years ago, locking it in timea stone’s throw from the centre of the village. Staring at this “fossilised fulgurite” and imagining that desert lightning bolt is like staring into a different universe.Along the coast is another trackway, in a remote spot where Arran’s only coal seam was exposed to the surface. This one was left by a six-foot millipede that lived 300m years ago, and would be easily missed without the small, oak Geopark signpost. A pod of dolphins swims by as I reach it, stealing the scene, jumping joyfully just offshore.Staring at this ‘fossilised fulgurite’ and imagining that desert lightning bolt is like staring into a different universeFour miles north sits the most famous geological site on Arran – Hutton’s Unconformity. James Hutton, the father of modern geology, visited the island in 1787. At Newton Point, a rocky outcrop in the north of Arran, he observed rock contact between gently sloping sandstone and older, steeply dipping schists. This led Hutton to reason that if natural processes had occurred in the past at the same rate observable in his day, this formation, and so the Earth, must be millions and not thousands of years old – as was widely believed by scholars at the time.View image in fullscreenArriving at Lochranza.Photograph: Stuart KennyHappily, a holidaying geologist is on hand to explain this to me, though he is, by his own admission, “more excited about the bloody otter” he’d just spotted.I eat fish and chips at the community-ownedLochranza Country Innand collapse intoLochranza Youth Hostel. A simple (but private) bunk bed provides all the comfort I need. The next day I walk a mighty 19 miles along the boulder-filled coastline and quiet roads around the west of Arran, camping near King’s Cave, where iron age crosses are carved into the stone, and watch gannets dive bomb into the sea as the sun sets over the Kintyre Peninsula.Occasionally, I abandon the geological hunt altogether and stop to watch otters fishingOccasionally, I abandon the geological hunt altogether; stopping to watch otters fishing, indulging in a whisky and chocolate tasting at the newly openedLagg Distillery, or relaxing atThe Lagg Inn, whose leafy beer garden is tucked away next to a river.As my walk happens to coincide with perhaps the sunniest week in Arran since Scotland sat at the equator, it isn’t hard to convince Malcolm to meet me down at Kildonan shore. “This really is a world-class geological site,” he tells me, pointing to the shoreline. While we wait for the tide to reveal our “pre-dinosaur” footprint, Malcolm explains the science of the nearby dyke swarms – the black “walls” jutting into the sea. “They’re magma which was forced up vertically through cracks in the Earth, and have since eroded away,” he says. “This is a record of a time Europe and North America were pulled apart; and the Atlantic was born.”‘Scotland in miniature’: why the Isle of Arran is perfect for a family holidayRead moreSeals lounge around on these globally significant rocks, digesting their breakfast in the sun. “The special thing about Arran is that it has rock types from basically every geological period of the last half billion years,” Malcolm says. “We’ve got the main part of the history of the Earth here – and it’s so accessible.”Off shore sits the microgranite mound of Ailsa Craig, home to an enormous colony of gannets, and Pladda, an island with a scenic lighthouse, sitting on what was once molten magma.View image in fullscreenA view of Brodick Bay with Goat Fell in backdrop.Photograph: Stuart KennyThat evening, via the plummeting waterfalls of Glenashdale, I reach Whiting Bay, and watch an otter scurrying in the sunset before setting up camp. With careful consideration for tide times, my final day skirts along boardwalks and seabed to Lamlash, Arran’s most populous village.I stop for a swim at a secluded bay and oystercatchers (my constant companions on the walk) squeak their farewells. Brodick soon welcomes me back with its sublime mountain vistas. As my ferry sails back to the mainland I gaze back at Goat Fell, and the words of the writer Nan Shepherd come to mind: “the shortsighted cannot love mountains as the longsighted do”.TheCorrie Hotelhas doubles from £115B&B,Lochranza Youth Hostelhas private rooms from £42or dorm beds from £20,Lagg Innhas doubles from £170.For more information, seeVisit ArranExplore more on these topicsScotland holidaysWalking holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Crisp veg with creamy, tangy dressings makes for fresh, bright salads. Follow our experts’ advice on how to make the best slawAnna BerrillTue 10 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhat’s the trick to great coleslaw?Chris, Paignton, Devon“Coleslaw is such an under-rated salad,” says the Guardian’s Felicity Cloake, whose latest book,Peach Street to Lobster Lane, was published last week. “Familiarity breeds contempt.” (As do those claggy tubs you get in supermarkets.) The whole point of coleslaw is that the veg has to be crisp, which is why Cloake shreds rather than grates the cabbage (a mandoline or food processor is helpful here). “That will leave it less mushy. And, if you have the patience, shred the carrot, too.” Cloake tosses the two with salt, vinegar and a little sugar, then leaves the mix to sit: “This both softens and seasons it.” Then, once drained, bring on the mayo: “Don’t go overboard, though – it should be lightly dressed rather than gloopy.”Conveniently, Jessica Prescott, author ofEpic Salads: For Every Mood, Craving and Occasion, has been working on an essential coleslaw guide, and her dressing template goes like this: “Two tablespoons of something creamy [mayo, sour cream, yoghurt], a tablespoon of something acidic [lemon or lime juice, apple cider vinegar], and citrus zest, if you like. A spoonful of mustard, honey or soy sauce can deepen the flavour.”If mayo is your “something creamy”, Richard Turner, chef/partner ofBodean’s, advises adding some soured cream or creme fraiche, too, though Jack Croft, chef/co-owner ofFallow,FowlandRoe, all in London, would ditch the white stuff altogether. He favours dijon mustard, a splash of good-quality vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a load of fresh herbs (chives, parsley): “That’ll be rich enough without feeling heavy.” Cloake often adds horseradish or mustard, plus finely chopped spring onion or chives.Another good tip for counteracting coleslaw that cloys comes from the queen of country herself,Dolly Parton. In her bookDollyWood Presents Tennessee Mountain Home Cooking, she combines dill pickle brine with mayo, white vinegar and seasoning (and adds a minced pickle to the slaw, too).Whatever your poison, it’s then time to prep the veg, Prescott says: “Thinly slice a quarter of a small green, red, savoy or napa cabbage, soak in cold water, then spin dry for maximum crunch.” You could bolster things with grilled corn (“my absolute favourite”), carrot or cucumber: “Grated, finely diced or thinly sliced all work, but if you’re adding water-heavy veg, sprinkle with salt and let them sit first.” Soft herbs, “finely chopped so they integrate rather than dominate”, are non-negotiable, too, as is setting the lot aside for 15 minutes, so “the flavours get friendly”.Once dressed, “taste, taste, taste”, Turner says, because “a slaw’s character changes over time”. And if you’re not eating it straight away, Croft advises to cover and chill. “Just before serving, season with salt and a good squeeze of lemon – this keeps the slaw fresh, bright and avoids clagginess.”There is, of course, a whole world of slaws beyond coleslaw. Start by mixing up the veg: Turner combines a shredded savoy, two finely sliced onions, a julienned granny smith, a thinly sliced green pepper, a jalapeño and chopped coriander and mint. “Mix 100ml yoghurt, the juice and grated zest of two limes, some salt and sugar, and pour over the vegetables,” says Turner, who chills until ready to serve.“I make one with ribboned mango tossed with sliced red onion, chilli and coriander,” adds Maria Bradford,food writerand chef/owner ofShwen Shwenin Sevenoaks, Kent, who brings that together with a lime and maple dressing. “It’s delicious with grilled meat or a whole baked bass or snapper.” The real takeaway here is that slaws are “one of the most flexible dishes around”, Prescott says, so do your worst: “They’re riffable and always satisfying.”Got a culinary dilemma?
