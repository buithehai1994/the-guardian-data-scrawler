Almost everyone regarded this as an impossible task. His remains had gone undiscovered for more than 500 years. It was a folly, a fool’s errand. She was out of her depth, an amateur. No letters after her name.But Philippa diligently did the work and did her research. She had an inner conviction that she would find him, and she did. It was a staggering achievement, and yet when the news broke of this startling discovery, and it was beamed round the world, there was little to no mention of her.I saw the Channel 4 documentary The King in the Car Park, which featured this woman I hadn’t even heard of. She was a little eccentric, odd even, and obsessive in her quest to find Richard’s remains. There was a disconnect between what I was seeing on screen and the headlines I’d read months before.I contacted her representatives and arranged to meet her for lunch. Her health was frail, and there was a vulnerability to her. The more Jeff Pope and I researched the whole saga, the more convinced we were by her absolute integrity.Man who won damages over Richard III film calls for more regulation of fact-based dramaRead moreWe set about writing a screenplay to tell the story of her journey from Edinburgh to Leicester andthe archaeological discovery of the century. A story which, it appeared to us, had been subsumed by bigger, louder voices.The resultant film, The Lost King, is one of which I’m immensely proud. It handed the megaphone to a woman whose story was largely unknown.In our film, Richard Buckley, the head archaeologist, is depicted as a champion of Philippa, but ultimately with feet of clay. Her ex-husband John Langley, whom I played, is seen as loyal, but sometimes impatient with Philippa’s obsessiveness. And then there’s Richard Taylor, the former deputy registrar at theUniversity of Leicester.We depict Philippa as imperfect and sometimes challenging. Ultimately, she is both ordinary and extraordinary. She also suffers from ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome), something she is open about and is shown in the film. Philippa’s ME and ongoing concomitant health issues meant that she was unable to testify at the impending civil trial to establish whether the film depicted Richard Taylor unfairly.I was looking forward to our day in court together, a chance for a judge to look at all the evidence and come to a fair conclusion. But Philippa’s absence meant we had lost our star witness and would have gone to trial with one hand tied behind our backs. No one wants to pressurise a woman who is unwell into doing something which could well make matters worse. Sometimes you have to fall on the sword.Consequently, we had to settle. Richard Taylor wanted to have the film altered or withdrawn. He didn’t get that. I’m pleased to say not one frame of the film has changed bar a clarification in the pre-title sequence. This card states that the Richard Taylor in the film is fictional and bears no relation to the Richard Taylor in reality who, as the card says, “always behaved with integrity”.View image in fullscreenSally Hawkins as Philippa Langley and Steve Coogan as John Langley in The Lost King.Photograph: Graeme HunterI noticed the University of Leicester’s website carries Richard Taylor’s statement in full, but not any of my statements. I’m sure that’s just an oversight. Philippa initiated the search for Richard III. Philippa determined the precise location in the northern area of the social services car park. When funding was withdrawn and the dig was in peril, Philippa raised the funds to ensure the project survived. When leg bones were exposed in the trench, it was Philippa who insisted that they be excavated. It revealed curvature to the spine and injuries to the head consistent with historical accounts of injuries incurred by Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth. In other words, it was him.Richard Taylor said subsequently in a podcast that he had to create a firewall between the university and Philippa. For that, I give him full marks. At the press conference to announce that the remains discovered were those of the king, Philippa was the 13th to speak out of 13 speakers.One thing is for sure, had Philippa been on the payroll of the University of Leicester, you can bet your bottom dollar that she would have been front and centre of all the university’s announcements. Not Richard Taylor. But as the University of Leicester liked to remind us yesterday: “She is an amateur”. Let’s face it, it’s always awkward when the amateur finds the remains of a 500-year-old dead king on your doorstep.Back of the net! Steve Coogan film roles – rankedRead moreRichard Taylor has suggested that there should be an inquiry. I would welcome any inquiry which affords the opportunity to look in detail at his and the University of Leicester’s behaviour during that tumultuous period.In the meantime, I’ll happily debate with Richard Taylor in a public forum on all the issues surrounding this saga. Our intention with The Lost King was only ever to give a voice to Philippa and her crowning achievement. That is something to celebrate.Richard Taylor is right about this having been a David and Goliath fight, except in our version, he and the University of Leicester are the Goliath, and the David is Philippa.The Lost King is available for all to see. I’m sure people will watch it and draw their own conclusions.Explore more on these topicsSteve CooganRichard IIIUniversity of LeicesterMonarchyLeicestercommentShareReuse this content"

At school I was always successfully “sick” on the annual sports day and had a standing note from my equally averse mother to excuse me from physical education classes due to my “bad foot”. Even after I started exercising regularly in my mid-20s, I never joined my friends’ social netball or football teams.“Hating sports” was core to my identity. Then, last year, a friend invited me to her birthday “kickabout” – a casual game of football, I gathered. (I believe some call it soccer.) Had we been less close, I might have made my excuses. Instead I turned up to the park, determined to keep as far away from the ball as possible.To my great surprise, I enjoyed myself. Instead of running down the clock on the sidelines, I got swept up in the game, rooting for my team to score.None of the other players were sporty or experienced either. Yet, at the pub afterwards, we agreed we’d had fun and wanted to do it again.Can my ‘inner child’ help me navigate life as an adult?Read moreA year later, the kickabout is not only still going, it’s grown from five or six friends to a rotating lineup of about 40. Every other Sunday, we play at a proper pitch at our local sports complex. I am, by some distance, the worst on the team, infamous for always instinctively fending off the ball with my hands (though somehow never when I’m actually playing in goal). But I’m also slightly better than I was a year ago – and I would no longer say I hate playing sports.What keeps me turning up every Sunday? Unexpectedly, it is not the socialising or the exercise. I love the slightly intoxicating sense of challenging myself, with zero expectation – or even hope – of ever being actually skillful.Why does it feel so good to be bad at something?“Amateurish” hasn’t always been a pejorative, explains author and activist Karen Walrond. “It comes from the Latin, meaning ‘one who loves’.”Her new book In Defense of Dabbling makes the case for “intentional amateurism”: finding an activity we’re drawn to but not necessarily naturally good at, and sticking with it anyway. After interviewing dozens of hobbyists, Walrond conceives of it as a regular practice, driven by passion – “something you keep going back to, for the love of it,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘Amateurish’ hasn’t always been a pejorative, explains author and activist Karen Walrond.Photograph: Courtesy of Karen WalrondWalrond realised she had internalised the idea that she should be “an expert” at something. Being a generalist is often associated with noncommitment or ineptness, she says, yet many of her most reliable sources of satisfaction were interests she explored for their own sake.There are two reasons to pursue intentional amateurism. First, it flies in the face of “hustle culture” and the expectation that we should always be productive or self-optimising. Teaching yourself to juggle, for instance, is something you might do simply for personal enjoyment.Second, even though you might never improve, you’ll inevitably experience benefits, which can flow into your daily life, says Walrond. For example, she has always found meditation difficult, but accesses mindfulness when engaged fully in activities she enjoys.Mindfulness is among seven attributes by which Walrond defines intentional amateurism, along with curiosity, self-compassion, play, challenge, connection, and wonder or awe. Focusing on these helped her “let go of perfectionism” and appreciate the experience.Walrond has tried many new activities: swimming, playing piano, making pasta from scratch, calligraphy, surfing, night photography. “I wanted to find something that really captured my soul,” she says.What stuck was pottery. It meets many of the intentional amateurism criteria, Walrond says. At the wheel, she gets to “shut out the world” and be in the present moment, and also indulge instincts to play. Being part of an ancient tradition inspires awe, while the community at her studio offers opportunities for connection.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’It’s now easier for her to “access curiosity, mindfulness and self-compassion,” she says. “I did not expect to find that.”My weekly kickabout may be similar, Walrond points out. There’s “the connection with your teammates, and certainly play. And the fact that you’re doing it without trying to become a professional footballer means there’s going to be self-compassion.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I dropped them when I became more focused on my career and realised I would never be especially good at them.That’s typical of ambitious, career-focused people who might benefit most from embracing amateurism, Walrond suggests. “We think that in order to be fully formed grown-ups, we should put aside some of this ‘kid stuff’ that we’re doing – only to find, years later, that that is actually where your joy is.”Taking my football commitment seriously, but not putting pressure on myself to perform has helped me to accept myself as I am (not very good at sports), while demonstrating that I can grow and try new things.Play and exploration without expecting perfection supports a growth mindset,consistentlyshownby research to boost happiness and wellbeing. “A lot of perfectionism is really related to how you’re perceived by other people,” Walrond says. “Embracing amateurism helps you focus inward.”More from Why am I like this:I’m an adult. Why do I regress under my parents’ roof?I like my own company. But do I spend too much time alone?People say you’ll know – but will I regret not having children?Tellingly, neither of us have trumpeted our new interest on social media – reflecting how precious and separate to our public “selves” it is. Many amateurs Walrond interviewed for her book described wanting to protect their passion from outside judgement, or pressure to improve or monetise. “A lot of people who have really embraced intentional amateurism don’t talk about it,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe cover of In Defense of Dabbling.Photograph: Broadleaf BooksOne good reason to discuss my new hobby, though, is that friends reveal that they, too, have been dabbling. One showed me a watercolour she’d painted of a horse (“after a few drinks”). Another customises her T-shirts and tote bags. Someone else has been taking drawing lessons in their downtime.One 60-something woman she spoke to had taken up basketball, which she’d loved as a child. “Nobody’s expecting you to be in the WNBA,” Walrond says. “You can go gentle with yourself.”In her book, Walrond includes an entire “menu” of activities she still intends to try, inspiring me to steal some for myself (horse riding, learning to play chess).Simply making the attempt enlarges our lives, by encouraging curiosity and taking us beyond our comfort zone. “There’s something to just stretching yourself a little bit: ‘Let’s see what I can do … What else can I learn, what else am I capable of?’”I’ve experienced that myself on the football pitch over the past year, going from very bad to better in surprisingly joyful increments. This weekend, in fact, we’re playing our first proper match against another team. I’m sitting it out, to cheer from the sidelines. It’s great to challenge yourself – but part of embracing intentional amateurism, I’ve decided, is also knowing your limits.In Defense of Dabbling by Karen Walrondis out now via Broadleaf Books.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyWhy am I like this?Sports gamesHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She hasn’t been seen for days. Not at any of the three Reform press conferences on three consecutive days this week. It’s not as if Reform has so many MPs to go round that her presence wouldn’t be missed. The last Sarah sighting was on TalkTV last Saturday where she could be spotted frantically counting the number of black and Asian actors in adverts. One, two,two too many…Safe to say that Sarah now can’t even bring herself to turn up to theHouse of Commons. Not out of shame but because it causes her to go even madder when she has to observe all the black and brown faces on the benches.But Nige at least was in the chamber for prime minister’s questions. Unlikelast week when he sat the session outalongside his old Brexit mucker Arron Banks in the gallery.Apparently that was meant to be a protest at not getting enough attention duringPMQs. His narcissism is offended that parliamentary rules only allocate a question to the leaders of small parties every five or six weeks. In NigeWorld everything revolves around Nige. If he got the full half-hour it still wouldn’t be enough.There again, Nige is a terrifically slow learner. It’s been well over a year but he still hasn’t realised he is entitled to enter himself into the MPs’ ballot. Or perhaps he just prefers to play the victim. That’s his usual safe place.If he ever does become prime minister, Nige is going to be spending a lot of time blaming Nige for the country falling apart. He will soon have to split himself into a million little pieces.But Farage was content to sit this one out. To lap up the attention when Reform got the inevitable shout-out. He seemed to take it as a badge of honour when the Lib Dem leader,Ed Davey, yet again mentioned Reform’s links to Russia.Nige doesn’t seem to think a pro-Putin stance does him any harm. Maybe he’s right. In any case, what Nige had really turned up for on Wednesday was to introduce his 10-minute rule bill on leaving the European convention on human rights.This is just the kind of meaningless performance politics Farage enjoys. The whole point of a 10-minute rule bill is for the proposer to whang on about a subject dear to their heart and then for parliament to agree to do precisely nothing about it.But Nige can’t resist an audience and the Lib Dem benches were full. The Labour and the Conservatives not so much. They seem to think that the best way of dealing with Nige is to ignore him. So far, the approach hasn’t worked particularly well.It’s the noblest battle of our new free-speech age: Sarah Pochin’s anti-woke couch crusade | Marina HydeRead moreNo matter. Shortly after 3pm, Nige was on his feet and parliament was obliged to listen. But even he seemed rather overwhelmed by the futility of the occasion. This was not one of his best speeches and he did seem to be visibly irritated when some MPs barracked him. Shouting out is fine when it’s by him: not so much when directed at him.So what we got was a lazy drive-by, with only a tangential nod to the truth. There was fear and anger in the country, he said. Most of it whipped up by him. Nige would be lost without fear and anger.Brexit wasn’t Brexit without getting rid of foreign courts and foreign judges. Nige won’t rest until the last vestige of anything foreign has been wiped away from our streets.Now that’s a policy Sarah P can really get behind. One day she hopes to be released from her all-white gated community and be introduced to someone who is only a little bit brown for a few minutes. Baby steps and all that.Davey spoke rather better in reply. Nige was guilty of misinformation, he said. Surely not. Whatever next. Instead, he talked of all the benefits the European convention had brought to Britain in terms of holding the powerful to account.He also observed that New Zealand not being in the ECHR was not the killer line Farage thought it to be. The clue was in the location. Rather he highlighted that Russia and Belarus were also not in the ECHR. They were rather closer to Europe. In it, in fact.Nige seemed surprised. I guess geography isn’t his strong point. Unusually the motion went to a vote where it was easily defeated. To be forgotten until the next time Nige chooses to bring it up. Probably tomorrow.As for PMQs, that was a non-event. Two leaders getting a battering in the polls and struggling to get their messages across.Kemi Badenochthought she had a gotcha moment when Keir Starmer refused to rule out an increase in income tax, national insurance or VAT, but Labour has been virtually shouting from the rooftops that one of the three will be going up in next month’s budget. So no one was that bothered.A more interesting line of attack might have been to ask whether manifesto promises should be honoured. But since neither Kemi nor Keir have a good record in that department, they chose to descend into a slanging match over who was worse at handling the economy. Frankly it’s a bit of a toss-up.

Some parents in England aren’t so sureGrowing number of schools are giving pupils and staff a fortnight off, but some parents complain of childcare costsShane HickeyWed 29 Oct 2025 11.07 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 11.18 EDTShareFor many schools across England it is now October half-term – but while it used to be standard for state schools to have just one week, increasingly pupils and staff are being given a fortnight off.A growing number of schools have added, or are intending to add, an additional week to the existing holiday, saying it will give teachers a much-needed extra break and allow families to access cheaper holidays.In England, councils set the holiday dates for state schools, while academies, free schools, foundation schools and voluntary-aided schools can set their own. Nottinghamshire county council moved to a two-week holiday in 2019 across its schools. UnitySchoolsPartnership, a group of schools across Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, is bringing in the holiday across eight primaries for the first time this year. And around England, an increasing number of schools are moving to, or considering the move to, a two-week break.The school year is often balanced by reducing the summer holidays by a week or adding extra time on to each school day, for example. Some of the Unity schools are adding 10 minutes on to the end of each day to make up for the time.In the past, parents with young childrenhave objected to the longer holiday, saying it places an extra burden on them to find childcare. In Wales,plans to extend the half-term and reduce the summer termwere shelved last year after opposition from the teaching unions.One parent on Reddit commented recently: “It actually makes me so angry that working parents have now got to find another five days of childcare.”Now some have warned the extra time off can have a negative financial impact on low-income households.Childcare costsSebrina McCullough of Money Wellness, a debt solutions and budgeting website, says that when children are not in school, parents face increased food and energy costs while also having to keep them entertained.“We also see increasing stress among single parents and those working zero-hour or shift-based jobs, who have very little flexibility,” she says. And while there is not a single policy across the country, there are additional issues. “For families with children in different schools, managing mismatched holiday dates can be a logistical nightmare and make arranging shared childcare even harder,” she says.Coram, the children’s charity, puts the cost of a week’s holiday childcare at £179 – an added bill for parents if schools do not reduce the summer holiday. Disadvantaged families are particularly hit, as it means a week without school meals, it says. “Finding childcare might also be tricky, as nearly a quarter of holiday clubs don’t open during half-terms, and those that do may only open for one week,” says Lydia Hodges from the charity.Rebecca Horne of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed says an extended October break may allow parents to break up holidays throughout the year instead of “having to twist like a pretzel to make the gigantic summer holiday work”. But women, who do most of childcare, face the prospect of more upheaval in their work lives, she says.Holiday savingsOne argument for a longer school break is that it puts less upward pressure on the price of holidays for those who can afford to travel because not everyone is travelling in the same week. Figures from Chase bank put the cheapest cost of flights for a family of four to Spain at £993 for the week of half-term when most schools are off this year, compared with £191 for the following week.View image in fullscreenTravel prices can be more affordable when everyone is travelling in the same week.Photograph: PhotoAlto/AlamyBut Paul Scott of the comparison site My Budget Break says tour operators often hike prices beyond just the week of half-term to include “shoulder dates” in and around the week, and may increasingly do this if the policy is extended to more schools.“Short-term, you might be able to grab a budget-friendly family holiday, but the prices are sure to creep up either side if there is an opportunity for tour operators to make more profit,” he says.Better healthThe case for a two-week break includes there being less absence in the second part of what is usually the longest school term. A survey by the Parentkind charity earlier this year found almost half of parents wanted all half-terms to be two weeks long.Sarah Garner of Unity Schools Partnership, which now has a two-week holiday across all of its 40 primary, secondary and specialist schools, says there has been an increase in attendance since the change and that the break meant illnesses were not being transmitted as much.“We found the term leading up to Christmas was a factor in staff and student absence, so we decided to trial a two-week half-term to see if it would make a difference. Since we introduced this, we have seen a significant upturn in attendance levels for staff and students,” she says.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said school attendance had improved last year, with 140,000 fewer pupils persistently absent compared with the previous year.Explore more on these topicsChildcareSchoolsConsumer affairsChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are our default setting on a Saturday, but when we need to look smart, we reach for something else. But jeans, worn right, can take you to the office or a nice restaurant with flair to spare. And most of us don’t need to worry too much about the red carpet, after all.A blazer is to jeans what lipstick is to a bare face. The juxtaposition makes the look feel deliberate and intentional, which radiates confidenceLet’s start with the basics. If your jeans sag at the knees or drag on the ground, no amount of silk blouse wizardry will save the outfit. Smart jeans are about clean lines, good tailoring and a fit that complements you. The extra-wide, extra-long denim that is everywhere at the moment can look great dressed up for let-loose parties. But for a look that reads as semi-formal, a straight leg hits the right tailoring-adjacent note, and the hem should sit just at the top of your shoe. Straight jeans are helpful because they know how to behave themselves in company. If straight jeans had a personality, they would be punctual and polite, very Type A. This is why they are your friend here.View image in fullscreenMargot Robbie shows the way to go.Photograph: Gotham/GC ImagesThe most common mistake we make when trying to look smart in jeans is to attempt to play down the jeans. If you wear dull jeans and cover them with something snazzy up top in the hope that no one will notice you are wearing jeans, you don’t disguise the denim – you look cobbled together, which is not the idea at all. A simple, classic leather belt that makes a feature of the jeans is the way to go.Rigid denim has the best silhouette, so look for minimal stretch. The waist should be at your waist – anything low-rise sends a more casual message – and snug but not tight. You are going to wear a belt anyway (see above, do keep up) and I don’t think denim should ever be uncomfortable. You should feel held, but not squeezed.A blazer is to jeans what lipstick is to a bare face. The juxtaposition makes the look feel deliberate and intentional, which radiates confidence. The contrast of denim with sleek wool or crepe adds texture and interest. This works over a shirt or T-shirt for day, or something slinkier for evening. Pick out a chain necklace or a clean hoop rather than a dangling chandelier earring. It feels more French, know what I mean?Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: the number-one rule for coats this winter – make it longRead moreJeans-and-a-nice-top is a classic for a reason, especially if you are going out for dinner. Starting with jeans makes putting together an outfit simpler, which is handy if it’s a quick post-work change. A silk camisole under your blazer is a simple go-to that gives you options: you can keep both on if you are near the door with a chill breeze, or slip the jacket off if you feel yourself going pink in toasty heating.The right shoe makes the difference between laid-back polish and popped-out-for-bin-bags. It doesn’t have to be a heel, although it doesn’t hurt. A classic glossy high pump with a jean is eternally chic, but loafers, fresh trainers or ankle boots are all good. A flash of skin somewhere is always a nice detail, if the temperature allows: a couple of buttons undone on a blouse, or a bare sandal if you are wearing a high-necked sweater.Sometimes the easy choice turns out to be the smart one. And if it’s good enough for the Venice red carpet, it’s good enough for your corner table in Carluccio’s.Model: Kentha at Milk. Stylist’s assistant: Charlotte Gornall.

What he said about us is categorically untrue, saying we shouldn’t be on the panel because we are watering it down and we are survivors of other abuse, not grooming gangs. We are survivors of grooming and grooming gangs.“Farage’s lack of knowledge and assumptions about our experiences as victims and survivors of grooming gangs proves he should not have a platform to make decisions about us or our input.“His ignorance and untrue statements about us, our experiences and the validity of our involvement, his lack of understanding or care to look into our lives to make sure what he was saying was true, has meant he has dismissed people who this inquiry is for.”The inquiry was ordered in June, on the recommendation of the Whitehall troubleshooter Louise Casey, who carried out an audit into group-based child sexual exploitation.Casey’s review found “disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds” were among “suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation” in some areas of the country but cautioned that it was difficult to paint an accurate national picture as there was no ethnicity data in most cases.The women who backed Phillips added that, while they had been abused by Asian men, they were “aware the inquiry is not just about us”. Some of the group were also abused by men from other ethnic backgrounds.About 30 people who have suffered group-based abuse were asked to join a panel to help appoint a chair and shape the terms of reference. Five have resigned amid claims the government tried to dilute the scope of the inquiry beyond street-based grooming gangs. The panel was asked if it should have a “broader focus” and look at other types of child sexual abuse. They have said they will return only if Phillips resigns.Ellie-Ann Reynolds, who quit the panel saying the process had become “less about the truth and more about a cover-up”, appeared on Monday alongside the Reform leader at a press conference in London.Farage said: “Five of the grooming gang victims, those that feel insulted, have withdrawn from the inquiry, but you’ll be told there are five who insist that Jess Phillips stays in place and that the inquiry continues.“But here’s the truth about the other five. There are two very distinctly different groups of young people who are sexually abused and raped by adults.“And what has happened with this inquiry is the government have, quite deliberately, from the very start, widened the scope out from those who were victims of Pakistani grooming gangs and brought in other women.“I’m not demeaning or diminishing in any way the treatment that [they] have been through. I’m just pointing out they were victims, survivors now, of a very different kind of sexual abuse.”The women who backed Phillips said they worry that focusing only on street grooming will exclude those whose group-based exploitation had begun online, through peers or family members.They added: “There is no point holding an inquiry if the scope is so small the decision is already made before it begins.”Two of the group have written memoirs about their experiences of predominantly Asian grooming gangs, using the pseudonyms Scarlett Jones and Caitlin Spencer.Two more survivors, using the pseudonyms Claire and Katie, said they felt unable to share details of their abuse “through fear of their safety”, but insisted they were victims of “traditional” grooming gangs.Samantha Walker-Roberts, who was kidnapped in 2006 from a police station in Oldham, Greater Manchester, and trafficked around the town to be abused, aged 12, by multiple men, also signed the letter backing Phillips.Although her experiences took place over a short period of time, she wants them to be examined by an inquiry as she fears the group who targeted her may have other victims.The Reform MP Lee Anderson said the party would “need to have a proper, grown-up, adult conversation” with the women about the nature of their abuse.He added: “With regards to what Nigel has said, that’s up to Nigel. We will speak to him later about that.”Reform UK has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsGrooming gangs inquiryNigel FarageReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

They have said goodbye to the politics of negativity, of hate, of ‘it can’t be done.’“Let’s also turn the page on Wilders and work on a splendid future for our beautiful country … in the coming years, we will do everything we can to show all Dutch people … that politics and the government can be there for them again,” he added.Even if final results put the Freedom party in first place, Wilders’ short-lived period in power afterthe PVV’s shock victory in 2023seems over for now: all major mainstream parties have ruled out joining a coalition with his party.The election was triggered byWilders pulling the PVV out of the governmentin June, less than a year after it took office, after the partners refused to endorse his radical anti-refugee plans, widely seen as unworkable or illegal or both.Wilders acknowledged his party was unlikely to be part of the new government, but said his decision to quit was justified. “The voter has spoken. We had hoped for a different outcome but we stuck to our guns,” he posted on social media.Under the proportional Dutch system, 0.67% of the vote yields one MP, a bar that was cleared by 15 of the 27 parties contesting the election – which included parties for the over-50s, for youth, for animals, for a universal basic income and for sport.That fragmentation means no single party ever wins a majority, and the country has been governed by coalitions – made up, in its three most recent governments, of four parties – for more than a century. The next government will be no different.“When it comes to forming a new government in the Netherlands, election results are not the end, they’re the start,” said Rem Korteweg of the Clingendael Institute in The Hague. “The cards have been shuffled. Now the negotiations can begin.”The centre-left GreenLeft/Labour alliance (GL/PvdA) had a poor night, finishing third with 20 seats – five fewer than in the outgoing parliament and than polls had predicted – prompting the party leader, Frans Timmermans, to step down.View image in fullscreenFrans Timmermans makes a resignation speech in Rotterdam.Photograph: Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesThe veteran former European Commission vice-president said he took “full responsibility” for the result, adding: “It is time for me to take a step back and hand over the leadership of our movement to the next generation.”But the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDA), who also campaigned on a return to “decent” and “responsible” politics in the Netherlands after the most extreme government in the country’s recent history, nearly quadrupled their seat tally to 19.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The VVD leader,Dilon Yeşilgöz, has “repeatedly said she wants a rightwing coalition”, noted Armida van Rij of the Centre for European Reform.An alternative, more rightwing constellation might bring in the radical right JA21, which gained eight seats to finish on nine. Unlike the VVD, all other outgoing coalition members lost heavily, with one, New Social Contract, failing to win any seats at all.In a campaign dominated by migration, healthcare costs and the Netherlands’ acute housing crisis, Wilders’ PVV had led consistently in the polls until days before the election, when the mainstream centre-left to moderate right parties caught up.View image in fullscreenD66 leader Rob Jetten greets the exit poll.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockWilders had said “democracy would be dead” if the PVV ended up as the largest party and was shut out of government. His opponents said first place did not guarantee government and any coalition with a majority is democratic.Coalition-building in the Netherlands can take months. After the vote, aninformateurtests possible options that could command a majority. Potential partners then negotiate an agreement and must undergo a confidence vote in parliament.Whatever the future cabinet’s complexion, it will need to act. Despite the campaign’s focus on migration, voters have consistently said the country’s biggest problem is its housing shortage, estimated at about 400,000 homes in a nation of 18 million.Unless that question – and other pressing issues, including soaring healthcare costs – are properly addressed, analysts warn that the Netherlands’ apparent return to what looks like a more commonsense form of government could prove short-lived.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropeGeert WildersnewsShareReuse this content"

He will be sentenced on 10 November.An earlier trial had fallen apart after jurors were unable to come to an assessment on the murder charge. The jury deliberated for eight hours before returning with the guilty verdict on Wednesday.Lloyd-Hall had pleaded not guilty to the murder charge, saying he had not intended to kill Pitman. The prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward KC had earlier told the Old Bailey how “revelry turned to tragedy in the blink of an eye” on 31 December 2023.The court heard how the two boys had gone with their own groups of friends to the hill to watch the fireworks that evening, but 20 minutes before midnight, the boys had clashed after Pitman bumped into one of Lloyd-Hall’s friends.Pitman had been playfighting and kicking when he lost his balance and fell into the boy behind him. That led to shoving and a confrontation, with Lloyd-Hall getting involved and threatening Pitman. Mobile phone footage shown to the court showed Lloyd-Hall pulling a knife from his waistband and swinging the knife down on to Pitman’s neck, as Pitman swung a punch.Video footage from a police bodycam then showed Pitman stumbling through the crowd and holding his neck, seeking help from nearby police officers. He collapsed shortly after and despite first aid efforts by police died a few minutes before midnight.Lloyd-Hall ran away from the scene after the stabbing and only turned himself in to a police station, with his father in attendance, after police released images for his search.‘We’re in a crisis’: Idris Elba calls for more action on youth violence in UKRead moreHe said he thought he had only hit Pitman with the sheath of his blade, and it was an attempt to get away from him. “I did not want him to lose his life,” he told the court. “I feel horrible for what I caused. It was not my intention.”The court had earlier heard Pitman described as a “lively” college student. He was one of 18 teenagers stabbed to death in London in 2023.The Metropolitan police released a statement on Tuesday marking the tragedy.“Harry was only 16 years old when he was stabbed. He had spent the evening with friends enjoying the fireworks before an altercation with a complete stranger led to him tragically losing his life,” said DI Daniel Catmull, from the Met’s specialist crime command.“While justice has been served, the tragic loss of such a bright and promising young life, whose vibrant spirit touched so many, is a profound tragedy that will forever be felt by all who knew and loved him.”Explore more on these topicsKnife crimeLondonCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Cai has been described as the top lieutenant of China’s president, Xi Jinping, andhas been revealedas the suspect receiving British political intelligence that formed part of thecollapsed Chinese spying prosecution.Iain Duncan Smith, the MP and former leader of the Conservative party who has been pressing for the government to launch a fresh investigation into the latest Telegraph takeover, wrote on X: “Let me put it plainly. The meeting between John Thornton and Cai Qi is a red flag and a serious one.“It demands that the culture secretary, @lisanandy, trigger an investigation into RedBird’s bid for the Telegraph under our media freedom laws.“The risk of undue Chinese influence here is overwhelming and that’s not just my view; it’s supported by formal legal opinion, given Thornton’s deep and well-documented connections with senior figures in the Chinese Communist party.”The development is the latest piece of intrigue in a long-running Telegraph takeover saga.RedBird Capital – which holds various investments, including astake in the parent companyof Liverpool Football Club – is in the process of acquiringTelegraph Media Groupfrom a connected organisation, RedBird IMI.RedBird IMI was forced to put the titles up for sale in spring 2024 after the then Conservative government passed a law blocking foreign states or associated individualsfrom owning newspaper assets in the UK.While a quarter of RedBird IMI’s funding came from RedBird Capital, the remainder wassourced from International Media Investments(IMI) – which is controlled by Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and owner of Manchester City FC.The Labour governmenteased the banon foreign governments owning stakes in UK newspapers this year by allowing them to hold up to 15% of titles, which paved the way for the RedBird Capital offer that would lead to IMI retaining a 15% Telegraph stake.The deal, however, has continued to be viewed with suspicion.In the House of Lords this month, theLiberal Democrat peer Christopher Fox said: “My Lords, as we know, a fund with Abu Dhabi money and probably Chinese money is acquiring what in global terms is a small player, relatively small, but the Telegraph is significant in the UK.“The best explanation for their motives that I can come up with is that they’re buying influence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marshall had also been in the running to buy the Telegraph titles.A spokesperson for RedBird Capital said: “RedBird’s funds are backed by a diverse group of leading global blue-chip institutional investors and family offices which do not include any institutions or individuals fromChina. There is no Chinese influence in RedBird’s proposed acquisition of the Telegraph.“We are happy to work with any regulator or government body that wants to look into the proposed transaction.”A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport did not comment, citing a “quasi-judicial process”.Explore more on these topicsTelegraph Media GroupNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesChinaDaily TelegraphSunday TelegraphnewsShareReuse this content"

By the early hours of Wednesday the public prosecutor said the death toll had risen to 132 – higher than during São Paulo’s notorious Carandiru prison massacre in 1992, when 111 prisoners lost their lives.Between 4.15am and 9am, when government body collectors finally arrived, the Guardian witnessed pickup trucks delivering dozens of corpses to a square in Vila Cruzeiro named after Saint Luke the Evangelist.0:52Brazilian police raid Rio favelas in deadliest operation against gangs – video“I’ve never seen anything like this … I still haven’t managed to comprehend what has happened. I feel empty. I have no words,” said Raull Santiago, a favela activist, as another cargo of corpses arrived, sending local women scrambling in search of their missing husbands, brothers or sons.Many, perhaps all of the dead men – most seemingly in their late teens, 20s and 30s – are likely to have been members of the local drug faction, the Red Command, which Tuesday’s operation was intended to target. Most of the corpses were unclothed but a few wore ghillie suits, camouflage clothing used by snipers, hunters and nature photographers to conceal themselves in foliage.View image in fullscreenPeople search woodland for bodies.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianBut there was fury among the scores of people who had flocked to the plaza and who claimed police had summarily executed the young men instead of detaining them. “Irrespective of whether these people were involved in the local drug trade or not, we don’t have the death penalty in Brazil … They should have been arrested,” Santiago said.“Murderers! Murderers!” cried Cida Santana, recalling how her son, Fabio, had messaged her at about 3pm on Tuesday to tell her he had been shot in the foot and was trying to surrender to police.Sixteen hours later, Fabio’s corpse was shrouded under a blood-stained floral rug with what looked like knife wounds to his chest. “My God! Work a miracle, God!” Santana begged, as she collapsed on to the ground beside her child.But there was to be no resurrection for Santana’s son, nor for the dozens of other bodies lined up beside him outside a sushi restaurant with bullet wounds to their limbs, torsos and heads. One had been decapitated, the person’s head stashed inside an olive green pouch that was placed on the ground. Several of the men had badly broken bones or what looked like puncture wounds in their flesh.View image in fullscreenCida Santana lost her son, Fabio, in the raid.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianAt times, as pickup trucks continued to deliver the dead, a stunned silence fell over the throng. No one – not the veteran crime reporters, nor the gangland preachers, nor the battle-weary favela residents – had ever seen bloodshed on this scale. Until this week, Rio’s deadliest police operation had beena 2021 raidon another Red Command stronghold, Jacarezinho, when 28 people were killed.“It’s surreal,” said Antônio Carlos Costa, a church leader and human rights campaigner, calling for the immediate removal of Rio’s governor, Cláudio Castro, who is an ally of Brazil’s former far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.Costa called the killings “a historic humiliation” for Brazil on the eve of next month’s Cop climate summit in the Amazon city of Belém.At other moments, onlookers exploded in rage as they took in the nightmarish scene. Shell-shocked friends and relatives of the deceased ripped off the sheets covering their mangled bodies and demanded that journalists film the butchery to show the world.“Help us, please!” implored Cláudia Silva, 53, shaking with rage as she denounced what she and others called “a genocide”. “When they come in here, they kill even the rats,” she said of the police.“This was a slaughter, not an operation. They came here to kill,” said Santana as she sat on a blood-covered bin liner next to her son’s corpse.“In 30 years working [in the favelas] this is the greatest act of savagery, the biggest massacre I have seen,” said Flávia Pinheiro Fróes, a lawyer who had come to support the families of the dead.View image in fullscreenFlávia Pinheiro Fróes, a lawyer, joins the devastated family and friends of the dead.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianCastro continued to defend the operation amid a growing chorus of outrage, including from the UN’s human rights office which said it was horrified by the killings. Rio’s governor celebrated “a harsh blow” to the heavily-armed drug traffickers who have seized control of many of Rio’s hundreds of favelas over the past 40 years. “The only victims yesterday were the police,” Castro said of the four officers killed during Tuesday’s intense gun battles with criminals he called “narco-terrorists”.As the governor spoke, Edmar Augusto, a priest with a purple stole draped over his shoulders, sprinkled holy water on the more than 50 bodies that had accumulated at the entrance to the favela.View image in fullscreenEdmar Augusto sprinkles holy water over the bodies of young men.Photograph: Alan Lima/The Guardian“We don’t want war. We want peace,” Augusto, 50, told the favela’s mourners, his voice breaking with emotion. “So many families are crying. And I want to cry with them. Society cannot stay silent,” the priest bellowed, staring skywards to recite the Lord’s prayer.As he waited for another car-load of bodies to arrive, Correia, the community leader, recalled how two decades earlier a group of local evangelical missionaries had warned that the favela would one day suffer a momentous bloodbath. “We didn’t believe them. We never believed it would happen,” he said. “[But] they prophesised this, and today it has come to pass.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilRio de JaneiroAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Farage has been everywhere,” one MPsaid at the time. “The mood was: this has been a fucking disaster. We’ve been given nothing to do. The government just cleared the pitch.”Thefebrile atmosphereon the backbenches has largely given way to despondency since the summer, but the anxiety around Reform’s persistent lead in the polls in the run up to next May’s elections remains.So Reform’s decision to hold a burst of press conferences, at which they take dozens of questions, three days in a row this week to coincide with the news agenda slowing down during the school half-term break, has sent a chill down the spines of someLabourMPs.That Farage and his key lieutenants brush aside scrutiny on detail and brazenly push half-truths and pet theories that could be turned into news stories does little to reassure them – he gets away with responses more mainstream politicians would not.“Whenever Farage opens his mouth he seems to create news, even if he’s talking absolute bollocks, and somehow that sustains Reform’s lead in the polls,” said one frustrated Labour MP.“At least we haven’t vacated the pitch like we did in the summer, but we still haven’t got our strategy on Reform right. We can’t just take them on, we also need to shout about our own alternative. Whatever we do at the moment it doesn’t seem to make much difference.”Reform shows no sign of altering its strategy. “We’re at our best when we’re on our front foot. If you want people to vote for you, you have to set out your long-term vision. If we stay silent on the big issues how are people supposed to know what we stand for?” one Reform insider said.They say their policies, which this week included announcements on anoverhaul of government,grooming gangsandwelfare cuts, are properly costed, after Farage’splan to save £234bnfrom migrant benefit cuts fell apart when it emerged 4 million EU nationals would be exempt.Farage hopes to dominate the agenda again next week, with a big speech on Mondayoverhauling the party’s economic policy– which Labour and the Tories see as a key weakness – by committing to cut spending before reducing taxes if he makes it into power.Two days later, Richard Tice, the economic spokesperson, has been invited to deliver a lecture at Bloomberg, which has previously hosted Rachel Reeves and her predecessor as chancellor, Jeremy Hunt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But not everybody in Labour is over-worried.“It was tactically smart of Reform to do press conferences over the summer, but when the business of government is happening it gets lost,” said one senior Labour source.Pitch-rolling before the budgetandplans to house migrants in military baseshave grabbed more headlines.Labour insiders question the wisdom of Farage’s attempts to put himself in the spotlight. “He’s a big attention-seeker. But he didn’t perform well this week – he came across as too snarly and grumpy on Tuesday andcouldn’t answer the question on Sarah Pochin,” one said.“They’re announcing policy too soon. It’s years until the election and the public just don’t care. The novelty value of Farage will wear off quite quickly and he’ll leave himself exposed. We think there’s a cap on their support.”It is not yet clear whether there is, in fact, a limit to Reform’s electoral appeal, but while Farage attempts to juggle insurgency with casting himself as a prime minister in waiting, Labour cannot afford to be complacent.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsReform UKLabourNigel FarageanalysisShareReuse this content"

He reflects on pain, pride and regretInterview byEmine Saner. Portrait byNadav KanderWed 29 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 12.48 EDTShareView image in fullscreenDon McCullin photographed at his home in Somerset, October 2025War photographers are not meant to reach 90. “Fate has had my life in its hands,” saysDon McCullin. Over his seven-decade career covering wars, famines and disasters McCullin has been captured, and escaped snipers, mortar fire and more. How does it feel to be a survivor? “Uncomfortable,” he says. No wonder he finds solace in the beautiful still lifes he creates in his shed, or in the images he composes in the countryside around his Somerset home.McCullin is proud of escaping the extreme poverty he was born into, and the interesting and adventurous life he has lived, but he says the accolades – including a knighthood in 2017 – make him uneasy. “I feel as if I’ve been over-rewarded, and I definitely feel uncomfortable about that, because it’s been at the expense of other people’s lives.” But he has been the witness to atrocity, I point out, and that’s important. “Yes,” he says, uncertainly, “but, at the end of the day, it’s done absolutely no good at all. Look at Ukraine. Look at Gaza. I haven’t changed a solitary thing. I mean it. I feel as if I’ve been riding on other people’s pain over the last 60 years, and their pain hasn’t helped prevent this kind of tragedy. We’ve learned nothing.” It makes him despair.The most harrowing photographs are McCullin’s best-known, but his career, which began 67 years ago, spans many genres, including beautiful landscapes, portraits and photographs of ancient ruins and antiquities. On a recent late autumn day, we sat at his table, surrounded by laden bookshelves, in a lovely room overlooking land on which he has planted many trees, and he talked me through his life in pictures.Guvnors, Finsbury Park gang, 1958View image in fullscreenMcCullin grew up in north London, in a damp two-room basement in a tenement building. His father sufferedchronic asthma and died when McCullin was 14. He left school soon afterwards.National service with the RAF followed, and that was where he discovered photography. This photograph, of a gang of young men McCullingrew up with, was published in the Observer when he was 23 and had been working at a London animation studio. It started his career.In Finsbury Park, people’s doors were always open. My mother was never home because she worked on the railway. We had gaslight, and there were lots of horses around, delivering coal or for the brewery. Sometimes, they’d let you sit on the back of one. I come from another culture.During the war, I was evacuated three times, and each time I’d come back to a London that was more derelict. We would climb these bombed buildings. It was like climbing inside cathedrals, the carcasses of these buildings, and we’d sit at the top eating chips stuffed into a roll. In a way, I had a real childhood. Sometimes, we would get the train up to Cockfosters, run across the live rails into the countryside and capture grass snakes and birds’ eggs. Children don’t have a life like that today.I used to get battered by bullies. I’d win the odd fight, but I would lose a lot of others. These boys in the photograph, all they talked about was violence, robbery, housebreaking. One of them was an armed robber who had been in prison.I was surrounded by violence and bigotry and it was getting to me. These people hadn’t travelled like me. I’d been to Sudan, Egypt and Cyprus with the RAF, and started developing a mind of my own.But my background of no education, bigotry and all that awfulness makes me feel like the impostor in the room. Despite all I have learned, I still feel uncomfortable.Near Checkpoint Charlie, Berlin, 1961View image in fullscreenBy the early 1960s, McCullin was freelancing for the Observer and other newspapers and magazines. He and his first wife,Christine,were still living in Finsbury Park in a two-room flat – one room was bathroom, kitchen and his dark room combined.I was sitting in a cafe with my wife in Paris on a belated honeymoon. I saw a man reading Le Figaro, which had a picture of an East German soldier with his Kalashnikov. I said to her: “When we go back, would you mind if I went to Berlin?” We’d only been married a few months. I asked the Observer if they wanted pictures, and they said: “We’re not sending you. It’s up to you if you go or not.” I went with a camera that I had used to photograph the Finsbury Park gang. It was a Rolleicord I had bought when I finished my national service. It was very difficult to compose [pictures with it] because it’s in a square format. I had pawned it once for five quid, and the one decent thing my mother did was she got that camera out. I saw other international photographers arriving, draped in all the latest cameras and I remember feeling shabby.Protest picture during the Cuban missile crisis, Whitehall, 1962View image in fullscreenThis man ran away from Trafalgar Square and they immediately blocked his way to Whitehall. I did a lot of political demonstrations when I worked on the Observer in the early 60s, and I loved it. There used to be brawls some days, which I could get involved in, photographically. I find this photograph amusing. Despite everything, there is laughter in me. I’ve got a huge sense of humour.The Cyprus civil war, Limassol, 1964View image in fullscreenDuringthe first war he covered, McCullin found himself in the middle of a gun battle when Greekssurrounded theTurkish quarter of Limassol. Turkish civilians had hidden in communal buildings, such as cinemas, where this photograph of a Turkish gunmanwas taken.I went into the Observer newspaper – I had a contract with them for two days a week for 15 guineas – and the editor said: “Would you consider going to cover the civil war in Cyprus?” I felt as if I was levitating. On my first day in Limassol, I took this picture, by the side of a cinema. It looks like a Hollywood still: the man is far too well dressed. In the evening, when the battle stopped, I had nowhere to stay, and the Turkish police said I could sleep in a cell block. That was my baptism in war.On another day, I was walking towards a village, and a British solder said: “Dead body up there.” I walked, looking at the ground, afraid to raise my head and I found the first body. I went to a house, knocked on the door, but there was no answer. I gently opened it and the first thing that hit me was a warm smell of blood. There was blood all over the floor. There were two dead brothers, and their father was in the kitchen at the back, murdered by the Greeks. I was in the house, photographing, when suddenly the door opened and several people came in, including a woman, crying for her dead husband, who she’d only married a couple of weeks before. I thought, “They’re going to attack me”, but they didn’t. They were very generous towards me.I felt I had chosen the right thing to do, because I found what I was photographing so outrageous that I couldn’t wait to get back to England and see my pictures published, to show the world how wrong it was. When you’re young and ambitious, you haven’t really worked it all out. You’re drawn to this tragedy, but it doesn’t belong to you – you’re imposing yourself upon the situation. You’re not welcome or invited and you’re stealing in a way. You’re stealing other people’s emotional tragedies. You’re stealing images of people, dead, who haven’t given you consent. I was aware it wasn’t totally right, and I believe it to this day. That’s why I come back here and do the English landscape. I feel as if I have to release myself from my guilt, which I still carry.Suspected Lumumbist freedom fighters being tortured, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1964View image in fullscreenTheGerman magazine Quicksent McCullinto cover events inDRC,where followers of theassassinated prime minister Patrice Lumumbahad captured the eastern part of the country. Arriving in what was thenLéopoldville(nowKinshasa), he discovered members of the media were being banned from leaving. Meeting a mercenary in his hotel bar, one of many mercenaries employed by the government to fight the rebels, McCullinpersuaded him to lend him a uniform and get himon a military plane to the rebel strongholdStanleyville(nowKisangani).I got on the runway in the early morning and before I got on the plane, they were running off people’s names. I thought: “Oh my God, they’re going to discover I’m not a mercenary.” The guy said: “What’s your name?” I said: “McCullin.” He said: “Get on the plane”, and I flew 1,000km to where [military leader] Joseph-Désiré Mobutu said no press were allowed to go. When I got to the other end, I found [the loyalist gendarmerie] were torturing boys as young as 17 and maybe younger. They were shooting them in the back of the head and kicking them in the river. These boys were Lumumbist. They were beating them; one of the boys had been stabbed in the face with a knife.Sheep going to slaughter, London, 1965View image in fullscreenThat was on the Caledonian Road, where there used to be big abattoirs on either side. I was working on a magazine story with the writer Eric Newby, who has long died. So many people I’ve worked with have died, I feel as if I’m one of the few left who knew this world I worked in.Grenade thrower, Hue, Vietnam, 1968View image in fullscreenMcCullin went to cover the Vietnam war for the first time in 1965, and returned several times.I joined these US marines, and they said it was going to be a 24-hour operation in the ancient city of Hue. Twelve days later, we were still there – they got a terrible hiding. They lost about 40 men; a sniper was picking them off every day. You can see the devastation in this photograph. I slept in a hut, on the floor, under a table, using my helmet as a pillow. I loved being tested to the limit. In the mornings, I always left the hut one way, and then one day I decided to turn another way. Behind the hut, I found a dead North Vietnamese soldier who had been lying almost head-to-head with me. He was about 18, his eyes were open and full of rainwater.Shell-shocked US marine, Hue, Vietnam, 1968View image in fullscreenI am slightly fed up with my more known pictures, because they’re classically, iconically composed. So what are they saying? They could almost be negative because they’re too perfectly designed by me, and people would say: “It’s almost artistic.” I’m afraid of falling off that very fine line.I never harmed any of the people in my pictures. I didn’t kill them. I didn’t torture them, the way this man has been tortured by his own breakdown.Every night, I remember the battle that that man was in. I didn’t get his damaged brain, but my brain has never been free of certain images. I have bad dreams and this pause every night before I sleep, but I’ve never suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.I was moving fast. I would go straight back to another war. There’s an adrenaline rush. It’s all very selfish and stupid, but you’re not telling the truth if you say you didn’t find some sides of it exciting. The excitement of incoming shells. But then you think, “That shell just blew some guy’s leg off,” or killed another four or five guys. I’ve been swimming in a whirlpool of huge misadventure, and it’s been a cesspit, really, my life. There’s no other way of describing it.I’ve risked my life a few times. I was in a gun battle once in Cyprus, and I saw an old lady who couldn’t walk. I thought, if someone doesn’t do something, that old girl is going to die in the next five minutes. I gave my friend my cameras and ran and picked her up and then ran back with her. I thought: “I can’t keep taking all the time. You’ve got to do something, give something back.” In Vietnam, I carried a soldier away from battle on my shoulders. He had been hit by a bullet and was in such pain. I thought: “I’ve been stealing all these years. I’ve got to hand some of that back.” But you risk your life doing it.Starving boy, Biafra, 1968View image in fullscreenThe day after his third child was born, McCullin left to cover the war that had broken out sinceBiafra had broken away from Nigeria in 1967. After witnessing battles, executions and more horrors, then coming down with malaria, McCullin was about to see the sights that would probably haunt him most, at a hospital for war-orphaned children, where hundreds were starving.This is possibly the most atrocious picture I’ve ever taken in my life. There were 600 children dying in this camp. They were dropping down and dying in front of me. When they see white people, they think you’re an aid worker coming to bring them food. So you can understand my guilt, can’t you? It was not kind of me to be there, really.That boy is holding a tin of corned beef, which he had completely licked dry to get every gram. I gave him a barley sugar sweet, which I had in my pocket, and he went away, licking it. I went off and spoke to a Médecins Sans Frontières doctor, and I felt someone take hold of my hand. It was the boy. It made me feel so bloody guilty.I haven’t printed that picture for nearly 30 years now. I don’t want to see it coming up in the dark room. I even feel guilty that these pictures – I have about 70,000 negatives – are in the house.Homeless Irish man, London, 1969View image in fullscreenThere are social wars on your doorstep. People used to write me letters, saying, “I want to be a war photographer.” I’d say: “Help yourself – it’s in your cities.” This man slept by a fire in Spitalfields market, very close to the City of London, which generates billions and billions of pounds for the people who own it. You couldn’t have more of a contrast. One side is everything, and the other side is nothing.I call this picture Neptune, because he looks like the sea god. I thought he was one of the most handsome men I had ever seen.Catholic youth escaping CS gas fired by British soldiers, Londonderry, 1971View image in fullscreenDuring the late 1960s, McCullin was barely home. He covered war in Chad and trekked to rebel camps in Eritrea. Even though he was injured while photographing the civil war in Cambodia – watching the man who had taken the full force of the mortar blast die in front of him on the way to hospital – he was back several months later. He photographed tribes in the Amazon rainforest, whose lands were being taken, and the refugee crisis caused bywar in Pakistan. On that particular trip,McCullin decided he was more interested in showing the impact of violence on civilians – something he was able to do in Northern Ireland.I spent six weeks in Northern Ireland. This is the gassing, in the Bogside area, of Catholic youths. I got gassed really badly that day, and hit in the back with a rubber bullet. I was led away, totally blind, into a house where there was a hell of a lot of swearing and shouting. “Get him a damp cloth!” It was chaotic.Man and British soldier, Londonderry, 1971View image in fullscreenThat man is coming home from work and that soldier’s behaving like a soldier. It does seem to be the extreme contrast of a normal man coming back from a normal day, having to share the street.Local boys in Bradford, 1972View image in fullscreenLocal Boys in Bradford 1972Photograph: Copyright: Don McCullin/Courtesy The TateBack from whatever war zone he had been sent to, McCullin would set himself photographic projects. He often went to the north of England, drawn to documenting people’s hard lives in run-down industrial landscapes.I used to walk the streets, and the people in the north are very friendly, a lot more trusting than the people in the south. I went to Bradford, and I saw that amazing slogan on the wall, against the racism of that period. I’m proud of my work in the north of England. I was evacuated as a child to Lancashire, to a chicken farm for 18 weeks, and I had a really horrible time. That is one reason why I don’t treat other people badly.If I had been to university, I think I would have been a more sensitive person, even more than I already am, and I would not have been able to sleep among dead bodies and rat-infested trenches and things like that. Also, I knew how to conduct myself. You smell poverty when you go into a house and it smells just like the house I grew up in as a boy.A winter’s victim, Hertfordshire, undatedView image in fullscreenIn 1972, McCullin and other journalists were captured inUganda, and he was sure he would die in the notoriousMakindye prison, listening to fellow prisoners being taken away to be beaten or executed, and watching trucks taking bodies away. After four days, he was released and deported, arriving home to his family – now living in a farmhouse in Hertfordshire.I found this sparrow outside my house one day, at dusk. I’ve got good eyes, I spot stuff on the floor, everywhere. I kind of X-ray things.Young Christians celebrating the death of a Palestinian girl, Beirut, 1976View image in fullscreenHaving been to Lebanon several times in the 1960s, when Beirut was a decadent playground for the rich, McCullin returned to cover thecivil war in the mid-1970s. Arriving in Beirut, he decided attaching himself to theChristian Phalangemilitia would give him the best access. Over the next few days, he photographed the massacres in a district in east Beirut populated largely by Palestinians – which wouldput McCullin’s name on a death warrant.One morning I was told: “We’re going to Karantina and we’re going to clear out the rats.” They meant Palestinians. I slept in the morgue that night and then in the early morning, they attacked the area.I was told to leave the area by the Christians. They said: “If we see you taking any more photographs, we’re going to kill you.” I’d been watching them kill Palestinians in groups, pouring magazines into men’s heads and exploding them. I was leaving when I heard this strange music and I saw this. This is a dead Palestinian girl lying in the rain, and this boy had a mandolin, which he found in one of the houses. He couldn’t play it, but he was giving the impression that he was serenading the death of this girl. I was looking around, thinking: “I’ve got to get this picture.” I took it very quickly.Dew pond, Somerset, 1988View image in fullscreenBy the mid-1980s, McCullin’s type of work had fallen out of favour at the Sunday Times, newly acquired by Rupert Murdoch, and he left. Personally, it had also been a difficult time – he had been injured inEl Salvador, after falling off a roof in a gun battle, and he left his first wife for the woman who would become his second, something he says he still feels guilty about (he has been marriedto histhird wife, Catherine, awriter and podcaster,formore than 20 years). Money was short, and he turned to advertising photography, even though it didn’t fulfil him. Moving to Somerset, he found peace in photographing the landscape around his new home.Dew ponds are very rare things. They are almost mythological. They’re completely round, and this one was at the foot of a hill fort. We’re surrounded here in Somerset by history and myth. I use that. This was in the early morning, but I usually work in the evening, when the sun is going down.I can stand in these fields for two or three hours and not get a picture. That doesn’t mean to say I’m disappointed, I’ve had the privilege of standing there. There’s nothing greater.Photojournalism has taken a nosedive, and it’s because newspaper proprietors want beautiful women, rich people, celebrities. They do not want my kind of pictures in their paper, spoiling their day. They don’t want that tragedy.Tulips with a mind of their own, undatedView image in fullscreenI study things. You watch tulips, they start in a very kind of pristine way, and in the end they start dancing in different directions. This is free of charge, a total joy ride. They can’t say to me: “Don’t photograph us in our deaths.”The road to the Somme, France, 1999View image in fullscreenI was commissioned by Royal Mail to create a commemorative stamp of the first world war. I was in a French bistro one day having lunch and it had been raining. I was going back when I suddenly saw this silvery wet road, and I swung my car around. I thought that that horizon would be the huge graveyard of thousands of men who didn’t want to die, men who hadn’t had a life at the age of 18 and younger.Refugee camp, Chad, 2007View image in fullscreenI was sent by Oxfam to photograph refugee camps in Chad [people fleeing violence in Darfur].In places I’ve worked, I have seen television crews coming in, treading on kids and pushing people around, thinking they are more important. I’ve always been tough with those people – growing up in Finsbury Park meant I wasn’t a pushover. But when it comes to my work, I am very sensitive, very polite. I’m a human being. I would never have got pictures of people who are injured and angry and hurt without that, and I’ve managed to allow them to give me that moment of trust. If I wasn’t thinking like that, my pictures wouldn’t have a sensitive way of trying to speak to you.The exhibitionDon McCullin: A Desecrated Serenityis at Hauser & Wirth, New York, until 8 November.

But how the 80-tonne beasts survive so long has never been fully explained.Now scientists have found hints of an answer and are drawing up plans to see whether the same biological trick can be performed in humans. If so, it raises hopes for boosting healthy ageing and protecting organs and tissues during surgery and transplantations, they say.“We were looking to understand the mechanisms of the exceptional longevity of the bowhead whale, the longest-living mammal,” said Prof Vera Gorbunova, a biologist at the University of Rochester in New York. “What we found is that maybe part of the mechanism is through very accurate and efficient repair of DNA breaks.”All living organisms suffer DNA damage over the course of their lives. Cells attempt to mend the damage, but the repairs are not always effective. This leads to mutations building up over time, which can raise the risk of cancer and drive ageing by impairing how well cells and tissues function.Supercentenarian gives scientists insight on secrets of healthy old ageRead moreGorbunova and her colleagues found that bowhead whales were particularly good at repairing a form of DNA damage in which both strands of the DNA double helix are severed. As a result, the whales acquired fewer mutations. “What we’re finding is that these kinds of repairs are very important for long life,” she said.Through a series of experiments on whale cells, they showed that DNA repair is enhanced by a protein called CIRBP, which is triggered by cold exposure. Bowhead whales spend their lives in Arctic waters and produce 100 times more CIRBP than humans.“This strategy, which does not eliminate damaged cells but faithfully repairs them, may be contributing to the exceptional longevity and low cancer incidence in the bowhead whale,” the researcherswrote in Nature.The team went on to explore what happened when they increased levels of CIRBP in human cells. Boosting the protein doubled the proportion of double-strand breaks that cells repaired. Further experiments on flies showed that extra CIRBP increased their lifespan and made them more resilient to mutation-causing radiation.“The very first conclusion we can make is there is room for improvement in humans,” Gorbunova said. “People used to think we can’t improve DNA repair, that it’s already optimal, but the whale does it better than we do.”How big a role DNA repair plays in the bowhead whale’s longevity is unclear, but the researchers are now raising mice with boosted CIRBP to see how long they live. They also hope to test whether cold-water swimmers, or those who take cold showers, have raised levels of the protein, and how persistent any boost might be.“We need to see if brief cold exposure is enough, but we’ll be looking at pharmacological ways to achieve this too,” Gorbunova said. “Not everyone wants to do cold swims.”Prof Gabriel Balmus, who studies DNA damage and repair at the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, said: “Enhancing our cells’ ability to repair DNA could, in principle, slow the ageing and associated disease processes – a notion supported by evidence from other species where stronger repair correlates with longer lifespan. Yet translating this into humans will be far from straightforward, demanding a balance between resilience and the body’s natural limits on renewal.”Explore more on these topicsScienceAgeingWhalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Does married sex need a rebrand?Wed 29 Oct 2025 19.39 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 20.28 EDTShareIn my youth, when my friends and I first started dating people, nothing was off-limits when it came to talking about our sex lives. But now, after being married for 17 years, the closest I’ve come to discussing my sex life is with my obstetrician. Not hot.Sex talk isn’t off-limits when we’re with friends who are single, dating or in new relationships. So why is mentioning anything about sex in long-term relationships kind of cringe?I’m a sex educator. Here’s the biggest myth about desire in long-term relationshipsRead moreIt could be something about respecting boundaries and protecting our partners from scrutiny, but that logic fails. I have had deep and respectful conversations about partners with friends many times, and there is an implied understanding that in sharing this information, our opinions of our partners will not change. We discuss, we learn, we move on. This would also be true if we discussed our sex lives.The same could be said when it comes to other areas of our lives. We talk about our parenting fails (numerous) and wins, dissect work dramas and family dynamics. We come from a place of zero judgment and the base assumption that they are an amazing (yet potentially flawed, as are we all) partner, parent, employee, employer, son or daughter. Nothing is off-limits.Except, apparently, sex.My friends and I have been through a lot. There have been critically sick children, brain surgeries, sick parents, grief, IVF, miscarriages, organ transplants, cancer diagnoses, caring duties, redundancies. And while we talk about how these major life changes impact our relationships, identities, financial security, mental and physical health, sex never comes up.I’d much rather hear about you getting railed on the kitchen bench than your new granite benchtopIn the early days of our son’s cancer diagnosis I readRobert Delaney’s A Heart That Works, which explores the death of his young son Henry from a brain tumour: “[W]e were so crazy and scared and holding each other so tight, we actually wound up having sex, twice, a few hours apart,” he wrote. “I realise it sounds insane to say that we had sex twice while our one-year-old had brain surgery across the street. I would normally omit that very personal fact, which might horrify some people, but I am sharing it primarily for the benefit of other parents who might have been through something similar and were terrified and crying and nearly hyperventilating with anxiety. I guess we were just so scared and wanted to be so close, and the horror of what was happening around the block didn’t erase the fact that we loved each other, and sometimes that love manifests as sex, even in the absolute worst of times. It’s probably good that we did, because in the months to come, the fear and anxiety would not always be kind to our libidos.”It was a validation of sorts, and held up a mirror to our own lives. And isn’t that something we all need? When I asked one of my oldest friends whether she spoke to other people in long-term relationships about their sex lives, it reinforced that not talking about it was in fact a universal thing. This led to a deep discussion about post-miscarriage sex, trauma and what that means in the context of sex and relationships.It wasn’t sordid, prying or pushing boundaries. And it reinforced that, in the Venn diagram of Big Life Things, sex is a circle that overlaps with almost everything.‘I felt like I was his carer’: why straight women in relationships lose interest in sexRead moreDoes married sex need a rebrand? Even when I wrote the words ‘married sex’ my face did a kind of involuntary wince. There are plenty of (usually sexist) jokes about a lack of sex in long-term relationships. And sure, once you start shitting with the door open, it’s probably a sign your romantic priorities have shifted. But common wisdom tells us the more you do something and the older you get, the better you get at it. Practice makes perfect, etc. So why is there an assumption that sex in the throes of new lust is hot, but in long-term relationships is reduced to three humps in missionary? Surely the opposite is true!It’s possible I’m just a perv. But it seems as though married sex (I did the involuntary wince face again) or sex in long term relationships is seen as taboo, which just further stops people from talking about it. And honestly, I’m happy to talk about your house renovations and all, but I’d much rather hear about you getting railed on the kitchen bench than your new granite benchtop. I want to know you’re late for dinner because you had a shower quickie while the kids were watching TV. I want to know about your fantasies and self-pleasure and the impact of grief on your libido and the way terror and love and stress and boredom impact every area of your life. Because it’s important.

First, it’s interesting to see what Dyson’s engineers have developed to try to persuade us that a £750 vacuum cleaner will be a vital addition to our lives. The other is that it usually pushes down the price of older models, which is great news for bargain hunters.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The V16 Piston Animal has several new features, the most significant being its floor head. Besides the introduction of anti-tangle combs, we haven’t seen such a departure from the status quo since Dysonlaunched its Fluffy floor headfor hard floors back in 2015. There’s arguably a good reason behind this conservatism, because Dyson’s previous designs have performed brilliantly in the cleaning tests I’ve put them through over the years. However, perhaps controversially, this model ditches the duo of brush bar and fluffy roller floor heads that have been a Dyson staple for a decade, using just one combination floor head for both carpet and hard floor.As I’ve already alluded to, the V16’s £749.99 launch price has already pushed down the prices of its predecessors. At the time of writing,some V15 modelsare reduced by £150, and the even more powerfulGen5detect(which launched at £850 just last year) has dropped to £549 at some places. The new V16 has its work cut out to persuade us that it’s better value for money than these reliable favourites.View at DysonView at John LewisHow I testedView image in fullscreenThe Dyson V16 Piston Animal’s performance in our mat cleaning test.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianI tested the Piston Animal in the same way I testedthe other cordless vacuums I’ve reviewed for the Filter. I started by measuring the suction using a vacuum gauge – somewhat problematic with Dyson vacuums because they’re programmed to cut out when the airway is blocked. It still gives an idea of their suction power, but can’t be used to reliably compare them with their rivals.Next, I tested the battery life by timing rundowns from a full charge, both in a vacuum’s most economical mode and at full power. I then tested the vacuum on a trio of troublesome spillages: flour, cat litter and pet hair. These tests are run on both hard floor and carpet, which makes for a useful comparison between vacuum cleaners, including recent Dyson models, such as the Gen5detect.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenEach cone in the head combines two brushes, one for carpets and another for hard floors.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianView at DysonView at John LewisThe new floor head is an intriguing proposition. Dyson has built its reputation on its vacuuming performance, and while suction strength and battery life play an important role in a decent vacuum, it’s the superlative performance of the two standard floor heads that have helped Dyson to stand out in recent years. The only downside is that you need to switch them over when moving from carpet to hard floor and vice versa.While the likes of Shark and Vax have tackled this problem by placing fluffy and brush rollers in parallel, Dyson’s new roller (which has the confusing name “All Floors Cones Sense”) uses two conical brush bars that sit side by side. Each cone combines two brushes, one that’s stiff enough to tease dirt out of carpets and another that’s soft and fluffy to lift dust from hard floors. The floor head automatically detects the surface you’re using it on and adjusts the rotation speed accordingly, for a gentler clean on hard floors. It also has a green light to illuminate dust and dirt on hard floors, which genuinely helps with spotting otherwise invisible dirt.View image in fullscreenSome of the included attachments.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianAlong with the new floor head, the Piston Animal comes with Dyson’s usual trio of useful handheld attachments: the crevice tool for getting into nooks and crannies; the combination brush and funnel for upholstery; and the Hair Screw Tool 2.0, which, although aimed at getting pet hairs off furniture, is also brilliant on stairs. Annoyingly for owners of previous models, the V16 uses new connectors, so you can’t use your old favourite attachments on this vacuum or vice versa.Scouring the specifications, there are a couple of other factors worth noting. The V16 has a larger collection bin capacity of 1.3l compared with previous versions that held 0.77l. This is something of a magic trick, with a redesigned interior mesh filter taking up considerably less room inside a similarly sized collection bin. There’s also a new dust compactor mechanism that helps to create more space in the bin without emptying it.It comes with an easier way of releasing the floor head from the extension wand, with a release catch now at the top of the wand as well as the bottom. That would have been more handy with the old floor head system, but you can still make good use of it if you buy the version withDyson’s Submarine floor washing attachment (£899).SpecificationsWeight:3.4kgMax suction power (quoted):315 air wattsMax suction power (measured):21kPaBattery life (quoted):1hr 10minsBattery life (tested):1hr 11minsCharge time (quoted):4hrs 30minsDust capacity:1.3lAdditional filters supplied?NoDimensions:25 x 26 x 130cmWhat we loveView image in fullscreen‘Automatic surface detection is a nice touch.’Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianAccording to the specifications, the V16 is Dyson’s most powerful cordless vacuum cleaner to date. We’ll have to take its word for it because, as I’ve mentioned already, Dyson cleaners cut out when their airway is blocked, and the V16 did so even sooner than the Gen5detect in my tests.Also improved is the battery life, which Dyson claims to have increased from an hour on the V15 to 70 minutes here. That’s in line with Dyson’s claims for the Gen5detect, but I found the V16 lasted even longer in my tests, managing 1hr 11minson its Eco setting, compared with 56 on the Gen5detect.Combining hard-floor and carpet cleaning into one floor head is a genuinely useful feature, because switching floor heads regularly can be quite annoying. Indeed, I suspect there are more than a few Dyson owners who don’t bother switching to their fluffy rollers because the standard roller bar does a sufficiently good job. This new floor head incorporates some of the benefits of the old fluffy roller, including the very useful dust light, and its automatic surface detection is a nice touch too.View image in fullscreenDyson’s Hair Screw tool was great at avoiding tangles.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt doesn’t have the same open-ended front, though, which seemed to help the fluffy roller trap and pick up everything from dust particles to larger lumps such as cat litter. Instead, it’s enclosed in a plastic shell similar to the standard floor head, except that it has a split down the middle with two brush cones, one on either side.We’ve seen a conical, anti-hair wrap concept before in Dyson’s Hair Screw tool, which has been included with top-end Dyson vacuum cleaners for a few generations. The idea is that it doesn’t just comb hair out from the roller, but also pushes it off the end of each cone, thanks to the single point of attachment and the diminishing screw shape.In practice, this worked a treat when it came to avoiding tangles. I tested it on my daughter’s bedroom floor, which is usually awash with long hair, and there was no sign of any tangling on Dyson’s new floor head. Annoyingly, it sometimes ejected clumps of hair off the end and left them on the carpet, though, which I haven’t experienced with Dyson’s previous brush bars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

With such a high price tag, it ought to be approaching perfection in my cleaning tests (just like its V15 and Gen5detect predecessors), but sadly, it fell short.In the cat litter test, I was left with more uncollected cat litter after a single forward pass and backward pull than I was with the Gen5detect, both on carpet and hard floor. The V16 was good at picking up pet hair, but no better than its predecessors, which are also excellent at this job.Flour was the most disappointing test. On both carpet and hard floor, the V16 Piston Animal failed to transfer about 30% of my test spillages into the collection bin. Some of this was left on the floor, particularly in a central smear where there’s a gap between the two rollers. I also found flour in various nooks and crannies around the floor head, including a surprising amount inside the rollers themselves.Dyson has designed the new floor head to reflect the angular shape of the cones inside, so it has a point in the middle and tapers back at each side. Without a straight edge at the front, it’s impossible to push right into the corner of a room, so you’ll have to use an attachment to pick up dust and dirt from such places.The vacuum has a colour screen that tells you how long the battery should last in minutes and seconds, which is genuinely useful, but it also flashes up information about how many microscopic particles it’s collected, of which I can’t see the point. New to this model is also a smartphone app, which I installed but didn’t appear to do anything useful.Warranty, repairability and sustainabilityView image in fullscreenSpare parts can be bought from the Dyson website.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianDyson’s cordless vacuum cleaners come with atwo-year warranty, which covers defects in the materials and workmanship. It doesn’t include wear and tear, blockages or replacement filters.All parts are available to buy as spares, from replacement rollers and filters to the main body of the unit. This means you should be able to keep a Dyson going for as long as the company keeps the parts available. To give you an idea of how long this might be, the oldest cordless vacuum that the Dyson website still has parts available for is the V6/DC56, which was launched in about 2013.TheDyson support websiteis good, with plenty of instructional videos available to demonstrate cleaning and maintenance. There’s also a full library of manuals available as PDFs and a helpline if you need to speak to someone. If you’re not inclined to fix your own, there are plenty of independent repairers who will service Dyson products and attempt to fix things for you.You canbuy a refurbished vacuum from Dysonat a reduced cost. They come with a reduced one-year guarantee and might have small scratches and blemishes from their previous owners, but are delivered in full working order.All Dyson vacuums come packaged in recyclable cardboard packaging.Dyson V16 Piston Animal: should I buy it?View image in fullscreenThe main body of the Dyson V16 Piston Animal.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianDyson’s latest vacuum cleaners are never cheap, and this one is no exception. However, new models usually perform better than their predecessors, which goes some way to justifying the price increases. That doesn’t apply here, with the new All Floors Cones Sense head failing to perform as well in my cleaning tests as Dyson’s previous models.That’s a huge disappointment for the V16 and one that makes it difficult to recommend. However, its arrival has conveniently pushed down the price of the better-performingGen5detectto its most affordable yet at some places – at least at the time of writing – and that vacuum is well worth a look.View at DysonView at John LewisFor more cleaning inspiration from the Filter:The best cordless vacuum cleaners for a spotless homeThe best robot vacuums, testedThe best steam cleaners and mopsAndy Shaw is a consumer journalist and technology addict.

But there’s a way outSahil DuttaWith living standards falling and the far right on the rise, the chancellor has the power to make decisions, not simply accept diktats from the marketsWed 29 Oct 2025 11.49 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 14.46 EDTShareMore than three decades ago, James Carville, political adviser to Bill Clinton, made what became afamous quipabout the power of bond markets to “intimidate everybody”. Clinton had entered office promising to transform the US’s infrastructure, only to be told that big public spending would spook investors, drive up borrowing costs, and sink his presidency.Today, if there is one thing that Britain has in common with Clinton’s US, it’s that the bond markets loom large again in political discussion. Clinton shelved large-scale investment plans and slashed welfare in the belief that doing so would prove his economic credibility with investors. Likewise, in Britain, ever sinceLiz Truss’s botched mini-budget, politicians have continually pointed to the risk of bond market revolt as the reason why public investment can’t be afforded.The bond markets are inarguably important. Governments and central banks support public spending by selling bonds to investors on financial markets. When those investors lose confidence, demand for bonds falls, and governments feel compelled to pay higher rates to keep investors on side. When the cost of borrowing shot up globally after the pandemic, it hit Britain particularly hard. Having borrowed significantly tobail outthe banking sector in 2008 and again during Covid, the country’s national debt now stands at101% of its GDP. This imposes real constraints on public spending. But the idea of a funding crisis is overblown.For one thing, investor demand for government debt remains resilient, and the yields – the rates government pays to borrow money when issuing bonds – are less than they were through most of the New Labour era. If the government wanted to improve living standards, it could increase taxes and borrow to invest in local government, public housing and public transport. To try to limit the impact of an adverse bond market reaction, a supportiveBank of Englandcould use its own balance sheet to buy up government debt itself. By increasing the demand for government bonds, yields overall could be contained.This is all to say that governments have choices about how they respond to the bond markets, and these choices are guided by politics, rather than cold economic necessity. If the Bank still had to raise interest rates and hit leveraged investors and mortgaged homeowners with higher costs, other interventions – such as adjusting price caps on utilities and introducing rent controls – could mitigate the broader impact. Whatever path the government and the Bank take, there are winners and losers. The point is that who benefits is a political choice – not market diktat.At the moment,Labourand the Bank seem to have made their choice: contain public investment, keep growth of disposable income in check, and hope to lower interest rates. Ironically, this approach may be intensifying bond market pressure. Take Labour’s fiscal rule. While Labour believes this is a means of reassuring investors, it actually creates uncertainty for them. Twice a year, the government has to show it is on track to keep its promise that current spending will be matched by tax revenues, and debt will be falling as a proportion of GDP, which leaves the government having to make kneejerk changes to tax and spending when forecasts change.It’s a similar story with tax. The stronger a country’s tax base, the more secure and desirable its bonds are to investors. Since publishing its manifesto, Labour hid behind the fanciful idea that growth would naturally increase tax revenues, so that redistributive taxes wouldn’t be needed. The government is now facing up to a reality where GDP has grown just 0.7% over the last year. This is an opportunity to substantially overhaul the tax system, reducing the government’s need to borrow on the bond market and providing the basis to repay when it does.Another underlying problem is that we’ve come to see central banks as institutions that are insulated from democracy or people’s everyday needs. Instead, we think of them as institutions that exist primarily to keep financial markets happy. This is inherent to the design of the Bank. Shortly after the Bank was givenformal independenceto set interest rates in 1997, an independentDebt Management Officestarted to handle the issuing of national debt. This was justified, again, in the name of the bond markets. It embedded the idea that governments had the power to tax, but not the power to shape the terms on which public spending is financed.It’s worth remembering that this wasn’t always the case. From the 1930s into the 1950s, the Bank worked with the government to restructure the national debt and lower the interest payments the government faced on its war debts. The national debt was far higher than it is now, but a so-called cheap-money policy engineered by the Bank and the Treasury supported the war, and helped Labour rebuild the country once it was over. This approach continued well into the 1970s. More recently, the Bank bought up vast holdings of government debt to support Covid bailouts, again demonstrating how closely debt management is tied to government policy.Acknowledging that public spending is a political choice taken by governments, rather than one dictated by remote financial investors, is especially important now. The poorer 40% of households in the UK are set to see their living standardsfall substantiallythrough this parliament. Public investment is one urgent part of reversing that trend, but it will be far harder to do without fixing the foundations of public finance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At present, the Bank is costing the government around£20bn a yearin its handling of public debt, partly because of the interest it pays to private banks on the reserves created during quantitative easing, and partly because it is now selling those government bonds back into the market at a loss (these sales also risk pushing up yields).The government could change the rule that leaves it liable for losses the Bank makes on interest payments and bond sales, or it could claw back some of these costs with a tax on banks’ windfalls. The Bank, meanwhile, could pause bond sales when they are loss-making. Carville had another notorious line: “It’s the economy, stupid!” A truly healthy economy will come from a government taking responsibility for delivering meaningful change, not evoking the bond markets to avoid it.Sahil Dutta is a lecturer in political economy and co-author of Unprecedented: How Covid-19 Revealed the Politics of Our EconomyExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsBondsBudgetBank of EnglandLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

This is how democracy crumblesOwen JonesWe’re watching the Orbánisation of the US – and as in Hungary, control of the media is key to consolidating powerWed 29 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 08.36 EDTShareDemocracy may be dying in the US. Whether the patient receives emergency treatment in time will determine whether the condition becomes terminal. Before Donald Trump’sreturn to the presidency, I warned of “Orbánisation” – in reference to Hungary’s authoritarian leader Viktor Orbán. There, democracy was not extinguished by firing squads or the mass imprisonment of dissidents, but by slow attrition. The electoral system was warped, civil society was targeted and pro-Orbán moguls quietly absorbed the media.Nine months on, and Orbánisation is in full bloom across the Atlantic. Billionaire Larry Ellison, theOracle co-founder, and his filmmaker son, David, have become blunt instruments in this process.Trump boaststhey are “friends of mine – they’re big supporters of mine”. Larry Ellison, second only to Elon Musk as the world’s richest man, haspoured tens of millionsinto Republican coffers. Shortly after the 2020 election, he joined a call that discussedchallenging the legitimacyof the vote. His son, David, has a history of backing Democrats – but at one time, so did Trump, his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.In August, David Ellison’s Skydance Media acquired Paramount Global with financial support from his father, leaving him as chair and CEO of the new entity. Beyond a vast slice of Hollywood, this acquisition brought control of CBS News – one of the US’s “big three” networks. During the last election,Trump demanded CBSlose its broadcasting licence over alleged political bias and even sued the network over what he called a flattering edit of Kamala Harris’s 60 Minutes interview. His mood has since improved. Ellison is “going to do the right thing” with the network,Trump crowedwhen its ownership shifted. His optimism was swiftly vindicated: aTrump appointeewas installed as CBS’s ombudsman to monitor “bias”, and Bari Weiss – a former Democrat turned anti-woke crusader – was made editor-in-chief.Now, Trump officials are briefing that they are also in favour of Paramount Skydance buying Warner Bros Discovery, the parent company of HBO and CNN. “Who owns Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) is very important to the administration,”a senior Trump officialtold the conservative New York Post. The pro-Trump newspaper states that rival bidders will face “regulatory hurdles”, with WBD’s CEO forced to consider the Trump administration’s willingness to crack down on what it sees as rampant leftwing bias across the mainstream media.Larry Ellison, meanwhile, also leads a group of investors set to take over TikTok’s US operations, with other partnersreportedly includingRupert Murdoch and Abu Dhabi’sgovernment-owned investmentcompany. Although much of Trump’s own criticism of TikTok has focused on China, key Maga figures such asJosh HawleyandMarco Rubiohave called for the app to be banned over “anti-Israel” bias, and for shifting younger Americans’ sympathies towards Palestinians. Ellison is a fervent supporter of Israel, and has previouslydonated millionsto its military through the non-profit Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. They will be pleased to have him in charge.In 2015, Safra Catz, Oracle’s Israeli-American executive chair, and former CEO, reportedly told former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barakin an emailthat: “We believe that we have to embed the love and respect for Israel in the American culture.” Oracle willhave oversightof the TikTok algorithm.But this goes much further than the Ellisons’ acquisitions. Trumpthreatened Meta ownerMark Zuckerberg would “spend the rest of his life in prison” if he crossed him. The social media mogul has little to worry about now, having done his best to ingratiate himself with the administration. He abandoned third-party factchecking in the US, dropped restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender, and appointedTrump supportersas head ofglobal affairsand to the executive board. At the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post, columnist Karen Attiah saysshe was firedfor “speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America’s apathy toward guns” after Charlie Kirk’s assassination.Liberal comedian Jimmy Kimmelhad his ABC show suspended after the pro-Trump chair of the Federal Communications Commission demanded action. TheCorporation for Public Broadcasting– long deemed hostile by Trump – has been defunded and shut down.The administration took controlover which media organisations have access to the White House, ejecting the Associated Press.US media outletswere stripped of their Pentagon credentials after refusing to only report officially authorised information issued by the Department of Defense. Trump’s lawsuits against media organisations have further cowed them.It goes far beyond media control. Witness Trump deploying the national guard to Democratic strongholds andcentralising controlover elections. Republicans have launchednew gerrymandering offensives,while demanding thedenaturalisation and deportationof socialist New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, as Trump threatens to defund the city if he wins. In Hungary, too, Orbánslashed fundingfor opposition mayoralties. Opponents are threatened with arrest: the arch warmonger John Bolton may be politically loathsome, but the charges filed against him are the harbinger of worse to come.Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannonclaims there is a plan to circumvent the constitution to allow his former boss to take a third term.

For instance, he hatesLetitia James, the New York attorney general who in 2022 successfully brought a civil fraud case against him and whom he has since urged the justice department topursue for mortgage fraud. But that’s just basic revenge – see also his pursuit of ex-FBI directorJames Comey. More interesting are the fleeting, trivial things that set Trump off, including his meltdown last week over aTV commercial from Canada.On the surface it didn’t seem like a particularly big deal: a TV ad airing on US television, paid for by the Canadian province of Ontario, in which an audio clip of Ronald Reagan denouncing tariffs ran over inspiring footage of the American west and industry. In a folksy voice Reagan explains: “When someone says: ‘Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports’, it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while it works – but only for a short time.” He then demolishes the premise of tariffs as anything but an instrument that “hurts every American worker”.Reagan’s words were taken from a 1987 radio address, and both Trump and the Reagan foundation instantly attacked the ad – in which some of the former president’s remarks were run out of chronological order – with Trump declaring it “FAKE”. (The sentiment of what Reagan said wasn’t altered.) Clearly, however, it’s not the edit that bent Trump so out of shape that, after the ad aired, he called off tariff talks withCanada– the only G7 country that has yet to reach a trade deal with the US – then doubled down by announcing he was “increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now”. This was temper, pure and simple – an expression of pique far outweighing the apparent scale of the insult that had clearly struck some very particular nerve.When it comes to analysing Trump’s overreactions, I always return to the delicious and staggering freakout he had at the New York Times columnist Gail Collins in 1992 when she referred to him as the “financially embattled thousandaire”. In the wasteland of Trump’s interior life, “rich” is probably the single most crucial pillar of his identity, and by suggesting that he had exaggerated his wealth, Collins cut as close to the marrow as it gets. Sure enough, Trump’s response was, for bizarreness, up there with Elon Musk calling the Thai cave rescuer a “pedo guy” for criticising his dumb submarine: hesent a copyof the column back to Collins with the words “The Face of a Dog!” scrawled over the picture.Trump wasn’t president then and had only harmless theatrics at his disposal. Obviously things are different now, and by threatening to raise tariffs to 60% onsome Canadian goods, Trump will probably hurt US consumers and workers for years to come, not least as Canada seeks to find alternative trade partners. What remains curious is what exactly in the ad so aggressively triggered him – and it has to do, I suspect, with the status of Ronald Reagan relative to the status of Donald Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in the years since his death, in the US Reagan has come to stand for unimpeachable political authority – and not just on the right – an American icon on a par with John Wayne and a symbol of the soul of the Republican party. At the end of the Ontario ad, a clip of Reagan recording the address shows him wearing a plaid cowboy shirt, and looking rugged and authentic.There is almost no point of comparison for Trump as far as this image is concerned. Burnished by exactly the nostalgia Trump has leveraged for his own political gain, Reagan’s words and image in that ad pitch the current president’s emptied-out, shiny-suited, barely Republican Maga movement against Reagan’s “Morning in America again” original – or at least against the modern spin on the original that has so much power today. Con artists are always aware, at some level, of their own fundamental fraudulence, which is why it can be so dangerous to confront them with the truth. I don’t think Trump’s excessive response at the weekend was down to a political disagreement about tariffs. Instead it was about a man suffering a brief, piercing and clearly quite painful collapse in his self-delusion.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionCanadaTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

The future of peace in the region depends on itWed 29 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 10.39 EDTShareDearDonald Trump,You still want that Nobel peace prize, right? You believe youdeserveit, don’t you? Even as yousendthe world’s biggest warship towards Venezuela,promiseto just “kill people that are bringing drugs into our country … they’re going to be, like dead”, andthreatenfurther national guard invasions of Democratic-run cities here in the United States.I suspect you aren’t helping your case for a Nobel right now. But I do have a suggestion for you. One that might guarantee you the hallowed peace prize that you so obviously crave in 2026.It’s super-simple: getBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to release 66-year-old Marwan Barghouti from prison in Israel.You remember Barghouti, right? Youtold Time magazineearlier this month that you were “literally being confronted with” his case “about 15 minutes before” they called you, that it was the “question of the day”, and that you would be “making a decision” soon.Be sure of this: many of the horrors the west allowed in Gaza will come closer to home | Owen JonesRead moreYou also told Time that the Palestinians “don’t have a leader right now, at least a visible leader … because every one of those leaders has been shot and killed”.For once, we agree! But Mr President, I do hope you realize that Barghoutiisthat leader. Described by theNew York Timesin the 1990s as one of the “young, charismatic and energetic” members on the Palestinian Legislative Council, today he commands support across the Palestinian political spectrum, from Fatah to Hamas, which hasrepeatedly tried(and failed) to get him included in their prisoner swap deals with Israel. He is, far and away, themost popularPalestinian leader alive. Opinion polls – and I know you’re a keen student of polls – have consistently found an imprisoned Barghouti beating all his rivals in hypothetical presidential matchups; in June 2024, he was even defeating the then Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in ahead-to-headby a landslide. A reminder: IsraelassassinatedHaniyeh, Hamas’s chief negotiator, in Tehran the following month.You want a unifying Palestinian leader with the stature and credibility to negotiate a proper peace deal with Israel in all of historic Palestine, and not just a ceasefire in Gaza? Barghouti is your man. In 2002, before his imprisonment, hewrotein the Washington Post he “recognized Israel on 78% of historic Palestine”, that he was strongly opposed to “the targeting of civilians inside Israel”, and that he didn’t seek to “destroy Israel” and wanted “peaceful coexistence between the equal and independent countries of Israel and Palestine”.Isn’t that the kind of Palestinian leader you and the US government could get behind? Isn’t that the kind of Palestinian partner thatIsraelhas long claimed to want?Of course, the Israeli government will tell you that Barghouti cannot be released because he is a terrorist; because he is servingfive cumulative life sentencesfor the murders of five Israeli civilians during the second Intifada. Don’t listen to them. An international observer sent to his 2004 trial in Israel, by the Governing Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, concluded in hisofficial report: “The numerous breaches of international law recalled in this report make it impossible to conclude that Mr. Barghouti was given a fair trial.”In fact, according to the report, only about one in five of the 100 witnesses called to testify against Barghouti during his trial were actually in a position to testify directly regarding his alleged role in the attacks – and none of them even accused him of being involved in them.Mr President, he wasnotgiven a fair trial – and I know how strongly you personally feel about people not being given fair trials. You havepardoned and freedhundreds of prisoners here in the US since January whom you believe were wrongly convicted and unfairly imprisoned. I don’t happen to agree with you on those pardons and commutations, but why not push for the release of Barghouti, too?The“Palestinian Mandela”,as he has become known, may be the key to the enduring peace in the Middle East that you say you want to achieve. Don’t believe me? Listen toRon Lauder, the pro-Israel president of the World Jewish Congress and one ofyourbig donors, who offered to travel to Sharm el-Sheikh earlier this month to try and persuade the Israeli government to include the release of Barghouti in the Gaza ceasefire deal. His attempt, sadly was rebuffed by Netanyahu. “A two-state solution is only possible if you have a good leader and Marwan Barghouti will be the right leader for it,” LaudertoldTime.Listen also to Ami Ayalon, former head of the Shin Bet, Israel’s equivalent of the FBI. Barghouti is “the only leader who can lead Palestinians to a state alongside Israel”, Ayalontoldthe Guardian in January 2024. “First of all because he believes in the concept of two states, and secondly because he won his legitimacy by sitting in our jails.”Listen to the Economist magazine, whichcallshim “the world’s most important prisoner” and the “one Palestinian who could help end the conflict”.Imagine the headlines you would get, Mr President, if you secured the release of “the world’s most important prisoner”. Imagine the crowds across the Middle East gleefully chanting your name in their tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands, if his release did indeed “help end the conflict”. They might even start naming their sons “Donald” in honor of your achievement. You’dreallylike that, wouldn’t you?I want to be very honest and blunt with you, Mr President. For the past decade, I have been one of your most ferocious critics. I remain skeptical of the Gaza ceasefire deal that you oversaw the signing of in Egypt. I also remain disturbed by yourconstant useof the word “Palestinian” as a pejorative, as a slur. Nevertheless, if you persuade (pressure?) your pal Bibi to free Barghouti from prison, even I will be forced to praise you.You suggested to Timeyou would be “making a decision” on this in the near future. Time is not on the 66-year-old Palestinian leader’s side. His familysayshe was beaten by Israeli prison guards last month as he was being moved from one prison to another. In August, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir,released a videoshowing him berating and threatening Barghouti inside his prison cell.If, God forbid, Barghouti were to join themore than 70 Palestinianswho have died in Israeli detention since 7 October 2023, then the prospects for a solution to the Israel-Palestine issue on your watch will slip away. So too will that Nobel prize.Pick up the phone, Mr President. Tell Bibi to release Barghouti.

The tragedy triggered the longestwave of proteststhe country had seen in a decade – a spontaneous uprising against corruption, negligence and the arrogance of power. One year on, the cracks in Serbia’s concrete have turned into fissures in its political foundations.The calamity cut deep for two reasons.First, every Serbian has a story about that station. Built in 1964 and reconstructed in recent years to serve the new high-speed line between Belgrade and the Hungarian border, Novi Sad’s station has long been a meeting place for the north of the country – a place where families and friends said hello, or goodbye. Only a week before the collapse, I had left my wife and daughters waiting in its shadow to buy water and snacks from a nearby kiosk. What happened to those 16 victims could have happened to any of us.Second, infrastructure is the regime’s pride and propaganda. For more than a decade, President Aleksandar Vučić’s ruling party has measured its success in kilometres of asphalt and track. Every election campaign features new promises of roads, bridges and tunnels. The forthcomingExpo 2027in Belgrade is the government’s showcase. But in Vučić’s Serbia speed, patronage and political gain are seen to comebefore safety or oversight.Novi Sad’s station, for example, has been ceremonially opened twice, in 2022 and again in 2024. The prominent March 2022 reopening took place during election campaigns in Serbia and Hungary: Viktor Orbán and Vučić stood side by side, a fitting pairing of two leaders whose regimes seem to compete only in their control of media, their disdain for institutions, and their courting of Moscow.This summer, Vučić inaugurated another motorway section even though part of it lacked a proper permit, and a tunnel had no automatic safety monitoring. The government’s solution was to suspend the tunnel-safety rulebook and station round-the-clock emergency crews – firefighters, police and an ambulance – at its entrance.The canopy’s fall did not create Serbia’s crisis; it exposed it. Over the past 12 years, the regime has captured every institution, hollowing out a democracy painfully built between 2000 and 2012. With courts, media, and regulators under party control, the street remains the only public forum. Since 2016, Serbia has seen near-annual protest waves – each one a training ground for the next generation of demonstrators.Since the huge Belgrade protest on 28 June, the regime has dropped all its masks. During regular protests across the country, police beat and chased peaceful demonstrators through the streets; nearly a thousand citizenshave been arrestedsince the uprising began. The state no longer hides its fear – it wields it.Vučić’s government likes to appear as if it sits on several geopolitical chairs, balanced between east and west, but in reality it runs the country for the president’s benefit, taking money from Brussels andorders from Moscow. The weaker Vučić’s party becomes in the polls, the more it relies on its core support, which largely pro-Russian, nationalistic and rightwing – and the more it leans towards Moscow. Such an ungovernable equilibrium carries with it the risk of instability spilling over, into the rest of the western Balkans.Russia’s grip on Serbia’s security apparatus remains dangerously underestimated. Its intelligence networks move with impunity, from the suspected training campsuncovered on Serbian soil– where operatives rehearsed chaos for Moldova’s election day – to the corridors of Belgrade’s own institutions. Meanwhile, the so-called “anti-protest movement” – a motley crew ofhired thugs and regime loyalists– borrows straight from the Kremlin’s playbook, a Serbian remix ofUkraine’s anti-Maidan.By late 2024, even before the fall of the canopy, the public mood had shifted decisively. Anational pollin September 2024 found more Serbs saying the country wasmoving in the wrong direction(47%) than the right one (46%). Since then, disillusion has deepened, to 53% versus 36%. Inflation remains above the EU average, wages lag behind costs, and debt, while no longer hitting new records, remains staggering. In response to the protests, Belgrade city council even made public transport free – a gesture emblematic of a broader trend of governing as if state resources will never run out, in a capital that was effectively bankrupt last year.Vučić’s Serbia now resembles a governmental Ponzi scheme: borrowing legitimacy through spectacle while deferring collapse. The US sanctions on the mostly Russian-owned Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), which took effect on 9 October 2025, threaten the country’s energy stability and an entire reindustrialisation growth model built on cheap Russian gas. The government’s ad-hoc response only underlines the absence of any coherent policy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Western diplomats still hope for calm: the EU prefers not to rock the Balkan boat while the war in Ukraine rages and Moscow stirs hybrid threats. But Serbia cannot go back.Ahead of the 1 November anniversary protests, several paths are possible, yet one thing is clear – the pre-canopy status quo is gone for good. Neither civil society, nor the opposition, nor the students will return to the staged “dialogues” that passed for politics before.Serbia’s students have joined a global gen Z front of defiance. Their refusal to be silent in the face of corruption and impunity shows that democracy’s renewal may once again come from the streets, and from the young.A year on, the system that brought down the canopy that killed 16 people still stands. The protests sprang from grief, but they now persist in the spirit of endurance. What Serbia has built in 12 months is not a new station but a new awareness – that stability under Vučić was never real. It was always borrowed time, a peace mortgaged against the next collapse.Srdjan Cvijić is a writer and the president of the International Advisory Committee of the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy thinktankExplore more on these topicsSerbiaOpinionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

In the series, Adam Brody plays the so-called “hot rabbi” and love interest of Kristen Bell’s character, an atheist podcaster considering conversion. Together, the pair navigate cultural differences and disapproving family members. Or at least I assume that’s what happened – I was too distracted by all the product placement to focus on the plot.Nobody Wants This review – Kristen Bell and Adam Brody’s chemistry is electricRead moreHere’s a quick summary of the first five episodes of season two, with, technically, some spoilers. The two lovers get coffee and doughnuts from Dunkin’. Brody’s Noah gives Bell’s Joanne a gold Jennifer Meyer necklace. Joanne’s sister (Justine Lupe) calls the family “DoorDash people” and eats her “favorite snack” of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos by a pool. The couple goes to a pasta making class, which the chef reminds them was booked through an Airbnb experience. Something happens in a bathroom. I don’t know what, other than there was an extended money shot of the aforementioned Estée Lauder serum.View image in fullscreenJustine Lupe appears with an Estée Lauder product in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixAnd, oh yes, there is gossip and intrigue and life lessons learned along the way. Sadly, all I retained was the incredibly un-subliminal message that I should order takeout and buy some skincare. The medium is the message, indeed.I took my qualms to Reddit: had the show really become sponcon slop? I was not alone in this assessment. “The number of product placements this season is hilarious to the point that it’s basically a giant infomercial,” one user posted. “It’s literally like they wrote the scene around the products,” another wrote. “It’s almost like a parody of product placement in movies, but it’s not, and that’s a huge bummer,” another opined.View image in fullscreenAdam Brody (left) and Kristen Bell hold Dunkin’ Donuts products in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixI understand that it’s hard to make films and TV today, even if you’re Netflix (the company is doing well butnothing is certainin the volatile streaming market). I am a lifetime Los Angeles romanticist, and I’m troubled by the fact thatHollywoodhas entered aslow death spiral. Filming in town is at ahistoric low, with productions fleeing to Atlanta or New York or the UK orAustraliato save on costs. So many releases these days are big-budget franchises orspin-offs, rather than the types ofcharacter-driven romcomsthat I and so many others love. Nobody Wants This, shot in LA, was an exception to all that: smart, funny and disarmingly charming. So what if Netflix solicited a little financial boost from our benevolent corporate overlords?It would be naive to turn to television as an escape from the capitalist hellhole that is my phone’s endless scroll of thinly veiled #ads and influencer brand collaborations. From the early days of the first soaps (called that as they were sponsored by personal hygiene brands), TV existed to both entertain and sell stuff. Yet the nonstop hawking in Nobody Wants This feels particularly egregious. Sure, I’ll buy that Joanne, a privileged and slightly vapid podcaster, would be a brand snob who totes a yuppy-ish Clare V handbag and stocks her refrigerator with Spindrift seltzers. But in its best moments, the show encourages us to reflect on our own belief system: how it came to be, and how it might change with time. That introspection becomes difficult when your eye is being pulled to the bottle of Seventh Generation disinfectant spray (available at Target) in the frame.View image in fullscreenJustine Lupe eats Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixNetflix has long promoted brands during its shows. But the companyswearsit’s nottheiridea. Netflix, which did not respond to my request for comment, told the New York Times in 2019 that “most of the brands that appear in shows and movies are added by creators who believe they add to the authenticity of the story”, and that such placements were “rare and not a business focus” at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One early Netflix success story, House of Cards, ran from 2013 to 2018. Its product placements (BlackBerry, Sony, Cartier) fit into the world of the show – mostly. At one point, thelead characterFrank Underwood, then a US House of Representatives majority whip, asked one of his colleagues about his PlayStation Vita. “I oughta get one of these for the car,” he said, before the episode cut to credits.View image in fullscreenKristen Bell wears a Fly By Jing chili crisp-branded sweatshirt in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixNetflix’s Stranger Things, set in the 1980s, prominently featured products from that era, leading to a modern-day boon for brands such as Coca-Cola, Eggo, Cadillac, Schwinn, Nike and Burger King. In 2019, CBS Newsreportedthat the total advertising value for the more than 100 brands that appeared in the series was estimated to hit over $15m in the first three days of season three streaming.Last year, the Daily Mailfoundthat Emily in Paris, a bubblegum dramedy starring Lily Collins, plugged 37 brands throughout 10 episodes. Some you might expect for a show about an American who moves to Paris, which Sex and the City’s costume designer consulted on: Chanel, Dior, Hermès. But not every sponsor was as chic: Starbucks, Apple and –mon dieu! – McDonald’s.Maybe I’ll finish Nobody Wants This tonight. Or maybe I’ll go watch five straight hours of car commercials on YouTube; I’m not sure there’s much of a difference at this point.Netflixexecutives, if you see this, maybe cut back on the product placement.

What your menu ordering style says about youPolly HudsonWe’re just human beings, out at a restaurant, struggling against the horror of food envy or orderer’s remorse. But how you approach this can be very revealing …Wed 29 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 13.50 EDTShareIt’s common wisdom that you can tell all you need to know about a person from the way they treat waiters. However, another restaurant-based measure of humankind has recently come to light: how much they dither about ordering.The food and culture magazine Vittles reached this conclusion after witnessing Rishi Sunakmaking a proper meal of itin Mayfair’s The Dover a couple of weeks ago. Apparently, the former prime minister began by painstakingly checking what every other occupant of the table was planning to have, canvassed the waiter’s opinion, then spent 10 minutes “fussing about whether the dover sole was too big”, before asking the waiter (“answer: no”), then trying, unsuccessfully, to get his mate to enter into a coalition and share the sole with him, before “capitulating” and plumping for the penne arrabbiata.Ugh, after all that, pasta? And a super-basic variety at that? If Sunak had still been in power, this story could well have been hisMiliband bacon sandwich.Vittles then attempted to sidetrack with “An interesting parlour game for nerds: which PMs would have just ordered the sole?” (Wilson, Blair and “even Callaghan”, they reckon), but let’s get back to thehowof ordering.I have a friend who, for reasons best known to his therapist, refuses to have the same food as anyone else at the tableWe all know people who wreck it like Rishi, faffing about so long you begin to wonder why you didn’t stay in. Many have … let’s call themquirkystrategies for handling menu decisions, and if you end up mixing incompatible parties it can cause havoc. I have a friend who, for reasons best known to his therapist, refuses to have the same food as anyone else at the table, even if it’s what he really wants. Sod’s law therefore decrees that he will end up dining with a ditherer who needs to ask what everybody is having, and that his will be the option the ditherer likes best and therefore settles on, leaving him with no choice but to switch. It will then become imperative that he only orders after the ditherer, no matter what direction it’s been going until then, in case the ditherer re-dithers and changes their mind, meaning he can go back to his original choice.Another weirdo insists on always trying something new whenever eating out, so she usually picks the least-appetising offering, then spends the rest of the evening begging her partner to give her his dinner instead. A different couple agree what each of them will have, together, as a team, and then eat half before swapping plates. This is infuriating because it seems co-dependent, but then you realise it’s a great idea because both get to try two dishes. However, you can’t copy it because you have sneerily decreed it co-dependent. They have never had a row over one of them eating more than their share pre-handover, but everybody they have ever met lives in hope that day is coming.The lowest of the low must surely be those who, like Sunak, involve the poor waiter in their decision. First, the waiter doesn’t care. Second, just because they like something doesn’t mean that you will, and vice versa. My favourite scenario is when the answer to “Would you have the chicken or the beef?” is a smug “Neither – I’m a vegan”, thereby making the questioner feel guilty as well as pathetically indecisive.At the opposite end of the scale from the hmm-ers, who plead to go last (and when it is finally their turn,say, “I … will … have … the …” as slowly as possible, so they get an extra few seconds to think), are the super-organised. These impressive creatures have been poring over the menu online for weeks and arrive prepared: they don’t need to look; refuse to be swayed by specials. The only potential spanner in the works is the last-minute seasonal menu change, which leaves them as clueless and confused as the rest of us.But let’s be honest here: whether we’re billionaire ex-prime ministers or paupers, whatever our method or madness, we’re all just human beings out in the world, struggling against the horror of food envy, or orderer’s remorse. It’s never been as important as now, when times are tight and eating out is more of a treat. Still, there’s never any excuse for having the boring old pasta.Polly Hudson is a freelance writer.Explore more on these topicsRishi SunakOpinionSocial etiquetteRestaurantsFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

As the needs of an ageing population grow, it must be a wake-up call for the governmentWed 29 Oct 2025 14.26 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 15.32 EDTShareEngland’s first modern hospice, set up with the aim of improving the quality of life of terminally ill people, opened as a charity in south-east London in 1967. Its guiding philosophy was movinglysummed upby Cicely Saunders, the nurse and social workerbehindits foundation: “You matter because you are you, you matter to the last moment of your life.”Since then, through a combination of donations, fundraising efforts and financial assistance from the NHS, the independent hospice movement has become a key element in the UK economy of care. Offering emotional as well as medical support to terminally ill people and those with life-limiting conditions, and delivering services to those who wish to stay in their own homes, hospices are an invaluable social asset. On both sides of the fraught parliamentary debate over the assisted dying bill, the need toensurethat good palliative care is an accessible option for all has been treated as a given.All of which makes the National Audit Officereporton the financial sustainability of England’s adult hospice sector a disturbing read. A heavy reliance on charitable sources already means that a postcode lottery applies to hospice provision, advantaging wealthier areas. In its report, published on Wednesday, the NAO describes an ominous financial squeeze across the board.Almost two-thirds of independent hospices reported a deficit in 2023-24. A decline in donations, the impact of inflation and higher employment costs is leading to a reduction in the number of beds and staff layoffs. Services providing psychological and bereavement support are being withdrawn, and some hospices are cutting back on at-home provision.This is, quite simply, dismal news. Significant numbers of people who would wish to receive palliative care are already unable to access it. An ageing population, in which people are living longer with more complex health conditions, means that demand will only grow. As Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO,observedon Wednesday: “With many more people expected to want hospice care in the future, it is crucial that the sector is financially resilient.”The Department of Health and Social Care committed this month to a three-year fundingsettlementfor children’s hospices, and hasprovideda one-off bailout of £100m for capital spending in the adult sector. But it needs to do much more to buttress and boost institutions that come out of the best of the voluntary tradition. Supplementing the state, hospices play an essential part in enhancing collective wellbeing, reducing suffering and saving the NHS money.Safeguarding the future may mean rethinking current arrangements, in which the bulk of funding for hospices is reliant on charitable contributions. The prospect of a state-funded assisted dying service sitting alongside a cash-strapped hospice sector is deeply disquieting. The mounting debts suggest it is nevertheless a distinct possibility.For the government, and the country as a whole, the NAO’s report should be a wake-up call. Current provision of end-of-life care remains patchy and subject to a postcode lottery, but the future must be about expansion rather than retrenchment. Following Saunders’s groundbreaking work in the 1960s, the value of hospices to the NHS was only gradually recognised and acknowledged. Warm words about the sector’s value, and the qualities of the dedicated staff who work within it, need to be followed up with action.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it wasDonald Trumpwho emerged the biggest winner. A $40bnlifelinefrom the US president gave Mr Milei’s beleaguered government just enough credibility – and apparent firepower – to halt the Argentinian peso’s slide. Crucially, this helped to stabilise consumer prices in the final weeks of the campaign. The US rescue engendered a short-lived aura of competence thatallowedMr Milei to shift the blame for rising prices back to the opposition, despite his own role in accelerating inflation bydevaluingthe currency when he took office.Mr Milei’s wasn’t a decisive triumph. His rightwing coalition got40% of the midterms votethanks largely to a low turnout and a fragmented opposition. His “chainsaw” programme of privatisation and public spending cuts has not been popular. Polls suggest thatsix in 10 votersdisapprove. Unsurprising, perhaps: since Mr Milei took office in December 2023, Argentinians’purchasing powerhas fallen sharply, real wages have declined and more than 200,000 jobs have been lost.Matías Vernengo of Bucknell University argues that without capital controls and new policies, Mr Milei’s so-called stability will end as previous neoliberal efforts did: in devaluation andcrisis. Prof Vernengo, who worked at Argentina’s central bank,blamesthe International Monetary Fund. It agreed a $20bn bailout to Argentina in April, underWhite House pressure, on the condition that Mr Mileiremovedforeign exchange controls. The following months proved why this was a bad idea. Argentina cannot use interest rates to stabilise its currency. Set too high, they invite speculative inflows. Too low and they encourage capital flight. Interestingly, Prof Vernengo favours temporary high interest rates to prevent the peso sliding uncontrollably.As long as the country can’t build dollar reserves through exports, any “strong” peso isillusory. Using recession and wage suppression to make a misaligned exchange rate “stick” is no panacea. That’s why Latin America’s third-largest economy requires foreign exchange controls and fiscal coordination for stable, equitable development. It’s either that or a forced devaluation for a more chaotic ride. Daniela Gabor, of Soas University of London, correctly says that Argentina isfinancially subordinatedto a Trumpian agenda. In effect, Mr Milei’s Argentina, which has borrowed heavily in a currency – dollars – it lacks, is continuing with self-defeating austerity to maintain access to $40bn in American credit. This is a Potemkin stability. Argentina risksbecominga Trumpian client state as Washington is directly intervening to prop up the peso.A developing nation should treat its current account not as a constraint to be financed, but as a strategic policy tool managed through accumulating dollars and an industrial policy. Argentina’s history did not begin with Mr Milei. Its first democratically elected president after the junta years,Raúl Alfonsín, attempted to protect living standards but was forced into submission byWashington’s threats, reportedly including one to block essential medicines. He was punished by isolation and forced into IMF orthodoxy. Mr Milei’s position is the mirror image of Alfonsín’s: instead of defying creditors and being penalised, he is submitting to them pre-emptively and being rewarded. But the mechanism of control is the same. History suggests it is a trap that Argentina will have to escape if it is to prosper on its own terms.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It reduces racism to a prejudice that leaks, unintentionally, out of clumsy words.Similar excuses were made afterFrank Hester said Diane Abbott “makes you want to hate all black women” and that she “should be shot”, and afterRobert Jenrick complained about not seeing “another white face”during his tour of part of Birmingham. Both said that their remarks had nothing to do with skin colour.The sad fact is that racism is not the preserve of self-declared Nazis advocating white supremacy with intent. Racism is widespread and influences everyone. Most white people, like me, will have said racist things with varying degrees of intentionality. Denying it just preserves it, and as the American civil rights activist James Baldwin pointed out long ago, when it comes to racism, “it is the innocence which constitutes the crime”.Rod EarleShalford, SurreyIt is possible to put a generous interpretation on theReform UKMP Sarah Pochin’s remarks about “adverts full of black people, full of Asian people”. In the light of the question put to her about “demographics”, she might say that she was objecting not to black and brown faces as such, but to the fact that their frequency in adverts does not match that in the UK population.But why does she says that this “drives me mad”? Why is it so important to her that the proportion of black and Asian faces in adverts should not exceed the proportion in the population? Is it some kind of obsession with mathematical neatness, or is it something else? She still has a lot of explaining to do.Richard NormanCanterburyFor some of us, Sarah Pochin’s objection to the number of Black and Asian people on TV feels chillingly like deja vu. The broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy made the same complaint 22 years ago (Too many blacks on TV, says Ludovic Kennedy, 25 September 2003).Coming from an esteemed liberal, it was doubly shocking, but that it now issues from an unsurprising source is no less disturbing. For Black and Asian people, it is evidence that inclusion is always contingent, always contested; it is always an issue over which contentment can shrivel suddenly and feel instead like complacency – whether at the drop of a hint, the raising of an eyebrow or the screech of racist commentary.Paul McGilchristCromer, NorfolkI think Sarah Pochin has failed to understand how advertising works. All companies want to appeal to the widest audience, so they include a diverse demographic in their adverts. So of course we will see a larger proportion of Black and Asian families in adverts than is actually present in society. It’s not some woke conspiracy, Sarah. Just maths.Jacqui WhiteWhitstable, KentCouldNigel Faragetell us what kind of racist comment is the tipping point that would lead to expulsion from his party?Peter BrookerWest Wickham, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

They naively assumed a market would emerge, with different universities and different courses charging different amounts. But it never did. The entire sector, bar a few institutions, went all-in and charged the full amount.The elephant in the senior common room is that degrees in the arts, humanities or social sciences are far cheaper to deliver than science, engineering or medical degrees. Ironically then, students with poorer employability outcomes are subsidising those with better ones.Of course, this is all part of successive governments’ “nudging” of young people towards Stem subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), while some politicians, such as Kemi Badenoch, would like toaxe the very degreesthat subsidise those they want to encourage.University finances are in a perilous state. Both research and undergraduate teaching lose universities money. The only way they have managed to vaguely balance their books is through postgraduate taught degrees targeted at overseas students paying high fees.It is even more ironic that this government wants totax the incomefrom overseas students, while previous governments were so hostile towards these students who, in effect, subsidise our own students. The marketisation of higher education, like the marketisation of other public services, has proved to be an abject failure of political ideology.Avi ShankarProfessor of consumer research, University of Bristol Business SchoolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Not only did Sarkozy gain the nickname “President Bling-Bling” for his ostentatious lifestyle while occupying the Élysée Palace, but hisacceptance of funds from Muammar Gaddafiwas surely a new low for French politics.As you point out, the politician most likely to be the next president of France, the far-right leaderMarine Le Pen, is herself awaiting the outcome of an appeal, also related to corruption. Although it is indeed heartening to see public approval for Sarkozy’s imprisonment, the news that he will have access to two police bodyguards throughout his time in jail demonstrates that he is no ordinary prisoner.All this comes, of course, at a time when the French national assembly is locked in a political stalemate. Further examples of corruption are likely to undermine yet more the political system ahead of the 2027 presidential election race.

Aston Villa and Real Madrid are on the Anfield horizon and so is trouble should this slump deepen.The FA Cup and Community Shield winners eased into theCarabao Cupquarter-finals courtesy of a first-half double from Ismaïla Sarr, Liverpool’s tormentor‑in-chief. The Senegal international made it seven goals in nine appearances against Liverpool – for Palace and Watford – as Oliver Glasner’s team registered their third triumph against Slot’s side in 80 days.TheLiverpoolhead coach made 10 changes for the fourth-round match but Palace are too streetwise, too assured and too talented to be treated so lightly. A sixth defeat in seven games, the heaviest of Slot’s reign at Anfield, was the almost inevitable outcome for the Premier League champions. A straight red card for the substitute Amara Nallo – his second in two Liverpool appearances – and a clinical third goal from the excellent Yéremy Pino inflicted further punishment on the hosts late on.Quick GuideCarabao Cup quarter-final drawShowCardiff to host ChelseaCardiff have been handed a dream home Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Chelsea.The League One club are the lowest-ranked team left in the competition, having won 2-1 at Welsh rivals Wrexham on Tuesday night.Chelsea came through 4-3 against Wolves at Molinuex, holding off a second-half fightback from the home side to secure their place in the last eight.Elsewhere in the draw, holders Newcastle will be at home to Fulham.Crystal Palace will head to Premier League leaders Arsenal.Manchester City, who came from behind to win 3-1 at Swansea, will be at home against Brentford.PA MediaCarabao Cup quarter-final draw in fullArsenal v Crystal PalaceCardiff City v ChelseaManchester City v BrentfordNewcastle Unitedv FulhamThe games will take place in the week commencing Monday 15 December.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Slot’s priority was clearly the visit of Villa in the Premier League on Saturday as he gave the majority of the senior squad the night off and more time preparing on the training ground. The risk was not so much in the starting lineup, a typical mix for this stage of the competition of youth and experience, but in having no insurance policies on the bench whatsoever.Nine members of the squad featured for the under-21s on Sunday in the mini-derby defeat of Everton. Nine was also the sum total of first-team appearances among the nine substitutes. Glasner went stronger, making five changes to the teambeaten by Arsenalon Sunday.In fairness to Slot and his makeshift selection there was little between the teams for 30 minutes and, in the 17-year-old Rio Ngumoha, Liverpool had one of the most enterprising players on display. Ngumoha went close with one curling effort and created Liverpool’s best opening of the first half when slipping in Federico Chiesa. From a tight angle, the Italy forward’s low shot was saved by the legs of Walter Benítez.View image in fullscreenThe pressure is mounting on Arne Slot.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA“I was not pleased with the first 15 minutes, the players were still in their hotel beds,” Glasner said. Once Palace awoke, however, their greater composure on the ball and experience told. Once Sarr beat Freddie Woodman for the first time, the Palace fan and former academy player making his Liverpool debut in place of the rested Giorgi Mamardashvili, the home side had no answers.Palace struck twice in quick succession before the interval. Both goals stemmed from Daichi Kamada passes down the centre of the pitch. The midfielder’s first incisive ball found Daniel Muñoz inside the area. His heavy touch rebounded off Joe Gomez to the unmarked Sarr, who swept his finish inside Woodman’s left-hand post under no pressure.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Amara Nallo is shown a red card by the referee Craig Pawson.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersFour minutes later Kamada put Liverpool under pressure again with a first-time pass into Sarr. The Senegal international flicked a layoff into Pino and darted into the penalty area. Pino found his run brilliantly, dissecting the Liverpool defence with a disguised pass, giving Sarr time and space to again beat Woodman with ease.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the night that Max Dowman became the club’s youngest player to start a match, at the age of just 15 years and 302 days, it was two other graduates of the Hale End academy who scored the decisive goals to send Mikel Arteta’s side into the last eight.Ethan Nwaneri, who has one record that Arsenal’s latest protege can never beat, as the youngest player in Premier League history, found the net again on a rare start to settle an inexperienced Arsenal side’s nerves before Bukayo Saka rounded off the victory over Brighton after coming on to replace Dowman.Quick GuideCarabao Cup quarter-final drawShowCardiff to host ChelseaCardiff have been handed a dream home Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Chelsea.The League One club are the lowest-ranked team left in the competition, having won 2-1 at Welsh rivals Wrexham on Tuesday night.Chelsea came through 4-3 against Wolves at Molinuex, holding off a second-half fightback from the home side to secure their place in the last eight.Elsewhere in the draw, holders Newcastle will be at home to Fulham.Crystal Palace will head to Premier League leaders Arsenal.Manchester City, who came from behind to win 3-1 at Swansea, will be at home against Brentford.PA MediaCarabao Cup quarter-final draw in fullArsenal v Crystal PalaceCardiff City v ChelseaManchester City v BrentfordNewcastle Unitedv FulhamThe games will take place in the week commencing Monday 15 December.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.On the impressive evidence of the 70 minutes he was granted here by Arteta, the forward – who will turn 16 on New Year’s Eve – will have plenty more opportunities to impress on the right flank over the years to come.“It was a very special evening,” said a delighted Arteta. “For him everything is natural, it’s the way he plays. I think that’s the secret, that he doesn’t make a big fuss of it, he just does what he does best, which is to play football.”This was an eighth win in succession for Arsenal in all competitions and yet another clean sheet despite making 10 changes that also included handing a senior debut to 17-year-old striker Andre Harriman-Annous. Having already established a four-point lead at the top of the Premier League, Arteta will hope that the timely injection of youth can provide more impetus in a season when they look destined to finally end their long search for silverware.“We’re struggling with some positions already and it’s October, so we’re going to need them,” added Arteta. “It was a great test for them and I take a lot of learning from it.”View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri, left, celebrates after scoring his side’s opening goal.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APFor some time it has been a matter of when and not if Dowman would be handed his first start having first trained with Arsenal’s senior squad when he turned 14, with the possibility he could still become the youngest player in Champions League history should he make an appearance before the end of January. But the absence of Gabriel Martinelli meant Arteta was short of attacking options and keen to rotate his squad before three testing away trips next week, as only Eberechi Eze retained his place fromthe win over Crystal Palaceon Sunday.If there were any doubts about whether Dowman was ready for this stage then they were dispelled in the 10th minute when a brilliant piece of control got the home fans out of their seats. Another teenager, Charalampos Kostoulas, should have made Arsenal pay from the resulting corner when Brighton raced downfield but he could only shoot wide. Georginio Rutter had also forced Kepa Arrizabalaga into an early save by then as the visitors started confidently.It was understandable with so many changes that Arsenal lacked rhythm in attack, although their biggest threat came whenever Dowman got the ball on the right flank. With a mop of hair that he is constantly brushing away from his eyes, he is deceptively quick off the mark and left Belgium international defender Maxim De Cuyper for dead on more than one occasion. Fabian Hürzeler was left cursing his luck when somehow Jan Paul van Hecke headed wide from a corner five minutes before half-time. “We weren’t on our highest level in either box and Arsenal made us pay,” said the Brighton manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The referee, Sam Barrott, waved away the appeals from the home crowd. A wonderful move that was triggered by Mikel Merino’s clever backheel eventually created the breakthrough, with Nwaneri finding the corner brilliantly after being set up by yet another academy graduate, Myles Lewis-Skelly. Eze saw another effort deflect just over as Arsenal started to find spaces in Brighton’s defence, with Hürzeler responding by introducing three attacking substitutes that surprisingly didn’t include top scorer Danny Welbeck.Merino’s effort from a corner was cleared off the line before Dowman was given a standing ovation when he made way for Saka. The England forward didn’t waste any time making his mark when he fired in the rebound after Harriman-Anous’s shot was saved to maintain Arsenal’s winning run and send an ominous warning to their rivals.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupArsenalBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

If the sight of that trophy inspired Thomas Frank’s team, Newcastle’s desire to retain it proved infinitely stronger. As Eddie Howe put it: “This was a performance in line with our identity and our expectations. We were strong.”Howe’s side could have been forgiven for prioritising the Champions League and the Premier League but, instead, they played with the zeal of a side still buoyed bytheir Wembley triumphin March.Sarr double for Crystal Palace sends young Liverpool side out of Carabao CupRead moreTheir passage to the quarter-finals this season and a home tie against Fulham in December was secured with goals from the impressive Fabian Schär and Nick Woltemade, not to mention another stunning midfield performance on Sandro Tonali’s part.Howe had enthused about the variety and versatility of Tottenham’s buildups but, perhaps anxious to prove his own chameleon credentials, Newcastle’s manager tweaked his 4-3-3 system to create extra overloads down the flanks.It meant that one full-back – Emil Krafth or Dan Burn – joined almost every attack as the home side temporarily shape‑shifted into a back three.With Tonali once again reprising his impression of the complete modern midfielder, Spurs struggled to second‑guess their hosts. Admittedly after Harvey Barnes missed a decent opening, Frank’s team woke up and Brennan Johnson should have done better than slice a shot into the Gallowgate at the end of a fluent counterattack.Howe’s reprieved players responded by rewarding the home fans who had struggled to get into the ground after the Microsoft internet outage on Wednesday left them unable to download match tickets.It came in the form of a headed goal from Schär, who connected with Tonali’s corner as Tottenham’s zonal marking engendered a sense of chaos to rival anything seen earlier in the St James’ Park box office. It did not help that Djed Spence was out of position, lacing his boots. “Djed had his boot off and needed time to tie it, the referee made a mistake,” Frank said. “I have spoken to him about it.”View image in fullscreenFabian Schär rises to power home a header and put Newcastle ahead.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAAs Schär’s header powered beyond Antonin Kinsky’s reach, Howe applauded enthusiastically. The ball-playing former Switzerland central defender began the season in stellar form and was desperately unlucky to lose his place to Malick Thiaw after sustaining a concussion.Now, with Sven Botman rested as Newcastle’s made eight changes to Tottenham’s four, Schär found himself stationed alongside Thiaw and doing a very good job of subduing Richarlison.Although the imperious Lucas Bergvall did not deserve to finish on the losing team, Frank’s problem was that his forwards struggled to properly test Newcastle’s goalkeeper, Aaron Ramsdale.Not that this lack of killer instinct was exclusively a Spurs problem. Had Barnes not clipped the crossbar with a late first-half volley following fine work from Tonali and Thiaw, Newcastle would have been two up at the interval.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Germany centre-forward headed his side’s second goal at the outset of the second half after meeting Joe Willock’s beautifully dinked cross and capitalising on an unfortunate misunderstanding between Kinsky and Kevin Danso. And to think Woltemade, who has now scored six goals for Newcastle, insists he is infinitely happier with the ball at his feet.Frank’s players have often shone aerially at dead balls this season but here Newcastle delighted in demonstrating that they, too, are pretty useful with their heads at set plays. “It’s something we’ve worked on really hard lately,” said Howe, who had reason to thank Ramsdale for a superb save to deny Pape Sarr. “We’ve got the height and power to cause teams problems.”Well before the end home fans felt sufficiently confident to start singing about another trip to a major final. Their Carabao Cup anthem last season – “Tell me Ma, I won’t be home for tea … we’re going to Wemberlee” – received an airing as Howe introduced a series of substitutes.They included Joelinton, who could count himself fortunate to be merely booked following a reckless tackle on the Tottenham substitute Mohammed Kudus. The same luck applied to Kudus, who responded by throwing his fists at the prone Brazilian before Joelinton fought back.“It was a game of small margins,” Frank said. “It was really close.”Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Hoops meet the Light Blues in Sunday’s Scottish League Cup semi-final at Hampden, where O’Neill managed his last game for Celtic in his first spell – the 2005 Scottish Cup final win over Dundee United. The Parkhead fans, while still disgruntled with the club’s hierarchy, will go into the game more assured by O’Neill’s impact on a side who looked closer to their best form. O’Neill, who was Celtic manager between 2000 and 2005, was given a rousing reception.“I know the confidence’s been a bit low,” he said afterwards. “That’s the most natural thing in the world, even the very, very best sides if you’re not getting a result. Players then stop doing things that they almost like naturally would do. There’s some of the lads in the dressing room that would have no idea who I was but they’re only about 10 years old – and some of the other lads, I said we have quite a number of winners in the dressing room. That’s really important.“But there was great performances all around this evening and just to win. So, yeah, they becalmed my dreadful insecurity problems. Naturally, delighted to win the game.

A question mark also hangs over the 27‑year‑old Sophia Dunkley, whose highest score all tournament was 22. “We do need to improve our batting – I don’t think it’s been consistent enough at times,” Edwards said.Edwards said she was proud of the progress England had made since she took on the head coach role six months ago, but emphasised she needed to be given time to embed changes. “I’m a winner. I don’t like losing. But equally I knew what I took on with this role – I knew it wasn’t going to be a quick fix.”Sciver-Brunt agreed with her head coach’s assessment: “We’ve come a long way since the summer. We’re a different side from then, and we’ve learned a lot about ourselves. This will hurt, but hopefully in time we’ll be able to learn from it and come back stronger.”England’s defeat was inflicted after the South Africa captain, Laura Wolvaardt, struck 169 from 143 balls – a knock she described as her best in one-day international cricket.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a group fixture between two mid‑table teams in a competition to which no one pays a lot of attention. But despite it all, the match marked a significant little milestone in the modern history of English cricket. Because Sussex gave a debut to a 21‑year‑old from Hemel Hempstead called Troy Henry, the first male player to come up into professional cricket throughthe Ace programme.Henry had turned up for the very first trial Ace held, back when he was a teenage left‑arm quick who dreamed of playing pro cricket and needed help to do it. Five years later, Sussex sent him in at No 9, he made 15 off eight balls, then came on fourth change and took one for 34 in four overs of left‑arm spin, because Ace’s coaches had persuaded him that if he wanted to get ahead he ought to switch disciplines.Four days later another Ace graduate, the 17-year-old Davina Perrin, smacked 101 off 43 balls for Northern Superchargers in the Hundred eliminator against London Spirit, inone of the stop‑and-watch-this moments of the English summer. A month earlier a third Ace graduate, Amy Wheeler, signed a new one‑year contract with the Blaze.‘Things are bigger than cricket’: Blair Tickner ready to enjoy New Zealand returnRead moreIt’s easy towant change, easy totalk or write about why we need it; back in 2020 everyone was doing it. The hard part is actually bringing it about. Henry, Perrin and Wheeler are the first players to emerge from five years of organisation, administration, fundraising and coaching by Ebony Rainford‑Brent, Chevy Green and the team at Ace during the quiet in-between.Now Rainford-Brent is stepping down as chair. She will still be on the board, but feels the organisation needs someone with more expertise in fundraising as it makes its next steps. “When we started it was on a hunch that there was more talent in the black community that we needed to capture in the professional game,” she says. “We didn’t expect it to turn into a programme which also serves kids from across different cultures and class backgrounds, we didn’t expect to have 40,000 kids through the programme in five years, didn’t expect 370 kids in our academy across the nation, and we didn’t expect to have three pros come through this year.”If the Ace programme grew to be bigger than Rainford-Brent expected, it was because the problems in English cricket were worse than she suspected. Five years working in the field has left her with the firm belief that while there are still problems with racial biases in the pathway “the class barrier is the biggest barrier to entry into cricket”. Ace has expanded its scope to meet this need. “We started with a lens of making sure the game wasn’t dying among one community, and we’re still doing that, but what we’ve created is something that is really just about opening up pathways for all the most underrepresented groups.” Ace has spread around the country and now about 20% of its intake comes from white working-class communities, particularly in inner cities.View image in fullscreenAce graduate Davina Perrin helped Northern Superchargers to win the women’s Hundred this summer.Photograph: Action Plus Sports Images/AlamyLooking back on what she has learned, Rainford-Brent says she was surprised at “how much support the young people needed”. She imagined Ace would be primarily about improving performance – she is so easy-going, it’s easy to forget that she was a remarkable athlete herself – but the array of challenges young players face is much broader than she imagined. Take their three professionals. Perrin already had talent but needed personal mentoring, Wheeler’s family needed more structural support, and Henry needed specific coaching to help him make the switch from bowling pace to spin.She is not done. “Our No 1 goal was to produce 10 professionals by 2030,” and they are well on their way already. “I think the wider target now is about creating that wraparound support, so we are creating employability in the game even for people who don’t make it as professional players.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket published itsexhaustive report on the state of the game in 2023but already it feels like a document from another time. “You get these peak interest moments and then it can fall off,” Rainford-Brent says. “Our true test is what happens in five or 10 years’ time and what we did in between these cycles when everyone was paying attention.” It helps that the leadership at the England and Wales Cricket Board has changed for the better, not least because, improbable as it seems to her, Rainford-Brent is a board member herself. “And yes,” she says, “I do wear my hi-tops to the board meetings.”“What I say is that we’ve gone from being hopeless to hopeful,” she says. “But hopeful doesn’t mean we’ve cracked it.”Explore more on these topicsCricketWomen's cricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Let alone the injured Elliot Daly, George Furbank, Seb Atkinson, Ollie Sleightholme and Will Muir.Wallabies resume England rivalry with memories still fresh of Twickenham triumph | Angus FontaineRead moreIn the end, though, it is less a question of individuals than of horses for courses and identifying the most effective combinations. Which makes perhaps the least discussed player on England’s teamsheet a vital cog. Forget, for a moment, the rationale forchoosing George Fordat fly-half or Tommy Freeman at outside-centre and consider the merits of the frequently unsung Fraser Dingwall.The Northampton captain does not particularly relish the phrase “glue player”, with its slight connotations of faint praise, but that is how Borthwick views him in the context of England’s remodelled midfield. If Freeman is to succeed in the 13 jersey, who better than his good mate from Saints to guide him through the midfield maze? And if the hosts are to maximise their firepower further out, they need a reliable, smart platform from which to do so.Quick GuideEngland team to face Australia – in fullShowEngland (v Australia): Freddie Steward (Leicester, 38 caps); Tom Roebuck (Sale, 6 caps), Tommy Freeman (Northampton, 20 caps), Fraser Dingwall (Northampton, 4 caps), Immanuel Feyi-Waboso (Exeter, 9 caps); George Ford (Sale, 102 caps), Alex Mitchell (Northampton, 23 caps); Fin Baxter (Harlequins, 14 caps), Jamie George (Saracens, 102 caps), Joe Heyes (Leicester, 14 caps), Maro Itoje (Saracens, 93 caps, captain), Ollie Chessum (Leicester, 28 caps), Guy Pepper (Bath, 3 caps), Sam Underhill (Bath, 42 caps), Ben Earl (Saracens, 42 caps)Replacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie (Sale, 49 caps), Ellis Genge (Bristol, 71 caps), Will Stuart (Bath, 50 caps), Alex Coles (Northampton, 10 caps), Tom Curry (Sale, 61 caps), Henry Pollock (Northampton, 1 cap), Ben Spencer (Bath, 10 caps), Fin Smith (Northampton , 11 caps).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It is still a significant call to back the determined Dingwall, who missed England’s summer tour through injury. In his absence Atkinson – now injured himself – impressed at 12 and there was always the option of reuniting Lawrence and Slade, both of whom offer class and no shortage of experience. But in the end Borthwick rewound to the end of last season’s Six Nations when England ripped it up against Wales, winning by arecord 68-14 marginin Cardiff.Who started in the visiting midfield that day? None other than the Dingwall-Freeman combination, at least until the latter was replaced by Henry Pollock in the second half. And how good did England look as they poured forward, brimming with intent, physicality and pace? Borthwick would love to see something similaragainst the Wallabies, even given his squad’s limited preparation time this autumn.From the 26-year-old Dingwall’s perspective that means prioritising his usual unselfish game and leaving others to supply the fireworks. “One of the things I always strive to do is to bring out the best in the people around me. Whether it’s doing simple jobs or just feeding information, that’s something I’ll go after. If I can have an effect by lifting the backline and the team then I’ll be pretty pleased with that performance.”View image in fullscreenThe Fraser Dingwall (left) and Tommy Freeman combination at centre helped England crush Wales in last season’s Six Nations.Photograph: Dan Mullan/The RFU Collection/Getty ImagesIt helps that the Northampton connection within the England squad is so tight, with Fin Smith and Pollock set to feature off the bench at some stage. Dingwall believes that link can only be beneficial: “Playing alongside Freemo is really nice. And it is cool because we are good mates off the pitch as well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Each one of us brings something slightly different. How you fit two centres together who complement each other can have some really good benefits for the side.”With England also aerially strong in the form of Freeman, Tom Roebuck and Freddie Steward, and with British & Irish Lions lurking on their bench to supply a powerful finish, Borthwick is clearly hoping to pile pressure on Australia in multiple ways and, in doing so, further enhance how his team is perceived.“I know you guys will criticise me for different things and the depth I go into regarding my preparation,” said the head coach this week, offering a rare glimpse of the man behind the normally implacable facade. “[But] if I was an England supporter I would want the head coach to be thorough. I’m thorough.” His midfield selection has certainly not been done on a casual whim.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamRugby unionAustralia rugby union teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over half have issues with their breasts when undertaking physical activity, be that pain, movement or fear of judgment; 40% of girls during puberty have urinary stress incontinence.“You ask girls to use their bodies and then their bodies do things that don’t feel like they work with sport; like having a period, like developing breasts, like leaking urine when you’re jumping around. But we don’t create an environment that says ‘this is normal and here’s what we can do about it’. If we can get that right we’d be on a winning streak.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The strong earnings report comes a day after a deal withOpenAIpushed the value of tech giant to more than $4tn.After its Xbox and investor relations pages went down, the company issued a statement that said: “We are working to address an issue affecting Azure Front Door that is impacting the availability of some services.”The outage did not dampen the software giant’s financial outlook. The company reported first-quarter earnings of $3.72 per share against analysts’ expectations of $3.68, and revenue of $77.7bn against expectations of $75.5bn, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.That’s up from the $3.30 per share and $65.6bn in revenue the company saw in the same quarter last year.Microsoft’s closely watched Azure cloud business grew by about 40%, also topping expectations. Operating income increased 24% to $38bn, more than projected. The company said its net income was $27.7bn.“Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,” said Satya Nadella, chair and chief executive officer of Microsoft.“It’s why we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.”The company reported spending a larger-than-expected $34.9bn on new AI-related projects over the quarter, a 74% increase from the same period a year ago.Microsoft’s earnings report comes as investors welcomed a revamped deal with OpenAI this week that has the once not-for-profit AI venture move toward becoming a for-profit entity and ties Microsoft more closely to the company.Under the new agreement, Microsoft will hold 27% of the OpenAI Group PBC, valued at roughly $135bn, while OpenAI’s non-profit arm will hold a $130bn stake in the for-profit.The earnings report gives Wall Street its latest look at the company’s AI and cloud growth. Graphic chipmaker Nvidia crossed a threshold on Wednesday to become the first company valued at $5tn as prospects for a US-China trade deal improved. The wider US stock market reached record highs earlier in the week, buoyed by hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in AI.Microsoft’s earnings, along with Meta and Google parent Alphabet on Wednesday, begin a week of reports from the “Magnificent Seven”, the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world.Investor anxiety over the possible inflation of a market bubble in AI-related investment similar to over-investment in the mid-to-late 1990s have been growing.

It’s about to spend hundreds of billions moreRead moreOn an earnings call, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood sought to calm fears of an AI investment bubble, explaining that the company’s aggressive expansion in AI capacity, up 80% this year, and data centers doubling in size over the next two – was to meet demand that was already booked.“Our need to continue to build out infrastructure is very high and that’s for booked business today and not any new booked business,” Hood said, adding that the company had been short of processing capacity for several quarters.“I thought we were going to catch up but we are not,” Hood said. “Demand is increasing and usage is increasing very quickly. When you see these kinds of demand signals, and we know are behind, we need to spend. But we’re spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and bookings, and we feel good about that.”But, she warned, Microsoft is still “likely to be short of capacity”.AI-related and cloud computing companies are valued at a combined $20tn, and gains across the market are 18% in 2025, or about $3.3tn, according to Reuters. Investors typically want to see that returns on AI capital spending, or CapEx, are following as the markets continue to reach record highs.Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon are projected to pump hundreds of billions into capital expenditures in their upcoming year, mostly into the construction of datacenters and associated infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Investors may be undeterred even without strong signs of revenue growth and settle for signs of strong AI adoption. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a milestone of 47,943 on Wednesday morning.“With five of the Mag Seven reporting this week, what the market expects to hear is confirmation that all this AI CapEx is coming through, that the revenues and profits from AI are coming through,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St Louis, Missouri, told Reuters this week.Part of the AI economic boom is likely to come from cost savings. Microsoft announced at the start of the summer that it would cut about 9,000 jobs. Amazon is reported to be planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs, or 10% of workers in the white collar division, to compensate for over-hiring during the peak demand of the pandemic.With the application of AI-technologies, company managers are increasing asked to justify hiring a human, with additional costs in health insurance and pension, along with HR and other management officials, when the role could be performed by AI. As a result, human resource divisions are likely to be the first to be scaled back as AI takes hold.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftQuarterly resultsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It does not specifically mention consent.But after the change the criminal code will define rape or sexual assault as “any non-consensual act”. It states consent must be “informed, specific, prior and revocable” and “cannot be inferred solely from the silence or lack of reaction of the victim”.It also includes the previous definition, stating: “There is no consent if the sexual act is committed with violence, coercion, threat or surprise, regardless of their nature” and encompasses oral and anal acts of penetration not currently explicitly stated in legislation but enshrined in jurisprudence.The bill had already been approved last week by the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, by a large majority. Only members of the far right opposed the change. It was approved by the upper house, the Senate, on Wednesday. Senators voted 327-0 in favour of the bill, with 15 abstentions.After the vote, Marie-Charlotte Garin, a green MP, who had pushed for the law change in parliament, said: “When it’s no, it’s no. When it’s not no, that doesn’t mean yes. And when it’s yes, it must be a real yes … Giving in will never be consenting again.”The push to include consent in the law was driven by last year’s trial of Pelicot’s former husband and 50 other men convicted of raping or sexually abusing her. Over almost a decade, Dominique Pelicot had drugged his wife to a near comatose state and invited strangers he met on an internet chatroom to rape and abuse her in the couple’s home.All those accused were convicted – andone who had appealedagainst the ruling had his conviction upheld earlier this month. But the case threw a spotlight on a grey area of the law. Many of the accused argued they were not guilty of rape because they had believed Gisèle Pelicot was asleep and they were taking part in some sort of game.Catherine Le Magueresse, a legal expert and supporter of the new law, said the bill would encourage young men and women to consider the “reciprocity of desire”.Many inFrancehave argued the question of consent is a false flag and that rape is best understood not as a consensual or non-consensual sexual act, but a predatory one. They have argued focusing on consent places the victim at the centre of an investigation and not the alleged rapist.“Consent is the wrong issue. It places the emphasis once more on the victim, not the rapist,” Anne-Cécile Mailfert, founder of the Fondation des Femmes, saidduring the Pelicot trial last year.“We are calling for a comprehensive law againstsexual violencethat would address the impunity allowed by our institutions, including a ­systematic investigation of rape complaints, a ban on investigations into the victim’s sexual past … a law that would provide a framework and the means to act and protect [rape victims].”Gisèle Pelicot’s lawyer, Antoine Camus, was also dubious about changing the law to include consent, fearing it would “backfire” on victims. “What exactly is consent in sexual matters? To any sexual act, or to one in particular?” he said last year. “Our definition of rape is not perfect today, but it has the merit of not falling into this trap.”Explore more on these topicsFranceGisèle PelicotGisèle Pelicot rape trialEuropeRape and sexual assaultShareReuse this content"

Those effects depend on decisions made by the administration throughout the shutdown. In addition, how federal employees and contractors respond to the delay in compensation is uncertain,” Swagel added.TheUS government shutdownstretched into its 29th day on Wednesday with no sign of an end to the crisis. TheSenateremained deadlocked over spending legislation and on Tuesday SenateDemocratsblocked aRepublican-backed bill that would have funded federal agencies through 21 November.Democrats have refused to support the bill to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancement in the Senate because it does not include funding for healthcare programs, or curbs onDonald Trump’s cuts to congressionally approved funding.According to the CBO report, economic activity at the end of 2025 will be lower as a result of the shutdown, with the decline being driven by three factors: fewer services will be provided by federal workers, federal spending on goods, services and food benefits will be temporarily lower and a drop in overall demand will temporarily decrease production from the private sector.The report laid out three loss estimates amid the government shutdown. If the government opens this week, a total GDP loss by the end of 2026 would be $7bn. If the shutdown lifts after six weeks, or around 12 November, the total GDP loss would be $11bn. The estimated losses after the eight-week shutdown scenario were projected to be $14bn.The CBO added that although a government shutdown lasting four weeks would not affect federal spending for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits, how a longer shutdown would affect Snap benefits is uncertain.The report comes asmore than two dozen states– led by New York, California and Massachusetts – sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over its decision to suspend food stamps amid the shutdown.Meanwhile, nearly 11,000 air traffic controllers, who are deemed essential workers,missed their first paycheckon Tuesday.With two weeks of unpaid work, as well as staffing issues being reported across major cities including Chicago, Dallas and Nashville, Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, has warned that another missed paycheck would be financially “harder [for employees] … as expenses continue to roll [in]”.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Trump administrationUS SenateUS federal government shutdownsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

With the army having abandoned El Fasher, the RSF now holds all five of Darfur’s regional capitals, while fighting continues in the southern region of Kordofan.El Fasher, once a city of more than 1 million people, has been under siege by the RSF since May 2024. In August that year, famine was declared in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, south of the city. In April, the RSFkilled as many as 2,000 peoplewhen it seized the camp, which at the time housed 500,000 people.Experts had also been warning that an RSF takeover of El Fasher would most likely be a repeat of its capture of Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, in 2023. The group killed as many as 15,000 civilians then, mostly from non-Arab groups.Former children’s hospitalThe RSF grew out of theJanjaweed Arab militias, which were accused of committing genocide of African ethnic groupsunder the orders of former president Omar al-Bashirin Darfur in 2003.In January, the US governmentformally declared that the RSF had committed genocide. Many Sudanese people still refer to the RSF as the Janjaweed.On Tuesday, the Joint Forces, a coalition of armed groups allied with Sudan’s military, said the RSF had executed more than 2,000 unarmed civilians since taking El Fasher.The RSF’s leader,Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, admitted there had been “abuses” by his forces, in his first comments since the fall of El Fasher, posted on Wednesday on Telegram. Dagalo said an investigation had been opened, without providing further details.The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab analysed satellite imagery of the hospital on Monday 27 and Tuesday 28 October. On Tuesday, three clusters of white objects and “reddish discoloration on the ground” appeared next to the hospital, having not been there the day before. In two of the clusters, the objects were 1.1-1.9 metres long, while the size of the objects in the third group could not be measured, the lab said in areport.The report also found “evidence consistent with mass killing” at an RSF detention site at a former children’s hospital in the east of El Fasher, as well as continued “systematic killing” at the east of the city’s earth walls, originally built as a defence mechanism by the army and then reinforced by the RSF.It is not yet possible to determine exactly how many people have been killed by the RSF in El Fasher, said Caitlin Howarth, the director of conflict analytics at the Yale lab. She added: “We’re not looking at small numbers, we’re looking at dozens and hundreds and, eventually, there will be thousands.”Civilians who made it out of El Fasher have reported being stripped of belongings and extorted for ransom by RSF fighters, with many women reporting being sexually assaulted. It is likely that many have died in the desert, trying to reach displacement camps, Howarth said, adding that the true number may never be known.The Associated Press spoke to witnesses who said RSF fighters went house to house, beating and shooting at people, including women and children. Many civilians died of gunshot wounds in the streets, some while trying to flee to safety, they said.“It was a like a killing field. Bodies everywhere and people bleeding and no one to help them,” Tajal-Rahman, a man in his late 50s, said by phone from Tawila, a displacement camp about 37 miles (60km) west of El Fasher that now houses more than 650,000 people.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsSudanMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, our political opponents have embarked down an anti-jobs, anti-science path that would spell disaster for our economy, our security and our planet.“Future generations will look back and judge us all on whether we took action to protect our planet and our way of life. This government is proud to be judged on this metric – and at Cop30 next week we will show that we are willing in both word and deed to fight for our planet.”The prime minister, Keir Starmer, has backed the blueprint, called the “carbon budget delivery plan”, published on Wednesday afternoon, by which the government has reaffirmed its commitment to decarbonise the UK’s electricity supply by 2030 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically by 2037.Renters will be allowed to demand that their landlords give them access to electric vehicle charging, in a redrawing of current rules, and industry will gain discounts to help reduce its energy costs.Heat pumps will be targeted as the low-carbon heating option to which the vast majority of the country will have to move, but the government has refused to rule out hydrogen for home heating, despite expert evidencethat it would be expensive and unviable.No firm price tag will be attached to the plan, but the government calculates it will not add to already high energy bills. The manifesto commitment to reduce energy bills by £300 still stands.Although the government would not confirm this, some observers believe that Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, may move to remove or reduce VAT on energy bills in the November budget.Asad Rehman, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, one of the groups that brought a legal action forcing the government to publish the new plan, said: “The government has signalled that it recognises that meaningful climate action isn’t just a legal duty – it’s a massive social and economic opportunity too. Done right, it can deliver cheaper bills, warmer homes and thousands of good green jobs. This would help tackle the deep inequality felt across the country and build a fairer, more prosperous future.”The plan covers all the main sources of carbon emissions, including energy, transport, agriculture, homes and industry. But campaigners said there were some omissions – for instance, there was no commitment to reducing the number of flights people take. The government is greenlightingthe expansion of airportsincluding Gatwickand Heathrow.Instead, the plan promises that 22% of fuel used in planes will besustainable aviation fuel, which is in high demand globally and requires huge amounts of land to produce.Juliet Michaelson, director of the climate charity Possible, said: “This plan still lacks realistic thinking on the most difficult-to-decarbonise areas, such as aviation. The reality is that the people who pollute the most will have to be made to pollute less.”The plan makes little mention of public transport, focusing on the uptake of electric vehicles rather than planning new railways. Climate experts say road use will have to be reduced to meet net zero, and motorist numbers are rising year-on-year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

To be consistent with recommendations from the Climate Change Committee, this would have to mean less land used for animal agriculture, but that is not explicitly addressed.Recommitting to climate action is a calculated political gamble. Reform has made scrapping net zero and climate policy, and pushing for an increase in fossil fuel use, acentrepiece of its policy offering. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has alsovowed to repeal the Climate Change Actand push for more gas.Some within the Labour party want Starmer to follow suit by abandoning the pledge to decarbonise electricity and allow for more fossil fuel use. The former Labour leader Tony Blair’s thinktank has pushed for such a U-turn several times this year.But others within government argue that backing down on climate policy will onlyalienate core voters, while depriving the UK of the opportunities of low-carbon economic growth. The CBI found that thegreen economy was growing three times fasterthan the rest of the economy, and many key businesses have expressed their backing for net zero.Ed Miliband’s new green jobs will bring Britain hope. I dare Reform to denounce them  | Polly ToynbeeRead moreMost of the “carbon budget delivery plan” unveiled on Wednesday was not new policy but restatements of existing measures. Publishing the plan was a legal requirement, placed on the government by the high court last year after a legal challenge by charities including Friends of the Earth and ClientEarth.The court ordered the Conservative government at the time, which was accused offalling behind on its statutory obligationto cut carbon to net zero by 2050, topublish a clear planon how to meet the UK’s five-yearly carbon budgets, set out by the Climate Change Committee.Kyle Lischak, the head of UK at ClientEarth, said: “Security and prosperity will only endure when policy aligns with nature, not against it. We’re proud that the legacy of our work on this climate plan is one of holding Westminster to its word. This new plan exists because people and organisations stood up for the rule of law and demanded honesty about how the UK intends to meet its climate commitments; the law enables the courts and the public to ensure promises are backed by credible action.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsLabourEnergyRenewable energyHousehold billsGreen economynewsShareReuse this content"

But the experts say a healthy future is impossible if fossil fuels continue to be financed at current rates.Dr Marina Romanello, of University College London (UCL), who led the analysis, said: “This [report] paints a bleak and undeniable picture of the devastating health harms reaching all corners of the world. The destruction to lives and livelihoods will continue to escalate until we end our fossil fuel addiction.“We’re seeing millions of deaths occurring needlessly every year because of our delay in mitigating climate change and our delay in adapting to the climate change that cannot be avoided. We’re seeing key leaders, governments and corporations backsliding on climate commitments and putting people increasingly in harm’s way.”The report says the rate of heat-related deaths has surged by 23% since the 1990s, even after accounting for increases in populations, to an average of 546,000 a year between 2012 and 2021.“That is approximately one heat-related death every minute throughout the year,” said Prof Ollie Jay, of the University of Sydney, Australia, who was part of the analysis team. “It is a really startling number and the numbers are going up.”Jay said: “We constantly emphasise to people that heat stress can affect everybody and it can be deadly – I think a lot of people don’t understand that – and that every heat-related death is preventable.”Laura Clarke, the chief executive of the environmental law firm ClientEarth, said: “We are living through the era of climate consequences. Heatwaves, floods, drought and disease are no longer distant warnings – they’re here now. But asattribution science, climate litigation and grassroots activism grow,accountability for climate impactsis no longer a question of if but when.”The 2025 edition of the LancetCountdown on Health and Climate Changewas led by UCL in collaboration with the World Health Organization and produced by 128 experts from more than 70 academic institutions and UN agencies.In the past four years, the average person has been exposed to 19 days a year of life-threatening heat and 16 of those days would not have happened without human-caused global heating, the report says. Overall, exposure to high temperatures resulted in a record 639bn hours of lost labour in 2024, which caused losses of 6% of national GDP in the least developed nations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Wildfires, stoked by increasingly hot and dry conditions, are adding to the deaths caused by smoke, with a record 154,000 deaths recorded in 2024, the report says. Droughts and heatwaves damage crops and livestock and 123 million more people endured food insecurity in 2023, compared with the annual average between 1981 and 2010.Despite the harm, the world’s governments provided $956bn in direct fossil fuel subsidies in 2023, which was the world’s hottest year on record until it was surpassed by 2024. The researchers said this dwarfed the$300bn a yearpledged at the UN climate summit Cop29 in 2024 to support the most climate-vulnerable countries.The report says the UK provided $28bn in fossil fuel subsidies in 2023 and Australia allocated $11bn. Fifteen countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Venezuela and Algeria spent more on fossil fuel subsidies than on their national health budgets.The world’s 100 largest fossil fuel companies increased their projected production in the year up to March 2025, which would lead to carbon dioxide emissions three times those compatible with the Paris climate agreement target of limiting heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the report says. Commercial banks are supporting this expansion, with the top 40 lenders to the fossil fuel sector collectively investing a five-year high of $611bn in 2024. Their green sector lending was lower at $532bn.Romanello said: “If wekeep on financing fossil fuelsand enabling this expansion of fossil fuels, we know that a healthy future is not possible.”She said thesolutions to avoid a climate catastropheand protect lives existed, from clean energy to city adaptation tohealthier, climate-friendly diets.“If there’s any optimism it comes from the action by local communities and authorities, and by the health sector – those that are really in contact with people on the ground,” she said. “They are seeing the impacts with their own eyes and are stepping up because they just become undeniable, but we must keep up the momentum.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisExtreme heatAir pollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

In it, Trump set out his ideas about what was wrong with the US: immigrants, mostly, but also Barack Obama, the “often pathetic” media, and the “total losers” in Congress.The book, the 18th inthe Trump canon, is typically self-aggrandising, with Trump describing his own brand as “one of the world’s great icons of quality and excellence”.Trump writes of himself: “Donald Trump builds businesses. Donald Trump builds buildings. Donald Trump develops magnificent golf courses. Donald Trump makes investments that create jobs. And Donald Trump creates jobs for legal immigrants and all Americans.”I did alive-read of Crippled Americafor the Guardian (I think I was being punished for something), and one bit that jumped out at me, amid the get-off-my-lawn complaints about foreigners and how there isn’t enough discipline in schools these days, was Trump’s cavalier dismissal of the climate crisis.“If you go back in history, you’ll find that the biggest tornadoes we’ve had in this country took place in the 1890s,” Trump wrote,wrongly. “And the most hurricanes occurred in the 1860s and 70s,” he added,also incorrectly.The then presidential candidate concluded: “Violent climate ‘changes’ are nothing new. We have even had ice ages.” (At no point in the last 160 years has there been an ice age.) “I just don’t happen to believe they are man-made.”Trump offered no explanation as to why he disagrees with the majority of the world’s scientists in believing that the climate crisis is not the result of human behavior. But on the day Crippled America was released he gave a press conference about the book, at Trump Tower in Manhattan, so I popped down.I asked Trump why he didn’t believe in climate change. He paused for a couple of seconds, then said, “OK, what else,” and briskly turned to another journalist.Trump dismissing me was unimportant, just a mildly funny story I could tell people back home. But hisblithe dismissal of science could have huge consequences.View image in fullscreenBRAZIL-UN-CLIMATE-COP30This view shows the COP30 logotype at Docks Station in Belem, Para state, Brazil on October 24, 2025.

But Trump doesn’t believe that. And when world leaders gather for the Cop30 climate summit in Brazil next month, there is expected to be no delegation from the US–onhis first dayin office, Trump ordered the withdrawal of the US, the world’s second biggest emitter of planet-heating pollution, from the Paris climate agreement.Meanwhile the president’s bizarre hatred for renewable energy (see: windfarms are driving whales“loco”) has seen the US fall behind the rest of the world, as Trump has instead, inthe words of my colleagueOliver Milman, “become the planet’s foremost advocate of fossil fuels”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has since paid £7.5m in refurbishments to the building.He is understood to be paying “peppercorn” rent, which is a legal term used in leases to show that rent technically exists, so the lease is valid – but the figure is often low, such as £1 per year. Andrew lives at the property with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.“There is considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money in relation to Prince Andrew, which in part stems from the fact that he is no longer a working royal and from serious and disturbing allegations made against him,” wrote Clifton-Brown.The letter, which was published on Wednesday, also questions whether the cost of any work on the property had been funded by the taxpayer, and whether an unredacted copy of the lease could be provided.This advancement comes after fresh allegations about the prince in theposthumous memoirby the Epstein survivor Virginia Giuffre, who said she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions. He has denied these allegations.“Does the current tenancy remain the most appropriate use of the Royal Lodge in light of the recent changed role for Prince Andrew, and if so, on what grounds?” wrote Clifton-Brown.“We are therefore concerned as to whether the lease arrangements for Royal Lodge are, in light of recent developments and changes in the responsibilities of Prince Andrew, achieving the best value for money.“They must also be justifiable in comparison to other options for the use or disposal of the property.”Andrew issaid to be in talks with King Charles’s representativesabout leaving the property voluntarily after renewed controversy over his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. If Andrew were forced to leave the mansion, the crown estate may have to pay him compensation.The Treasury and the crown estate have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

This deal delivers on our promise to protect our borders and cut down on migration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the ambassador responded that he had made no such comment.Access to the EU’s energy markets is also imperilled by the bill, representatives of the EU warned the government. This would be very difficult for the UK, which imports 16% of its electricity from Europe. The UK government estimates the deal will add £9bn to the UK economy by 2040.The bill, which the government hopes will boost economic growth,removes EU-derived nature protectionsand instead allows developers to build on wildlife areas if they pay money into a “nature recovery fund” and commit to improve the environment within 10 years.The EU believes its protections, which the UK used to follow, are stronger as they involve not harming habitats in the first place, and quicklyreplacing what is lostrather than making a vague long-term commitment.EU negotiators have also noticed there are provisions in the bill for the Treasury to claw back the money from the nature recovery fund in some instances, meaning it is not fully ringfenced to protect wildlife.The ambassador is understood to have warned Reynolds that the bill as it stands could floutthe “level playing field” rulesthat underpin the free trade agreement. These rules state that the UK cannot regress on its environmental rules in a way that would give it a competitive advantage over the EU. The bloc believes this bill does exactly that.EU representatives also raised this concern at a meeting with government officials earlier this month.It has been noted by the EU that all theministerial speechesabout the bill have been about removing red tape to boost economic growth. EU officials say it will be hard for the government to argue the bill does not give it a competitive advantage in light of this.When contacted for comment, the EU Delegation said that it does not comment on ongoing discussions with the UK. TheEuropean Unionremains fully committed to strengthening its close partnership with the United Kingdom, in accordance with the agreements reached at the EU-UK Summit of 19 May.Keir Starmer, the prime minister, has been trying tostart a “reset”with the EU, to remove friction for trade and undo some of the damage to the UK economy caused by Brexit.Ben Reynolds, of the green thinktank IEEP UK, said: “It is understandable that the EU has concerns that the planning bill as it stands regresses on the commitments the UK made when it left the EU to maintain similar levels of environmental standards, and in this case nature protection.“There is no clear argument around removing these protections as the bill currently threatens, but the case against is strong if it jeopardises the government’s nascent work to rebuild relationships with the EU. The economic case is clear for closer cooperation with the EU, be it on energy markets or other aspects of policy that would remove trade barriers and benefit British businesses and our environmental standards.”Earlier this year, the EU met the UK to discuss participation in the electricity market. As part of these discussions, there was an understanding that the UK would align with relevant environmental protections concerning the building of electricity infrastructure. However, the bill would remove these to make it easier to build renewable energy, and the EU currently understands the bill as lowering environmental protections for the benefit of energy generators.A government spokesperson said: “The planning and infrastructure bill will not regress any environmental standards – it will deliver a win-win for nature and development. Environmental delivery plans will secure better environmental outcomes that go further than current legislation which simply offsets harm, and money from the nature restoration fund is ringfenced for nature under clauses in the bill. We are committed to the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement and ensuring our mutual high standards are protected.”This article was amended on 29 October 2025.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentEuropean UnionTrade policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The companies are frequently gagged from alerting the affected customer their information has been turned over. This is either because the law enforcement agency has the power to demand this or a court has ordered them to stay silent.For Israel, losing control of its data to authorities overseas was a significant concern. So to deal with the threat,officials createda secret warning system: the companies must send signals hidden in payments to the Israeli government, tipping it off when it has disclosed Israeli data to foreign courts or investigators.To clinch the lucrative contract, Google and Amazon agreed to the so-called winking mechanism, according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian, as part of a joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand Hebrew-language outletLocal Call.Based on the documents and descriptions of the contract by Israeli officials, the investigation reveals how the companies bowed to a series of stringent and unorthodox “controls” contained within the 2021 deal, known as Project Nimbus. BothGoogleand Amazon’s cloud businesses have denied evading any legal obligations.The strict controls include measures that prohibit the US companies from restricting how an array of Israeli government agencies, security services and military units use their cloud services. According to the deal’s terms, the companies cannot suspend or withdraw Israel’s access to its technology, even if it’s found to have violated their terms of service.Israeli officials inserted the controls to counter a series of anticipated threats. They feared Google or Amazon might bow to employee or shareholder pressure and withdraw Israel’s access to its products and services if linked to human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories.They were also concerned the companies could be vulnerable to overseas legal action, particularly in cases relating to the use of the technology in the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.The terms of the Nimbus deal would appear to prohibit Google and Amazon from the kind of unilateralaction taken by Microsoft last month, when it disabled the Israeli military’s access to technology used to operate an indiscriminate surveillance system monitoring Palestinian phone calls.Microsoft, which provides a range of cloud services to Israel’s military and public sector, bid for the Nimbus contract but was beaten by its rivals. According to sources familiar with negotiations, Microsoft’s bid suffered as it refused to accept some of Israel’s demands.As with Microsoft, Google and Amazon’s cloud businesses have faced scrutiny in recent years over the role of their technology – and the Nimbus contract in particular – in Israel’s two-year war on Gaza.View image in fullscreenEx-Google employees speak about Google’s Project Nimbus at the University of California, Berkeley, in Berkeley, California, on 25 April 2024.Photograph: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty ImagesDuring its offensive in the territory, where aUN commission of inquiry concludedthat Israel has committed genocide, the Israeli military hasrelied heavily on cloud providersto store and analyse large volumes of data and intelligence information.One such dataset wasthe vast collection of intercepted Palestinian callsthat until August was stored on Microsoft’s cloud platform. According to intelligence sources, the Israeli military planned to move the data to Amazon Web Services (AWS) datacentres.Amazon did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about whether it knew of Israel’s plan to migrate the mass surveillance data to its cloud platform. A spokesperson for the company said it respected “the privacy of our customers and we do not discuss our relationship without their consent, or have visibility into their workloads” stored in the cloud.Asked about the winking mechanism, both Amazon and Google denied circumventing legally binding orders. “The idea that we would evade our legal obligations to the US government as a US company, or in any other country, is categorically wrong,” a Google spokesperson said.Quick GuideContact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Nothing has changed. This appears to be yet another attempt to falsely imply otherwise.”However, according to theIsraeli government documents detailing the controls inserted into the Nimbus agreement, officials concluded they had extracted important concessions from Google and Amazon after the companies agreed to adapt internal processes and “subordinate” their standard contractual terms in favour of Israel’s demands.A government memo circulated several months after the deal was signed stated: “[The companies] understand the sensitivities of the Israeli government and are willing to accept our requirements.”How the secret code worksNamed after the towering cloud formations, the Nimbus contract – which runs for an initial seven years with the possibility of extension – is a flagship Israeli government initiative to store information from across the public sector and military in commercially owned datacentres.Even though its data would be stored in Google and Amazon’s newly built Israel-based datacentres, Israeli officials feared developments in US and European laws could create more direct routes for law enforcement agencies to obtain it via direct requests or court-issued subpoenas.View image in fullscreenAn Amazon Web Services datacentre in Stone Ridge, Virginia, on 28 July 2024.Photograph: Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWith this threat in mind, Israeli officials inserted into the Nimbus deal a requirement for the companies to a send coded message – a “wink” – to its government, revealing the identity of the country they had been compelled to hand over Israeli data to, but were gagged from saying so.Leaked documents from Israel’s finance ministry, which include a finalised version of the Nimbus agreement, suggest the secret code would take the form of payments – referred to as “special compensation” – made by the companies to the Israeli government.According to the documents, the payments must be made “within 24 hours of the information being transferred” and correspond to the telephone dialing code of the foreign country, amounting to sums between 1,000 and 9,999 shekels.Under the terms of the deal, the mechanism works like this:If either Google or Amazon provides information to authorities in the US, where the dialing code is +1, and they are prevented from disclosing their cooperation, they must send the Israeli government 1,000 shekels.If, for example, the companies receive a request for Israeli data from authorities in Italy, where the dialing code is +39, they must send 3,900 shekels.If the companies conclude the terms of a gag order prevent them from even signaling which country has received the data, there is a backstop: the companies must pay 100,000 shekels ($30,000) to the Israeli government.Legal experts, including several former US prosecutors, said the arrangement was highly unusual and carried risks for the companies as the coded messages could violate legal obligations in the US, where the companies are headquartered, to keep a subpoena secret.“It seems awfully cute and something that if the US government or, more to the point, a court were to understand, I don’t think they would be particularly sympathetic,” a former US government lawyer said.Several experts described the mechanism as a “clever” workaround that could comply with the letter of the law but not its spirit. “It’s kind of brilliant, but it’s risky,” said a former senior US security official.Israeli officials appear to have acknowledged this, documents suggest. Their demands about how Google and Amazon respond to a US-issued order “might collide” with US law, they noted, and the companies would have to make a choice between “violating the contract or violating their legal obligations”.Neither Google nor Amazon responded to the Guardian’s questions about whether they had used the secret code since the Nimbus contract came into effect.“We have a rigorous global process for responding to lawful and binding orders for requests related to customer data,” Amazon’s spokesperson said. “We do not have any processes in place to circumvent our confidentiality obligations on lawfully binding orders.”Google declined to comment on which of Israel’s stringent demands it had accepted in the completed Nimbus deal, but said it was “false” to “imply that we somehow were involved in illegal activity, which is absurd”.A spokesperson for Israel’s finance ministry said: “The article’s insinuation that Israel compels companies to breach the law is baseless.”‘No restrictions’Israeli officials also feared a scenario in which its access to the cloud providers’ technology could be blocked or restricted.In particular, officials worried that activists and rights groups could place pressure on Google and Amazon, or seek court orders in several European countries, to force them to terminate or limit their business with Israel if their technology were linked to human rights violations.To counter the risks, Israel inserted controls into the Nimbus agreement which Google and Amazon appear to have accepted, according to government documents prepared after the deal was signed.The documents state that the agreement prohibits the companies from revoking or restricting Israel’s access to their cloud platforms, either due to changes in company policy or because they find Israel’s use of their technology violates their terms of service.Provided Israel does not infringe on copyright or resell the companies’ technology, “the government is permitted to make use of any service that is permitted by Israeli law”, according to a finance ministry analysis of the deal.Both companies’ standard “acceptable use” policies state their cloud platforms should not be used to violate the legal rights of others, nor should they be used to engage in or encourage activities that cause “serious harm” to people.However, according to an Israeli official familiar with the Nimbus project, there can be “no restrictions” on the kind of information moved into Google and Amazon’s cloud platforms, including military and intelligence data. The terms of the deal seen by the Guardian state that Israel is “entitled to migrate to the cloud or generate in the cloud any content data they wish”.Israel inserted the provisions into the deal to avoid a situation in which the companies “decide that a certain customer is causing them damage, and therefore cease to sell them services”, one document noted.The Interceptreported last yearthe Nimbus project was governed by an “amended” set of confidential policies, and cited a leaked internal report suggesting Google understood it would not be permitted to restrict the types of services used by Israel.Last month, when Microsoftcut off Israeli accessto some cloud and artificial intelligence services, it did so after confirming reporting by the Guardian and its partners, +972 and Local Call, that the military had stored a vast trove of intercepted Palestinian calls in the company’s Azure cloud platform.Notifying the Israeli military of its decision, Microsoft said that using Azure in this way violated its terms of service and it was “not in the business of facilitating the mass surveillance of civilians”.Under the terms of the Nimbus deal, Google and Amazon are prohibited from taking such action as it would “discriminate” against the Israeli government. Doing so would incur financial penalties for the companies, as well as legal action for breach of contract.The Israeli finance ministry spokesperson said Google and Amazon are “bound by stringent contractual obligations that safeguard Israel’s vital interests”. They added: “These agreements are confidential and we will not legitimise the article’s claims by disclosing private commercial terms.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsGoogleAmazonIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

McGee’s second and third pregnancies had been complicated by health issues. She nearly died at one point and suffered a stroke, and a doctor said any future pregnancies could prove fatal and advised her to take contraception.A 1935 ban on the sale and import of contraceptives, however, made it nearly impossible for her to follow the doctor’s instructions.The couple turned to the UK, placing an order for a diaphragm and spermicide jelly,according to the Irish Times. The package was seized by customs, and they were told that if they attempted to order contraceptives from abroad again, they would face fines or jail time.McGee refused to give in. “I was livid that somebody in government could tell us how to live our lives. I wasn’t going to back down,”she toldthe Irish Examiner in 2022.The couple took their case to the high court, where Seamus, who went by the name of Shay, laid out exactly what was at stake. “I’d prefer to see her use contraceptives than be placing flowers on her grave,” he told a hearing in 1972.View image in fullscreenMary McGee with husband Seamus in 1972.Photograph: Dermot Barry/The_Irish_TimesAfter their legal challenge was struck down, the couple appealed to the supreme court. Four of the five judges ruled in their favour, finding that contraception was a private matter for married couples and that the decision should be free of interference from the state.Their victory resonated across Ireland and around the world, with the couple receiving congratulatory messages from the WorldHealthOrganization and from as far as Hawaii.They also faced anger from some quarters, latertelling mediaof how they had walked out of their parish, never to return, after the priest suggested they had brought the church into disrepute.The couple’s legal battle remains the court’s single most important decision in terms of its political and social consequences, the supreme court justice Gerard Hogan later noted.It was the “legal equivalent of the moon landing” in that it forced the government to gradually shift its stance on contraception, Hogan said at a 2023 conference examining the McGee case and its legacy, inremarks reported by the Irish Times.The decision “shows how one brave woman single-handedly changed the course of Irish social history”, he said, leading to “a social revolution, the consequences of which are still being played out”.As news broke on Wednesdaythat May had died peacefullyat a hospital in Berlin, tributes poured in across social media as people remembered her courage and hailed her as a hero for the women of Ireland.The writer and film director Paul Duanewroteon Bluesky: “How far we’ve come. Now Irish religious conservatism is limited to a few thousand spoiled votes and a lot of airtime on [Irish public broadcaster] RTE. But the country isn’t listening to them any more, thanks to brave women like May McGee.”The writer Fintan O’Toole‬hailed heras “one of the heroines of modern Ireland.”Laura Kelly, a historian of medicine and gender in modern Ireland and professor at the University of Strathclyde,wrote on Bluesky: “May McGee was such a courageous woman and had a huge impact.”Shay McGee died in January 2024.Explore more on these topicsIrelandContraception and family planningHealthEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But, in an apparent appeal to the thieves, she added: “There is still time to give them back.”View image in fullscreenThere has been a heavy police presence outside the museum since the heist.Photograph: Abdul Saboor/ReutersThe treasures were “clearly unsellable” as they were, she said. “Anyone who buys them would be guilty of concealment of stolen goods,” she told journalists, adding she “would like to hope” they would be recovered “for the Louvre and for the nation”.The four-man gang pulled up outside the world’s most visited museum at about 9.30am on 19 October in a stolen furniture removal truck fitted with an extending ladder and lift, in which two climbed to the ornate first-floor Apollo gallery.Wearing hi-vis vests to resemble maintenance workers, they smashed an unsecured window and used disc cutters to slice open two glass display cases before descending in the bucket lift and fleeing on motorbikes driven by the other two men.The heist lasted less than seven minutes, with the two who entered the gallery spending three minutes and 58 seconds inside. They dropped a diamond and emerald-studded crown but fled with eight richly gem-encrusted pieces.The stolen jewels included an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave to his second wife, Marie Louise, and a diadem set with 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds that had once belonged to the empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III.Beccuau said the two suspects – both of whom were arrested last Saturday night, one at Charles de Gaulle airport outsideParis, reportedly as he was trying to catch a flight to Algeria – were believed to be the men who had entered the Apollo gallery.Their DNA had been found on a display case and a scooter used in the getaway, the prosecutor said. She added that it was possible that the gang had numbered more than four men, but there was no indication so far it had benefited from inside help.Beccuau said one of the suspects, an Algerian national, was aged 34, had lived inFrancesince 2010, and was known to police for road traffic offences. The second was aged 39, born in the Paris suburb of Aubervilliers, and had convictions for burglary.The prosecutor said 100 investigators from France’s BRB organised crime squad and a unit specialising in trafficked artworks and cultural goods were “working every day of the week, day and night, in an effort to identify the thieves and recover the jewels”.Investigations were continuing, she said, adding that there was still “plenty of evidence to be examined”. She declined to give any details about the two suspects who remain at large.Earlier on Wednesday, police acknowledged serious shortcomings in the Louvre’s security. The Paris police chief, Patrice Faure, told senators that ageing systems and delays to planned upgrades meant “a technological step has not been taken”.A planned €80m (£70m) security improvement programme would not be completed before the end of the decade, Faure said. The museum’s director, Laurence des Cars,had previously acknowledged security blindspots.Des Cars said the only external security camera installed near the Apollo gallery was pointing in the wrong direction to cover the window. The museum this week transferred some precious jewels to the Bank of France, RTL Radio reported.Explore more on these topicsFranceParisEuropeMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

We urge all involved to redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation,” said its director general, Sigrid de Vries.Another ACEA member, Mercedes, is now searching globally for alternative sources of the crucial semiconductors, according to its chief executive, Ola Källenius.The chip shortage is also causing problems in Japan, where Nissan’s chief performance officer, Guillaume Cartier, told reporters at a car show in Tokyo that the company was only “OK to the first week of November” in terms of supply.Beijing banned exports of Nexperia chips near the start of the month in response to the Dutch government’s decision to take over the Netherlands-headquartered company on 30 September and suspend its Chinese chief executiveafter the US flagged security concerns.Last week car companies in the UK, EU and Japan, including brands such as Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen and Volvo,said the ban on exports from Nexperia factories in Chinacould halt production lines.“The industry is currently working through reserve stocks but supplies are rapidly dwindling. From a survey of our members this week, some are already expecting imminent assembly line stoppages,” de Vries said.The Nexperia chip ban was a blow to Europe’s car sector, which has already been hit by President Xi Jinping’s decision toreintroduce controls on exports of rare earth exportsas part of the escalating trade tensions with the US.Aston Martin cuts investment plan by £300m as Trump tariffs biteRead moreXi andDonald Trumpare expected to sign off on a trade agreement when they meet on the sidelines of a summit in South Korea on Thursday. The proposed deal would pause the export ban on the crucial minerals for a year, but it is unclear if this will also cover deliveries to the EU.Rare earths, in particular magnets, are used across the car industry for window, door and boot openings, while chips are critical to all electronics in vehicles, ranging from dashboard functions to ignition and transmission systems.De Vries said while alternative suppliers for chips existed, it could take “months to build up additional capacity”. She said the “industry does not have that long before the worst effects of this shortage are felt”.A high-level delegation from Beijing will arrive in Brussels on Friday for talks but there are fears the diplomatic tools deployed by the EU in the past months are not as effective as the hardballing used by the US andChina.Andrew Small, a senior fellow and China expert at the German Marshall Fund, an American thinktank, said: “I think the EU needs a fix super-quickly on Nexperia and there are hopes that there may be some progress on that this week.”Small believes China’s attitude to the EU has changed since April, when it learned that hardballing the US got results.“This is all part of a new strategy where China is repeatedly now taking steps that bring European industry and other industries around the world to the point of choking them off,” he said.“It is no longer that Europe is collateral damage, it is China targeting Europe and I think people are beginning to understand that now.”De Vries said: “We know that all parties to this dispute are working very hard to find a diplomatic solution. At the same time, our members are telling us that part supplies are already being stopped due to the shortage.”The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia on 30 September, citing lapses in governance. On 4 October, the Chinese ministry of commerce blocked exports of the chipmaker’s products out of China. While most of Nexperia’s semiconductors are produced in Europe, about 70% are packaged in China before distribution.A spokesperson for Wingtech, Nexperia’s Chinese owner, said the chip shortage was self-inflicted and “a result of the ill-considered measures by the Dutch government”, which had “jeopardised global business continuity”.The company’s Chinese arm has taken steps towards independence and hasresumed sellingproducts to domestic Chinese customers.The sources said the Dutch government believes it can negotiate a resolution with China that will restore the company to a unified Dutch-Chinese structure.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryEuropeChinaAsia PacificMotoringDonald TrumpXi JinpingShareReuse this content"

Her remarks came a day after thescience minister, Patrick Vallance, saidthat “some degree of price increase is inevitable”.He told MPs on the science committee: “For brand new, innovative medicines it’s likely there will be some price increase.”A price rise will require additional funding for theNHSat a time when Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, faces tough decisions to balance the books, and is likely to breach Labour’s election promises not to raise one of the big three taxes of VAT, income tax and national insurance.“We’ve discussed the fact that if there’s a rise in price for innovative medicines, that comes with a cost load, and that needs to be met,” Lord Vallance said.The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers, representing trusts and other health organisations, said this week that the cost of covering redundancies and strikes, along with paying more for medicines, was not included in the budget and would need extra cash from the chancellor.While GSK is investing $30bn in US manufacturing and research, Walmsley reaffirmed the company’s support of the UK’s life sciences strategy and its commitment to Britain. This is in contrast with other pharmaceutical groups that have scrapped or paused investments in the UK, including MSD, known as Merck in the US, and its British rivalAstraZeneca.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will be sorely missedGraeme VirtueWed 29 Oct 2025 08.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 12.33 EDTShareBlame Brassic on Dominic West. While filmingPride, the rousing 2014 film about gay Londoners finding solidarity with a hardscrabble Welsh community during the miners’ strike, West was acting alongside lanky live wire Joseph Gilgun, who would regale him with wild tales of growing up in Chorley in Lancashire. Tickled by anecdotes like the theft of a shetland pony, West encouraged Gilgun to mine his formative years for material that could become a TV show.Gilgun teamed up with screenwriter Danny Brocklehurst, no stranger to authentic northern humour after working on Channel 4’sShameless. The result wasBrassic, a headlong comedy about a rowdy gang of scallywags, chancers and wheeler-dealers trying to stay one step ahead of the law and local heavies in the fictional northern town of Hawley. As well as repurposing the ducking and diving of his youth, the autobiographical elements extended to Gilgun’s likable ringleader Vinnie O’Neill coping with being bipolar. That key character detail also meant a recurring role for the plummy West as Vinnie’s relentlessly inappropriate GPDr Chris.When Brassic debuted on Sky in August 2019, it was a raucous word-of-mouth hit that became the broadcaster’s biggest comedy launch in years. Now, after seven seasons (placing it alongside Trollied as Sky’s longest-running homegrown sitcom) co-creators Gilgun and Brocklehurst are calling time with its 50th episode, a surprisingly tidy numerical capstone for a series that has always embraced chaos.Putting aside the exuberant, escalating farce of Brassic’s innumerable shady capers – which have included a bull semen heist, infiltrating a naked cult and multiple mix-ups involving corpses in compromising situations – the show’s greatest strength has always been its deep bench of boisterous but caring characters.View image in fullscreenSplenetic … Steve Evets as Farmer Jim in Brassic.Photograph: Ben Blackall/SkyEarly seasons foregrounded the intense emotional triangle between Vinnie, his upwardly mobile childhood pal Dylan (Damien Molony) and Dylan’s compassionate girlfriend Erin (Michelle Keegan). But their wider circle, seemingly permanently installed in the Crow’s Nest pub, was bursting with brash, big-hearted oddballs: dodgy entrepreneur Tommo (Ryan Sampson), gay, bare-knuckle fighter Ash (Aaron Heffernan), loyal mechanic JJ (Parth Thakerar) and unlikely sweethearts Cardi (Tom Hanson) and Carol (Bronagh Gallagher).Even amid such a stellar cast, there was an early breakout: the gang’s splenetic frenemyFarmer Jim(Steve Evets). With his scraggly woolly hat and bedraggled beard, Farmer Jim looks like Captain Birdseye marinated in sheep dip, always a hair-trigger away from a drunken, foul-mouthed tirade. Over the course of seven seasons, the indefatigable Evets has been responsible for some of the best screen swearing sinceThe Thick of It’s imperial phase.Having an ensemble strong enough that anyone can hold the spotlight has kept Brassic firing on all cylinders even as cast members have cycled in and out. (Molony left in season four; perhaps hisBergeracis so gloomy because he misses the high-jinks of Hawley.) A steady stream of up-for-it guest stars has helped, including Lee Mack, Steve Pemberton, Liza Tarbuck, Imelda Staunton, Greg Davies and Mani from the Stone Roses. Season five featured the surprise casting coup of Camille Cottin from French hit Call My Agent as a therapist helping Vinnie unpack his traumatic childhood. The addition of Shameless veteran Dean Lennox Kelly as ex-acid house DJ Curtis Plum also felt like a full circle moment.The transgressive plotlines and near-constant (but mostly affectionate) swearing has always made it easy to dismiss Brassic as crass or juvenile; a UK version of the cheerfully depraved It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, another long-running sitcom about loafers in a bar looking for kicks.But at a craft level, Brassic has always been brilliantly conceived, written and acted. There are echoes of Spaced, Community and even Family Guy in its use of elaborate flashbacks, fantasy sequences anddance numbers. What’s just as impressive is how the everyday pub scenes are optimised to maximise humour, with almost every line garlanded by sarcastic asides, knowing looks or background slapstick. Brassic’s additive, maximalist approach to comedy chimes with the all-or-nothing, ride-or-die philosophy of the Hawley crew.So perhaps it’s for the best that it bows out before it burns out. Appropriately for a show where the characters have spent an awful lot of time cultivating a weed farm, Brassic is going out on a high. (Last year saw a surge of renewed interest when the first four seasons became available on Netflix UK.) The climactic 50th episode has been trailed as a tonal departure, suggesting that volatile Hawley gangster Davey MacDonagh (Neil Ashton) may finally lose his patience with Vinnie and the gang. The fact that season seven has been released weekly rather than as the usual bingeable box set has certainly added to the sense of anticipation and dread. That fans are genuinely concerned about the fate of these nominally knockabout characters points to how beloved they are. In any case, they had a good run. Fare thee well, ne’er-do-wells.The final episode of Brassic is 9pm, Sky Max, 30 October; seasons one to seven are available on NowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the positive side, it can serve as protection: viewing an ennobled director’s films through this prism, auteurist critics can feel obliged to make excuses for even the worst among them. (The rationale is that a bad film by a Noted Film-maker is still better than the best efforts of a jobbing hack.) One disadvantage is that such honorifics can leave a creative patrolling a very narrow courtyard, searching only for material worthy of a Noted Film-maker; another is that the dismay when a project doesn’t spark is all the greater. A prominent test case has just reached Netflix in the Kathryn Bigelow-directed A House of Dynamite, a not-so-heavy-hitter that – if texts from cinephile pals this past weekend are anything to go by – seems nailed on for only one award this season: that for Gravest Disappointment.‘Our world is combustible’: Kathryn Bigelow on AI, Andy Warhol and nuclear ArmageddonRead moreTo determine why the film has underwhelmed so, we must retrace its director’s steps. Bigelow earned her laurels with a run of expansive, limber genre pics: biker flick The Loveless, the rangy vamp saga Near Dark, cop thriller Blue Steel, the enduring Keanu/Swayze actioner Point Break. Clearer indication of her direction of travel came with 1995’s underheralded Strange Days, an electrifying future-now thriller, informed by the Rodney King case, which also doubled as a cautionary fable about the perils of abandoning reality to seek shelter in the virtual realm. (Bigelow proved more alert to this than her screenwriter/ex-husband James Cameron, currently prepping the release of Avatar 3.) Yet post-2001, with her reputation growing, Bigelow – like her homeland – was forced on the defensive. The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty broached America’s then-recent misadventures in the Middle East; Detroit, released in the summer of Charlottesville, entered into fractious conversation with the country’s long history of racism.You can understand why a film-maker on this trajectory might be drawn towards Dynamite’s script – penned by Noah Oppenheim, the former NBC News chief who penned Netflix’s recent, De Niro-led series Zero Day – and why the streamer would enthusiastically stump for a nuclear-panic thriller after Oppenheimer’s Oscars sweep. (One pitch for the new film: what if Oppenheimer, but now?) Dynamite is at its strongest early on, describing in something like real time the 19 minutes in which a missile launched somewhere in the Pacific by unknown parties is spotted on the radars of a US army base in Alaska and flagged to the White House situation room, en route towards what everyone learns is its target: downtown Chicago. In this first section, Bigelow and Oppenheim briskly accelerate the stakes while engaging in an intriguing temporal brinkmanship: we’re set to wondering where this two-hour film can possibly go once the countdown clock reaches zero.The answer – and here’s where the disappointments begin – is back to the beginning: the film subsequently shuffles between the perspectives of those higher-ups (Tracy Letts’ general, secretary of defence Jared Harris and president Idris Elba) the prologue glimpsed or heard only in passing. Structurally, the film can’t develop: it’s a two-hour movie with fewer than 20 minutes of plot, leaving Oppenheim to revisit that first reel multiple times, each pass trowelling on moot procedural points while edging everybody closer to the dreaded big bang. Previous Bigelow films had a tight grip on cause-and-effect; her best films as a Noted Film-maker, The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, were definitionally all consequence. But here, the inciting incident is also the final play; the drama gets interesting at the exact moment the film fades to black. The characters are left wondering: “Is that it?” We are, too, for different reasons.While the scenario spins in ever decreasing circles, like a doomy Groundhog Day, we’ve ample time to consider the deleterious effect Netflix money has had on the look of American cinema. Even on the big screen, Dynamite struck the eye as flatly familiar, Barry Ackroyd’s cursory handheld lensing recalling 24 or The West Wing or recent Netflix content recycling the same sets, up to and including Zero Day. If Bigelow the Noted Visual Film-maker disappears, so too does Bigelow the Noted Feminist Film-maker: Rebecca Ferguson, outlined in that opening reel as potentially another of this director’s tough-minded working women, clocks off early, so once more it’s left to a cabal of frowning men to try to prevent the world’s end. The verve Bigelow brought to her pulpier breakthrough films vanishes with her; maybe after Detroit’s commercial underperformance, the film-maker felt she had to rein in her risk-taking, but a script this talky required some compensatory pyrotechnics.The fear A House of Dynamite most potently evokes, then, isn’t nuclear annihilation, but a director’s terror of being thought unworthy; tensing up and practically fossilising as it goes along, it’s hardly surprising the film should have been overtaken by recent, recontextualising events. What this screenplay assumes is that those occupying positions of operational authority would be trained specialists, conscientious to the core and that the biggest threat to Chicago in late 2025 would come from some place other than the White House. Where earlier Bigelow films felt like fiercely engaged reflections on their moment, Dynamite – the first of this director’s recent works to fall somewhere between afterthought, distraction and outright irrelevance – instead spends two listless hours scrabbling around hopelessly behind the curve. It’s not tense for a reason: even before the rogue missile first registers on a radar, the America Bigelow’s film describes has been blown to smithereens.Explore more on these topicsKathryn BigelowNetflixAction and adventure filmsDrama filmsThrillerscommentShareReuse this content"

She really shines alongside Ruth Wilson in this pacy, twisty thriller based on Mick Herron’s debut novelLucy ManganWed 29 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 13.41 EDTShareIalways forget how goodEmma Thompsonis. That is partly because she tends to work in film rather than television and I last made it to the cinema in the mid-90s. It is also partly because she is always so … how can I put this? … so Emma Thompson in all her interviews and award speeches that I can’t envisage her putting herself away enough for Proper Acting.But of course she can – and does as the private investigator Zoë Boehm, a woman of flint and diamond, in the new eight-part thriller Down Cemetery Road, Morwenna Banks’ adaptation of Mick Herron’s debut novel of the same name. Herron has since become known for Slow Horses, the series about the busted spies in Slough House pushing paper under the world-wearied eye of Jackson Lamb, ever hoping to get back in the game. Gary Oldman, who plays Lamb, has become a sort of niche national treasure for his portrayal of the beleaguered antihero who we like to think lives in all of us. I hope the same happens with Thompson/Boehm, because both are magnificent. Boehm is a role model for ladies everywhere, but especially those hampered by a lack of innate cynicism or by a people-pleasing nature (or early training). Look at Boehm and learn. Observe the barren wasteland in which she stands, the field of fucks she has left to give. “I don’t drink prosecco and I don’t bond emotionally,” she tells a new client and one of the show’s many delights is that this remains almost entirely true.The new client is the art restorer Sarah Tucker, played by the gloriousRuth Wilson. Sarah is another woman who doesn’t suffer fools gladly, with the notable exception of her investment banker husband, Mark (Tom Riley). The couple are in the middle of a nightmarish dinner party with a potential new client for Mark, a rich prick called Gerard Inchon (Tom Goodman-Hill, having a whale of a time with a character given some of the best lines in a drama stuffed with great ones). They are joined by Sarah’s friend “Wigwam” (Sinead Matthews), a hippy with four kids (“Are you starting a cult?” inquires Gerard), and her newish partner Rufus (Ken Nwosu), when a neighbour’s house explodes, killing two adults and injuring a child.Sarah goes to visit the child, Dinah, in hospital. The strange hostility of the staff, who refuse to let her see the little girl and whom she later sees being bundled into a car and spirited away, leads to an obsession – there is a suggestion of mental heath struggles in Sarah’s past – with finding her. The quest brings Sarah into contact with the private investigator team of Zoë and her hapless and hopelessly devoted husband, Joe (Adam Godley). Joe begins to look into it.Could Dinah’s disappearance have anything to do with the storyline unfolding elsewhere? Namely, at the Ministry of Defence, where nervy handler Hamza Malik (Adeel Akhtar) is being hauled over the coals by his boss, C (Darren Boyd, cast against type to brilliant effect, in a terrifying part that still requires all his comedy chops, given that he has almost as many great lines as Gerard). It was not a gas leak that took out the house but a bomb planted by a borderline rogue agent referred to by C variously as “Wreck-It Ralph” and “the Twisted Firestarter”. He must be brought back under control and the consequences of his mistakes covered up, along with the mistake he seems to have been trying to cover up for others. We all look at the shaking Malik. No one’s hopes are high.Down Cemetery Road is great stuff. There is not a wasted moment, not a wasted word. Everything is there for a reason (especially Fehinti Balogun as Amos, the bridge between Malik and his mad or bad and certainly dangerous to know agent, and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as the man caught on Mark’s phone camera hanging around the blast site). The plot thickens at pace and the twists are worth waiting for. It smooths out the book’s few technical problems and infelicities nicely – bringing Zoë to the fore much earlier, for example – and retains all the dry humour and acuity for which fans of Slow Horses will surely have been hoping. And – a side issue, I know, but for those of us who can barely look at Jackson Lamb because of the fine layer of filth that shrouds him, an important one – Zoë looks as if she has fully mastered basic hygiene and laundry.

And what he did was Ballad of a Small Player, which feels like the exact opposite of Conclave. A sweaty, vibrant, Macau-set fever dream of a thriller, it sees Colin Farrell hamming it up as an aristocratic English gambler scrambling to pay off his debts while trying to shake off Tilda Swinton, playing a woman who knows his true identity. While the results aren’t quite as satisfying as Conclave, it’s nevertheless very exciting to see a director as elegant as Berger turn his hand to something so trashy.Stuart HeritageHedda(Nia DaCosta, 2025),out now, Prime VideoBetween Marvel and her 28 Years Later sequel, Nia DaCosta has quietly snuck out an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s 134-year-old play Hedda Gabler. It’s far from the first – there have been at least 20 others – but it’s certainly the most modern. Tessa Thompson plays the lead, and the debauchery is ramped up beyond all comprehension. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a review of this film that doesn’t compare it to Emerald Fennell’s Saltburn; if nothing else, it should slake your thirst for sexy period fare until Fennell’s Wuthering Heights comes out in February.Stuart HeritageLate Night With the Devil(Cameron and Colin Cairnes, 2023), 9pm,Film4Just when you thought found footage horror had run out of steam, along comes 2023’s absurdly good Late Night With the Devil to revive it. The found footage comes in the form of a Halloween episode of a 1977 talk show that flies off the rails after an appearance by a 13-year-old possessed girl. The joy doesn’t just come from how scary it is but in the glee it takes in destroying show business tropes. It’s a note-perfect reconstruction of a time when late-night hosts were the most powerful people on TV.SHExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For those who remember Riz Ahmed’s turn inthe award-winning 2019 movie Sound of Metal, about a heavy metal drummer who loses his hearing, there is moreover an extra frisson.Here Ahmed plays a lonely Muslim guy who grew up in the post-9/11 US; a lifetime of suspicion drove him to drink and now he’s in recovery. He runs an illegal and very lucrative specialist service for corporate employees in crooked organisations who wanted to be whistleblowers but lost their nerve and now just want to hand back the evidence without getting into further trouble. For a big fee, he will broker the return of the incriminating material while keeping back a copy for insurance purposes. To make contact with everyone, he usesa “relay” telephone servicewhich connects deaf and speech-impaired people using telephone operators who read aloud typewritten prompts and keep no records of what is said: an ideally secure message-drop system.Lily James plays Sarah, a woman who gets in touch with him saying she once wanted to expose her employer with a document she’s stolen; now she’s scared and just wants out. The fixer agrees to help, but breaks his own rules by getting emotionally close to her. Sam Worthington plays the sinister surveillance operative who wants to neutralise Sarah; it is nice to see Worthington get a break from boring Avatar duty. There are some very coolly orchestrated scenes in the big city and Mackenzie ratchets up the tension in style.Relay is in UK and Irish cinemas from 31 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersRiz AhmedLily JamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

After throwing it in to pursue her musical dream, she minted a spooky, singular sound that made fans of David Byrne and Feist. At 64, her irreverence remains intactWed 29 Oct 2025 07.28 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 12.52 EDTShareJuana Molina answers our video call from a hospital bed, reclining in a green T-shirt with two cannulas in her hand. She has done her back in while also playing Whack-a-Mole with hernias, two last year, and two new ones now. “Do you know those toys, made of little pieces of wood, and you press the bottom and it goes” – she makes herself floppy, mimicking a push puppet – “that’s exactly how I was yesterday.” But now, says the 64-year-old Argentinian musician, “I have so many painkillers, that I …” She wobbles her eyelids, gurns and gives me two thumbs up.For the avoidance of doubt, Molina seems entirely with it, and insists we continue when I offer to reschedule. She is ultra precise on the technical odyssey she undertook to make her new record, and also extremely funny company, cheeky and withering about anyone who’s too serious – or worse,boring.In the early 90s, Molina was one of Argentina’s biggest comedians with her sketch show Juana y Sus Hermanas (Juana and Her Sisters), in which she portrayed a series of outre characters with some degree of John Waters in their DNA. (Some of them still go viral on TikTok, which she doesn’t let herself use because it’s too addictive.) But in 1993, on bed rest while pregnant with her daughter, she realised that if she didn’t pursue her lifelong dream of becoming a musician, she would one day be a bitter old woman railing at the pop charts. So she quit. It was as much of a shock to the nation as it would be if Kristen Wiig swapped SNL for MTV.It worked out, winning Molina ardent fans such as David Byrne and Feist, and a good chunk of her career signed to Domino. Next year marks 30 years since her musical debut, Rara. For three decades, or at least since things solidified on her 2000 breakthrough, Segundo, she has minted her own unique sound, made of dry, rhythmic guitar loops, drones, low pulses and incantatory voices rich with mystery. It’s enveloping in a comfortingly spooky sort of way.Juana Molina: Siestas Ahí – videoTo record, Molina says, she has to get out of her own way to enter “the world of pure music. There’s no thought, no concepts or pre-ideas. It’s flowing, and I am driving and being driven at the same time, tourist and guide.” Nothing gives her more pleasure than working alone at home in Pacheco, outside Buenos Aires, surrounded by her three dogs, cats and the plants she “cohabits” with. The house once belonged to her grandmother. “I sometimes spend 14 hours in the studio and I don’t even drink a cup of tea, nothing!” she says. “All of a sudden, I hear birds. The whole night has gone by and I didn’t realise because I’m in a tunnel where the only language is music.”That may also be how Molina ended up in this hospital bed. “I think what’s happening to me is because I am all the time bent over, playing and looking for things, and I don’t even think about my [posture],” she says. For her eighth album, Doga, her first since 2017’s Halo, she has been trying to master the furiously difficult world of analogue synths, hunching over instruments that resemble old-fashioned telephone switchboards to invent sounds that don’t rely on pre-programmed waveforms. “You can do whatever you want, and you need to know a lot,” says Molina.She recorded everything she made but became overwhelmed by the hundreds of hours of tape. It prompted her to work with a producer, Emilio Haro, for the first time since her debut. Doga is deeper and more spacious than its predecessor, with synthesised orchestral touches: the guitars on Miro Todo (I See Everything), says Molina, sound like violins that “are somehow out of tune, but in a very nice way, like played as if the player wasn’t feeling like playing.” She makes a beleaguered, twitchy face to illustrate. Often the experimentation was truly analogue: Molina would play guitar while Haro moved knobs, “which is something you can’t do while playing”, she says, “unless you have extraordinary feet”.View image in fullscreenMolina photographed for the Guardian in 2007.Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianRecently, Molina tried to re-record her first album, having lost the rights to a former label. Rara is an outlier in her catalogue, her only full-band record: she says most people who love that album don’t like her others. “I recorded half of it and when I started singing it, I felt it wasn’t right,” she says. The problem was that although it was recorded in 1995, it featured songs she had written as a young woman in 1983. “Those lyrics, they’re so romantic and suffering,” she says, rolling her eyes. “The first song talks about a girl that has a picture of a boy in her book, she thinks of him and wonders if he thinks about her. Then we go to his story and he’s put her photo in an old jacket, he checks the pockets and throws it away. He doesn’t even remember her!”Molina looks stricken that she ever told such a story. (And she has since got the rights to Rara back.) But otherwise she says she remains intimately connected to herself at all ages, in defiance of the idea that there are certain ways she should be at 64. On her 2013 album Wed 21, a song called Las Edades (The Ages) was about starting to feel that she repelled younger people. “Maybe it’s a survival thing that you need to mate with someone your age in order to have children and all that,” she says. “But the weird thing is that I can be with children, eight years old, and feel as if I’m eight. If I’m with 16-year-old guys, I feel as if I’m 16. It’s not that I am only 64; it’s not that all those ages disappear. It’s just a way that people count ages. Age became so important for society, and it hurts when you get older. You feel the rejection.”She recently attended a 60th birthday party, and lamented how “incredibly boring” a lot of the conversations were, about politics and the economy. “One of the things I hate the most in life is to be solemn,” she says. “Solemnness is for a burial. But when you are solemn about life, things need to be donethis wayand you can’t dressthat wayand you can’teat with your hands,” she intones in a dreary voice, “there’s a huge boredom”.Juana Molina: Cosoco – videoProof of the eternally rejuvenating properties of curiosity, Molina would rather “talk about a chair, the way a glass is made or why the handle of a cup has that shape, things that are not important but are so much fun to talk about”, or learn how things work so that she can mend them herself: “If I fix the window, it feels good.” She recently co-founded a label, Sonamos, and thrills at the enthusiasm and knowledge of her partner Mario Agustín de Jesús González. “His curiosity has no limits,” she says. “Though sometimes I get a bit like, let’s talk about pizza.”‘We need anger to fight for our lives’: Mexican musician Silvana Estrada on grief, violence and the indignity of ‘el ghosting’Read moreWhen people bug her saying that Argentina needs her back on TV (even though she has a small part in Netflix women’s prison drama En el Barro), she wonders why they don’t realise that online comedy clipsarethe new TV. On her Instagram, she frequently addresses fans while disguised by a novelty filter – maybe her as an elderly woman, or a field of seven babies wearing strawberry hats. “When I think I spent hours with wigs and makeup, and now I just scroll and an unexpected character is there, it makes me so joyful that you can bring them to life immediately,” she says. As with music leading her, “the filters tell me what to do with them, it’s like an instant impersonation.” Similarly, the cover of Doga features Molina convincingly Photoshopped as a very fluffy dog.Maybe this resistance to branding herself as aserious artistehas constrained Molina’s deserved legacy a little outside South America. But her allergy to gravitas and even to the concept of legacy feels refreshing; she mostly seems intent on giving listeners the same feeling of “pure music” as she experiences. At her gigs, she eschews visuals “because I thought, if the music doesn’t give you enough images then it’s a failure”, she says. She hopes she’s still making music in another 30 years’ time “if my body allows me to”, and only hopes she’ll have some more help in the studio. “I would love to have assistance to help me with whatever sound I want to get,” she says, “instead of being there breaking my back on the instruments.”Doga is released via Sonamos on 5 NovemberExplore more on these topicsMusicExperimental musicArgentinainterviewsShareReuse this content"

These are some of the highlightsJohn SelfWed 29 Oct 2025 11.34 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 11.36 EDTSharePaul Bailey, whodied last October aged 87, was best known as a novelist of comic brilliance, wide-ranging empathy – even for the worst of his characters – and a cleverness that was never clinical. His fiction was frequently occupied with the impact of memories on our lives, and usually heavily driven by sharp, syncopated dialogue. But he was also a memoirist, poet and more besides – so here’s a guide to the legacy of books he left behind.The ones to keep you companyBailey was a social creature, a great talker and lover of “trivial chit-chat”, as one of his characters puts it. Bailey and his friend Beryl Bainbridge used to watch Coronation Street and then compare notes over the phone. This fondness for a gossipy conversation is brought out in his novels Trespasses (1970) and Peter Smart’s Confessions (1977). Both feature a man surrounded by funny, maddening, over-the-top characters, who are usually so closely related to him that he can’t escape the gravitational pull of their nonsense. “Who wants to be normal anyway?” asks Ralph’s mother in Trespasses when he comes out to her as gay. Like spending an evening with your wittiest, and sometimes cheekiest, friend.The ones to make you laugh and cry at the same timeBailey wrote brilliantly about old age, at both ends of his career. His debut novel At the Jerusalem (1967) follows the experiences of Faith Gadny as she tries to settle into life in an old people’s home, where the other residents provide the warmth lacking from the staff, whose idea of taking an interest in the residents is to ask, “Why aren’t you ladies watching the television?” In Bailey’s penultimate novelChapman’s Odyssey(2011), an elderly man in hospital slips between tussling with the doctors (“I only drink superior wines”, he assures them when they rebuke him for his liver test results) and being bombarded by memories of his mother, his lovers and classic literary characters, from Dickens’s Pip to Austen’s Emma. Both books are full of funny exchanges but marked by the shadow of the inevitable end. Always in Bailey’s novels, smiles are not to be trusted. In At the Jerusalem, “the matron smiled, shut the smile off quickly”; Mrs Gadny laughs with nerves when her behaviour is challenged. In Chapman’s Odyssey, Harry warns the medics that “my smiles aren’t what they seem”. The reader’s smiles are real enough, though.Paul Bailey obituaryRead moreIf you want to know the facts behind the fictionAs well as his novels, Bailey was a brilliant memoirist, publishing two volumes of autobiography. An Immaculate Mistake (1990) is a masterpiece of remembrance, its title taken from his mother telling him, her third child, that “You were our mistake. You ought not to be here, by rights.” (“She was old now, and letting go of her secrets,” he adds. “This one, she knew, would be of particular interest to me.”) It’s in this book that we see where all those misguided, loving but infuriating parents in his novels come from. But it’s also a beautiful portrait of a young man growing up gay in the 1940s and 50s, when homosexual acts were illegal and his family thought it suspicious for a boy to buy his mother flowers; and of an aspiring actor (Bailey was on the stage before he turned to the page) who memorised Hamlet at the age of 15. His second memoirA Dog’s Life(2004) focuses on life with his mongrel puppy Circe and his former partner David, his love for Romania – which inspired his later novels Kitty and Virgil,Uncle RudolfandThe Prince’s Boy– and of course dollops of gossip, including a splendid account of a literary event with Iris Murdoch, where she calls one audience member a “stupid cow”.If you’re pressed for timeBailey’s novels are mostly short anyway – the tremendous Old Soldiers (1980) is barely 100 pages long – but if you want something even briefer, then trythe poetry he turned to late in his career. The two volumes, Inheritance (2019) and Joie de Vivre (2022), show the best of Bailey’s wit, empathy and precision in capsule form. They are poems full of death and life. Two themes of love recur: for his mother (“I’m closer to you now – / I need to tell you – / than I ever was in life”) and for his civil partner Jeremy Trevathan. In Amazement, he writes of the pleasures of “watching an idiotic TV entertainment” together, and concludes: “It’s awesome, in its way, this act of eating cheese / and drinking wine, as the world keeps darkening.”If you only read oneThere would be little dispute that Bailey’s most ambitious and wide-ranging novel is Gabriel’s Lament, which was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 1986. (He also judged the prize in 1982, an experiencehe hated.) This was the book Bailey was proudest of, even though – or perhaps because – “it drained me. It took everything out of me”. It tells the story of Gabriel Harvey, whose mother disappears and whose father becomes an insufferable snob after coming into a pile of money – and the two events may be connected. It’s a portrait of 20th-century London, an account of mental collapse, and as simultaneously funny and sad as anything Bailey wrote. If you want more, it inspired a sequel, Sugar Cane (1993), which Bailey researched by becoming “a regular visitor to a brothel” – as a spectator.Explore more on these topicsPaul BaileyWhere to start withPoetryFictionAutobiography and memoirfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But on actual politics, she is less assuredHouman BarekatWed 29 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTShareAccepting a literary prize in Ohio last year, the novelistZadie Smithdescribed “feeling somewhat alienated from myself, experiencing myself as a posthumous entity”. Smith is only 50, but there is indeed something of the afterlife about the material gathered in her new book, which bundles various odds and ends from the past nine years: speeches, opinion pieces, criticism and eulogies for departed literary heroes – Philip Roth, Martin Amis, Hilary Mantel.In Some Notes on Mediated Time – one of three completely new essays in the collection – Smith recalls how the “dreamy, slo-mo world” of her 1980s childhood gave way, within a generation, to the “anxious, permanent now” of social media. If you lived through that transition, you don’t have to be very old to feel ancient. When this estrangement is compounded by the ordinary anxieties of ageing, cultural commentary becomes inflected with self-pity. Smith’s identification with the protagonist ofTodd Field’s Tár, a once revered conductor who finds herself shunned by the younger cohort, takes on existential proportions: “Our backs hurt, the kids don’t like Bach any more – and the seas are rising!”Those pesky “kids” stalk the pages of Dead and Alive, most noticeably at the level of language. When Smith deploys a nonchalant “IMHO” in an otherwise stately meditation on historical fiction, it feels plausibly organic. But many of her flirtations with the vernacular are prefaced by awkward, vaguely apologetic disclaimers: “as the youngs [sic] say”; “as the kids say”; “as the present cliché goes”; “To use one of the template phrases of the moment”. The cumulative effect is a little embarrassing. (In one unfortunate instance, a puzzling reference to “the circle-jerk of contemporary dating”, it seems she doesn’t know the meaning of the slang expression she has commandeered.)It’s as though Smith can’t quite decide if she’s a bien pensant pragmatist or an idealistic dreamerThere are upsides to being slightly out of touch. One is that you feel less obligated to pay lip service to the reductive pieties that grease the wheels of cultural commentary. Reflecting on a Parisian exhibition of global objets d’art originally collected in 18th-century Dresden, Smith suggests the word “Eurocentric” is doing too much heavy lifting in the gallery texts, “as if the curators, in their wisdom, had decided to take power – especially colonial power – at its own word”. Elsewhere, she bemoans the “unhinged” tone that lets down some biographies of overlooked literary women: “by turns furious, defensive, melancholy and tragic, their very intensity keeps the muse in her place, orbiting the great man”. In such works, score-settling zeal can obscure the complexity of human relationships: “If male artists sometimes stage dramas of power, it is not unknown for female artists to make a performance of masochism. Neither performance should be entirely trusted.”The moral bean-counting school of criticism makes for an impoverished discourse, as Smith notes in an essay on the painter Kara Walker,whose workriffs knowingly on racialised caricature. Minority artists are routinely upbraided from both sides, either for pandering to the white gaze or “being insufficiently empowering … neglecting to provide, for a black audience, some necessary form of ‘self-care’”. They should be allowed “to make work without shame”. Smith steers a similarly sensible middle course on the vexed debate around “cultural appropriation” in fiction, acknowledging the understandable “desire to be once and for all free of the limited – and limiting – fantasies and projections of other people” while insisting on the prerogatives of the novelist. There is more to people than their identity – “we can, sometimes, forget the mystery that lies at the heart of all selfhood”.The point is well made in a thoughtful piece on James Baldwin and the craft of writing, originally a lecture delivered to creative writing students over Zoom during the pandemic. Smith reminds her students that the essence of Baldwin’s brilliance was his ability to process politics through personal experience: he “submitted to his consciousness first and then re-examined what that might mean for his conscience”. This is sound advice, and Smith’s positions on the politics of creativity are beyond reproach, albeit commonsensical – amounting, essentially, to a caution against overcorrection and incuriosity.When it comes to actual politics, she is less assured. Her New Yorker op-ed on the war in Gaza, published in May 2024, was widely interpreted as unhelpfully equivocal, and seemed to conflate anti-war protesters with antisemites. She has since added her signature toan open letter acknowledging Israel’s actions as genocidal. The New Yorker piece, reprinted here with a new preamble hailing the protesters as “heroic”, is an intriguing artefact: the prose is mealy mouthed, heavy on the passive voice – all the more conspicuous since Smith’s writing is normally so clear and crisp. Grasping to account for this, I was reminded of her observation in a speech to environmental activists just a few pages earlier that “most street-level climate denial is actually sincere. Because the truth really is too terrible to contemplate.”In another speech, from 2018, Smith pays tribute to the postwar settlement that bequeathed us the NHS and the modern welfare state, and is being “deliberately dismantled by means of a concerted, fifty-year-long process of financial deregulation and privatisation … which it is well within our power to reverse”. On the eve of the 2024 general election,she reiterates this sentiment, in hope that “the next time the bright bird of potential equity flies past the ship of state, we might remember what it looks like … and not let any Tories or Neo-Liberals rush up on to the deck to shoot it down”. This modest aspiration would place Smith firmly to the left of the Starmerites, but her political instincts are centrist; she showed little enthusiasm for Jeremy Corbyn during his leadership of the Labour party, even though his platform was broadly in line with the views expressed here. (She has uttered his name in print just once, to put the boot in after Brexit.)It’s as though Smith can’t quite decide if she’s abien pensantpragmatist or an idealistic dreamer. In this respect she’s perhaps no different to many thousands of ambivalent liberal-ish voters. Fair enough – she’s a novelist, not a political theorist. What’s interesting is how all this relates to her metier, given that the catastrophic stagnation of centre-left politics – up to and including the present government – has coincided with a crisis in media. “For the past 15 years we have … been subjected to a truly monumental network of psychological influence that our governments have failed to regulate,” she writes. The same technological forces that have riven the body politic are threatening to destroy literary culture as we know it.Against this backdrop, Smith’s nostalgic evocations of analogue-era television are doubly poignant. TV dramas, she suggests, were not so very different to novels: “The seamlessness, the sharp cuts, the fades in and out … the storification of every element of life.” She believes the novel, with its unique capacity to generate empathy, can act as a bulwark against the oppressive uniformity of the algorithm. A lovely sentiment, but at this point it feels like an article of faith: the genie is out of the bottle. “I would rather the kids knew stories than soundbites,” Smith writes, and most sensible people would concur. The trouble is, as every embattled parent knows, that’s no longer her call – or ours – to make.Dead and Alive: Essays by Zadie Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton (£22).

Alongside the rage many terminally ill people feel against the dying of the light, there are the memories that return to flagellate the conscience: the failures of kindness, the misjudged words that can’t be unsaid, the feelings left catastrophically unexpressed. Crimes of the heart – and sometimes, worse.The malaise of regret and the yearning for absolution vibrate through Andrew Michael Hurley’s latest work of fiction, a wildly atmospheric, deceptively simple tale that borrows tropes from cosy crime only to snare you into something deeper, darker and more chilling.The driving animus of Hurley’s fiction has always been place. In his bestselling debut,The Loney, set in Morecambe Bay, and the folk-horror works that followed –Barrowbeck,Devil’s DayandStarve Acre– he evokes the atmosphere and folklore of his settings with deft, idiosyncratic brushstrokes that bring the reader into territory as psychic, even mythic, as it is physical. In Saltwash, the titular town of his new novel is a semi-abandoned coastal resort whose estuary has become “suckled down to a delta of dark streams and vast sandbanks”, and on whose tattered streets “the neglect … was so rife as to seem wilful”. Saltwash is not so much a town as a state of mind: one that the novel’s septuagenarian protagonist, Tom Shift, will be forced to reckon with during the course of his brief but soul-shaking visit.He arrives in the pounding rain for a meeting proposed by Oliver, the mercurial, enigmatic penpal brokered for him by the clinic where he goes for therapy. But Tom is drawn to their rendezvous at the crumbling Castle Hotel as much by curiosity as by friendship. Why do Oliver’s letters, though larded with literary allusions to mortality, shy away from the intended subject of their correspondence – which is that both of them are dying?Something is horribly awry here. Why is Tom, the only newcomer to the annual gathering, forbidden to know more?While the doomed Tom waits for the doomed Oliver in the hotel bar – all mildewed walls, surly staff and peeling stucco – more elderly people appear, as if for a reunion. Maniacally talkative, and dressed in the finery of their younger incarnations, they are cartoonishly drawn yet ghoulishly credible, and as the booze flows it emerges that they, too, are waiting for Oliver, and this is an annual party, the high point of which is to be a lottery.When Oliver finally appears, he immediately takes over the show, scattering bons mots and performing magic tricks with a verve and panache at odds with his unwashed clothes and skeletal appearance. As the night wears on, Tom catches dark hints about some of the other guests, but remains an innocent if increasingly anxious bystander to their simmering conflicts and intrigues. Yet as the meal is served – starting with an eel, celery and tomato soup so vile that one of the party vomits – his feeling that “he needed to be that rare thing, a better person” begins to build to a pitch he can’t ignore. Something is horribly awry here. Why is Tom, the only newcomer to the annual gathering, forbidden to know more about the lottery? And why is everyone so desperate to win?Easy to read but challenging to process, the novel left me entertained, but also feeling as raw, unsettled and existentially shaken as Tom, its hapless everyman. And perhaps that is exactly the intention. While Saltwash may not be the ideal Christmas gift for anyone confronting their mortality, for some unexamined souls it may be perfect. Welcoming on the outside, and increasingly unnerving as you reach the core of its gruesome, shocking proposition, Hurley’s latest offering is Heart of Darkness wrapped in candy.Saltwash by Andrew Michael Hurley is published by John Murray (£16.99.

Political, unpredictable and replete with ass puns, Asses.Masses is, on the one hand, a fairly rudimentary-looking video game made by Canadian artists Patrick Blenkarn and Milton Lim with a small team of collaborators. But the setting – in a theatre, surrounded by others, everybody shouting advice and opinions and working together on puzzles – transforms it into a piece of collective performance art.Here’s how it works: on a plinth in front of a giant projected screen is a controller. In the seats: the audience. Whoever wants to get up and take control can do so, and they become the avatar of the crowd. The game opens with a series of questions, mostly about donkeys, some in different languages, and quickly it becomes obvious that you have to work together to get them right. Someone in our crowd spoke Spanish; another knew the answer to an engineering question; I knew, somehow, that a female donkey is called a jennet.This is what makes the game a collective experience. Usually, no more than one person has their hands on the controller but, nonetheless, everyone is participating as you guide a group of donkeys on a long, surprising and increasingly surreal quest to get their jobs back from the farm machines that have made them redundant.View image in fullscreenEveryone is participating as you guide a group of donkeys on a long, surreal quest … Asses.Masses.Photograph: Patrick Blenkarn + Milton LimOver 10 chapters (with, thank God, food and frequent breaks), we took control of a whole cast of amusingly named asses, ruminated on collective action, industrialisation and labour politics, debated over what to say and what to do, and laugheda lotat the cheekier parts. Without spoiling it, the show’s content warnings give you a fair idea of what to expect: references to violence, strong language, simulated sex (donkey), simulated sex (human), police brutality as well as references to drug use and suicide. I was amused to discover that this Glasgow performance prompted a mini moral panic from a group called Parents Watch Education, which the Daily Record seized upon under the headline “Parents slam show aimed at teens featuring simulated donkey sex, murder and drugs”. (The show is advertised as 14+, and very much prioritises humour over realism.)Asses.Masses is a thought-provoking game made worthwhile by its even more interesting means of play. It is also, and this must be said, a true endurance test. I had to duck out for a couple of hours in the middle to go and lie down for a bit; it has been many years since I have played any video game for eight straight hours. Thankfully, I brought a friend with more stamina, who filled me in on what I’d missed before I took up the controller for the final chapters. At one point, overwhelmed by the audience’s different opinions, I put the controller down, put my hands on my head, and silently empathised with every union or labour organiser who has ever had to corral and prioritise the ideas of an opinionated membership.The game could have done more with the idea of herd mentality – I’m fairly sure that few of our group decisions actually amounted to anything and, really, what we were mostly doing was watching someone else play the game rather than actively participating. It was, in that sense, like a live Twitch stream. Theatre people tend to get very excited about anything that incorporates video game elements into performances, but I often wonder if that’s because they aren’t necessarily familiar with the mass participation and crowd dynamics that video gamesalwaysinspire, whether through multiplayer, streaming, or just spirited online conversation.View image in fullscreenA thought-provoking game and a true endurance test … the crowd at Asses.Masses.Photograph: undefined/Patrick Blenkarn + Milton LimIt made me want to invite friends round my house and pass the controller around all day like we used to in our early 20s. My friend was reminded of a video game book club she used to run, where six people would play through a game such as What Remains of Edith Finch together (and laugh at it, in that specific instance). Asses.Masses is specifically designed around collective play, but I can think of plenty more shortish, thought-provoking games that could be staged like this, and that would inspire an interesting reaction from audiences. And if the number of people who engage with Twitch is any indication, I think a lot of people would come.Stumbling out of the theatre and into the rainy Glasgow night, I felt a real sense of camaraderie with the small crowd I’d been playing with. Often when I finish a game, I’m on my own in the living room in the middle of the night, while my family sleeps, and I have nobody to turn to to discuss it with. This time, I had a whole group of people to debrief with, and it reminded me that it is always the addition of human players that animates games with soul.Assess.Masses ison aglobal tour till September 2026What to playView image in fullscreenSpooky but not too scary … Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival.Photograph: Adam Robinson-YuI have two spooky (but not too scary, because I’m a wuss) recommendations for Halloween week.

A low, circular mound of fine, granular soil that rises to meet me, like a bulging ocean swell. Not a speck escapes its edge. An almost hemispherical dome of smooth, compacted clay, whose surface cracked as it dried from the mould it was cast in. The hemisphere stands on the floor like an igloo in the desert. Nearby, a wall of beeswax curves away, with a slightly peppery, honey smell. It leads me to a bristling stockade of tangled branches, foliage and autumnal berries. Inside, it suddenly feels like Christmas, which I doubt is quite the effect the artist was aiming for.American artistMeg Webster’s sculptures are round things disposed about a circular space that rises to a distant glass and iron roof at the Bourse de Commerce, originally built in the 1760s as a wheat silo and exchange. Later it became the Paris Commodities Exchange, and now the Bourse is home to French billionaire Francois Pinault’s art collection, which numbers more than 10,000 works. Dramatic, oddly vulnerable and beautiful, Webster’s art refers back to minimal art, but its materiality is somehow more primal than that. I last saw her work at theDia Art Foundation at Beacon, New York. Jessica Morgan, Dia’s director, has curated Minimal, working with Pinault’s vast collection and loans from other institutions.But this is less curating than wrestling, as much with the huge building as with the art. The Bourse is a kind of Tower of Babel, and Minimal is an odd mixture of solo displays, like Webster’s, and rooms where single works by different artists are bought together thematically, according to the rubrics Light, Balance, Surface, Grid, Monochrome and Materialism.

White sings against rust-red, a dirty khaki, a muted green. Ryman did so much with so little. His art is all about surface and volume, nuance and touch and knowing when to stop. A low, rectangular pile of wrapped white sweets, their cellophane catching the light, sits on the floor below Ryman’s paintings. An iteration ofFelix Gonzalez-Torres1991 Untitled (Portrait of Dad), the quantity of sweets (about 175lb, or 79kg) corresponds to the weight of the artist’s father. Visitors are allowed to help themselves to the mints. Gonzalez-Torres liked the idea that his art would leave a sweet taste in the mouth, to linger like a memory.Around the perimeter of the central space antique cabinets hang in the corridor, originally installed here for the 1889 Exposition Universelle. Each contains a single On Karawa DatePainting, in which white lettering and numbers denote the date of the painting’s manufacture. If the Japanese artist didn’t finish by midnight, he ditched the incomplete work. Below the painting, in a box, sits a page from the day’s newspaper, from the city where On Karawa made the painting. Beneath the painting dated 5 October, 1982, a newspaper tells us that Israeli planes have attacked Syrian missile sites. In the box beneath June 20, 1975 there’s a full-page printed advert for the movie Jaws, which opened in US cinemas on that day. The world passes by and we pass with it.Including works made between the 1950s and the 2010s, by artists working in the Americas, Europe and Asia, Minimal is not a show about minimalism as a movement so much as about the less-is-more, enough-is-enough tendency, and there is an awful lot of it here. This is minimal to the maximal.From the sparse and somehow dispiriting light works in the basement, where things flash and glow and look a little wan, up to the first floor, whereSusumu Koshimizu’s lump of hewn granite sits alone in a wonky, open-topped cube of hemp paper, and his bronze tetrahedrons slant this way and that across the floor as part of a display devoted to the Mono-ha or School of Things movement, we’re crossing not just continents but worlds of thought.View image in fullscreenAgnes Martin, Blue-Grey Composition, 1962.Photograph: © Agnes Martin Foundation, New York / Adagp, Paris, 2025The clunky galvanised steel air-conditioning ducts I passed on the landing are sculptures byCharlotte Posenenske, who worked almost entirely with ready-made industrial sections. On the next floor up I’m surrounded by the quietly humming, repetitively worked paintings ofAgnes Martin, in a room devoted to the artist. It also includes a relief in which heavy-duty boat spikes have been drilled into sections of wood, the hexagonal heads of the spikes roughly painted in dark red and white. It is like a weird rejoinder to the delicacy of her repetitive, hand-drawn lines and grids, the infinitesimal shifts in weight and tempo of her art.From Martin we go to a more general look at grilles and grids – anEva Hessepanel of grommets, aSol LeWittgridded drawing of arcs and circles, and a great, lone 1966Bridget Rileypainting in which a grid of little black ovoids mess with your retinas and seem to blink back at you as they tilt this way and that, as if there’s too much mental stimulation going on for the brain to cope with. British-Pakistani sculptorRasheed Araeen’s 16 large open wooden cubes, in red, yellow, blue and green, occupy an alcove, and visitors are invited to re-stack, balance, tilt and configure them in any way they wish.Quite soon, I’ve stopped caring about the niceties of the thematic displays. I need to take a deep breath and spend time with Pape, whose career in Brazil encompassed not just a huge variety of materials, manners and approaches but also successive movements in Brazilian art, and whose art seemed to cover all bases, minimal or not.View image in fullscreenLygia Pape, Divisor, 1968, Performance at Museu de Arte Moderna, Rio de Janeiro.Photograph: Projeto Lygia Pape/© Projeto Lygia PapeIt’s one thing after another, though how amusing it is to see a glum, early 1970s diptych by New York artistBrice Marden, with its smoothed-out waxy surface, in relation to the bright panels of sewn-together, shop-bought cotton fabrics stretched by the late German artistBlinky Palermo.Things are dangling from hempen cords: stones used in Korean weaving practices that also reference shamanic beliefs, and lengths of wood bundled and suspended from another rope. I guess this is all about balance, like theRichard Serrathat leans insouciant and immobile against the wall. Lengths of barbed wire hang from the wall, too, connected to lengths of chain byMelvin Edwards.Senga Nengudi’s bulbous and pointy transparent vinyl bags, partly filled with dyed water, flop and bulge from heavy ropes, hinting at bodies that sprout and leak and won’t behave.Ryman reappears, with works more casual and more eccentric than those on the ground floor, and I’m dying to come across something byCady Noland, but she’s not here. There’s noBruce Nauman, and noRobert Morris. More ropes and chains snake over the floor, inMaren Hassinger’s River, which intends to evoke the despoliation of nature and the journeys that took enslaved Africans to the Americas.What links these objects and images and what divides them? Can we look at them all the same way or must we approach them differently? It is very difficult not to just clock things, tick the checklist and keep on climbing the stairs and circulating, in pursuit of a conclusion that is endlessly deferred. The minimal is always with us.Minimal is at the Bourse de Commerce, Paris, until 19 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsParisSculpturePaintingInstallationreviewsShareReuse this content"

Take John Smythe, the man otherwise known as Daddy inFiona Mozley’s beguiling novel. By any perspective, not just that of Danny and Cathy, his teenage children, he is a hulk of a figure. He is not only a prize fighter, wiping out opponents in illegal bouts with supernatural ease, but he lives a wild-man existence, prowling society’s edges, off-grid and at one with nature in all its beautiful cruelty.Faced with giving him theatrical form, writer/director Javaad Alipoor leaves him to our imaginations. Better to suggest his primal power than disappoint us with an all-too-human actor. Instead, Daddy exists in narration and reported speech, never in plain sight. It is a wise move, even if sometimes you hanker for a flesh-and-blood confrontation in a production, forBradford 2025, that is more descriptive than dramatic.Upfront about its origins as a novel, the adaptation leans in to the storytelling. In the role of Danny, LJ Parkinson is sometimes a character but more often a narrator, drawing us into this quasi-mythical tale in which the brute force of capitalist greed confronts the lawlessness of a preindustrial economy. Out on the West Riding fringes, landlord Mr Price (Sean Jackson) tries to contain Daddy’s feral family, as if attempting to tame nature itself.‘Epic with a capital E’: inside Elmet, a tale of violence and greed on haunted Yorkshire heathRead moreAlipoor frames this story of class, exploitation and misogyny as a tragedy, telling us Daddy’s fate from the start. It is another smart move: the knowledge it will end badly creates a dramatic shape that goes some way to containing the novel’s digressions.Gaining in polemical force is Cathy’s story. Played by a stony-faced Jennifer Jackson, she steps out of Mozley’s book to claim kinship with a teenageCharlotte Church, a fellow victim of the sexist and sexualised cultureon which Cathy takes violent revenge. As womanhood approaches and the predatory Charlie Price (Tom Varey) swoops in, Cathy not only refuses to be defined by male expectations but fights back, disrupting the social order as she goes.Gloriously taking the place of the novel’s poetry is the live score byAdrian McNally and the Unthanks, their timeless folk melodies evoking the archetypal forces at play in a rich retelling of a haunting book.At Loading Bay, Bradford, until 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Often with his work it’s less important to ask what it means, more how it feels; not to work out exactly how he’s meshed different dance forms or redrawn mythical stories, but to get immersed in its sensory impact.Thikra has plenty going on in that area. The piece was made earlier this year for an arts festival at Wadi AlFann, a new “cultural destination” in AlUla, an ancient oasis city and trade route in the Saudi Arabian desert. It’s a collaboration with London-based Saudi artist Manal AlDowayan, who originally built her rocky set on the desert sand. And you can imagine the early scenes of the 60-minute piece having an impact in a vast outdoor setting. Khan has a strong graphic sense, the 12 dancers in unison in bold type and satisfying lines that cut and splice. It’s crisply danced by the all-female cast, all with long hair swishing in sync.View image in fullscreenChing-Ying Chien in Akram Khan’s Thikra.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellAt the centre is a young woman dressed in white (Ching-Ying Chien) and what follows has the appearance of an initiation or sacrifice, perhaps an exorcism. In fact, in this mythological tale fabricated by Khan and AlDowayan, she is an ancestor, summoned by a tribe of women on this “night of remembering”, for a rebirth of sorts, a ritual healing from the past. It’s no dreamy-soft spiritual journey, but a place of anger and searching (as well as great beauty in compelling performances by Azusa Seyama Prioville as the matriarch, Nikita Goile one of her daughters). Samantha Hines is the supposed vessel for the ritual, but she’s like a beastly scavenger picking over Chien’s body, and then a mildly terrifying puppet master.The narrative details don’t really matter (which is just as well) because Khan’s choreography bypasses thinking mode and goes straight for weighty but intangible worlds of colour and emotion, life and death, animal spirit, magic and witchery. The score by Aditya Prakash (with sound design by Gareth Fry) is head-filling in volume and density, with a really physical sense of rhythm, drawing on Arabic music, plus a blast of Bulgarian choral music and a hint of Purcell’s Dido. It’s intense, but you can only melt into that atmosphere and await catharsis.Until 1 Novemberat Sadler’s Wells, London; thentouring.Explore more on these topicsAkram KhanDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

Both are true: no two gigs by this fantastic off-the-cuff comic are ever the same, and yet all of them cleave tightly to the same free-associating formula. Tonight’s show, part of his Cranium of Curiosities UK tour, is no different. I suspect these two hours of wildly divergent nonsense hit a fair few pre-scripted marks, but if they do, it’s deftly concealed among the expertly extemporised riffs – dreamed up, developed and kept going in constant dialogue with his audience – on Gregg Wallace, fairy figurines anddugongs.It is,and always has been, quite the feat, of which Noble, now 49, is the effortless master. If I were feeling churlish (or when I’ve watched his work too frequently), I might feel fatigued at the attritional meaninglessness of his shows, which stubbornly refuse to coalesce into anything resembling a theme, point or argument. Sometimes, too, Noble’s meta-commentary on his own wackiness, and how mindblown we supposedly are by it, gets a bit much.But tonight is one of those nights where it’s easier just to marvel at the craft, and laugh helplessly at the many startling images conjured by the geordie’s fizzing comic brain. Maybe his hypothetical West End musical of latterday video nasty The Human Centipede is first base – but his gag about how its cast might travel incognito is a keeper. A proposed TV gameshow, Hips or Piles?, will linger long in the memory, and a routine about how to stay safe in a hi-vis factory is a mini-masterpiece of surrealist standup.Then there’s the act-out of a scene involving Bear Grylls, Dame Judi Dench and a jellyfish in the desert, concluding with the imperishable assertion: “If he was a true Christian, he’d slide his leg under her.” You had to be there, of course – and Noble at his carefree, escapist best takes you all the way there, far from the rational tyranny of your own life, loosed from sense and propriety entirely.Ross Noble: Cranium of Curiositiesis touring until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Stern heirs are now seeking the painting’s return and damages.“In the decades since the end of world war two, this Nazi-looted painting has been repeatedly and secretly trafficked, purchased and sold in and through New York,” alleges the suit filed this week in federal district court in Manhattan, which was first reported by theNew York Times.The Stern family fled Munich and went to California with their six children in 1936 as a result of Nazi persecution, but were prevented from taking the artwork, painted by the Dutch post-impressionist in 1889, according to the complaint.“Before the family’s emigration, the Nazi government declared the painting to be ‘German cultural property’ and prohibited the Sterns from bringing the painting (and others in their collection) with them abroad. After obtaining permission from a Nazi official, a ‘trustee’ appointed by the Nazis sold the painting in Germany on the Sterns’ behalf, but the proceeds of the sale were deposited in a ‘blocked account,’ which the Nazis later confiscated,” lawyers for the heirs said in the filing.In 1948, or shortly after, the painting arrived inNew Yorkand was bought by Vincent Astor, one of America’s wealthiest people, whose wife, Brooke Astor, served on the board of trustees of the Met from 1964 until 1983. It was later sold through a gallery to the Met, which sold it to Basil Goulandris and his wife, Elise, in 1972.The Greek couple established in 1979 the Basil & Elise Goulandris Foundation (BEG), which operates a museum in Athens where the painting is on display.The foundation and a surviving nephew of Basil Goulandris are named as defendants in the lawsuit, which alleges the family “and its related entities have hidden and obscured the painting’s ownership and location from plaintiff”.“To this day, the Goulandris defendants continue to conceal how and when the BEG came into possession of the painting; the Stern family’s ownership of the painting from 1935 to 1938; and the facts that the Nazis looted the painting from the Stern family, coerced the Sterns into selling it via a Nazi-appointed agent, and confiscated the proceeds of the sale,” according to the court papers.The Stern heirs filed a similar complaint in California in 2022 but it was dismissed in 2024. An appeal was dismissed in May.Tattoo fixers on removing Nazi symbols: ‘You don’t know if they’re changing or hiding’Read moreThe lawsuit argues the Met’s purchase of the painting was approved by Theodore Rousseau Jr, the museum’s curator of European paintings and “one of the world’s foremost experts on Nazi art looting”.“Rousseau and the Met knew or should have known that the painting had probably been looted by Nazis,” the court filing alleges.The Met said in a statement that it “takes seriously its longstanding commitment to address Nazi-era claims”.“At no time during the Met’s ownership of the painting was there any record that it had once belonged to the Stern family – indeed, that information did not become available until several decades after the painting left the museum’s collection,” a spokesperson said.“The Met’s sale of the Olive Picking met the museum’s strict criteria for deaccessioning – specifically, it was recorded that the work was deemed to be of lesser quality than other works of the same type in the collection. While the Met respectfully stands by its position that this work entered the collection and was deaccessioned legally and well within all guidelines and policies, the museum welcomes and will consider any new information that comes to light.”William Charron, a lawyer representing the BEG, said: “The Goulandris Foundation is a highly prestigious organization in Athens. The attempt to sue and smear the foundation and the Goulandris family in the US upon misleadingly incomplete allegations was previously dismissed, twice. We are confident it will be again.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsVincent van GoghNazismNew YorkMuseumsArtShareReuse this content"

But she’s standing in a fake sea – and looking at an artificial island’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 29 Oct 2025 10.58 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 13.19 EDTShareItaly has some of the most beautiful natural beaches in Europe, so I find it fascinating that so many holidaymakers choose to go to places like the one in this photograph: a strange manufactured island with plastic palm trees. This image is from a series,Leisure Time, that was important to me. I started it at a time when I had lots of personal problems, in 2006 and 2007. I needed to do something that would change my vision, my way of seeing the world, and even to some extent reinvent myself.I have always been interested in landscapes, cities, and the relationship between people and the environments they inhabit. The theme I decided to work on was mass tourism. I wanted to open our eyes to this strange aspect of modern life: the fact that people prefer to spend time at some artificial park or beach, rather than visit a real one.Many people want to go on holiday to a place where they know exactly what to expect, and are never going to be surprised or discover anything by chance. Many will also flock to sites they have seen other people post pictures of on Instagram – often distorting the reality of that location. They will take their pictures without taking the time to engage with the place. And today, even when tourists do visit a natural attraction, such as a mountain in the Alps, they expect to find something good to eat there, with music, and a high level of service. They want the same things we have in a city. But that isn’t the essence of mountains, which we should really visit to find refuge, calm and connection with the natural world.I wanted to look like just another tourist. So I’d dress in swimwear and do the same things they didI researched and photographed in holiday parks around the Tre Cime di Lavaredo mountains in the Dolomites, as well as on cruises – an increasingly popular type of holiday, especially for young people. An Italian cruise company, Costa, allowed me to spend a week on a ship, but when photographing the amusement parks, I mostly went in as just another tourist rather than as a journalist. I didn’t want to change the way people were behaving by appearing too much like I was doing professional work, so I’d dress in swimwear like them and do the same things.At the time, I was using a quite heavy medium-format camera, which wasn’t the most convenient way to work. If I did the same project today, I’d probably use an iPhone – that would be the perfect way to achieve the pictures I wanted without drawing attention to myself. The approach I’ve taken with the brightness of my Leisure Time images is my way of accenting the strange, unnatural character of these places: everything is intended to be perfect and made in candy colours that appeal to children.The woman in the black swimsuit is a real central presence – the way she’s standing in the fake sea and looking out over the artificial island, as if gazing at a scene of natural wonder. The photograph was taken either in the Mirabilandia water park or theGardaland Resort, both in the north of Italy. The fact that I can’t tell exactly which without checking is perhaps revealing in itself. They’re not identical, but they have the same atmosphere. In effect, this park could have been anywhere.Massimo Siragusa’s image is part of the World Press Photo 70th anniversaryprint sale, 17-26 November.

In recent years there’s been a steady resurgence of interest in him and his work – not just as a gay, Black composer, but as a significant musical personality whose maverick minimalist beats earned him a reputation for artistic confrontation.This concert, part of US bass-baritone Davóne Tines’sBarbicanresidency, offered a snapshot of his eclectic output. Touch Him When, arranged here for electric guitar and performed with head-banging intensity by Jiji, explored Eastman’s belief in music as a performative art. Distortion pedals and reverb leant the music a doom-metal vibe as consonant and dissonant waves crashed and burned. At the opposite end of the spectrum was Piano 2, a tripartite work with a conventional, early-20th-century feel, presented with calm authority by pianist Conor Hanick.View image in fullscreenAn increasingly sensual pas de deux … Khalid Dunton and José Lapaz-Rodriguez.Photograph: Andy ParadiseThe Holy Presence of Joan d’Arc, composed for 10 cellos, featured chugging rhythms undercut by doleful phrases that rose and fell. Eastman clearly identified with the medieval warrior and defier of gender norms. The originally improvised prelude, where Joan’s spirit guides call on her to speak boldly, was intoned by Tines, his voice resonating like a fist in a velvet glove as he traversed the auditorium. Cellist Seth Parker Woods, who also curated the concert, played live against nine prerecorded lines. It was a fine performance, but how much more powerful might it have been with those nine other cellists?Eastman’s music was often reworked for whatever forces he had available. Here, the iconic Gay Guerilla was arranged for three pianists at two pianos, cello, electric guitar and voice with two dancers and choreography by Kyle Marshall. Tolling chords built and shifted, gaining in harmonic complexity until, two-thirds of the way through, the music erupted with acerbic iterations of the Lutheran battle hymn Ein Feste Burg. Clad as timeless soldiers, Khalid Dunton and José Lapaz-Rodriguez hunted and circled each other in an increasingly sensual pas de deux as the lines between sleep and death, sex and combat became progressively blurred.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

After a lifetime of seeing exercise as punishment, I could suddenly appreciate itAnnabel LeeWed 29 Oct 2025 02.45 EDTShareAs a teenager, I was very much a “don’t put me down for cardio” girl. At school I would volunteer to be the goalkeeper as it required the least amount of movement. When it came to sports day, if I couldn’t blag a sicknote, I’d reluctantly sign up for long jump, since the long-jump pit was tucked away behind the bike shed and drew no crowds. The idea of running on the track in front of the whole school felt like a nightmare brought to life.Unlike lots of my male friends who played football or rugby for fun, I only saw exercise as punishment. Diet culture in the 90s dictated that thinness – and subsequent “goodness” – was a simple case of calories in versus calories out. Exercise was a gruelling way to stay slim and nothing more. I knew nothing of the feelgood effects of exercise, since I only ever experienced feeling as if I was going to pass out.As an adult, my attitude began to change. I tried running and found that I didn’t hate it, but I could never shake the feeling that I was bad at it. It often made me feel as if I was back at school, coming last in the relay race and embarrassing everyone, especially myself.View image in fullscreen‘Cardio is no longer the enemy’ … Annabel Lee, during a 10km run in Oxford.Photograph: Courtesy of Annabel LeeThat was until, at the age of 38, I agreed to go for a run with my five-year-old daughter. My husband had been a runner for a few years, and I was trying to get better at it. As a result, we talked about running a lot at home and my daughter started showing an interest. She said running sounded fun, which reminded me that was the point – it was meant to be an enjoyable hobby that made you feel better, not worse. Her attitude made me realise that running was now something I chose to do, rather than something I was forced into.My daughter liked running races with her brother but wanted to try going further. Friends with children suggested we try junior parkrun – 2km runs for four- to 14-year-olds, which aim to get kids active and make running accessible. Adults can run with their children, and events are focused on having fun, rather than pushing for a personal best.Bright and early one freezing Sunday morning, we headed to junior parkrun on a local running track. My daughter was one of the younger runners there and, running alongside her, I was amazed at her attitude and ability. She did not complain. She did not try to bunk off early. She appeared to be genuinely enjoying herself.I follow my daughter’s lead and relish the moment, grateful my body is able to propel me around the track alongside herAfterwards, we headed to a cafe by the running track for a snack, where my daughter told me she had loved the run – and to my surprise, so had I. We weren’t there to compete with anyone else or fret over our finish time – we were simply there to enjoy the experience of running together. I didn’t track the run on my usual running app or notice our pace.Later, I went out to run alone. When I started to get tired, my usual inner monologue kicked in: why don’t you stop? You’re terrible at this! Then I remembered how I had spoken to my daughter just hours earlier, encouraging her and praising her capabilities. You’re doing great, I told myself. Just keep running.The one change that worked: I loathed all forms of exercise – until I moved to a big city and walked milesRead moreTo my surprise, it worked. Instead of berating myself, I tried to talk to myself like I would to a child who I adore. My daughter looks very similar to how I did when I was five, so it had been easy to imagine I was talking to a younger version of myself. I knew I never wanted her to feel like running was a punishment; I wanted her to experience the runners’ highs and feelgood endorphins, not think of exercise as something to be endured.Since then, junior parkrun has become a regular occurrence. I’ve stopped focusing on how “good” or “bad” my runs are, and resisted the urge to compare myself with others. Instead I follow my daughter’s lead and relish the moment, grateful that my body is able to propel me around the track alongside her. I don’t think about calories burned or kilometres covered and I don’t worry about how bad I might look; instead, I concentrate on how good I feel.These days, cardio is no longer the enemy. I often go out for longer runs by myself and I’m training for my first marathon – but a Sunday morning 2km with my favourite running buddy remains an absolute joy.Explore more on these topicsRunningA moment that changed meFitnessFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In my years of reviewing beauty tech, it was upgrading my hair dryer that made the biggest difference to my beauty routine. I used to dread hair-wash days: the chore of shampooing, conditioning and rinsing my hair, plus the time – and aching arms – spent getting it dry again.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My clunky, bargain-bucket hair dryer of seven years was weighty, deafeningly loud, and took a painstaking 20 minutes to dry my hair completely. So happier days really did arrive when I switched it up for a new model.My current hair dryer uses a lightweight digital motor that’s not only far quieter, but is also powerful enough to dry my hair in just five minutes. It seems modern hair dryers have stepped up their game. Here, you’ll find the best hair dryers I’ve ever tested, from gentle options with diffusers for curly hair to ultra-fast models that shave significant time off your morning routine. You’ll also find expert hair-drying guidance from celebrity hairstylist Melissa Timperley.At a glanceBest hair dryer overall:Hershesons the Great£225 at HershesonsBest budget hair dryer:BaByliss Hydro-Fusion£29.99 at AmazonBest for curly hair:Panasonic Nanoe Moisture+£199.99 at CurrysBest hair dryer for sensitive scalps:Dyson Supersonic Nural£299 at John LewisBest lightweight hair dryer:Head Jog Futaria£99.95 at Salons DirectWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing beauty products for four years and have amassed a near-encyclopaedic knowledge of hair care. I’ve attended countless styling masterclasses, interviewed hair stylists, and completed a cosmetic science course where I learned exactly how hair growth, styling and care work at a cellular level.I’ve tested and reviewed more than 57 hair-styling tools – including hair dryers, curlers,hot brushes, wavers andstraighteners– from big-name brands and newcomers alike. And perhaps most impressively, I’ve walked away with my hair healthy and intact.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach hair dryer was tested for speed and sound levels.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianHaving researched the most popular brands and models, I put 20 hair dryers through their paces for this test. I also spoke to a hair stylist to find out what she looks for in a hair dryer, before cherrypicking the best 10 from my tests to include here.I used an anemometer to test each model’s maximum wind speed, which ranged from a measly 16 metres a second (m/s) to a mind-boggling 48m/s, and also a sound meter to measure noise levels from 15cm away.Claims of “enhanced shine or smoothness” aren’t quantifiable, but I did use every hair dryer to complete the same task, noting how long it took to rough-dry hair and then to finish. I also tried my hand at using a round brush to achieve a smooth, bouncy blowout. While I’m no professional at this, it did allow me to make a judgment about how easy a hair dryer’s controls are to use, how precise and versatile its settings are, and comfort levels over the course of styling.When testing was complete, I returned the samples to the manufacturers who sent them. If samples could not be returned, they were sent to the RedbridgeReach Out domestic abuse service, who provide support and refuge for survivors.The best hair dryers in 2025View image in fullscreenBlown away: the hair dryers vying for approval.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest hair dryer overall:Hershesons the GreatView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£225 at HershesonsTesting the Hershesons the Great hair dryer confirmed my belief that there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. This hair dryer perfects the basics and irons out any common niggles. It’s the lightest option I’ve ever tested, almost the quickest – and an easy recommendation.Why we love itThe Great hair dryer has four speeds, three heat settings and a cool shot. It reached a super-fast 38.4m/s in my tests, rough-drying my hair in less than five minutes, and leaving it soft and healthy-looking.You change the settings using buttons on the hair dryer’s handle, which can then be locked into place. This is unlike button controls on other models, which can be accidentally pressed mid-use.One distinctive feature of the Hershesons hair dryer, and something that goes a long way to justify its premium price, is its heat-proof mat. This will automatically switch off the dryer when it’s placed on to it, resuming again once it’s lifted. I found this invaluable when blow-drying my hair with a round brush, since I could plonk the hair dryer down to section my hair without having to faff around with the controls.Add on two concentrator nozzles, a diffuser, a fabric bag and a sturdier storage case, and the Great is a hair dryer that truly feels designed with the user in mind.It’s a shame that …it’s so expensive. Next to hair dryers with magnetic attachments, the push-on system here also felt archaic and made it more difficult to switch out tools.Weight (without wire):294gCord length:2.75mHeat settings (including cool shot):fourSpeed settings:fourAttachments:concentrator nozzles and a diffuserMaximum wind speed:38.4m/sVolume range:82-86dBBest budget hair dryer:BaByliss Hydro-FusionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£60 at Lookfantastic£29.99 at AmazonIf you ever struggle with frizzy hair after blow-drying, chances are you need an ionic dryer. This budget-friendly BaByliss option has a good range of speed and heat settings, a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser, making it suitable for numerous hair types. Furthermore, thanks to its 2,100W motor, its 26.4m/s maximum wind speed rivals some of the pricier options on this page.Why we love itIt was immediately clear that the Hydro-Fusion was well built and powerful. It rough-dried my hair in about 10 minutes, leaving it feeling healthy and totally free from frizz and flyaways. Despite this power, it’s quieter than many of the models here, too.Attachments securely clicked into place and stayed on without issue while I completed my round-brush blow-dry test. I found the hair dryer’s two speed settings offered plenty of control for more precise styling, and the cool shot came through quickly compared with other cheaper hair dryers I’ve tested. Once styled, my hair was bouncy and shiny, with a frizz-free finish that lasted multiple days.It’s a shame that …its design is pretty basic; there are no frills here. A few more colour options would have been welcome, too, but you’re unlikely to find a better hair dryer for the price.Weight (without wire):430gCord length:2.5mHeat settings (including cool shot):fourSpeed settings:twoAttachments:concentrator nozzle and a diffuserMaximum wind speed:26.4m/sVolume range:78-85dBBest hair dryer for curly hair:Panasonic Nanoe Moisture+View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£199.99 at Currys£329.99 at PanasonicAs counterintuitive as it sounds, this hair dryer adds moisture to your hair. Panasonic’s Nanoe technology creates microscopic water droplets that penetrate the hair’s cuticle to add extra moisture to the hair’s deepest layers. It claims this helps to reduce colour fading, flyaways, split ends and breakage.Why we love itI tested the Panasonic EH NA0J hair dryer after several hair washes and found its distinctive shape intuitive to use. For rough-drying, I used heat and the fastest speed setting (23.4m/s), and was impressed at how quickly the hair dryer worked its magic (in about 10 minutes).Compared with the other models here, the Nanoe appeared to separate wet clumps of hair into smaller sections, drying strands faster. Despite using the one and only heat setting, my hair felt smooth and healthy after a rough dry. And when attempting the round-brush blow-dry, the Nanoe set the style quickly using its cool shot.This hair dryer is particularly good at gently diffusing curly and coily hair types. The diffuser attachment locks securely on to the front of the body, and its long prongs are well designed to spread air gently from the root to the tip of a curl. Add in its moisturising capabilities, and you’ll be left with soft, shiny, healthier curls with each use.It’s a shame that …it has only one heat setting. Instead, the Nanoe offers multiple modes: alternating hot and cold for preserving shine; a scalp care mode and a skin care mode. These won’t be right for every user, particularly if you like adjusting the heat levels manually. But if your hair needs extra nourishment, this hair dryer is worth a shot.Weight (without wire):460gCord length:2.7mHeat settings (includingcool shot):one (plus scalp care and alternating modes)Speed settings:threeAttachments:concentrator nozzle and a diffuserMaximum wind speed:23.4m/sVolume range:73-84dBBest hair dryer for sensitive scalps:Dyson Supersonic NuralView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at DysonDyson was once best known for its vacuum cleaners, but in recent years has cultivated a reputation for luxury hair styling tools. The 2016 Dyson Supersonic was the brand’s first hair care product, with a distinctive design that ripped up the hair dryer rulebook. And in 2024, Dyson launched the Supersonic Nural, which mirrors the original design but adds some handy scalp care features.Why we love itThe Supersonic Nural had to do some heavy lifting to justify its high price tag. It looks just like its predecessor aside from a small sensor in the middle, which controls the Nural’s new Scalp Protect mode. This tweaks the temperature of the air based on the hair dryer’s proximity to the scalp, ensuring you never burn your scalp or frazzle the delicate hairs at the hairline.As someone with a fussy scalp, I often find the highest temperatures of hair dryers too harsh, but this ensured I was completely comfortable throughout drying. At the same time, it dried the lengths of my hair without frazzling them or causing unnecessary damage. You can also switch this mode on and off if you prefer to control the temperature yourself.There are three speeds and four temperatures, and the button controls are intuitive. Its evenly weighted design was comfortable to hold, its motor was very quiet, and I found its magnetic attachments convenient and easy to use. I particularly liked the flyaway attachment, which quickly and comfortably smoothed down my frizz and flyaways after rough drying my hair.It’s a shame that …it’s very expensive and the hair dryer wasn’t quite as quick as others I’ve tested. It took about seven minutes to blow dry my hair, but I was grateful that it could take care of my scalp without me having to make adjustments. It’s easily the best option for those with sensitive scalps.Weight (without wire):485gCord length:2.8mHeat settings (including cool shot):fourSpeed settings:threeAttachments:concentrator nozzle, diffuser, flyaway attachment, gentle air attachment and a wide-tooth combMaximum wind speed:29.2m/sVolume range:75-81dBBest lightweight hair dryer:Head Jog FutariaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99.95 at Salons Direct£139.95 at AmazonThis is the fastest hair dryer I’ve ever tested, and weighing in at 304g, the Futaria is just 10g heavier than the lightest option – the Hershesons above. It was the dark horse here; I hadn’t encountered Head Jog before my most recent round of testing, but with its super-fast wind speeds of 43.8m/s and reasonable price point, it’s an easy favourite.Why we love itThe Futaria hair dryer packs a serious punch, rough-drying my hair in a blisteringly quick four minutes. Thanks to its three speeds and four heat settings, I could master a precise round-brush blow-dry without much effort at all. Personally, I found the wider concentrator nozzle best for styling larger sections of hair, which sped up the process even further.The digital motor also makes the Futaria relatively quiet, and despite its light weight, the design feels sturdy and evenly weighted, plus its rear filter is easy to clean and maintain. As such, this model is perfect for use in busy salons to reduce wrist strain and maximise time efficiency. And those of us at home will also benefit from the dryer’s sleek design, which is available in blue, pink and black.It’s a shame that …since it’s tailored to professional stylists, it’s not as widely stocked as other hair dryers. Also, those concerned about damage may find the knock-your-socks-off power a little much. That said, if you’re careful with the highest intensity settings and use a heat protection spray, you shouldn’t fry your hair.Weight (without wire):304gCord length:3mHeat settings (including cool shot):fourSpeed settings:threeAttachments:twoconcentrator nozzles and a diffuserMaximum wind speed:43.8m/sVolume range:78-84dBskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

According to the brand, the Parlux 3200 Plus (previously Compact) is the most widely used professional hair dryer on the market. I found it well balanced and comfortable in the hand and liked its tactile, retro-feeling switches.During testing, it dried my hair incredibly quickly, leaving a glossy, frizz-free finish. That’s thanks to the inclusion of Parlux’s K-lamination motor, which provides the power of a 2,800W motor while using only 1,900W. The hair dryer is available in a wide range of colours, and is a stylish option – if you can look past the box, which looks freshly fished from the early 2000s.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s heavier than other options here, plus it lacks the design refinements of more expensive models.Weight (without wire):588g;cord length:3m;heat settings (includingcool shot):three;speed settings:two;attachments:two concentrator nozzles;maximum wind speed: 26m/s;volume range:80-85dBCloud Nine the Airshot ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£299 at Lookfantastic£199 at AmazonBest for:quiet operationTaking both the highest and lowest noise levels into account, the Airshot Pro is the quietest hair dryer I’ve tested. In addition, my hair was left with gorgeous shine thanks to the Sericite-infused heat tech that features in Cloud Nine’s heat-styling tools.As well as offering a great range of temperature controls, with a continuous cool shot option, the Airshot’s magnetic concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachments proved secure and suited to a range of hair types.It didn’t make the final cut because …it lacks a dedicated cool shot button, and it’s not as speedy as others in this price range. Still, some may be swayed by its quiet operation.Weight (without wire):448g;cord length:3m;heat settings (including cool shot):four;speed settings:three;attachments:two concentrator nozzles, diffuser;maximum wind speed: 23.8m/s;volume range:75-79dBBellissima B-travelView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£49.99 at Boots£50 at AOThe dinky Belissima B-travel hair dryer is a brilliant option for trips and holidays. It has dual-voltage controls, so you can use it wherever you are in the world. Its folding handle and carry case keep everything safe in transit, and it feels very sturdy considering its price.Unlike most hotel hair dryers, which only let out a pathetic trickle of air, this hair dryer provides wind speeds of up to 18.9m/s – faster than some full-size options I’ve reviewed and highly impressive given the hair dryer’s light weight. You also get a concentrator nozzle for precision styling and two speed options.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s one control switch, so you can’t adjust the heat setting independently from the speed settings, and the difference between the two heat settings is negligible. Its travel-based use case is limited; for the same price, you’d be better off investing in an alternative with multiple temperature settings to use at home.Weight (without wire):305g;cord length:1.8m;heat settings (includingcool shot):two;speed settings:two;attachments:concentrator nozzle;maximum wind speed: 18.9m/s;volume range:79-84dBGtech DryOnicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£179 at AO£179 at CurrysBest for:precise temperature controlsOne of my biggest bugbears with hair dryers is that you never quite know how much heat you’re using on your hair. Thankfully, the Gtech DryOnic has a screen on the back that displays the airflow setting and its temperature. With temperatures that range from 40C to 100C, you can make precise adjustments for your hair type.I found the various airflow settings useful and liked how securely the magnetic concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachments fitted on to the dryer. After styling, my hair felt soft and hydrated, with minimal frizz.It didn’t makethe final cut because …it’s not quite as quick as others here at a similar price, and its 2m cord isn’t quite long enough for my liking. I also found it too easy to accidentally press the buttons and change the temperature midway through styling.Weight (without wire):426g;cord length:2m;heat settings (including cool shot):five;speed settings:four;attachments:concentrator nozzle and diffuser;maximum wind speed: 18.8m/s;volume range:78-85dBRemington Shine TherapyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£26 at AO£25.99 at AmazonBest for:tight budgetsThis lesser-known hair dryer is the sister product to the popular Remington Shine Therapyhair straighteners. It offers equally brilliant value and is designed to add shine to the hair using ionic technology.While difficult to quantify in tests, I found the hair dryer did dry my hair relatively quickly and left it shiny and smooth after a round-brush blow-dry. Multiple heat and speed settings, plus a concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachment, make it a good option for all hair types.It didn’t make the final cut because …of its short 1.8m cord and the fact that it’s pretty noisy compared with other models here. That said, it can’t be beaten on price and is a sensible choice if you’re hoping to upgrade an old hair dryer on a budget.Weight (without wire):449g;cord length:1.8m;heat/cool settings:four;speed settings:two;attachments:concentrator nozzle and diffuser;maximum wind speed:18.6m/s;volume range:84-89dBWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianIinterviewed Melissa Timperley, hair stylist and founder ofMelissa Salons, to discover her tips for choosing a hair dryer. “When it comes to protecting your hair and achieving the style you want, the tool you use matters just as much as the products you pair it with,” she says.What features should I look for?According to Timperley, the key features are adjustable speed and heat settings, which “allow for better control and protection, depending on your hair type and styling needs”. Look for hair dryers with a cool shot button, too, which “help to seal the cuticle and set your style”.Design-wise, consider weight, which is “especially important for longer hair or professional use” to prevent armstrain. Also look for a dryer that has a removable or self-cleaning filter, as “this makes cleaning and maintenance easy, which helps preserve motor life”.What to avoid when choosing a dryerTimperley warns that there are some features, or omissions, that could be detrimental to hair health. It’s best to avoid “single-setting dryers that don’t allow heat or speed control”, as well as low-wattage dryers under 1,800W, because “they often take longer to dry hair, exposing it to heat for too long”.However, some of the dryers I’ve chosen here are below 1,800W. That’s because these use digital motors, which are smaller and lighter than brushed motors and produce faster airflow. That means, in those cases, the difference in drying speeds is negligible.She also warns against buying “heavy, bulky dryers that are uncomfortable to use regularly” and “poor-quality nozzles or diffusers that don’t fit securely or distribute air properly”.Put simply, she says: “If the dryer doesn’t clearly list its motor type, wattage or heat settings, that’s a red flag.”What makes a hair dryer good for different hair types?Picking out the right hair dryer for your hair type can be challenging. “The best hair dryers cater to your hair’s specific needs – whether that’s smoothing frizz, protecting fine strands or cutting through thick, coarse textures,” says Timperley.For fine or damaged hair, Timperley advises looking for “lower heat settings and a ceramic or tourmaline dryer that distributes heat more gently”. For thick or coarse hair, “higher wattage and powerful airflow are essential – infrared, ionic and titanium dryers are great for cutting drying time without excessive heat”. And finally, for curly or textured hair, “a diffuser attachment is key, as is a dryer that offers heat control without sacrificing volume or natural texture”.What’s the difference between ionic and ceramic hair dryers?“Ionic hair dryers emit negative ions that help break down water molecules faster, reducing drying time and frizz,” says Timperley. “They’re great for smoothing and shine, especially if you have thick, frizzy or unruly hair.”Conversely, “ceramic hair dryers use ceramic heating elements to distribute heat evenly, which helps prevent hotspots and damage. They’re ideal for fine or delicate hair”.“Some of the best hair dryers,” says Timperley, “combine both technologies, giving you faster drying without sacrificing hair health.”For more, read the Filter’s guide tothe best hair masksSarah Matthews is aconsumer journalist who specialises in health and beauty reviews.

Keep and combine any trimmings into a ball and re-roll as and when required.Pastrykeeps well in the freezer, and by skipping two time-consuming steps in the traditional recipe – that is, making the pastry and caramelising the onions – this one comes together about an hour faster. Instead, the onions are cooked upside down, steaming and caramelising beneath a blanket of pastry with anchovies and black olives for a fast, fun twist on a French classic. And if you have less pastry, you can always halve the recipe.Quick upside-down pissaladière tartsThe current wave of upside-down tarts, which went viral on TikTok and Instagram a couple of years ago, may have begun with Lily Ghodrati’s delicious and simplepeach and honey puff pastryor Dominik Franks’inspirational onion tart, which even led to a whole book on upside-down cooking. I’ve also been having a lot of fun cooking upside down lately, frommy extra-long leek tartto these speedy pissaladière tartlets. It’s a simple, playful way to create something that feels extra-special.Makes4 individual tarts1 red onion2 tbsp olive oil1 tbsp honeySalt and black pepper8 anchovies(or 4, for a milder taste)Pitted black olives, to taste120g pastry– I used puff but shortcrust works, tooHeat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Peel and trim the onion, then cut into four thick, round slices (cross-sections of onion). Line a hob-appropriate oven sheet with baking paper, then imagine where you will put each piece of onion. Drizzle those areas with olive oil and honey, then season. Lay two anchovies on top of each seasoned patch and cover them with a piece of onion. Nestle a few black olives in and around the onions, then season with a little more olive oil, honey, salt and pepper.Turn on two adjacent hob rings to a medium heat, put the tray on top of the rings and leave the onions to cook undisturbed for five minutes.Meanwhile, on a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry and cut it into four rectangles just large enough to cover each piece of onion. Carefully lay one pastry rectangle on top of each piece of onion, press down around the edges with the back of a fork, then bake for 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Lay a board on top of the pastry tray, then flip to invert the tarts on to the board. Carefully peel away the paper and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wastePastryBakingVegetablesSnacksStarterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You have all the preserves from the warmer months to work with, prolonging the essence of balmier days, but, as colder weather draws in, it’s also a time to think about heartier fare to warm our bellies. Root vegetables, mushrooms and dark red meat play a prominent role in making the winter chill not just bearable but somehow even desirable.Duckis one of my favourites for a weekend lunch, and we’re lucky to have incredible produce here in Yorkshire to pair it with.Honey-roast duck with beetroot and poached pears (pictured top)Chill48 hrPrep20 minCook1 hr 30 minServes4For the pears2 large, ripe williams pears, peeled, quartered and cored600mlred wine300g caster sugarStrips of zest and juice of 1 orange3 bay leaves1 rosemary sprig1 thyme sprigFor the duck200g baby beetroot, halved1 garlic bulb2 red onions, peeled and quartered2 rosemary sprigs2 tbsp olive oil2 tbspraspberry vinegar, or balsamic vinegar1 duck crown, left uncovered in the fridge for 48 hours (this helps to dry out the skin)3 tbsp runny honeySaltHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the pears in a pan with the wine, sugar, orange zest and juice, bay, rosemary and thyme. Cover with a cartouche (a circle of baking paper laid directly on top of the poaching liquid), bring to a gentle simmer and poach for about 15-20 minutes, until tender.Meanwhile, put the beetroot, garlic, onion, rosemary, olive oil and vinegar in an oven tray, mix well, then roastfor 25 minutes.Rub the duck all over with the honey, and season liberally with salt. Once the beetroot mix has had 25 minutes, sit the duck crown on top and return to the oven for 10 minutes. Turn the tray 180 degrees, roast for another eight minutes, then remove and leave to rest for 20 minutes.Carve the duck and serve each portion with two slices of warm poached pear as a garnish (keep the poaching liquid: reduce it until it’s syrupy, then save for pouring over vanilla ice-cream). This would be lovely with some mash and/or a bitter-leaf salad alongside.Yorkshire pudding stuffed with slow-cooked duck leg, liver parfait and wild mushroomsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian.

Divide the duck fat evenly between two four-hole yorkshire pudding tins (or deep muffin tins – to make eight), then put the trays in the hot oven to heat up.Meanwhile, make the batter. Tip the flour into a bowl, then beat in the eggs until smooth. Gradually beat in the milk then continue to beat until the mix is completely lump-free. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the melted butter and pour the batter into a jug. Take the hot tins out of the oven, then carefully and evenly pour the batter into the greased holes. Return the tins to the oven and bake undisturbed for 20-25 minutes, until the puddings have puffed up and browned. Remove and set aside while you make the stuffing.Meanwhile, put a large, lidded ovenproof casserole on a medium heat, then brown the duck legs in it for 10-15 minutes (their fat will render so no need for oil), turning every few minutes so they colour all over. Transfer to a plate and remove all but a tablespoon of the duck fat from the casserole (save the excess for roasting spuds). Once the yorkshire puddings are out of the oven, reduce the temperature to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.Add the wild mushrooms to the hot casserole and cook, stirring, for four minutes, until they start to take on colour. Add the shallots and garlic, and fry, stirring, for two or three minutes, just to soften. Add the flour, cook, stirring, for a minute, then return the duck legs to the pan. Pour in the red wine, stock and rosemary, bring to a simmer, then cover and transfer to the oven for an hour and a half.When the duck is cooked, lift the legs out of the pot and shred all the meat off the bones. Put the casserole on a medium heat and reduce the liquid for about four minutes, until it turns nice and glossy, then stir the shredded duck back into the mix.Put two hot yorkshire puddings on each plate (reheat them gently in the oven first), and put a large tablespoon of the parfait in the centre of each one. Pile some of the duck and mushroom mixture on top and serve immediately.Joshua Overington is chef/owner ofMýsein Hovingham, North YorkshireExplore more on these topicsFoodDuckMain courseBritish food and drinkAutumn food and drinkVegetablesBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"

Over the last decade, however, the largest island in the Inner Hebrides has been drawing visitors for other reasons – its dynamic food and drink scene. Leading the way are youngSgitheanach(people from Skye) with a global outlook but a commitment to local, sustainable ingredients. It’s also the result of an engaged community keen to create good, year-round jobs that keep young people on the island.Calum Montgomery is Skye born and bred, and he’s passionate about showcasing the island’s larder on his menus atEdinbane Lodge. “If someone is coming to Skye I want them to appreciate the landscape, but also the quality of our produce,” he says. “Our mussels, lobster, scallops and crab are second to none.” Montgomery is mindful of the past: “It means everything to me to use the same produce as my ancestors. My grandpa was a lobster fisherman and we’re enjoying shellfish from the same stretch of water, with the same respect for ingredients.”View image in fullscreenLoch Fada near Portree, Skye.Photograph: Denis Chapman/AlamyMontgomery’s A Taste of Skye menu lists the distances his produce has travelled. I eat fat scallops hand-dived in Loch Greshornish (zero miles), and creel-caught lobster from Portree (12 miles) with vegetables, foraged herbs and edible flowers from the kitchen garden and seashore (zero miles). That connection to produce and producers is key. “Last week I took a young chef out with a scallop diver so he could learn what they do. We shucked scallops straight from the water and ate them raw with a squeeze of lemon. ‘That’s the best scallop I’ve ever eaten,’ he said. That’s what we want to bring to the restaurant.”Driving south, in the shadow of the mighty Cuillin mountains, I meet another culinary ambassador for Skye, Clare Coghill, atCafé Cùil. This year Coghill represented Scotland at Tartan Week in New York, serving lobster rolls with whisky butter, and haggis quesadillas from a Manhattan food truck. She initially launched Café Cùil in Hackney, London. Returning home to Skye during the pandemic, a series of pop-ups proved there was a market here too.View image in fullscreenCafé Cùil’s blood orange and beetroot-cured trout on sourdough and creme fraiche.Photograph: Lynne Kennedy PhotographyOver a machair matcha (topped with dried machair flowers) and delicious blood orange-cured trout, Coghill tells me: “I’m really proud I opened in London, but I couldn’t do what I can do here. Getting fresh ingredients was a huge mission, but here the scallops come straight from the sea to my door. My creel fisherman only speaks to me in Gaelic.” Her love of Skye’s produce, people and landscape is clear across her colourful, creative dishes, all imbued with local flavours, with a twist of Gaelic. “My connection to Gaelic culture and language is so important,” she says. Visitors can use little lesson cards on the tables to learn a few words while they eat.A lot of us worked elsewhere. We’d see the produce arrive miles from where it was landed, and it’s just not as goodSkye’s more longstanding food destinations are not resting on their laurels.Kinloch Lodge, a boutique hotel run by Isabella Macdonald in her family’s ancestral home, has long been a foodie destination. Isabella’s mother, Claire, Lady Macdonald OBE, writes well-loved books on Scottish cookery.The kitchen continues to innovate, with a dynamic young team led by head chef David Cameron. When they’re not in the kitchen the chefs grow herbs and spices in the hotel greenhouse, and forage for wild greens in the gardens and sea herbs like sea aster and scurvygrass from the shoreline of Loch na Dal. In autumn they follow deer trails to find mushrooms in the woods.View image in fullscreenHogget with asparagus and spinach, at Edinbane LodgePhotograph: Lynne KennedyI feast on Skye scallops, pak choi and peanuts in a delicious dashi; Shetland cod with Scottish asparagus, and house-smoked lobster. Kinloch’s ghillie, Mitchell Partridge, takes guests out for activities including foraging and fishing “There’s a huge appetite for experiences from our guests,” says Macdonald. “People want to come and really get to know the island and the landscape.”The whisky industry is also helping to keep young people on Skye, in jobs that last beyond the peak tourism months. Dougie Stewart, operations manager atTorabhaig distillery, tells me: “The fish farm was a big employer in the past, but now most of the jobs are automated. House prices have gone up so much it’s harder for young people to stay. The whisky industry has become a really important employer.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In other distilleries, that’s an honour usually reserved for retiring distillers. The visitor centre and cafe employ many people from around the Sleat peninsula. “We meld into the community because we brought the community here,” says tour guide manager Anne O’lone.To pick up supplies for my journey home I stop byBirch, a speciality coffee roaster and bakery serving gleaming pastries and colourful brunch dishes. It’s owned by Niall Munro, who also founded the hugely successfulSkye Livemusic festival. His brother Calum Munro is chef-owner at fine-dining restaurantScorrybreacin Portree, somewhere I’m desperate to try, but I’ve sadly run out of mealtimes. More local success stories, and incredible food.“We’re all deeply rooted in Skye,” says Calum Montgomery. “A lot of us left and worked elsewhere. We’d be seeing the produce we knew arrive miles from where it was landed, and it’s just not as good as what we grew up eating. I’m so proud of the whole place now.”Journeying across Skye, I’m constantly asked where I’ve been and where I’m eating next. It’s a real testament to this food community that everyone is keen to champion other island businesses. It’s collaborative, not competitive, and the quality?

I said to him: ‘No more children are going to die like you.’”Last week, on the anniversary of the fire, she was invited to meet the prime minister in Downing Street, as the government announced that it planned to repeal the presumption that children should have contact with both parents, under which decisions are made in the family court.It was guided by this presumption that a family court judge had made the decision to allow Throssell’s ex-husband unsupervised access to their children, despite her warnings that he had threatened to harm both her and them.That evening, Throssell had returned home from work just after her sons’ father, Darren Sykes, had picked them up. “I missed them by five minutes,” she said. “I was late home, and I missed them for that last hug.”“Literally, 15 minutes later, there was a knock on the door,” she said, “and, you know, I just knew. I opened the door, and there was a police officer stood outside the door, and the car was flashing in the middle of the road. And I said, ‘What has he done?’”She was rushed to Sheffield children’s hospital and ran through the doors. “I could see them working on Paul,” she said. “His little body was bouncing off the bed.”Once she arrived, doctors told her that they were going to let him go. As she held her son, she said police “came in and said, ‘You can’t touch him any more, he’s a crime scene.’”View image in fullscreenClaire Throssell at home with a photo of her sons before travelling to London to meet Keir Starmer.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianPaul had been overcome by the smoke and fumes from the fire deliberately started by their father, who also took his own life. She later found out that Jack had died trying to save his brother.“He went back for his brother, and he didn’t leave him,” she said. “Pulled him, and because he was going backwards, he fell through the hatchway into the fires below.”And after emergency services arrived on the scene, she said, Jack told “as many people as he could” what had happened, before he was sedated: “My dad did this, and he did it on purpose.”“Even at that point, he wasn’t thinking of himself, he was thinking of me,” she said. “He was thinking of Paul, and five days later, he died believing that he’d saved Paul’s life, because I never told him different.”‘He saw our children as possessions’: my husband killed our sonsRead moreA serious case review following her sons’ death said that Sykes’s actions could not have been predicted – a finding that Throssell disputes.“I told the courts that he’d kill them,” she said. “I told them what would happen. I couldn’t predict how, but I knew he would do it, and I was just minimised, ignored and invisible.”A Cafcass (children and family court advisory and support service) officer had met with Paul at school, and he had told her his father would make him sit at the table and eat peas until he was sick.Sykes was granted five hours of unsupervised contact, against the boys’ wishes. They did not feel safe with him, and would spray themselves with her perfume before they left, Throssell said.“I defy any judge to see children crying and physically holding onto you, physically shaking, and saying they don’t want to see their dad,” she said, “and see how they felt as a parent, having to say to them, ‘You’ve got to go.’”“As parents, we’re supposed to protect our children, not send them into danger,” she added.After returning from visits, she said “it’d take at least a day to regulate them again and make them feel safe, get them to smile again, because there were lots of tears.”“Yes, they weren’t staying overnight, yes, they weren’t there at meal times, but they were still being abused, still being hurt, and he was taking away their childhood piece by piece by piece, and I couldn’t do anything about it.”After her sons’ death, Throssell was left with nothing; she had spent all of her savings on legal fees fighting to try to keep her children safe. At their funeral, she wore her sister’s shoes, stuffed with newspaper, because they were two sizes too big; she couldn’t afford to buy a pair of her own.Sykes had cancelled their home insurance before setting the fires, and had written to the bank saying she was responsible for the £50,000 mortgage; the house was eventually rebuilt by community volunteers.At that point, she said, “I could have given up, hated the world, hated everybody in it, become bitter, give up, die.”“But then, what about these two?” she asked, pointing to framed photographs of her boys behind her, on the wall of her living room in Penistone, SouthYorkshire. “They didn’t deserve that. They deserve a legacy. They deserve to be known.”View image in fullscreenPaul (left) and Jack. Their mother has campaigned since their death for a change in the law.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIt was when she was at her lowest that the charity Women’s Aid got in touch, she said, and she was “shocked” to discover that her sons were the 18th and 19th children to be killed after a court had awarded contact with a parent.“After what I experienced in the family courts, I teamed up with Women’s Aid and we started the Child First campaign to repeal presumption of contact,” she said.“The system is so flawed, it protects bad practice. It protects misogyny, it protects oppression and it protects fear,” she added. “You run away from the fear, you walk into a family court and it’s there again.”Earlier this year, she asked the charity to produce another report, to find out how many more children had died since Jack and Paul.“The report said exactly 19 more children, and I sat on the floor there and cried,” Throssell said, pointing to a spot on the floor of her living room in front of an armchair, “curled up and cried, because I’ve still not kept that promise, not just to Jack and Paul, but to every child that’s at risk.”In the last 30 years, the charity found, 67 children have been killed by a parent who was also a perpetrator of domestic abuse, in circumstances relating to unsafe child contact.The figures do not includeSara Sharif, who was killed in 2023 by her father and stepmother. The family court had been involved with the family since before she was born.“We couldn’t have achieved such seismic change without Claire – her dedication, her drive and her courage,”said Farah Nazeer, the chief executive of Women’s Aid.“Claire has been the central pillar in our campaign work around this,” she added, “and we will continue campaigning and working together until the wellbeing and safety of children becomes ingrained in family courts.”Cafcass said last week that it welcomed the government’s decision to repeal the presumption of parental involvement.“Children’s experiences of parental separation, conflict and, in the worst cases, further abuse and harm can be obscured by a legal presumption of contact,” a spokesperson said.“Putting children’s safety at the heart of family court proceedings that are about them is what we must and will continue to prioritise at Cafcass.”The news of the government’s decision came out of the blue, Throssell said; she received a call from Women’s Aid asking if she could come down to London because the government was planning to make an important announcement.Her MP, Marie Tidball, then the Labour candidate, had come up to her at an event at her son’s school, and made her a promise that if she was elected she would fight to repeal presumption of contact. But Throssell didn’t know that it would definitely happen, and she didn’t expect that it would happen so soon.While repealing the legislation “doesn’t take away the sting of walking into an empty room” – “I have to live with that silence every day,” she said – it has allowed her to keep her promise to her boys. She hopes the new law might even be named after them.“I came out of Downing Street, and it felt so different knowing that a promise is going to be kept, the last promise that I made to Jack and Paul,” she said.“When I first walked up that staircase, it was a real mountain to climb, I was still looking at the floor,” she added. “Walking down that staircase, I could finally hold my head up and feel that I’d done something.”This article was amended on 29 October 2025. Sara Sharif was killed in 2023, not 2024 as stated in an earlier version.Explore more on these topicsChild protectionChildrenDomestic violenceYorkshireNorth of EnglandEnglandKeir StarmerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Deep in the forest, a multilane highway abruptly opens up through the trees, leading to a palace topped by a winged eagle that glows under the equatorial sun.But along the rows of futuristic new buildings, Nusantara’s boulevards are largely empty save for a few gardeners and curious tourists.Three years since former president Joko Widodo launched the ambitiousnew capital, meant to replacepolluted, congested and sinking Jakarta, some fear it is in danger of becoming a glorified ghost town.Under the president,Prabowo Subianto, who assumed office last October, state funding for the new capital project has plunged more than half, from £2bn in 2024 to £700m in 2025. Next year £300m has been allocated, a third of what was requested. Private investment has also fallen more than £1bn short of the target.A map showing the new city’s expansion areaaltPrabowo, who is yet to visit as president, also quietly downgraded Nusantara to a “political capital” in May, although the decision was only made public in September.In 2024 the head and deputy of the body overseeing the capital resigned. About 2,000 civil servants and 8,000 construction workers currently live in Nusantara, far from the 2030 target of 1.2 million.Apartment blocks, ministry buildings, hospitals, roads, water systems and an airport have been built, but much of the city remains under construction.Herdiansyah Hamzah, a constitutional law scholar from Mulawarman University in East Kalimantan, says the project was already “a ghost city” and the new “political capital” designation had “no meaning” in Indonesian law.“The new capital is not a priority for Prabowo,” he says. “Politically, it’s unwilling to die, unwilling to live.”Despite the delays and downgrade, those involved in the project – officially known as Ibu Kota Nusantara (IKN) – remain upbeat.View image in fullscreenThis aerial photo taken on 15 August, 2025 shows the presidential palace and government ministry buildings under development in Ibu Kota Nusantara (IKN), the planned new capital of Indonesia, in East Kalimantan.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images“The president [Prabowo] told me, ‘It is my commitment to continue and finish this even faster,’” says Basuki Hadimuljono, head of the Nusantara Capital Authority (OIKN), from his office overlooking the new capital.Reports of a construction slowdown and lack of political will are “not true”, he says.“The funding is there, the political commitment is there,” he says. “Why should we doubt that?” Funding, he adds, has been “reallocated, not cut”.Boom and bustAround Nusantara, small businesses that had thrived on the influx of workers say trade this year has collapsed, while environmentalists have warned of a potential ecological disaster in a stretch of rainforest home to rare and endangered species.“When Jokowi was president, my rental rooms were full,” says Dewi Asnawati, who runs a convenience store and homestay. “Now, my income has dropped by half.”Stallholder Syarariyah agrees, describing a boom followed by a bust. “At first, our laundry was full every day,” she says. “But when the workers went home, everything stopped. Many friends closed their businesses. People worry this could become a ghost city.”View image in fullscreenConstruction of Nusantara in January 2024.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesConstruction worker Bejo has also seen the slowdown first-hand. “We still work, but there’s less overtime and less money,” he says. In Balikpapan Bay, where fishers once complained of huge ships carrying construction materials disturbing their nets, they now say traffic has fallen sharply.For the Indigenous Balik people living near Sepaku River, less than 20km away, the new capital has brought disruption.Arman, a local farmer and fisher, says flooding has worsened since a water treatment plant was built on the river, cutting his harvests in half. Promises of clean water from the new plant, he says, never materialised.“It only goes to IKN,” he says, adding that the dozens of families in the community could no longer source their own water from the river due to pollution and a new dam. The government has denied those claims.Still, the community wants Nusantara to succeed, hoping it could bring more awareness of Balik culture and tourism to the area. “If it stops, we lose everything,” says Arman. “But if it continues without us, we also lose.”Environmental groups such as Walhi say the project has already caused lasting ecological damage. The NGO estimates more than 2,000 hectares of mangrove forest have been cleared over the past two years due to infrastructure projects, including a new highway and port.Nusantara, says the group, is unlikely to benefit local and Indigenous communities.“[With Nusantara] you will have a high-walled area where people enjoy everything inside, but outside, life will be different,” says Walhi’s Fathur Roziqin Fen. “The local people lose both the economy and the environment – they lose both ways.”View image in fullscreenThe presidential palace at Nusantara.Photograph: Michael NielsonThe government has denied any negative environmental impacts and defended its engagement with Indigenous groups, with some provided with compensation for their land.Nusanatra, says Basuki, was designed as a green city withonly a quarter of the 252,000-hectare site to be developed and the rest kept as green space.Even as officials defend the government’s commitment, analysts say Prabowo’s focus lies elsewhere, such as his flagship free schools meals program, which is slated to have an annual budget of £15bn by the end of 2026.Others suggest Nusantara may end up more a tourism destination.Lost homes, lost traditions, lost habitats: the cost of Indonesia’s brand new cityRead more“It feels like Singapore,” says Clariza, who was visiting from the neighbouring island of Sulawesi. “Clean, modern – like something impossible in the middle of the jungle.”She is also hopeful Nusantara can help shift Indonesia’s wealth away from Java, which has long dominated the country’s politics and power.“For us who live in the eastern regions, it feels more centralised when the capital is here,” she says.“But it’s also strange and quiet,” she adds. “There’s nobody here yet.”Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaAsia PacificPrabowo SubiantofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereNesrine MalikWed 29 Oct 2025 09.20 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 09.21 EDTShareThe Long Wave is one! I can’t believe it’s been a whole year. It genuinely feels as if we are just getting started. Whenwe launched the newsletter, I wrote about how it was born first and foremost out of curiosity, of interest in how we passed our food, culture and habits down and across the world, how we mixed recipes, languages, shared music. Our instinct was that there is a sprawling global family, rich in untold stories. That instinct has been validated and surpassed. What follows is only a small sample of what we have covered over the past year.Exploring the breadth and depth of the Black diasporaView image in fullscreenConnective tissue … Elmiene’s music is a love letter to home.Photograph: Joe Plimmer/Guardian pictures/Universal MusicI start with this particularly poignant conversation with the Sudanese-British artist Elmiene,touching on themes of displacement, war, the comfort of music, gathering in celebration, and the connective tissue of culture. I think about it often. And how this young man, brought up in the UK but constantly replenishing from the well of his origin country of Sudan, did not become estranged from either, but fused them into a love letter to home. “I’m here in LA or New York and at the same time my grandmother’s hearing bullets and grenades,” Elmiene explains. “Is this where I should have been? What am I doing being a fucking musician? I feel like a clown sometimes.”How Brazil celebrates its Black heritageView image in fullscreen‘Comfortable in our own skin’ … Black Consciousness day highlights the importance of Afro-Brazilian culture.Photograph: Dario Oliveira/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockI learned a huge amount from thisconversation with our correspondentin South America, Tiago Rogero. Rogero is a journalist with an academic’s intellect, and so his approach to the news is always grounded in prodigious historical context and sharp political insight. Here, he tells me about how Brazil’s Black population, the largest outside Africa, celebrates its history while navigating the challenges of present day Brazil. “We fight for the right to feel comfortable in our own skin, our own cities, in our own country. We are the ones who literally built this country and we should be the ones who own it.”Michelle Obama 2.0View image in fullscreenFallible vulnerability … Michelle Obama’s journey is one of historical note.Illustration: Joe Plimmer/Guardian Pictures/Toby Melville/ReutersIn one of our most popular editions, I tracedMichelle Obama’s transformation from toweringpolitical icon to relatable podcast auntie. But her journey maps out on to a larger historical moment, one where her embodiment of “girlboss” feminism and “Black Girl Magic” lost steam to give us a more vulnerable, fallible, and tremendously more likeable Michelle. “What happened that eight years that we were in the White House? We got out alive; I hope we made the country proud. But what happened tome?”Dancing on the streets of BarbadosView image in fullscreenElectric liberation … Crop Over festival provided the backdrop for a deep exploration of Barbados.Photograph: Graham BelleWhen our Jason Okundayewent to Barbadosto participate in Crop Over festival, it is no exaggeration to say that he returned to the office a changed man. His dispatch not only covers the political and economic transformation of Barbados, but also reveals that electric shock of recognition that comes from travelling within the Black diaspora. “It is almost cliche to say that dancing in the street is a liberating experience but, as someone who, admittedly, can be uptight, the parade completely unravelled me and released me from all inhibitions.”Caribbean Cuisineskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was simultaneously; a recipe book, a record of history through ingredients, and a recognition of the role cuisine plays in anchoring identity and preserving memory. It made me wish someone would do something similar for Sudanese food (spoiler,someone did. Stay tuned!).As Sakarah tells me: “When an elder passes, they go with all their knowledge, so it’s important to archive things for the purposes of preservation”.Nigeria’s Super FalconsView image in fullscreenBewildering chaos … opponents had no chance against the brilliance of the Super Falcons.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty ImagesThis year’sWomen’s Africa Cup of Nations had itall. A high drama final, social media stars, and, as ever, politics trying to steal the valour of sports. The Guardian’s West Africa correspondent, Eromo Egbejule, talked me through the reasons for the Nigerian team’s superpower after they won their tenth trophy. His expert diagnosis as a Nigerian himself? The team’s strength is in its mental edge. “Nigerians thrive in chaos,” Eromo suggests, half in jest and half with a sort of national pride, in reference to a playing style that bewilders and scatters the strategic plans of their opponents.And on that note, The Long Wave is looking forward to covering the men’sAfrica Cup of Nations, which kicks off in December, and is already the subject of hectic excitement and speculation on the continent.

Conservatives have not yet clarified central aspects of the policy including what benefits would count towards losing indefinite leave to remain, and if families would be split up.Lam told the Sunday Times: “There are also a large number of people in this country who came here legally, but in effect shouldn’t have been able to do so. It’s not the fault of the individuals who came here, they just shouldn’t have been able to do so.“They will also need to go home. What that will leave is a mostly but not entirely culturally coherent group of people.”We’re interested to hear from people in the UK with indefinite leave to remain who could be affected by this new policy proposal, and how they feel about it.Share your experienceShare your thoughts on the proposal to revoke the right to remain of thousands of legally settled residents in the UK, and how this may affect you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

With the army having abandoned El Fasher, the RSF now holds all five of Darfur’s regional capitals, while fighting continues in the southern region of Kordofan.El Fasher, once a city of more than 1 million people, has been under siege by the RSF since May 2024. In August that year, famine was declared in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, south of the city. In April, the RSFkilled as many as 2,000 peoplewhen it seized the camp, which at the time housed 500,000 people.Experts had also been warning that an RSF takeover of El Fasher would most likely be a repeat of its capture of Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, in 2023. The group killed as many as 15,000 civilians then, mostly from non-Arab groups.Former children’s hospitalThe RSF grew out of theJanjaweed Arab militias, which were accused of committing genocide of African ethnic groupsunder the orders of former president Omar al-Bashirin Darfur in 2003.In January, the US governmentformally declared that the RSF had committed genocide. Many Sudanese people still refer to the RSF as the Janjaweed.On Tuesday, the Joint Forces, a coalition of armed groups allied with Sudan’s military, said the RSF had executed more than 2,000 unarmed civilians since taking El Fasher.The RSF’s leader,Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, admitted there had been “abuses” by his forces, in his first comments since the fall of El Fasher, posted on Wednesday on Telegram. Dagalo said an investigation had been opened, without providing further details.The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab analysed satellite imagery of the hospital on Monday 27 and Tuesday 28 October. On Tuesday, three clusters of white objects and “reddish discoloration on the ground” appeared next to the hospital, having not been there the day before. In two of the clusters, the objects were 1.1-1.9 metres long, while the size of the objects in the third group could not be measured, the lab said in areport.The report also found “evidence consistent with mass killing” at an RSF detention site at a former children’s hospital in the east of El Fasher, as well as continued “systematic killing” at the east of the city’s earth walls, originally built as a defence mechanism by the army and then reinforced by the RSF.It is not yet possible to determine exactly how many people have been killed by the RSF in El Fasher, said Caitlin Howarth, the director of conflict analytics at the Yale lab. She added: “We’re not looking at small numbers, we’re looking at dozens and hundreds and, eventually, there will be thousands.”Civilians who made it out of El Fasher have reported being stripped of belongings and extorted for ransom by RSF fighters, with many women reporting being sexually assaulted. It is likely that many have died in the desert, trying to reach displacement camps, Howarth said, adding that the true number may never be known.The Associated Press spoke to witnesses who said RSF fighters went house to house, beating and shooting at people, including women and children. Many civilians died of gunshot wounds in the streets, some while trying to flee to safety, they said.“It was a like a killing field. Bodies everywhere and people bleeding and no one to help them,” Tajal-Rahman, a man in his late 50s, said by phone from Tawila, a displacement camp about 37 miles (60km) west of El Fasher that now houses more than 650,000 people.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsSudanMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Internet service was disrupted across the country, the global monitor NetBlocks said. “Live network data show a nationwide disruption … corroborating reports of a digital blackout,” itposted on X.Hassan, a former vice-president who took office after the death of her predecessor, John Magufuli, in 2021, has left nothing to chance for her first presidential test.Opponents from the two main opposition parties in the east African country have been disqualified and government critics have been abducted, killed or arrested.Analysts say they expect voter apathy, possible unrest over the stifling of opposition voices and the further entrenchment of Hassan and the ruling CCM party.“Tanzania will never be the same after this election,” said Deus Valentine, the chief executive of the Center for Strategic Litigation, a Tanzania-based nonprofit organisation. “We are either entering a completely new paradigm or level of impunity, or we are entering a completely new level of civil defiance. Something is going to give.”View image in fullscreenPeople lined up to cast their votes at polling stations in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday.Photograph: Emmanuel Herman/ReutersHassan started her tenure by undoing some of Magufuli’s authoritarian and repressive policies, including by ending a ban on political rallies and making reconciliatory moves with the opposition. Along the way, she gained local and international approval.But she later backtracked and her administration has been accused of overseeing a grim return to the repression of the past, dashing hopes of lasting change.In June, after the reporteddisappearance and tortureof two activists, Boniface Mwangi of Kenya and Agather Atuhaire of Uganda, UN expertscalled on the Tanzanian governmentto “immediately stop the enforced disappearance of political opponents, human rights defenders and journalists”.The experts said more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance had been recorded in Tanzania since 2019.Africa’s children: 20 years on, what happened to the millennium babies?Read moreA wave of abductions in the lead-up to the election has increased public anger against Hassan. One of those taken was Humphrey Polepole, a CCM insider who had resigned from his role as ambassador to Cuba and became a vocal critic of the government, CCM and Hassan’s leadership. His family said he was abducted by unknown individuals early this month.In June, Tanzanian policedismissedclaims of increasing abductions and disappearances, claiming some were staged. Hassan has in the past ordered an investigation into abduction reports but the findings have not been made public.A crackdown on opposition parties has intensified in recent months. In April, Tundu Lissu, the vice-chair of the leading opposition party, Chadema, was arrested and charged with treason and cybercrime offences. His party, which has led calls for a boycott of the election unless electoral systems are reformed, was later disqualified from participating.Last month Luhaga Mpina, the leader of ACT-Wazalendo, another opposition party, was also disqualified, meaning Hassan will contest only lesser-known opponents from minor parties.View image in fullscreenACT-Wazalendo supporters at a rally in Zanzibar on Sunday.Photograph: ReutersNicodemus Minde, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies, said at a seminar organised by the institute: “The political landscape going into the election remains sharply polarised, with opposition leaders facing legal harassment and civic space that has been constrained.”He said the absence of Chadema and ACT-Wazalendo from the ballot had made this election “arguably the least competitive” since the reintroduction of multiparty politics in 1992.CCM and its predecessor Tanu have ruled the country since independence in 1961, making it one of the longest-ruling political forces in Africa.Hassan’s administration has pointed to plaudits for Tanzania’s economic growth and low inflation under her watch. She is campaigning on promises to strengthen healthcare and education and provide economic empowerment to uplift lives and foster inclusive growth.“In our current and forthcoming manifestos, we are focusing on the people,” she said at a campaign rally in the eastern district of Temeke last week. “Our goal is to make sure that every Tanzanian has a chance to participate meaningfully in the nation’s economic growth.”View image in fullscreenSchoolchildren walk past a billboard for Hassan in Arusha.Photograph: APAmong those being allowed to run against CCM is Salum Mwalimu, a running mate of Lissu during the 2000 presidential election. He is running for the Chaumma party, which is made up of many Chadema defectors.Mwalimu’s campaign promises include reforms to government systems, including creating a new constitution. “Tanzanians should expect great change from our party, which is committed to transforming the country,” he said at the national electoral commission in August, when he went to collect presidential nomination forms.Observers say Hassan’s opponents lack the resources and name recognition to compete with the countrywide party machinery that CCM has built over the decades and benefited from to entrench its rule.In the 2020 presidential election, Magufuli won with 84.4% of the vote and Lissu was second with 13.04%.More than 37 million people are eligible to vote. The election encompasses separate votes for the president, MPs and local politicians.Explore more on these topicsTanzaniaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I am banned,” Soyinka said.The US embassy in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, said it could not comment on individual cases, citing confidentiality rules.The Trump administration has made visa revocations a hallmark of its wider crackdown on immigration, notably targeting university students who were outspoken about Palestinian rights.Soyinka said he had recently compared Trump to Uganda’s Amin, something he said Trump “should be proud of”.“Idi Amin was a man of international stature, a statesman, so when I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment,” Soyinka said. “He’s been behaving like a dictator.”The 91-year-old playwright behind Death and the King’s Horseman has taught at and been awarded honours from top US universities including Harvard and Cornell.His latest novel, Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth, a satire about corruption in Nigeria, was published in 2021. Soyinka described the book as his “gift to Nigeria”in an interiviewwith the Guardian.In February, the Crucible theatre in Sheffieldstaged Death and the King’s Horseman.Soyinka left the door open to accepting an invitation to the United States should circumstances change, but added: “I wouldn’t take the initiative myself because there’s nothing I’m looking for there. Nothing.”He went on to criticise the ramped-up arrests of undocumented immigrants in the country.“This is not about me,” Soyinka said. “When we see people being picked off the street – people being hauled up and they disappear for a month … old women, children being separated. So that’s really what concerns me.”Trump’s crackdown has seen national guard troops deployed to US cities and citizens temporarily detained as part of aggressive raids, as well as the curtailing of legal means of entry.Explore more on these topicsWole SoyinkaNigeriaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationAfricaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

By the early hours of Wednesday the public prosecutor said the death toll had risen to 132 – higher than during São Paulo’s notorious Carandiru prison massacre in 1992, when 111 prisoners lost their lives.Between 4.15am and 9am, when government body collectors finally arrived, the Guardian witnessed pickup trucks delivering dozens of corpses to a square in Vila Cruzeiro named after Saint Luke the Evangelist.0:52Brazilian police raid Rio favelas in deadliest operation against gangs – video“I’ve never seen anything like this … I still haven’t managed to comprehend what has happened. I feel empty. I have no words,” said Raull Santiago, a favela activist, as another cargo of corpses arrived, sending local women scrambling in search of their missing husbands, brothers or sons.Many, perhaps all of the dead men – most seemingly in their late teens, 20s and 30s – are likely to have been members of the local drug faction, the Red Command, which Tuesday’s operation was intended to target. Most of the corpses were unclothed but a few wore ghillie suits, camouflage clothing used by snipers, hunters and nature photographers to conceal themselves in foliage.View image in fullscreenPeople search woodland for bodies.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianBut there was fury among the scores of people who had flocked to the plaza and who claimed police had summarily executed the young men instead of detaining them. “Irrespective of whether these people were involved in the local drug trade or not, we don’t have the death penalty in Brazil … They should have been arrested,” Santiago said.“Murderers! Murderers!” cried Cida Santana, recalling how her son, Fabio, had messaged her at about 3pm on Tuesday to tell her he had been shot in the foot and was trying to surrender to police.Sixteen hours later, Fabio’s corpse was shrouded under a blood-stained floral rug with what looked like knife wounds to his chest. “My God! Work a miracle, God!” Santana begged, as she collapsed on to the ground beside her child.But there was to be no resurrection for Santana’s son, nor for the dozens of other bodies lined up beside him outside a sushi restaurant with bullet wounds to their limbs, torsos and heads. One had been decapitated, the person’s head stashed inside an olive green pouch that was placed on the ground. Several of the men had badly broken bones or what looked like puncture wounds in their flesh.View image in fullscreenCida Santana lost her son, Fabio, in the raid.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianAt times, as pickup trucks continued to deliver the dead, a stunned silence fell over the throng. No one – not the veteran crime reporters, nor the gangland preachers, nor the battle-weary favela residents – had ever seen bloodshed on this scale. Until this week, Rio’s deadliest police operation had beena 2021 raidon another Red Command stronghold, Jacarezinho, when 28 people were killed.“It’s surreal,” said Antônio Carlos Costa, a church leader and human rights campaigner, calling for the immediate removal of Rio’s governor, Cláudio Castro, who is an ally of Brazil’s former far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.Costa called the killings “a historic humiliation” for Brazil on the eve of next month’s Cop climate summit in the Amazon city of Belém.At other moments, onlookers exploded in rage as they took in the nightmarish scene. Shell-shocked friends and relatives of the deceased ripped off the sheets covering their mangled bodies and demanded that journalists film the butchery to show the world.“Help us, please!” implored Cláudia Silva, 53, shaking with rage as she denounced what she and others called “a genocide”. “When they come in here, they kill even the rats,” she said of the police.“This was a slaughter, not an operation. They came here to kill,” said Santana as she sat on a blood-covered bin liner next to her son’s corpse.“In 30 years working [in the favelas] this is the greatest act of savagery, the biggest massacre I have seen,” said Flávia Pinheiro Fróes, a lawyer who had come to support the families of the dead.View image in fullscreenFlávia Pinheiro Fróes, a lawyer, joins the devastated family and friends of the dead.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianCastro continued to defend the operation amid a growing chorus of outrage, including from the UN’s human rights office which said it was horrified by the killings. Rio’s governor celebrated “a harsh blow” to the heavily-armed drug traffickers who have seized control of many of Rio’s hundreds of favelas over the past 40 years. “The only victims yesterday were the police,” Castro said of the four officers killed during Tuesday’s intense gun battles with criminals he called “narco-terrorists”.As the governor spoke, Edmar Augusto, a priest with a purple stole draped over his shoulders, sprinkled holy water on the more than 50 bodies that had accumulated at the entrance to the favela.View image in fullscreenEdmar Augusto sprinkles holy water over the bodies of young men.Photograph: Alan Lima/The Guardian“We don’t want war. We want peace,” Augusto, 50, told the favela’s mourners, his voice breaking with emotion. “So many families are crying. And I want to cry with them. Society cannot stay silent,” the priest bellowed, staring skywards to recite the Lord’s prayer.As he waited for another car-load of bodies to arrive, Correia, the community leader, recalled how two decades earlier a group of local evangelical missionaries had warned that the favela would one day suffer a momentous bloodbath. “We didn’t believe them. We never believed it would happen,” he said. “[But] they prophesised this, and today it has come to pass.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilRio de JaneiroAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Though this is still high by global standards, it has dropped to a levelArgentinahad not seen in years.On the other hand, his policy of burning through dollar reserves to keep the peso overvalued has already led to the International Monetary Fund lending $20bn in April (of which $14bn has been disbursed) and the recent USbailout.The surge in imports is severely affecting Argentina’s local industry and commerce. Since Milei took office in December 2023, people’s purchasing power has fallen sharply, real wages have declined, more than 200,000 jobs have been lost, and about 18,000 businesses have closed.For Hernán Letcher, director of the Centre for Argentine Political Economy (CEPA), the election result was a surprise not only because opinion polls had not predicted it but also because, “when you look at the social indicators, none of them has shown or ever had a positive performance”.“We often say in Argentina that a cheap dollar wins elections,” he added.Letcher also attributed the result to falling inflation, fear of returning to a past of deep economic crises and “anti-Peronism”.“A large part of society has a very stigmatised view of Peronism,” said Letcher, referring to the political movement that emerged under three-time Argentinian president Gen Juan Domingo Perón.According to sociologist Juan Gabriel Tokatlian, Milei’s campaign succeeded in spreading the idea that if he did not win, the economy would collapse. “That created a sort of panic among many people who don’t want another devaluation, who know the cost is extremely high and therefore preferred to avoid a catastrophic scenario,” he said.Tokatlian noted that within Peronism there had been some hope that Trump’s interference might backfire, as it had in Canada’s elections and in Brazil, where tariffs imposed by the US president ended up boosting Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s popularity.“But in Canada and Brazil those were backlashes caused by Trump’s punitive measures. Here in Argentina, however, he was generous … and for some – not many, but for some – that support was at least the assurance that there wouldn’t be a catastrophic economic crisis,” said Tokatlian.Aquiles Ferrario, 82, who owns a bookshop in central Buenos Aires specialising in imported art and design books, voted for Peronism on Sunday and said he found it “almost unbelievable that our people voted more guided by fear than by fury towards a government that does not hesitate to commit, spread and promote the most atrocious attitudes.”“What worries me is the future of our children, grandchildren and their successors – that they might end up living openly in a colony of the US, which I believe is the status that corresponds to a country whose economic and geopolitical policy depends entirely on the US and on a figure such asDonald Trump,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaJavier MileiDonald TrumpAmericasTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to hit Jamaica since records began in 1851,made landfall at about midday local time on Tuesday. With winds reaching 185mph and torrential rains, it knocked out power lines, cut off the internet, and demolished buildings; the death toll and extent of the damage are still unknown.The storm has already hit Haiti and the Dominican Republic; though it was at one stage downgraded to a tropical storm, now it has strengthened again and is expected to arrive imminently in Cuba, where more than 700,000 people have been evacuated. “The reports that are coming in are catastrophic,” Jamaican energy and transport minister Daryl Vaz told Sky News. “Not very much survives a Category 5 hurricane, in terms of infrastructure.”Melissa is unprecedented in Jamaica – but it is the third category 5 hurricane, the highest designation on the Saffir-Simpson scale measuring wind speed, since hurricane season in the Atlantic region began in June. For the very latest,head to the live blog. For today’s newsletter, I spoke toNatricia Duncan, the Guardian’s Caribbean correspondent in Kingston, about the devastation Melissa has left in its wake. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesEconomy| Rachel Reeves has said Britaincan defy gloomy economic forecastsafter the fiscal watchdog infuriated ministers by predicting a productivity downgrade would leave her with a £20bn gap to fill in her forthcoming budget.Sudan|Ethnically motivated mass killingsand other atrocities are being reported from El Fasher after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces took control of the city in Sudan’s western Darfur region over the weekend.UK news| Downing Street has defended the prospect of paying moreto house asylum seekers in disused barracks instead of hotels, arguing that quelling public disquiet was worth the extra cost. No 10 said that “communities don’t want asylum seekers housed in hotels, and neither does the government”.Middle East|Israeli warplanes struck Gaza on Tuesday night, shortly after Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, ordered the military to carry out “powerful strikes” in Gaza, in the most serious test of the increasingly shaky US-brokered ceasefire.Television| Prunella Scales, the actor best known for playing Sybil Fawlty in the classic comedy series Fawlty Towers,has died aged 93. Scales, who was married to fellow actor Timothy West, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2013.In depth: ‘There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a category 5 hurricane’View image in fullscreenWaves lash the shore in Kingston, Jamaica, as Hurricane Melissa approached on Tuesday.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APIn an advisory message on Hurricane Melissapublished yesterday, the National Hurricane Center in the US painted a bleak picture of its likely consequences. For anything in the path of the ring of thunderstorms around the eye of the hurricane, known as the eyewall, “total structural failure is likely, especially in higher elevation areas”, it said. “Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely … Peak storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13ft above ground level, near and to the east of where the centre of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.”Here’s a useful visual guideto how the storm developed.At a press briefing, the Jamaican prime minister, Andrew Holness, asked the public to heed the severity of the threat. “You have been warned. It’s now up to you to use that information to make the right decision. I have been on my knees in prayer.”For many Jamaicans, Natricia Duncan said, last year’sHurricane Beryl– which was less severe but did damage costed at about $200m – is fresh in the memory. “It’s only a year ago,” she said. ‘“Everybody has a very recent memory of how destructive the impact was, and they know how much worse this one could be. So people are really frightened.”Why is Hurricane Melissa so dangerous?The winds generated by the hurricane are exceptionally fast and destructive – but the storm itself has moved very slowly, at 2-4mph. That is a disastrous combination: it means the storm lingers, doing more damage before it moves on.“This is a dire situation unfolding in slow motion. A major hurricane slowly crawling toward an island with powerful winds, extreme rainfall, and damaging storm surge is a perilous situation for a place like Jamaica,”AccuWeather’s chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. “Slow-moving major hurricanes often go down in history as some of the deadliest and most destructive storms on record.”Natricia pointed tothe devastation wrought by Hurricane Dorianin the Bahamas in 2019, where “it just sits over a country and has the opportunity to do maximum damage”. There is a psychological impact of that slow pace, she added. “You know it’s coming, and you prepare for it, and you deal with it. But when it’s moving so slowly, that extra time means that the uncertainty and anticipation keeps growing and growing. And there are constant updates that seem to get worse and worse.”What is the extent of the damage so far?Even before the storm reached Jamaica, powerful winds brought down power lines in Saint Elizabeth parish on the south-west of the island. The most vulnerable areas were communities in Jamaica’s mountains and hills, where winds were expected to reach speeds up to 30% greater than on lower ground.With seven deaths already reported across theCaribbean, including three in Jamaica, the Kingston authorities did not confirm any official toll overnight. But, Natricia said, “the bottom line is that the country is facing a very tragic and difficult situation, especially in the Saint Elizabeth area. I’ve been trying to reach people there and it hasn’t been possible. They really, really need help.”In total, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) estimated that about 1.5 million people could be affected in Jamaica alone, a number that an IFRC official said was a potential underestimate. The Jamaican authorities said they expected about 50,000 people to be displaced. It is hoped that airports can be reopened on Thursday to allow the delivery of emergency supplies.Minister of local government Desmond Mckenzie said that St Elizabeth was “under water” and that the damage there was extensive. He also warned of severe conditions in Clarendon parish on the southern coast, and said some families were trapped in their homes with rescue not yet possible. About 15,000 people are in shelters, and more than half a million are without electricity. The storm also damaged four hospitals and left one without power, forcing officials to evacuate 75 patients.How well prepared is Jamaica for this kind of storm?Holness said there are 850 shelters across the island, enough for more than 20,000 people. And 50 generators are available to help secure clean water supplies.But officials have warned some shelters are overcrowded, with others in safer areas less full, and said that “every drop will count” to maintain access to water. Many of the shelters are school buildings that were not designed as evacuation centres, and there are reports that some residents arrived to find them closed.Natricia spoke to some people living in Port Royal, one severely affected area, who were reluctant to evacuate. “Even though it’s unprecedented, some are wary of shelters, maybe they’ve had stuff stolen or felt unsafe in the past,” she said. “Even among people who aren’t moving there’s an element of fear, of not wanting to let go of the familiarity of their homes.”While there are building codes in place that seek to mandate safer construction, there is a large informal building sector in Jamaica where such codes are unlikely to be followed. “You have people building homes by putting together what they can find - maybe they’re making a roof out of zinc sheeting,” Natricia said. “When I think about how much of that there is in Jamaica, I worry that 900 shelters doesn’t seem to be enough for the potential need.”Meanwhile, in Haiti, which has also been hit by the storm, the World Food Program (WFP) said it had only been able to make about 15% of the food it would normally provide available. It blamed a drop in contributions from donor countries now focused on Gaza and Ukraine. Cuba’s president, Miguel Díaz-Canel,denied claimsthat an ongoing economic crisis had limited his government’s ability to act.In Jamaica, there was a sense that once as much as possible had been done, the only option was to wait. Holness said: “There is no infrastructure in the region [of the Caribbean] that can withstand a category 5. The question now is the speed of recovery.”What are the key factors in the recovery operation?Much of the work for the aftermath is already under way. Many shelters are designated as distribution hubs for aid once the storm passes, while supplies such as food rations and medical supplies have been pre-positioned by the Red Cross and WFP.There are so-called strike teams ready to reconnect hospitals and water plants to the grid as quickly as possible, and aid agencies such as the WFP have mapped air and sea corridors to deliver further supplies. Cholera-prevention and water-purification kits have been placed in regional hospitals, and Jamaica has triggered the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility to ensure emergency funds.While all those measures will be important, there is also a clear sense of practical limits on what can be prepared in advance, Natricia said. “I interviewed a minister who said ‘How do you prepare for a category five? What do you do when it’s that severe?’ I really feel for Caribbean governments because it is a very hard thing to find an answer to. The infrastructure you built is gone and you still owe for it and it plays out again and again.”Is the hurricane related tothe climate crisis?In short: yes. As Oliver Milmanwrites in this piece, there is a likely link between the speed at which Melissa grew into a category 5 hurricane and the rapid heating of the world’s oceans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at the science nonprofit Climate Central,told NPRthat hot ocean temperatures were made 500 to 700 times more likely by the climate crisis.With two storms in quick succession, people may now be more aware that similar disasters in the future are more likely, Natricia said. “People may start to rethink how they live. But it’s also a fact that not everybody has the luxury of making those choices. We know the stark reality in the Caribbean now is that we can have a day’s notice that some monster is going to come that humans can’t really match.”What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenDon McCullin.Photograph: Nadav Kander/The GuardianDon McCullin(above)is 90, and sceptical of the value of his photographs. “I feel as if I’ve been over-rewarded, and I definitely feel uncomfortable about that, because it’s been at the expense of other people’s lives,”he tells Emine Saner. “It’s done absolutely no good at all.” You may have more faith in his work as an act of witness; in any case, the images are extraordinary.ArchieCampaignerKwajo Tweneboa’s pieceon whereAwaab’s law, which came into force on Monday, will fall short is a really important read in a time where we don’t talk about housing rights enough.Poppy Noor, deputy newsletters editorHello!

Today’s agreement shows that through international cooperation – not shouting from the sidelines – we can deliver for the UK and for working people.”Starmer was invited to visit Vietnam by Lam – who spoke via a interpreter – in order to “enrich the bilateral relationship between the two countries”.In this government’s first year, 35,000 individuals with no legal right to remain were removed, including 5,200 foreign national offenders – a 14% increase compared with the previous year.The BBC has raised concerns about one of its journalists, a Vietnamese national, who has beenunable to leave the countryfor several months after travelling to the country to visit family and renew their passport.Human Rights Watch has identified more than 170 political prisoners who are under arrest for practising their basic human rights, ranging from activists to online bloggers.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationKeir StarmerVietnamAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC journalist was in Vietnam for a routine passport renewal and to visit family,” the media outlet said in a statement.“We are deeply concerned about our journalist’s wellbeing and urge the authorities to allow them to leave immediately, providing them with their renewed passport so they can return to work,” it added.Vietnam remains an extremely restrictive environment for journalists, who cannot operate freely in the one-party state, controlled by the country’s Communist party. Domestic media is highly censored and dissenters are regularly jailed.In May, the print edition of the Economist, which featured Tô Lâm on its cover, wasbanned in the country, part of a long series of acts of media censorship by authorities.Phil Robertson, the director the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates, said that when Lâm was in London, he needed to be met “with clear and unrelenting demands” that the journalist be given their passport and allowed to immediately fly out to Bangkok.“Failure to act now will likely condemn this journalist to face arrest and worse at the hands of Vietnam’s ministry of public security,” he added. “Prime minister Starmer needs to make it very clear to Gen Tô Lâm that the UK-Vietnam relationship cannot be bolstered on the back of blatant violations of media freedom and human rights.”Officials in Vietnam show little tolerance for dissent and maintain tight control on the media, with the press freedom groupReporters sans Frontièresranking it as among the worst in the world for media freedoms – 173rd out of an index of 180 countries. The group describes Vietnam as “one of the world’s biggest prisons for journalists”.The Vietnamese government has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsVietnamBBCPress freedomAsia PacificNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

The agency said Williams stole the material over a three-year period while working for a US defence contractor, including information on national security-focused software.That software was meant to be sold exclusively to the US government and its allies. But the justice department said the Russian broker Williams sold the secrets to advertises itself as a reseller of cyber-tools to customers, including the Russian government.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailEach of the two charges carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to US$250,000. The US government said it would also seek the forfeiture of property in the amount of US$1.3m (A$2m).“America’s national security is NOT FOR SALE, especially in an evolving threat landscape where cybercrime poses a serious danger to our citizens,” Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, said in the department’s statement.Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An official had toldthe ABCit was aware of the charges and stood available to offer consular assistance “should it be requested”.The Australian Defence Force (ADF) said it was aware of reports of the case, saying they were taken “very seriously” but that it would not comment on individual cases.“Defence has layered security controls and procedures to protect our people, information, capabilities and bases,” a spokesperson said.John Eisenberg, the assistant attorney general for national security in the US, said Williams had “betrayed the United States and his employer by first stealing and then selling intelligence-related software to a foreign broker that touted its ties to Russia and other foreign governments”.“His conduct was deliberate and deceitful, imperiling our national security for the sake of personal gain,” Eisenberg said in the department’s statement. “Today’s guilty plea reflects our commitment to ensuring that insiders who abuse their positions of trust face serious consequences.”US officials added the stolen secrets cost Williams’ employer more than US$35m in losses and allowed “non-allied foreign cyber-actors to obtain sophisticated cyber exploits that were likely used against numerous unsuspecting victims”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News USFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have said goodbye to the politics of negativity, of hate, of ‘it can’t be done.’“Let’s also turn the page on Wilders and work on a splendid future for our beautiful country … in the coming years, we will do everything we can to show all Dutch people … that politics and the government can be there for them again,” he added.Even if final results put the Freedom party in first place, Wilders’ short-lived period in power afterthe PVV’s shock victory in 2023seems over for now: all major mainstream parties have ruled out joining a coalition with his party.The election was triggered byWilders pulling the PVV out of the governmentin June, less than a year after it took office, after the partners refused to endorse his radical anti-refugee plans, widely seen as unworkable or illegal or both.Wilders acknowledged his party was unlikely to be part of the new government, but said his decision to quit was justified. “The voter has spoken. We had hoped for a different outcome but we stuck to our guns,” he posted on social media.Under the proportional Dutch system, 0.67% of the vote yields one MP, a bar that was cleared by 15 of the 27 parties contesting the election – which included parties for the over-50s, for youth, for animals, for a universal basic income and for sport.That fragmentation means no single party ever wins a majority, and the country has been governed by coalitions – made up, in its three most recent governments, of four parties – for more than a century. The next government will be no different.“When it comes to forming a new government in the Netherlands, election results are not the end, they’re the start,” said Rem Korteweg of the Clingendael Institute in The Hague. “The cards have been shuffled. Now the negotiations can begin.”The centre-left GreenLeft/Labour alliance (GL/PvdA) had a poor night, finishing third with 20 seats – five fewer than in the outgoing parliament and than polls had predicted – prompting the party leader, Frans Timmermans, to step down.View image in fullscreenFrans Timmermans makes a resignation speech in Rotterdam.Photograph: Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesThe veteran former European Commission vice-president said he took “full responsibility” for the result, adding: “It is time for me to take a step back and hand over the leadership of our movement to the next generation.”But the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDA), who also campaigned on a return to “decent” and “responsible” politics in the Netherlands after the most extreme government in the country’s recent history, nearly quadrupled their seat tally to 19.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The VVD leader,Dilon Yeşilgöz, has “repeatedly said she wants a rightwing coalition”, noted Armida van Rij of the Centre for European Reform.An alternative, more rightwing constellation might bring in the radical right JA21, which gained eight seats to finish on nine. Unlike the VVD, all other outgoing coalition members lost heavily, with one, New Social Contract, failing to win any seats at all.In a campaign dominated by migration, healthcare costs and the Netherlands’ acute housing crisis, Wilders’ PVV had led consistently in the polls until days before the election, when the mainstream centre-left to moderate right parties caught up.View image in fullscreenD66 leader Rob Jetten greets the exit poll.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockWilders had said “democracy would be dead” if the PVV ended up as the largest party and was shut out of government. His opponents said first place did not guarantee government and any coalition with a majority is democratic.Coalition-building in the Netherlands can take months. After the vote, aninformateurtests possible options that could command a majority. Potential partners then negotiate an agreement and must undergo a confidence vote in parliament.Whatever the future cabinet’s complexion, it will need to act. Despite the campaign’s focus on migration, voters have consistently said the country’s biggest problem is its housing shortage, estimated at about 400,000 homes in a nation of 18 million.Unless that question – and other pressing issues, including soaring healthcare costs – are properly addressed, analysts warn that the Netherlands’ apparent return to what looks like a more commonsense form of government could prove short-lived.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropeGeert WildersnewsShareReuse this content"

Entrusted with ministerial responsibilities, can they deliver the radical solutions that they often preach? Or do they, sooner or later, when faced with complex policy dilemmas, end up self-destructing, leaving an even bigger mess in their wake?That is the questionDutch votershad to weigh on Wednesday after a tumultuous two-year experiment in which Geert Wilders’ far-right Freedom Party (PVV) entered a rightwing coalition to run the Netherlands for the first time.At a time when populist parties are vying for power in much of Europe, including France, Germany and the UK, but may have reached their limitsin Hungary, the Dutch general election could be a signpost for Europe more broadly.It is likely to take months of negotiations before the exact shape of the next multi-party governing coalition becomes clear. But exit polls suggested far-right disappointment, with the centrist party, D66, on course to narrowly win more seats. Mainstream parties vowed during the campaign to exclude Wilders from government in any case – whatever the PVV’s eventual score.That doesn’t mean the far right’s “the Netherlands is full” narratives are out of favour. As Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist who specialises in political extremism,pointed out in the Guardian,the threat of a firewall around Wilders was not driven by revulsion at his ideology, but by anger at his “immature” posturing andpulling outof government after 11 months. That is what triggered this week’s general election.Moreover, his anti-immigrant themes were adopted with gusto as the political centre ground shifted rightward. Even leftwing politicians echoed the scapegoating of refugees during the campaign. No wonder fear runs through migrant and minority communitiesas Ashifa Kassam reported.‘On the outside, screaming in’Yet, on the issues that voters said mattered most to them: housing, healthcare and the asylum system, the experiment with far-right rule was, objectively, a total flop. The PVV has nothing to show.“The liberal-populist-far right coalition failed to address any of these challenges, and in some cases exacerbated them,” says Armida van Rij, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank.View image in fullscreenVVD party leader Dilan Yeşilgöz casts her vote.Photograph: Sem van der Wal/EPAAnger (includingamong younger voters) about the national housing shortage helped Wilders to a seismic victory in the last election in 2023. Two years on the crisis is unsolved, with more than80,000 peopleneeding homes. It has simply become a bigger stick with which to beat asylum seekers, casually accused of jumping waiting lists.“The coalition did nothing to address the housing crisis; there are no other new laws, reforms or achievements to speak of,” says Koen Vossen, political historian and the author of The Power of Populism:Geert Wildersand the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands.“You can drive faster than the 100km/h speed limit on a short stretch of highway in the polders. That is the only thing I can think of that they delivered on.”The firebrand Wilders is ill-suited to governing, Vossen thinks. Although he has been a force in Dutch politics for 20 years, his comfort zone is “on the outside screaming in”.“He lacks an organisation, because he doesn’t want one. He made poor ministerial appointments because he does not trust anyone – he had to cast around for party loyalists but they were amateurs, with no skills or experience.”Give us boringSo after such epic failure, do voters conclude that populist ideologues can’t fix their problems?For Mudde, that question overlooks the broader influence cast by Wilders. “Whatever the eventual outcome, one thing is already clear,” he wrote for the Guardian’s opinion pages. “Despite the far right’s evident failure in governing theNetherlands, it retains a magnetic hold over the country.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And asHeather Stewart noted in a featureabout populists crashing economies globally, failures are not always punished at the ballot box.Yet, ahead of Wednesday’s election, pollsters noted a yearning for a return to stable, middle-of-the-road politics. “You hear it a lot,” says Vossen. “Give us back the boring old Netherlands with a stable government. Give us stable people that can do things.”The Christian Democrat leader Henri Bontenbal even made “boring” his sales pitch in the campaign.Trust destroyedAt the same time, Wilders’ failures are used by newer copycat, far-right parties, to promise that with better organisation, they could achieve the PVV’s goals.More ominously still, perhaps, many Wilders fans blame not incompetence, but his enemies. “Among his core supporters the belief is widespread that he was blocked by the courts, by leftwing judges, by the deep state or whoever,” says Vossen. “This blame game is very Trumpian.”Shutting him out of future coalitions could also be weaponised by the PVV as a repudiation of the popular will, a way to further corrode trust in democracy.Vossen says the Wilders experiment had inflicted lasting damage. “The Netherlands was always a high-trust society, and our politics reflected that. But the last two years destroyed a lot of trust. When people look to the radical right, yes, they see that it has failed, but that has left them feeling even more dissatisfaction with the system.”“It used to be rare to hear anti-institutional sentiment in the Netherlands. But it is now common. The foundations of democracy are being questioned. It is very disturbing.”To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeGeert WildersNetherlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

McGee’s second and third pregnancies had been complicated by health issues. She nearly died at one point and suffered a stroke, and a doctor said any future pregnancies could prove fatal and advised her to take contraception.A 1935 ban on the sale and import of contraceptives, however, made it nearly impossible for her to follow the doctor’s instructions.The couple turned to the UK, placing an order for a diaphragm and spermicide jelly,according to the Irish Times. The package was seized by customs, and they were told that if they attempted to order contraceptives from abroad again, they would face fines or jail time.McGee refused to give in. “I was livid that somebody in government could tell us how to live our lives. I wasn’t going to back down,”she toldthe Irish Examiner in 2022.The couple took their case to the high court, where Seamus, who went by the name of Shay, laid out exactly what was at stake. “I’d prefer to see her use contraceptives than be placing flowers on her grave,” he told a hearing in 1972.View image in fullscreenMary McGee with husband Seamus in 1972.Photograph: Dermot Barry/The_Irish_TimesAfter their legal challenge was struck down, the couple appealed to the supreme court. Four of the five judges ruled in their favour, finding that contraception was a private matter for married couples and that the decision should be free of interference from the state.Their victory resonated across Ireland and around the world, with the couple receiving congratulatory messages from the WorldHealthOrganization and from as far as Hawaii.They also faced anger from some quarters, latertelling mediaof how they had walked out of their parish, never to return, after the priest suggested they had brought the church into disrepute.The couple’s legal battle remains the court’s single most important decision in terms of its political and social consequences, the supreme court justice Gerard Hogan later noted.It was the “legal equivalent of the moon landing” in that it forced the government to gradually shift its stance on contraception, Hogan said at a 2023 conference examining the McGee case and its legacy, inremarks reported by the Irish Times.The decision “shows how one brave woman single-handedly changed the course of Irish social history”, he said, leading to “a social revolution, the consequences of which are still being played out”.As news broke on Wednesdaythat May had died peacefullyat a hospital in Berlin, tributes poured in across social media as people remembered her courage and hailed her as a hero for the women of Ireland.The writer and film director Paul Duanewroteon Bluesky: “How far we’ve come. Now Irish religious conservatism is limited to a few thousand spoiled votes and a lot of airtime on [Irish public broadcaster] RTE. But the country isn’t listening to them any more, thanks to brave women like May McGee.”The writer Fintan O’Toole‬hailed heras “one of the heroines of modern Ireland.”Laura Kelly, a historian of medicine and gender in modern Ireland and professor at the University of Strathclyde,wrote on Bluesky: “May McGee was such a courageous woman and had a huge impact.”Shay McGee died in January 2024.Explore more on these topicsIrelandContraception and family planningHealthEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But, in an apparent appeal to the thieves, she added: “There is still time to give them back.”View image in fullscreenThere has been a heavy police presence outside the museum since the heist.Photograph: Abdul Saboor/ReutersThe treasures were “clearly unsellable” as they were, she said. “Anyone who buys them would be guilty of concealment of stolen goods,” she told journalists, adding she “would like to hope” they would be recovered “for the Louvre and for the nation”.The four-man gang pulled up outside the world’s most visited museum at about 9.30am on 19 October in a stolen furniture removal truck fitted with an extending ladder and lift, in which two climbed to the ornate first-floor Apollo gallery.Wearing hi-vis vests to resemble maintenance workers, they smashed an unsecured window and used disc cutters to slice open two glass display cases before descending in the bucket lift and fleeing on motorbikes driven by the other two men.The heist lasted less than seven minutes, with the two who entered the gallery spending three minutes and 58 seconds inside. They dropped a diamond and emerald-studded crown but fled with eight richly gem-encrusted pieces.The stolen jewels included an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave to his second wife, Marie Louise, and a diadem set with 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds that had once belonged to the empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III.Beccuau said the two suspects – both of whom were arrested last Saturday night, one at Charles de Gaulle airport outsideParis, reportedly as he was trying to catch a flight to Algeria – were believed to be the men who had entered the Apollo gallery.Their DNA had been found on a display case and a scooter used in the getaway, the prosecutor said. She added that it was possible that the gang had numbered more than four men, but there was no indication so far it had benefited from inside help.Beccuau said one of the suspects, an Algerian national, was aged 34, had lived inFrancesince 2010, and was known to police for road traffic offences. The second was aged 39, born in the Paris suburb of Aubervilliers, and had convictions for burglary.The prosecutor said 100 investigators from France’s BRB organised crime squad and a unit specialising in trafficked artworks and cultural goods were “working every day of the week, day and night, in an effort to identify the thieves and recover the jewels”.Investigations were continuing, she said, adding that there was still “plenty of evidence to be examined”. She declined to give any details about the two suspects who remain at large.Earlier on Wednesday, police acknowledged serious shortcomings in the Louvre’s security. The Paris police chief, Patrice Faure, told senators that ageing systems and delays to planned upgrades meant “a technological step has not been taken”.A planned €80m (£70m) security improvement programme would not be completed before the end of the decade, Faure said. The museum’s director, Laurence des Cars,had previously acknowledged security blindspots.Des Cars said the only external security camera installed near the Apollo gallery was pointing in the wrong direction to cover the window. The museum this week transferred some precious jewels to the Bank of France, RTL Radio reported.Explore more on these topicsFranceParisEuropeMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said it had received two bodies from the strike.After the Tuesday night bombardment, Israel said that it was now adhering to the ceasefire again and statements from US officials seemed to indicate they did not consider the ceasefire to have been broken. But Wednesday’s strike cast doubt on Israel’s willingness to comply with the truce, which obligates both parties to stop their attacks.The strikes, some of the bloodiest attacks in the two-year war, killed at least 46 children and 20 women, and injured 200 people, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency. They took place hours after Donald Trump said nothing would jeopardise the ceasefire agreement.Casualties in GazaThe Israeli military released an infographic showing 25 “terrorists” it had killed in Gaza over the past 24 hours, but did not explain the identity of the other 79 people it had killed.The strikes shattered the short-lived relief Palestinians had felt since the start of the ceasefire. Funerals were held for the victims of the latest attacks at hospitals across Gaza on Wednesday. Some had been carried into medical facilities in the arms of loved ones.“These are massacres,” said Haneen Mteir, who lost her sister and nephews and was attending a funeral outside Nasser hospital in southern Gaza. “They burned children while they were asleep,” she told the Associated Press.The Israeli military said in a statement that it would continue to uphold the ceasefire agreement but would respond “firmly to any violation”. The foreign ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, blamedHamasfor the strikes and attributed the high death toll to the group using civilians as human shields.Hamas said the strikes “revealed Israel’s intention to undermine the ceasefire and impose new realities by force”. It said it would continue to adhere to the agreement in a statement issued on Wednesday.The director of humanitarian support and international cooperation at Gaza’s civil defence agency, Dr Mohammed al-Mughir, said: “Among these attacks was the targeting of a cancer patient camp, the Insan camp.”Mohammed al-Munirawi, a reporter forPalestineNewspaper, was among the dead, bringing the number of journalists killed by Israel in Gaza to 256, the territory’s media office said.The death toll was confirmed by an Agence France-Presse (AFP) tally of reports from medical officials at five Gaza hospitals that received the dead and wounded.Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes on Tuesday evening after a firefight between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops, and amid growing anger over Hamas turning over body parts of a hostage whose remains Israeli troops had recovered two years before.The bombardment promptedHamas, which denied responsibility for the gun attack, to delay a planned handover of another hostage’s remains, which had been scheduled for Tuesday night.Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday, said nothing would jeopardise the ceasefire but that Israel “should hit back” if its soldiers were killed. “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back,” he said.The US vice-president, JD Vance, said earlier that the ceasefire was holding despite “skirmishes”.However, Tuesday night’s attack exposed all the frailties of a ceasefire that from the outset has been marred by violence. Before the latest overnight strikes, Gaza’s media office accused Israel of having committed 80 violations since the ceasefire began, killing 97 Palestinians and injuring 230.Qatar’s prime minister and foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said intensive diplomatic efforts were being made to ensure the ceasefire did not collapse. He said that challenges were to be expected and that both sides acknowledged the agreement must hold.The Gaza civil defence spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal described the situation in Gaza as “catastrophic and terrifying”, calling the strikes “a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”. He told AFP: “The Israeli strikes targeted tents for displaced people, homes and the vicinity of a hospital in the strip.”A spokesperson for the IDF, when asked if the strikes were a resumption of the full-scale invasion, said on Tuesday that the military “can’t elaborate on the scale yet”. On Wednesday the IDF said it had reinstated the Gaza ceasefire.The Israeli military published footage of what it said were members of Hamas reburying a body in order to “stage a false discovery” for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which it said was Hamas “attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies”. Hamas has yet to comment on the claims.The video prompted condemnation from the ICRC, which said in a statement that it was “unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged”.The news has enraged Israelis, with the far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich lashing out at Hamas and calling on Netanyahu to resume the war.“Once again, Hamas murders one of our soldiers during a ‘ceasefire,’ and once again, the prime minister chooses to conclude the incident with a ‘measured response’ and an immediate return to the ceasefire, while continuing to allow in ‘humanitarian’ aid, instead of returning to full-scale war,” Ben-Gvir wrote on X.Under the ceasefire agreement, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas is required to return the remains of all Israeli hostages as soon as possible. In exchange, Israel has agreed to hand over 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli.Hamas has so far returned the remains of 15 hostages, with 13 bodies still in the territory. The militant group has said it does not know the precise whereabouts of all the bodies, saying it has lost contact with several of its units that had been holding the captives and were reportedly killed during Israeli bombardments.Although Trump has conceded that some of the bodies are difficult to reach, he said “others they can return now and for some reason they are not”. “It may have to do with the disarming of Hamas,” he added.Israel has made Hamas’s disarmament a central objective, describing it as a key condition for bringing an end to the two-year war.On Sunday, Hamas’s chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the group’s weapons were “tied to the existence of occupation and aggression”. He said: “If the occupation ends, these weapons will be handed over to the state.” It remained unclear whether he was alluding to the still-unformed Palestinian governing authority expected to take over Gaza’s administration once Hamas relinquishes control.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

At least seven people were killed in separate strikes in Gaza City and Khan Younis, including two children, medical sources said.The sudden outbreak of violence was the most significant challenge of the 18-day ceasefire inGaza.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday, US president Donald Trump said “nothing” would jeopardise the ceasefire, but added Israel “should hit back” if its soldiers were killed. “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back,” said Trump.The Israeli military confirmed a soldier’s death on Wednesday.Netanyahu ordered the strikes after a firefight between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops, and amid growing fury overHamasturning over body parts of a hostage whose remains Israeli troops had recovered two years before. The Israeli prime minister called an emergency meeting to discuss what he called Hamas violations of the ceasefire, amid clamour for a return to the war by far-right figures in the Israeli government.The bombardment promptedHamas to delay a planned handover of a hostage’s remains, which had been scheduled for Tuesday night.Israeli media said Hamas militants had attacked Israeli troops in southern Gaza with an anti-tank missile and guns earlier on Tuesday.Hamas denied responsibility for the attack and said in a statement that it remained committed to the ceasefire deal.An Israeli military official told Reuters that the attack violated the ceasefire because it was carried out east of the agreed withdrawal line of Israeli forces.Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, said that Hamas would “pay many times over” for attacking Israeli soldiers and for failing to turn over hostages’ remains. “The attack on IDF soldiers in Gaza today by the Hamas terror organisation crosses a glaring red line to which the IDF will respond with great force,” Katz said in a statement.Israel notified the US before launching the strikes, two US officials told the Associated Press.The ceasefire, which started on 10 October, has held up until now, despite similar incidents of violence in recent weeks. US officials have made it clear they do not want a return to fighting in Gaza and have sent a series of officials to Israel over the past week, inwhat Israeli media has sardonically dubbed “Bibisitting.”The US vice-president, JD Vance, said that he thought the ceasefire would hold despite Tuesday’s fighting. “That’s doesn’t mean there aren’t going to be little skirmishes here and there,” Vance told reporters.Earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu accused Hamas of a “clear violation” of the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire, saying the militant group had returned body parts of a hostage whose remains Israeli troops had recovered two years before.Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hamas is required to return the remains of all Israeli hostages as soon as possible. In exchange, Israel has agreed to hand over 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli. Hamas has yet to return 13 bodies.In a statement on Tuesday, Hamas said that the latest order to strike Gaza would further delay efforts to recover hostages’ remains.Hamas has also accused Israel of violating the ceasefire, with the Gaza media office saying Israel has violated the deal more than 80 times, killing at least 80 people since the truce came into effect.On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Crossaccompanied members of Hamasinside areas of Gaza under the control of the Israeli military to facilitate the search for the bodies, after Donald Trump on Saturday issued a 48-hour ultimatum to return the remains of the dead Israeli hostages “quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action”.In the evening, Hamas’s military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, said it hadreturned the body of an Israeli captive, with the Israeli government later confirming it had received it from the Red Cross.However, on Tuesday, the Israeli health ministry’s National Forensic Institute said there was no match with any of the 13 missing bodies, saying the remains belonged toOfir Tzarfati, whose body was recovered by the IDF in the Gaza Strip in December 2023, less than two months after his abduction.The Israeli military published footage of what it said were members of Hamas reburying a body in order to “stage a false discovery” for the ICRC, which it said was the group “attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies”. Hamas has yet to comment on the claims.The news has enraged Israelis, with the far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich lashing out at Hamas and calling on Netanyahu to resume the war.“The fact that Hamas continues to play games and does not immediately transfer all the bodies of our fallen, is in itself evidence that the terror organisation is still standing,” said Ben-Gvir, the security minister.“Now we don’t need to ‘extract a price from Hamas’ for the violations. We need to exact from it its very existence and destroy it completely, once and for all, in accordance with the central goal defined for the ‘war of revival’ [war in Gaza],” he said, adding: “Mr prime minister, enough hesitation. Give the order.”Smotrich, the finance minister, wrote to Netanyahu calling for “forceful responses” to Hamas’s violations and called for “the destruction of Hamas and the removal of the threat emanating from Gaza toward the citizens of Israel”.It was unclear if the strikes ordered on Gaza would be accompanied by further punitive measures. The Times of Israel said the prime minister was considering moving the yellow line dividing Gaza in two to place more territory under IDF control, or halting the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza.Hamas has so far returned the remains of 15 hostages, with 13 bodies still in the territory.The militant group says it does not know the precise whereabouts of all the bodies, saying it has lost contact with several of its units that had been holding the captives and were reportedly killed during Israeli bombardments.In a separate development on Tuesday, police said Israeli forces had killed three Palestinians they described as members of a “terrorist cell” during a raid near the occupiedWest Bankcity of Jenin.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHamasGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Cai has been described as the top lieutenant of China’s president, Xi Jinping, andhas been revealedas the suspect receiving British political intelligence that formed part of thecollapsed Chinese spying prosecution.Iain Duncan Smith, the MP and former leader of the Conservative party who has been pressing for the government to launch a fresh investigation into the latest Telegraph takeover, wrote on X: “Let me put it plainly. The meeting between John Thornton and Cai Qi is a red flag and a serious one.“It demands that the culture secretary, @lisanandy, trigger an investigation into RedBird’s bid for the Telegraph under our media freedom laws.“The risk of undue Chinese influence here is overwhelming and that’s not just my view; it’s supported by formal legal opinion, given Thornton’s deep and well-documented connections with senior figures in the Chinese Communist party.”The development is the latest piece of intrigue in a long-running Telegraph takeover saga.RedBird Capital – which holds various investments, including astake in the parent companyof Liverpool Football Club – is in the process of acquiringTelegraph Media Groupfrom a connected organisation, RedBird IMI.RedBird IMI was forced to put the titles up for sale in spring 2024 after the then Conservative government passed a law blocking foreign states or associated individualsfrom owning newspaper assets in the UK.While a quarter of RedBird IMI’s funding came from RedBird Capital, the remainder wassourced from International Media Investments(IMI) – which is controlled by Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and owner of Manchester City FC.The Labour governmenteased the banon foreign governments owning stakes in UK newspapers this year by allowing them to hold up to 15% of titles, which paved the way for the RedBird Capital offer that would lead to IMI retaining a 15% Telegraph stake.The deal, however, has continued to be viewed with suspicion.In the House of Lords this month, theLiberal Democrat peer Christopher Fox said: “My Lords, as we know, a fund with Abu Dhabi money and probably Chinese money is acquiring what in global terms is a small player, relatively small, but the Telegraph is significant in the UK.“The best explanation for their motives that I can come up with is that they’re buying influence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marshall had also been in the running to buy the Telegraph titles.A spokesperson for RedBird Capital said: “RedBird’s funds are backed by a diverse group of leading global blue-chip institutional investors and family offices which do not include any institutions or individuals fromChina. There is no Chinese influence in RedBird’s proposed acquisition of the Telegraph.“We are happy to work with any regulator or government body that wants to look into the proposed transaction.”A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport did not comment, citing a “quasi-judicial process”.Explore more on these topicsTelegraph Media GroupNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesChinaDaily TelegraphSunday TelegraphnewsShareReuse this content"

The company reported first-quarter earnings of $3.72 per share against analysts’ expectations of $3.68, and revenue of $77.7bn against expectations of $75.5bn, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.That’s up from the $3.30 per share and $65.6bn in revenue the company saw in the same quarter last year.Microsoft’s closely watched Azure cloud business grew by about 40%, also topping expectations.

The company said its net income was $27.7bn.“Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,” said Satya Nadella, chair and chief executive officer of Microsoft.“It’s why we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.”The company reported spending a larger-than-expected $34.9bn on new AI-related projects over the quarter, a 74% increase from the same period a year ago.Microsoft’s earnings report comes as investors welcomed a revamped deal with OpenAI this week that has the once not-for-profit AI venture move toward becoming a for-profit entity and ties Microsoft more closely to the company.Under the new agreement, Microsoft will hold 27% of the OpenAI Group PBC, valued at roughly $135bn, while OpenAI’s non-profit arm will hold a $130bn stake in the for-profit.The earnings report gives Wall Street its latest look at the company’s AI and cloud growth. Graphic chipmaker Nvidia crossed a threshold on Wednesday to become the first company valued at $5tn as prospects for a US-China trade deal improved. The wider US stock market reached record highs earlier in the week, buoyed by hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in AI.Microsoft’s earnings, along with Meta and Google parent Alphabet on Wednesday, begin a week of reports from the “Magnificent Seven”, the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world.Investor anxiety over the possible inflation of a market bubble in AI-related investment similar to over-investment in the mid-to-late 1990s have been growing. But bubbles aren’t necessarily visible until they burst.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s about to spend hundreds of billions moreRead moreOn an earnings call, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood sought to calm fears of an AI investment bubble, explaining that the company’s aggressive expansion in AI capacity, up 80% this year, and data centers doubling in size over the next two – was to meet demand that was already booked.“Our need to continue to build out infrastructure is very high and that’s for booked business today and not any new booked business,” Hood said, adding that the company had been short of processing capacity for several quarters.“I thought we were going to catch up but we are not,” Hood said. “Demand is increasing and usage is increasing very quickly. When you see these kinds of demand signals, and we know are behind, we need to spend. But we’re spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and bookings, and we feel good about that.”But, she warned, Microsoft is still “likely to be short of capacity”.AI-related and cloud computing companies are valued at a combined $20tn, and gains across the market are 18% in 2025, or about $3.3tn, according to Reuters. Investors typically want to see that returns on AI capital spending, or CapEx, are following as the markets continue to reach record highs.Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon are projected to pump hundreds of billions into capital expenditures in their upcoming year, mostly into the construction of datacenters and associated infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Investors may be undeterred even without strong signs of revenue growth and settle for signs of strong AI adoption. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a milestone of 47,943 on Wednesday morning.“With five of the Mag Seven reporting this week, what the market expects to hear is confirmation that all this AI CapEx is coming through, that the revenues and profits from AI are coming through,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St Louis, Missouri, told Reuters this week.Part of the AI economic boom is likely to come from cost savings. Microsoft announced at the start of the summer that it would cut about 9,000 jobs. Amazon is reported to be planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs, or 10% of workers in the white collar division, to compensate for over-hiring during the peak demand of the pandemic.With the application of AI-technologies, company managers are increasing asked to justify hiring a human, with additional costs in health insurance and pension, along with HR and other management officials, when the role could be performed by AI. As a result, human resource divisions are likely to be the first to be scaled back as AI takes hold.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftQuarterly resultsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The company brought in record quarterly revenue but reported a major tax bill that dampened earnings per share, the company announced on Wednesday. The financial results come asMetaends a multibillion-dollar hiring spree focused on artificial intelligence talent.The tech giant earned $51.24bn in quarterly revenue, beating Wall Street expectations and the company’s own projections for third-quarter sales. However, it reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.05, far below Wall Street expectations of $6.70 in EPS. The major drop was due to a one-time non-cash income tax charge of $15.93bn. The EPS would have been $7.25 without this one-time charge, the company said.The report, and the scheduled investor call, gives investors another opportunity to find out whether the company’s lavish spending on AI infrastructure is justified. The company projected full-year total expenses would be between $116m and $118bn, upping the lower end of the range from $114bn. The company also expects 2025 capital expenditures to be between $70bn and $72bn, up from a previously projected range of $66bn and $72bn. Meta said its fourth-quarter revenue would likely fall somewhere between $56bn and $59bn.Google parent Alphabet beats forecasts with first $100bn quarterRead more“We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and CEO. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses. If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.”Jesse Cohen, senior analyst atInvesting.com, said the latest report reveals “the growing tension between the company’s massive AI infrastructure investments and investor expectations for near-term returns”.Spending is not expected to slow down any time soon, however. On the earnings call, Susan Li, the company’s chief financial officer, said Meta will need to “invest aggressively” in 2026 to meet the company’s computational needs.Earlier this month, the company announced a new joint venture with Blue Owl Capital that would help the firms build and finance the new $27bn Hyperion data center campus in Louisiana, the biggest Meta is involved in developing.“We also anticipate total expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate in 2026 than 2025, with growth driven primarily by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation,” Li said. “Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to growth, as we recognize a full year of compensation for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent, and add technical talent in priority areas.”When asked about how the company is balancing releasing products that will show near-term returns on investment with these larger research-focused projects, Zuckerberg said that Meta AI is a “massive latent opportunity” and pointed to the company’s ability to bring its new products to billions of users.“The research is going to enable technological capabilities to exist and then those capabilities can get built into all kinds of different products,” Zuckerberg said.It’s the first financial update since Meta said itplannedto lay off 600 staffers from its AI unit – the same unit the company went on a spending and hiring spree to restructure and fill with the top AI talent from other companies. The company said the layoffs were an effort to reduce the bloat within the company’s “super-intelligence” unit and brought the number of employees there down to just under 3,000.Zuckerberg said the investment into Meta’s Superintelligence Labs helped the company build what he described as “the highest talent density lab in the industry at this point”.The company’s stock has been on a steady rise over the past six months. Its previous two earnings reports have beaten Wall Street expectations. The wider US stock market likewise reached record highs the week.Meta also launched its new Ray-Ban Display glasses last month, which feature a screen embedded in the lenses, and analysts were eager to hear sales figures. But the unit responsible for these glasses as well as Meta’s virtual reality headsets posted a massive $4.4bn loss. Zuckerberg said the company’s collaborations with Ray-Ban and Oakleys on these AI glasses were going well and that these investments will likely be very profitable.Meta’s original camera glasses, simply dubbed Meta Ray-Bans, proved to be a popular gadget. Both types of glasses have already prompted privacy concerns. While Meta has designed the glasses not to work if a light that notifies people that the glasses are recording is covered, a $60 modification can disable the light,404 Media reported.“I suspect these glasses, in particular, will predominantly appeal to early ‘tech-curious’ adopters, and that scheduled demos will far outpace sales,” saidMike Proulx, Forrester VP research director.On the advertising side, Meta lost its accreditation from the Media Rating Council, a non-profit that sets industry-wide standards for brand safety, after the company decided to pull out of the organization’s annual audits. The accreditation signals to advertisers that the content on the platform that their ads may appear next to would not be harmful to their brand. Meta received the accreditation just four months before it was stripped.Analysts were optimistic that the loss of accreditation would not ultimately hurt Meta’s ability to attract advertisers.“While this may raise eyebrows among advertisers, it won’t deter them from investing in Meta due to its sheer audience reach and brand reliance,” Proulx said. “Brands will overlook potential brand-safety risks as long as their Meta media investments continue to perform.”Explore more on these topicsMetaQuarterly resultsUS politicsStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

That estimate is up from an original declaration of $75bn in February and a revised figure of $85bn announced in July.The company reported total revenue of $102.35bn for the quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $99.89bn, according to data compiled by LSEG.Google Cloud remained one of Alphabet’s fastest-growing segments, benefiting from surging enterprise demand for AI-powered infrastructure and data analytics services. The unit posted revenue of $15.16bn, topping estimates of $14.72bn. The performance was probably boosted by burgeoning enterprise demand for its AI infrastructure.The unit continues to close the gap with larger rivals Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, aided by strong take-up of Vertex AI and custom tensor processing units.Competition in the broader AI and cloud market is intensifying, with rivals aggressively cutting prices and introducing new generative-AI capabilities.Alphabet’s advertising unit, which brings in the vast majority of the company’s revenue, has been competing in a crowded field of rivals vying for more ad dollars as lower interest rates are expected to lift the economy.However, analysts have pointed to cautious spending from advertisers in some sectors who are grappling with economic uncertainty due to pressures from tariff costs and a rapidly evolving global trading landscape.Still, Wall Street expects the company to benefit from advertisers moving away from experimental ad platforms like Snapchat and others.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Fed has been under immense pressure fromDonald Trumpto cut rates despite persistent inflation and no longer has access to key data thanks to the shutdown.The Fed chair,Jerome Powell, said on Wednesday that “there is no risk-free path” for the Fed to take with the labor market cooling and prices going up.Two members of the committee voted against the quarter-point increase. Stephen Miran, whom Trump appointed days before the committee’s last meeting in September, once again voted against the majority, arguing that the rate cut should be larger. Jeffrey Schmid, the president of the Kansas City Fed, also voted against the majority, though he preferred no change to the interest rate.Powell noted that much of the disagreement among the 12-person committee was not about this most recent interest rate cut but how the committee should proceed in December at its next meeting.The Fed’s goal is to use interest rates to both keep unemployment low and minimize price increases. Powell noted that the majority of Fed officials are now more concerned about the labor market than rising inflation, but opinions on the path forward differ widely.“We have one tool. We can’t do both of those at once. People have different forecasts … and they have different levels of risk aversion,” Powell said.Trump’s crackdown on migration is affecting the labor supply, though demand for labor has “gone down a little more than supply”, which is why the majority ultimately settled on a rate cut, said Powell.The ongoing federal government shutdown, now one of the longest in US history, has also complicated the Fed’s job. Collection of important economic data has been indefinitely halted as employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are furloughed during the shutdown.The Fed typically studies BLS data to determine labor market conditions, including the number of new jobs added to the economy and the current unemployment rate. The last jobs report was released in early September, before the shutdown, and gave a relatively bleaksnapshotof the jobs market in August. The number of jobs added to the economy in August was down by more than 100,000 since the spring, and unemployment crept up to 4.3% – the highest since 2021.Though the BLS was scheduled to release September’s job market report in early October, it suspended its publication once the shutdown started. The private payroll firm ADP reported earlier this month that the private sectorcut32,000 jobs in September, a sign that the job market is continuing to slow.Though the BLS’s jobs report has been suspended, the bureau still released itsinflation reportfor September that showed that prices are going up, albeit slowly. Prices rose 3% over the last year, the highest since January. In April, the annual inflation rate was 2.3%, the lowest it has been since 2021. The Fed’s target inflation rate is 2%.Asked about how the continuation of the government shutdown could affect the Fed’s next meeting, Powell said the central bank had other means of getting a snapshot of the economy it can use to determine its next move. But, he noted, “it is hard to say.”The next meeting is “six weeks aways, so we don’t know what we are going to get”, he said.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyDonald TrumpEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The company declined to provide a specific number.OneCBSNews staffer described the cuts as a “bloodbath”, saying they were wide-reaching and affected a number of departments.As part of the cuts, the network has closed its Johannesburg bureau and is cancelling its CBS Mornings Plus and CBS Evening News Plus streaming shows. The network’s Saturday-morning program will undergo a format change, according to a source with knowledge of the changes who was not authorized to comment. The network’s race and culture unit was gutted.One concerned CBS News staffer who was not authorized to comment described the process as “nerve-racking”. “Seems no one is safe,” the person added.CBS News anchor John Dickerson becomes latest figure to exit networkRead moreOverall, Paramount will lay off about 1,000 staffers on Wednesday, part of a longer-term plan that would double that number of cuts.David Ellison, the chief executive of Paramount Skydance, announced the cuts in a memo to all staff on Wednesday morning.“In some areas, we are addressing redundancies that have emerged across the organization,” he wrote. “In others, we are phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth. Ultimately, these steps are necessary to position Paramount for long-term success.”The cuts are expected to be one of the larger rounds of layoffs in recent memory at CBS News. The most recent round of significant layoffs came in May 2020, during the early months of the pandemic,when approximately 50 staffers were affectedduring the leadership of the then CBS News president, Susan Zirinsky.Puck’s Dylan Byers first reported that “nearly 100” CBS News staffers would be cut on Wednesday.The layoffs were planned before the appointment ofBari Weissas the network’s editor in chief, so it is unclear what role she might play in the process. Weiss briefly addressed the cuts at the top of the network’s editorial meeting on Wednesday,saying it would bean “enormously difficult day” at the network.“This is just an enormously difficult day for so many people that have given years of their lives to this company, and I’m sorry, and want to support everyone in whatever way I can,” Weiss said, according to a recording of her remarks reviewed by the Guardian. Weiss further told staff that her “door is open”.On Monday, one of the network’s longest-serving and most decorated journalists, John Dickerson,announced that he would be leavingat the end of the year, signaling a coming overhaul of the network’s struggling CBS Evening News program. The network’s head of standards, Claudia Milne, also recently departed the network.In his memo, Ellison thanked the employees who will be laid off.“We are deeply grateful for your hard work, professionalism, and resilience during this period of transition,” he wrote. “We remain confident that Paramount’s best days are ahead, and we’re committed to building a strong foundation for the future.”Explore more on these topicsCBSParamount+US television industryTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But repeated certification and production delays have pushed back deliveries by years, piling up charges of more than $15bn and straining its finances, while giving an opening to rival Airbus’s competing A350 as international travel continues to rise.Last month, CEO Kelly Ortberg said the company was behind schedule in certifying the jet, saying a “mountain of work” needed to be done but did not mention further delay to first delivery, which was slated for 2026, at the time. He said, however, no new technical problems had been identified. Including charges disclosed on Wednesday, Boeing has taken about $15bn in charges related to the 777X program. The latest charge includes penalties owed to customers for late deliveries.Shares of the planemaker were down 1% in premarket trading. Wall Street analysts had anticipated a sizeable charge to the 777X program.Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, a US boutique aerospace management consulting firm, said the charge was more than the $2bn to $4bn he expected. While he does not expect the charge to be financially crippling to debt-laden Boeing, “it does raise questions about any more surprises to come”.However, the latest delay comes at a time when demand is growing for international travel driving demand for the widebody aircraft, which was not the case when the 777X was first held up.“Now it might be getting to a challenge,” Aboulafia said. “People start to lose patience and demand compensation.“The charge includes longer production costs and penalties owed to customers, according to Boeing.After years of grappling with quality issues and production delays on its flagship 737 MAX, Boeing cautiously ramped up monthly output in 2025. Earlier this month, the company received the long-awaited approval from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase 737 Max production to 42 jets per month, easing a cap of 38 that had been in place since January 2024. That cap was imposed after a mid-air panel blowout in January 2024 on a nearly new aircraft.Boeing delivered 55 jets in September, marking its strongest performance for that month since 2018. This was a significant jump from the 33 deliveries recorded a year earlier, when a strike involving 33,000 factory workers in the Pacific north-west disrupted production.Deliveries are closely watched by Wall Street, as planemakers typically receive the bulk of their payments upon handing over the jets to customers, making deliveries a key indicator of revenue and cashflow.Boeing reported a free cashflow of $238m, turning positive for the first time since 2023.The planemaker posted an adjusted loss per share of $7.47 for the quarter through September, compared with analysts’ average expectations of a $4.59 loss, according to data compiled by LSEG.Its revenues for the quarter rose 30% to $23.27bn, above Wall Street expectations of $21.97bn.Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS economyBoeingAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Netflix, nobody wants thisAlaina DemopoulosSeason two of the Adam Brody and Kristen Bell-starring show feels like a long infomercial thanks to endless product placementWed 29 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 14.43 EDTShareAfter a long day, it’s nice to put on some sweats, pour yourself a glass of wine, turn on the TV and cozy up to an advertisement for Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex.Or at least that’s what I found myself doing on Sunday night, when I returned for season two ofNetflix’s Nobody Wants This. In the series, Adam Brody plays the so-called “hot rabbi” and love interest of Kristen Bell’s character, an atheist podcaster considering conversion. Together, the pair navigate cultural differences and disapproving family members. Or at least I assume that’s what happened – I was too distracted by all the product placement to focus on the plot.Nobody Wants This review – Kristen Bell and Adam Brody’s chemistry is electricRead moreHere’s a quick summary of the first five episodes of season two, with, technically, some spoilers. The two lovers get coffee and doughnuts from Dunkin’. Brody’s Noah gives Bell’s Joanne a gold Jennifer Meyer necklace. Joanne’s sister (Justine Lupe) calls the family “DoorDash people” and eats her “favorite snack” of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos by a pool. The couple goes to a pasta making class, which the chef reminds them was booked through an Airbnb experience. Something happens in a bathroom. I don’t know what, other than there was an extended money shot of the aforementioned Estée Lauder serum.View image in fullscreenJustine Lupe appears with an Estée Lauder product in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixAnd, oh yes, there is gossip and intrigue and life lessons learned along the way. Sadly, all I retained was the incredibly un-subliminal message that I should order takeout and buy some skincare. The medium is the message, indeed.I took my qualms to Reddit: had the show really become sponcon slop? I was not alone in this assessment. “The number of product placements this season is hilarious to the point that it’s basically a giant infomercial,” one user posted. “It’s literally like they wrote the scene around the products,” another wrote. “It’s almost like a parody of product placement in movies, but it’s not, and that’s a huge bummer,” another opined.View image in fullscreenAdam Brody (left) and Kristen Bell hold Dunkin’ Donuts products in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixI understand that it’s hard to make films and TV today, even if you’re Netflix (the company is doing well butnothing is certainin the volatile streaming market). I am a lifetime Los Angeles romanticist, and I’m troubled by the fact thatHollywoodhas entered aslow death spiral. Filming in town is at ahistoric low, with productions fleeing to Atlanta or New York or the UK orAustraliato save on costs. So many releases these days are big-budget franchises orspin-offs, rather than the types ofcharacter-driven romcomsthat I and so many others love. Nobody Wants This, shot in LA, was an exception to all that: smart, funny and disarmingly charming. So what if Netflix solicited a little financial boost from our benevolent corporate overlords?It would be naive to turn to television as an escape from the capitalist hellhole that is my phone’s endless scroll of thinly veiled #ads and influencer brand collaborations. From the early days of the first soaps (called that as they were sponsored by personal hygiene brands), TV existed to both entertain and sell stuff. Yet the nonstop hawking in Nobody Wants This feels particularly egregious. Sure, I’ll buy that Joanne, a privileged and slightly vapid podcaster, would be a brand snob who totes a yuppy-ish Clare V handbag and stocks her refrigerator with Spindrift seltzers. But in its best moments, the show encourages us to reflect on our own belief system: how it came to be, and how it might change with time. That introspection becomes difficult when your eye is being pulled to the bottle of Seventh Generation disinfectant spray (available at Target) in the frame.View image in fullscreenJustine Lupe eats Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixNetflix has long promoted brands during its shows. But the companyswearsit’s nottheiridea. Netflix, which did not respond to my request for comment, told the New York Times in 2019 that “most of the brands that appear in shows and movies are added by creators who believe they add to the authenticity of the story”, and that such placements were “rare and not a business focus” at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One early Netflix success story, House of Cards, ran from 2013 to 2018. Its product placements (BlackBerry, Sony, Cartier) fit into the world of the show – mostly. At one point, thelead characterFrank Underwood, then a US House of Representatives majority whip, asked one of his colleagues about his PlayStation Vita. “I oughta get one of these for the car,” he said, before the episode cut to credits.View image in fullscreenKristen Bell wears a Fly By Jing chili crisp-branded sweatshirt in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixNetflix’s Stranger Things, set in the 1980s, prominently featured products from that era, leading to a modern-day boon for brands such as Coca-Cola, Eggo, Cadillac, Schwinn, Nike and Burger King. In 2019, CBS Newsreportedthat the total advertising value for the more than 100 brands that appeared in the series was estimated to hit over $15m in the first three days of season three streaming.Last year, the Daily Mailfoundthat Emily in Paris, a bubblegum dramedy starring Lily Collins, plugged 37 brands throughout 10 episodes. Some you might expect for a show about an American who moves to Paris, which Sex and the City’s costume designer consulted on: Chanel, Dior, Hermès. But not every sponsor was as chic: Starbucks, Apple and –mon dieu! – McDonald’s.Maybe I’ll finish Nobody Wants This tonight. Or maybe I’ll go watch five straight hours of car commercials on YouTube; I’m not sure there’s much of a difference at this point.Netflixexecutives, if you see this, maybe cut back on the product placement.

Aston Villa and Real Madrid are on the Anfield horizon and so is trouble should this slump deepen.The FA Cup and Community Shield winners eased into theCarabao Cupquarter-finals courtesy of a first-half double from Ismaïla Sarr, Liverpool’s tormentor‑in-chief. The Senegal international made it seven goals in nine appearances against Liverpool – for Palace and Watford – as Oliver Glasner’s team registered their third triumph against Slot’s side in 80 days.TheLiverpoolhead coach made 10 changes for the fourth-round match but Palace are too streetwise, too assured and too talented to be treated so lightly. A sixth defeat in seven games, the heaviest of Slot’s reign at Anfield, was the almost inevitable outcome for the Premier League champions. A straight red card for the substitute Amara Nallo – his second in two Liverpool appearances – and a clinical third goal from the excellent Yéremy Pino inflicted further punishment on the hosts late on.Quick GuideCarabao Cup quarter-final drawShowCardiff to host ChelseaCardiff have been handed a dream home Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Chelsea.The League One club are the lowest-ranked team left in the competition, having won 2-1 at Welsh rivals Wrexham on Tuesday night.Chelsea came through 4-3 against Wolves at Molinuex, holding off a second-half fightback from the home side to secure their place in the last eight.Elsewhere in the draw, holders Newcastle will be at home to Fulham.Crystal Palace will head to Premier League leaders Arsenal.Manchester City, who came from behind to win 3-1 at Swansea, will be at home against Brentford.PA MediaCarabao Cup quarter-final draw in fullArsenal v Crystal PalaceCardiff City v ChelseaManchester City v BrentfordNewcastle Unitedv FulhamThe games will take place in the week commencing Monday 15 December.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Slot’s priority was clearly the visit of Villa in the Premier League on Saturday as he gave the majority of the senior squad the night off and more time preparing on the training ground. The risk was not so much in the starting lineup, a typical mix for this stage of the competition of youth and experience, but in having no insurance policies on the bench whatsoever.Nine members of the squad featured for the under-21s on Sunday in the mini-derby defeat of Everton. Nine was also the sum total of first-team appearances among the nine substitutes. Glasner went stronger, making five changes to the teambeaten by Arsenalon Sunday.In fairness to Slot and his makeshift selection there was little between the teams for 30 minutes and, in the 17-year-old Rio Ngumoha, Liverpool had one of the most enterprising players on display. Ngumoha went close with one curling effort and created Liverpool’s best opening of the first half when slipping in Federico Chiesa. From a tight angle, the Italy forward’s low shot was saved by the legs of Walter Benítez.View image in fullscreenThe pressure is mounting on Arne Slot.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA“I was not pleased with the first 15 minutes, the players were still in their hotel beds,” Glasner said. Once Palace awoke, however, their greater composure on the ball and experience told. Once Sarr beat Freddie Woodman for the first time, the Palace fan and former academy player making his Liverpool debut in place of the rested Giorgi Mamardashvili, the home side had no answers.Palace struck twice in quick succession before the interval. Both goals stemmed from Daichi Kamada passes down the centre of the pitch. The midfielder’s first incisive ball found Daniel Muñoz inside the area. His heavy touch rebounded off Joe Gomez to the unmarked Sarr, who swept his finish inside Woodman’s left-hand post under no pressure.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Amara Nallo is shown a red card by the referee Craig Pawson.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersFour minutes later Kamada put Liverpool under pressure again with a first-time pass into Sarr. The Senegal international flicked a layoff into Pino and darted into the penalty area. Pino found his run brilliantly, dissecting the Liverpool defence with a disguised pass, giving Sarr time and space to again beat Woodman with ease.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kelly’s dismissal followed a 49-25 home loss to Texas A&M that dropped the Tigers to 5-3 and capped a collapse from early-season title hopes to frustration.“I can tell you right now, Scott Woodward is not selecting our next coach,” Landry told reporters at the state capitol in Baton Rouge on Wednesday. “Maybe we’ll let President Trump pick it. He loves winners.”Governor Jeff Landry says in no uncertain terms that Scott Woodward will NOT select the next LSU Football coach.pic.twitter.com/rdqh8tuSWp— Matt Moscona (@MattMoscona)October 29, 2025Landry accused Woodward of a “pattern” of failure, pointing to a similar deal the athletic director made while running Texas A&M’s program, where coach Jimbo Fisher was fired in 2023 with a $77m buyout – then the largest in college sports history. “The guy that’s here now wrote that contract that cost Texas A&M more than $70m,” Landry said. “Right now, we have a $53m liability. We are not doing that again.”$54m to walk: getting fired as a college football coach is a booming industryRead moreKelly, 64, compiled a 34-14 record in Baton Rouge and won nearly 71% of his games, but his teams faltered when it mattered most. LSU’s promising 4-0 start this season disintegrated into three losses in four games, and fans chanted “Fire Kelly” during Saturday’s defeat. By Sunday night, he was gone.“When Coach Kelly arrived at LSU four years ago, we had high hopes that he would lead us to multiple SEC and national championships,” Woodward said in announcing the firing. “Ultimately, the success at the level that LSU demands simply did not materialize.”Landry said he met with university leaders at the governor’s mansion that same night to discuss the legal and financial fallout. Because LSU is part of the state’s higher-education system, part of Kelly’s salary was publicly funded, though most came from donors and sponsorships. The governor said his concern was “the fiscal effect of firing a coach under a terrible contract” and the perception that the public would be left footing the bill. “I was not happy that we were raising ticket prices while having a losing season and paying a coach $100m without the results,” he said.Woodward, an LSU graduate who has led the athletics department since 2019, defended the move in a short statement, saying the school would “continue to negotiate [Kelly’s] separation and work toward a path that is better for both parties”. Kelly’s buyout isbelieved to be around $54m. Landry, however, argued that accountability must be written into any future deal. “We’re going to pick a coach and we’re going to make sure that coach is successful, compensated properly, and held to metrics,” he said. “I’m tired of rewarding failure in this country and leaving the taxpayers to foot the bill.”Kelly’s exit continues a tumultous season for major college programs. Penn Statefired James Franklinearlier this month, followed by Florida’s dismissal of Billy Napier a week later. Across the country, at least half a dozen universities have already parted ways with their head coaches before November. LSU named associate head coach Frank Wilson as interim head coach for the remainder of the season while a selection committee, appointed by the LSU Board of Supervisors, begins its search for a permanent replacement.Kelly’s four-year record stands in stark contrast to his predecessors. Nick Saban, Les Miles and Ed Orgeron all won national championships within their first four seasons in Baton Rouge. Kelly’s tenure produced three minor bowl appearances but no College Football Playoff berths, even as he oversaw quarterbackJayden Daniels’s riseto a Heisman Trophy.The governor insisted he has nothing personal against Kelly, describing him as “a good man” but one who “just wasn’t the right fit anymore”. What most frustrates him, he said, is the broader trend of athletic departments handing out vast, guaranteed contracts to coaches regardless of performance. “I think the spirit of the team needed a change,” he said. “But we’re going to make sure the next contract makes sense. We’re done writing blank checks.”Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsLouisianaUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Investigators determined that the pair of Jefferson parish residents used a web of false identities to convince an out-of-state business to loan out the money, Rivarde said in an interview on Tuesday.Rivarde added that Weber is said to have even posed as Ward’s father, Calvin, at least once while signing notarized documents in person aimed at obtaining the loaned money.Weber and Lash eventually drew scrutiny from investigators – and on 16 May, they were arrested at a shopping center in the Jefferson parish community of Harvey, where they had planned to attend a meeting meant to facilitate their obtaining the loans, Rivarde said.Both were subsequently released from custody on bail. Court hearings for Weber and Lash were tentatively scheduled, respectively, for early November and mid-December.In an interview on Tuesday, Calvin Ward recounted first being called by the Jefferson parish sheriff’s office while attending an event forNFLrookies and their families before his son was drafted by the Titans in April. An investigator – whom he briefly thought was a prankster – informed him someone had put two liens on his home in Texas, which had been fully paid, said Calvin Ward, a former college football player.Calvin Ward subsequently learned that a private credit fund based in California had extended two high-interest loans to people pretending to be him and his son – despite lacking their social security or driver’s license numbers. The lender’s president apparently brimmed with pride when he saw the NFL draft and believed he had seen one of his clients get chosen No 1 overall.The fraudsters also convinced the fund’s president that his son would eventually receive a signed helmet from Cam Ward as a gift, said attorney Josh Clayton, who represents the quarterback and his family.“It’s scary,” Calvin Ward said. He said his family had taken steps to freeze Cam Ward’s credit when he finished playing collegiately at the University of Miami because they had heard that someone who walked into a bank impersonating an NFL rookie the previous year had managed to get a hefty loan in that athlete’s name.However, Calvin Ward remarked, nothing had prepared him for “a heavy dose of how easy it is for someone to put a lien on your house without you knowing about it”.Lenders placelienson homes to gain the ability to claim a property to pay off debts in cases of default. In the Wards’ case, the lender released the liens immediately upon learning it was all a ruse, Clayton said.“My message is be as vigilant as you can with your [finances],” Calvin Ward said. “There’s schemers and scammers out there, and they’re always trying to put a plan in action.”Records show authorities seized a 2018 Bentley Bentayga from Weber in the course of the investigation into him.He subsequently filed documents asking that he be given back the Bentayga, contending that the vehicle – whose original base price on Carfax is listed at $195,000 – “could not be of any evidentiary value concerning [his] current charges”. That request remained unresolved on Tuesday.NFL: behind the scenes at the International Series in LondonRead moreAlso on Tuesday, Weber argued that someone from outside Louisiana had unduly used his name in dealings involving Cam Ward.“A person was painting themselves as me, but … it was not me,” Weber said when reached by telephone. “It was a misunderstanding. I don’t know what’s going on.”Weber then insisted the case against him had been dismissed, and that to report on it would defame his character.Informed of those comments, Rivarde said the case against Weber was “100% still open”. The case was also listed in Jefferson parish’s online court system as active.Weber said he and Lash were friends. Social media accounts under their names present both as businesspeople.At least one of Weber’s accounts allude to his past as a decorated high school basketball player who then played the sport for the men’s team at the University of Alabama during the 2004-05 campaign, as a 6ft 3in, 195lb shooting guard.The case against Lash and Weber is one of two prominent matters recently handled by the Jefferson sheriff’s office that involved an NFL player.Earlier in October, the agencysaidtwo suspects had been arrested and another pair were being sought after a burglary at the home of New Orleans Saints player Cam Jordan. The break-in occurred while Jordan was at a game, and it appeared to be one of a string of cases across the US targeting professional athletes while they were away from their homes competing.Meanwhile, late in 2024, federal prosecutorschargeda New Orleans man and the estranged wife of retired NFL pro Earl Thomas with a $2.7m plot to commandeer the ex-player’s identity, steal his money and with it buy luxury goods such as a $28,796 Hermes handbag, a $52,890 Porsche Panamera and breast implants.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS crimeTennessee TitansUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a reminder of how he makes the miraculous seem mundaneGabriel Baumgaertnerat Dodger StadiumWed 29 Oct 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 10.02 EDTShareEven Shohei Ohtani’s teammates struggle to find the right adjectives to describe him; ones that express how good he is while emphasizing how unlikely his existence is in the first place.After Monday’s Game 3, when Ohtanibecame the first playerin postseason history to reach base nine times in a World Series game, Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman opted for “unicorn,” one of the more common Ohtani descriptors. Starting pitcher Blake Snell, meanwhile, put things simple and plain.“He’s going to do spectacular things all the time,” Snell said. “And it’s just going to be normal for him.”Game 4 of the World Series, though, proved that even a spectacular unicorn can be fallible. On Tuesday, Ohtani allowed more than three runs in a start for the first time since August and didn’t record a hit in theDodgers’ 6-2loss to the Toronto Blue Jaysto tie the series at two games apiece.That a pedestrian performance like this can surprise is further evidence of how Ohtani has completely reset the standards of what a professional baseball player can achieve. After Tuesday’s game, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts admitted that even he can get carried away.Guerrero homers off Ohtani as Blue Jays see off Dodgers to level World SeriesRead more“It’s part of being a fan and seeing great things from great players,” Roberts said. “So every time he steps up I expect great things to happen, and maybe unfairly.”Even in Wednesday’s loss, Ohtani’s six strikeouts gave him the record for most for any player in their first three postseason starts (25, surpassing James Paxton’s record of 20 in 2019). The 15 swings and misses he induced from Toronto hitters put his whiff rate – the percentage of pitches that opposing hitters swing and miss – at 42%, higher than any other starting pitcher in the 2025 postseason. And his outing came just 18 hours after he was the first player in 119 years to have four extra-base hits in aWorld Seriesgame.That, perhaps, is a reminder of just how special the 31-year-old is. When he signed with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, his arrival was expected to generate a new generation of two-way players, who would excel as pitchers and batters. Instead, his phenomenal success has only highlighted the extreme challenges of staying healthy (Ohtani has missed two full pitching seasons with elbow injuries) and the mental preparation required to battle big league pitchersandhitters. As a result, Ohtani may have inadvertently killed the two-way player, at least while he is the standard bearer. “[Ohtani] came in and he’s like the Babe Ruth of hitting and pitching,” Kansas City Royals pitcher Michael Lorenzen – a former two-way player with seven career home runs –told the Athletic in August. “How much value is there in someone who’s just above average at both? I think if that’s proven by someone that it’s really valuable, then a lot more people will do it.”But Ohtani should not be dismissed as a curve breaker because of his seemingly divine talent. Before he signed with the Angels, Ohtani told Sports Illustrated that the most mental stress he suffered was not from the pressure of starring at two positions, but from fans and pundits who believed that his insistence on hitting and pitching indicated he was either selfish or unserious. Even for those who think Ohtani’s legend is overblown, it’s hard to consider him unserious about anything: as an adolescent, he scarfed “dozens” of bowls of rice to try and add bulk to his lanky frame and created detailed life goalsin spreadsheets. He is so meticulous about his sleep that he reportedly travels with his own mattress and pillow to ensure he gets his preferred 10 hours per night – and another two before gametime. Asked how he felt about starting the next day after his historic Game 3 performance, Ohtani said simply, “I want to go to sleep as soon as possible.”View image in fullscreenShohei Ohtani is known for his exacting routines.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPAThose small parts of the “routine” are among the most common ways his many admirers try to explain Ohtani’s greatness. Ex-Dodgers teammate Chris Taylor remembers Ohtanipausing minutes betweenindividual sprints and practice swings to try and create game-like visualizations so he could improve his subsequent reps. When asked to explain Ohtani’s uniqueness to a casual observer, Roberts described Ohtani as two specialists rolled into one, able to summon the best from each side of himself.“[These are] crazy expectations, probably unattainable for any person,” Roberts said before Tuesday’s game. “And then to kind of have the body and mind work together to perform at the highest level with all eyes on him. I just don’t think there’s a comparable if you’re talking about one human being.”Whether it’s his appeal as a two-way player or his mammoth home runs and scorching line drives, Ohtani has galvanized those who follow his career. His jersey was the best-selling across Major League Baseball forthe third consecutive seasonand has spurred anoticeable uptick in Japanese tourism to Los Angeles. Another athlete who shone in multiple disciplines – NFL hall of famer and nine-year MLB veteran Deion Sanders – said it will be decades until another player like Ohtani arrives.Until then, the world will need to work on some new words to bring Ohtani to life. After all, unicorns are not real, but Ohtani is.Explore more on these topicsShohei OhtaniMLBBaseballUS sportsWorld SeriesLos Angeles DodgersWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The spirit of Stoke City’s legendary ball flinger lives on with the long throw-inenjoying a renaissancein the Premier League this season. Indeed, statistics show that the number of long throw-ins per match has more than doubled from last season, pointing to a very real and meaningful trend.It’s a trend bemoaned by some, including Jamie Carragher, who in his punditry has taken issue with the way long throw-ins disrupt the game (the game’s lawmakers areconsidering taking action too). Others have different gripes, seeing long throw-ins as a low-brow, primitive shortcut to goal in violation of the spirit of the sport. If scoring is now as simple as launching the ball into the box at every opportunity, why would anyone bother coaching technical skill?Brentford are sticking it in the mixer more than any other team in the Premier League this season. It’s a part of how the data-led West Londoners have continued to punch above their weight, but it’s not just plucky underdogs doing a Delap. Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur are also using long throws.This is part of a wider trend. For years, the best teams focused on pressing with intensity high up the field. Now to counter that, opponents are going direct quicker. Passing in the Premier League is at a 15-year low this season and long throws are an extension of the desire to get the ball forward quicker no matter the means.So yes, long throws are changing the game. Whether it’s for the better, worse, or neutral depends on your perspective.Is Liverpool’s title defence already over?View image in fullscreenArne Slot’s Liverpool have found things more difficult in his second season.Photograph: Dave Shopland/APLiverpool knew what they would face at the Brentford Community Stadium on Sunday. Arne Slot had highlighted his own team’s problems in combating physical, direct opponents of late, complaining that the Reds “were not able to press the opponent because the ball wasn’t on the ground, it was in the air.” Yet he seemingly had no way to stop Brentford from doing as Crystal Palace, Galatasaray, Chelsea and Manchester United had also done.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mohamed Salah scored, but was once again a shadow of the player that set goalscoring records last season. Florian Wirtz was off too, not for the first time.While Liverpool’s problems are well documented, Slot hasn’t yet come up with an effective plan to address them. Last week’s 5-1 away win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League came close to giving Liverpool a new framework to move forward, but that required Salah to be dropped. Alexander Isak also came off with an injury, meaning Slot couldn’t reuse the front-two system against Brentford.Talent wise, it’s reasonable to assume Liverpool will turn their form around before too long. By then, though, Arsenal could be in an even stronger position at the top of the table. Such is the Gunners’ consistency and momentum, Liverpool’s Premier League title defence may already be over.Is the Old Firm’s grip on Scottish soccer loosening?View image in fullscreenHeart of Midlothian’s Lawrence Shankland (third right) celebrates after scoring his sides third goal.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PATony Bloom has only been in Scottish soccer for a matter of months, but the landscape around him has already changed dramatically. The Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise owner vowed this would happen when he became Hearts minority owner in June, targeting a league title within a decade. But not even Bloom’s fabled data model could have predicted Celtic and Rangers’ implosion this season.It would be an exaggeration to claim Hearts’ fast start is the sole explanation for the Old Firm’s sudden demise. Celtic fans want wholesale changes at executive level afteryears of mismanagementculminated in a catastrophic summer transfer window, while Rangers are reeling from Russell Martin’s ill-fated 123 days as manager.Nonetheless, the sight of Hearts eight points clear at the top of the table is emblematic of the growing belief Scottish soccer has reached a turning point – one that has been a long time coming. It’s been 40 years since a non-Old Firm team won the title. That was Sir Alex Ferguson’s Aberdeen.Hearts may not maintain their current pace, but they have already exposed just how vulnerable Celtic and Rangers are. Scottish soccer is ripe for a disrupter. This is presumably why Bloom invested in Hearts, having done something similar in the Premier League and Belgium. He spotted an opportunity.Brendan Rodgers’ bombshell resignation and Dermot Desmond’s public evisceration of the Northern Irishman exposed just how threatened Celtic feel. Aberdeen were spoken about as potential title challengers last season after winning 10 of their opening 11 league fixtures, but what Hearts are doing is even more profound because of how they’re going about it. Forward thinking, data-driven and on the rise – they are everything the Old Firm aren’t right now.Explore more on these topicsFootballUS sportsScottish PremiershipLiverpoolFootball tacticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the night that Max Dowman became the club’s youngest player to start a match, at the age of just 15 years and 302 days, it was two other graduates of the Hale End academy who scored the decisive goals to send Mikel Arteta’s side into the last eight.Ethan Nwaneri, who has one record that Arsenal’s latest protege can never beat, as the youngest player in Premier League history, found the net again on a rare start to settle an inexperienced Arsenal side’s nerves before Bukayo Saka rounded off the victory over Brighton after coming on to replace Dowman.Quick GuideCarabao Cup quarter-final drawShowCardiff to host ChelseaCardiff have been handed a dream home Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Chelsea.The League One club are the lowest-ranked team left in the competition, having won 2-1 at Welsh rivals Wrexham on Tuesday night.Chelsea came through 4-3 against Wolves at Molinuex, holding off a second-half fightback from the home side to secure their place in the last eight.Elsewhere in the draw, holders Newcastle will be at home to Fulham.Crystal Palace will head to Premier League leaders Arsenal.Manchester City, who came from behind to win 3-1 at Swansea, will be at home against Brentford.PA MediaCarabao Cup quarter-final draw in fullArsenal v Crystal PalaceCardiff City v ChelseaManchester City v BrentfordNewcastle Unitedv FulhamThe games will take place in the week commencing Monday 15 December.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.On the impressive evidence of the 70 minutes he was granted here by Arteta, the forward – who will turn 16 on New Year’s Eve – will have plenty more opportunities to impress on the right flank over the years to come.“It was a very special evening,” said a delighted Arteta. “For him everything is natural, it’s the way he plays. I think that’s the secret, that he doesn’t make a big fuss of it, he just does what he does best, which is to play football.”This was an eighth win in succession for Arsenal in all competitions and yet another clean sheet despite making 10 changes that also included handing a senior debut to 17-year-old striker Andre Harriman-Annous. Having already established a four-point lead at the top of the Premier League, Arteta will hope that the timely injection of youth can provide more impetus in a season when they look destined to finally end their long search for silverware.“We’re struggling with some positions already and it’s October, so we’re going to need them,” added Arteta. “It was a great test for them and I take a lot of learning from it.”View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri, left, celebrates after scoring his side’s opening goal.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APFor some time it has been a matter of when and not if Dowman would be handed his first start having first trained with Arsenal’s senior squad when he turned 14, with the possibility he could still become the youngest player in Champions League history should he make an appearance before the end of January. But the absence of Gabriel Martinelli meant Arteta was short of attacking options and keen to rotate his squad before three testing away trips next week, as only Eberechi Eze retained his place fromthe win over Crystal Palaceon Sunday.If there were any doubts about whether Dowman was ready for this stage then they were dispelled in the 10th minute when a brilliant piece of control got the home fans out of their seats. Another teenager, Charalampos Kostoulas, should have made Arsenal pay from the resulting corner when Brighton raced downfield but he could only shoot wide. Georginio Rutter had also forced Kepa Arrizabalaga into an early save by then as the visitors started confidently.It was understandable with so many changes that Arsenal lacked rhythm in attack, although their biggest threat came whenever Dowman got the ball on the right flank. With a mop of hair that he is constantly brushing away from his eyes, he is deceptively quick off the mark and left Belgium international defender Maxim De Cuyper for dead on more than one occasion. Fabian Hürzeler was left cursing his luck when somehow Jan Paul van Hecke headed wide from a corner five minutes before half-time. “We weren’t on our highest level in either box and Arsenal made us pay,” said the Brighton manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The referee, Sam Barrott, waved away the appeals from the home crowd. A wonderful move that was triggered by Mikel Merino’s clever backheel eventually created the breakthrough, with Nwaneri finding the corner brilliantly after being set up by yet another academy graduate, Myles Lewis-Skelly. Eze saw another effort deflect just over as Arsenal started to find spaces in Brighton’s defence, with Hürzeler responding by introducing three attacking substitutes that surprisingly didn’t include top scorer Danny Welbeck.Merino’s effort from a corner was cleared off the line before Dowman was given a standing ovation when he made way for Saka. The England forward didn’t waste any time making his mark when he fired in the rebound after Harriman-Anous’s shot was saved to maintain Arsenal’s winning run and send an ominous warning to their rivals.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupArsenalBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

If the sight of that trophy inspired Thomas Frank’s team, Newcastle’s desire to retain it proved infinitely stronger. As Eddie Howe put it: “This was a performance in line with our identity and our expectations. We were strong.”Howe’s side could have been forgiven for prioritising the Champions League and the Premier League but, instead, they played with the zeal of a side still buoyed bytheir Wembley triumphin March.Sarr double for Crystal Palace sends young Liverpool side out of Carabao CupRead moreTheir passage to the quarter-finals this season and a home tie against Fulham in December was secured with goals from the impressive Fabian Schär and Nick Woltemade, not to mention another stunning midfield performance on Sandro Tonali’s part.Howe had enthused about the variety and versatility of Tottenham’s buildups but, perhaps anxious to prove his own chameleon credentials, Newcastle’s manager tweaked his 4-3-3 system to create extra overloads down the flanks.It meant that one full-back – Emil Krafth or Dan Burn – joined almost every attack as the home side temporarily shape‑shifted into a back three.With Tonali once again reprising his impression of the complete modern midfielder, Spurs struggled to second‑guess their hosts. Admittedly after Harvey Barnes missed a decent opening, Frank’s team woke up and Brennan Johnson should have done better than slice a shot into the Gallowgate at the end of a fluent counterattack.Howe’s reprieved players responded by rewarding the home fans who had struggled to get into the ground after the Microsoft internet outage on Wednesday left them unable to download match tickets.It came in the form of a headed goal from Schär, who connected with Tonali’s corner as Tottenham’s zonal marking engendered a sense of chaos to rival anything seen earlier in the St James’ Park box office. It did not help that Djed Spence was out of position, lacing his boots. “Djed had his boot off and needed time to tie it, the referee made a mistake,” Frank said. “I have spoken to him about it.”View image in fullscreenFabian Schär rises to power home a header and put Newcastle ahead.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAAs Schär’s header powered beyond Antonin Kinsky’s reach, Howe applauded enthusiastically. The ball-playing former Switzerland central defender began the season in stellar form and was desperately unlucky to lose his place to Malick Thiaw after sustaining a concussion.Now, with Sven Botman rested as Newcastle’s made eight changes to Tottenham’s four, Schär found himself stationed alongside Thiaw and doing a very good job of subduing Richarlison.Although the imperious Lucas Bergvall did not deserve to finish on the losing team, Frank’s problem was that his forwards struggled to properly test Newcastle’s goalkeeper, Aaron Ramsdale.Not that this lack of killer instinct was exclusively a Spurs problem. Had Barnes not clipped the crossbar with a late first-half volley following fine work from Tonali and Thiaw, Newcastle would have been two up at the interval.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Germany centre-forward headed his side’s second goal at the outset of the second half after meeting Joe Willock’s beautifully dinked cross and capitalising on an unfortunate misunderstanding between Kinsky and Kevin Danso. And to think Woltemade, who has now scored six goals for Newcastle, insists he is infinitely happier with the ball at his feet.Frank’s players have often shone aerially at dead balls this season but here Newcastle delighted in demonstrating that they, too, are pretty useful with their heads at set plays. “It’s something we’ve worked on really hard lately,” said Howe, who had reason to thank Ramsdale for a superb save to deny Pape Sarr. “We’ve got the height and power to cause teams problems.”Well before the end home fans felt sufficiently confident to start singing about another trip to a major final. Their Carabao Cup anthem last season – “Tell me Ma, I won’t be home for tea … we’re going to Wemberlee” – received an airing as Howe introduced a series of substitutes.They included Joelinton, who could count himself fortunate to be merely booked following a reckless tackle on the Tottenham substitute Mohammed Kudus. The same luck applied to Kudus, who responded by throwing his fists at the prone Brazilian before Joelinton fought back.“It was a game of small margins,” Frank said. “It was really close.”Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Rayan Cherki, who teed up Marmoush, secured the win in stoppage time.It was a timely moment for Marmoush’s first City goal of the season and he seized a rare window of opportunity. When the Egypt striker, filling in for Erling Haaland, received Cherki’s pass and swivelled on his heels, eluding the Chelsea loanee Ishe Samuels‑Smith, there was only one thing in his mind.

I’m really pleased to get the win because I know it is difficult to play away.”Guardiola made 10 changes from thedefeat at Aston Villaon Sunday, with Oscar Bobb the only survivor from their starting lineup, but the 18‑year‑old Divine Mukasa represented the only inexperienced player in the XI. James Trafford deputised for Gianluigi Donnarumma in goal and Marmoush, Cherki and Jeremy Doku were among those promoted from the bench.Haaland, who is expected to return against Bournemouth on Sunday after colliding with a post in the closing stages at Villa Park, Rúben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Tijjani Reijnders were given the night off.At the same time Guardiola was mindful that this had the makings of an awkward contest, even if City’s previous visit was aroutine 3-1 winin the same competition in 2021. Guardiola was apologetic after his side rallied from two goals downto win 3-2 courtesy of an offside Sergio Agüero goalen route to lifting the FA Cup in 2019.

Swansea began brightly and startled City when the wing-back Josh Key drove infield past Rayan Aït-Nouri and squared for Franco just outside the area. Franco dispatched a right-foot effort towards goal, watching his sweet strike all the way.City had Trafford to thank for preventing Swansea from doubling their lead through Melker Widell after Abdukodir Khusanov gifted the forward possession with a sloppy pass.Eight minutes later Doku, who enjoyed stretching his legs inBelgium’s World Cup qualifying victory against Walesthis month, darted inside off the left flank and Cameron Burgess,Swansea’s hero in the last round, inadvertently helped the ball beat the goalkeeper Andy Fisher.“I watched Doku against Wales and he was scary,” the Swansea head coach, Alan Sheehan, said. “City are incredible up close, they’ve got close to £1bn-worth of quality.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The post‑match comments from Wiegman did little to ease the worry. “It doesn’t look good,” she said. “We don’t know yet but I’m not very positive about what I’ve seen.” Injury woes have been mounting for Wiegman since the summer with key players already missing. Leah Williamson is yet to return after undergoing a minor knee operation while Lauren Hemp and Lauren James remain out. Grace Clinton was missing with a knock, Jess Park was out with concussion, and Lotte Wubben‑Moy had to leave camp early through illness. But all the focus now is on Agyemang.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang leaves the pitch on a stretcher after sustaining a knee injury late on against Australia.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesDebutants make their markEveryone wants to win football matches but the Lionesses were presented with a huge opportunity for experimentation in this series of friendlies, with two more games to come against China (29 November) and Ghana (2 December) to close out 2025. With the pressure eased, Wiegman took used this opening, handing out three debuts and giving players crucial minutes. Aston Villa’s Lucia Kendall took her chance against Australia and was arguably one of the best performers. This was the 21-year-old’s first call‑up from the under-23s but she looked like she belonged instantly, comfortable in possession, creating opportunities and at ease amongst seasoned internationals.Depth at left-back has been a consistent issue but Taylor Hinds’s adept performance against the Matildas will have given the coaching staff plenty of food for thought. Khiara Keating also made her long-awaited debut, starting against Brazil. The defeat was disappointing but the young goalkeeper was not at fault for either goal and grew into the match. There were also key minutes for players who have found themselves on the periphery, such as Esme Morgan, Maya Le Tissier, Missy Bo Kearns and Aggie Beever-Jones.View image in fullscreenTaylor Hinds on the move during her England debut against Australia.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockDefensive frailties remainThe opening 18 minutes against Brazil encapsulated the defensive issues that have haunted England for some time. The Lionesses tend to labour against pacy, direct attackers while also being guilty of making early errors. Jess Carter and Morgan were the centre-back partnership in a new defensive unit against Brazil. Both ply their trade in the NWSL, where fast transitions are the norm, but they struggled to handle the speed of the Brazilian front line.Le Tissier, who has been the subject of much conversation over this window, started at right-back against Brazil but was moved to the centre towards the end of that game and against the Matildas and looked much more comfortable. The lack of suitable cover for Lucy Bronze, however, remains a problem. The 34‑year‑old illustrated exactly how important she is to this team with a goal and an assist in the first half against Australia, her first 45 minutes since the Euro 2025 final. Leah Williamson’s absence was also felt, not only in the leadership she brings as captain but also how fundamental she is to the way England build going forward.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The young Chelsea forward has been one of the most in-form players in the Women’s Super League this season and has four goals to her name. She has struggled, however, to get regular game time for England and found herself occupying the bench at the Euros. While certainly an out-an-out No 9, the key strength of Beever-Jones is her versatility which gives Wiegman added attacking dynamism.She can play across the front three and has even been utilised in the No 10 role by her club manager, Sonia Bompastor. She started on the left against Australia and was the most dangerous player early on, while her goal was another illustration of her range of scoring ability. “I love playing for England no matter where I am,” she told ITV. “I don’t look at the stats, I just come here and focus to try and tell Sarina what I can do.”View image in fullscreenAggie Beever-Jones fires in the opening goal against the Matildas.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAWork to be done in the attacking thirdA strangely frustrating aspect from these two friendlies for England will have been the limited minutes they had to challenge themselves against a full-strength opposition. Brazil’s Angelina and Australia’s Alanna Kennedy both saw red around the 20th minute for denying goalscoring opportunities. “In a qualifier I don’t care,” Wiegman said with a laugh. “But in a friendly you want to play 11 v 11 as that’s the challenges you have the most.” It did, however, force the Lionesses to adapt against cohesive defensive units. They struggled to do so against Brazil, who dropped deep to defend their penalty area, despite having opportunities to equalise. England were much improved in the final third against Australia, particularly in the first half. But their lack of clinical finishing persisted despite the wealth of attackers they possess, and is an area where they can improve.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

Just over a month ago, the inevitable coronation ofShamrock Roversas Irish champions seemed such afait accompliyou could practically hear the faint, mournful wail of Derry City fans in the distance. Having dispatched the hipster threat of Bohemians and watched Derry slip up against Drogheda, the Tallaght titans needed a single, solitary point from their final five League of Ireland Premier Division outings to bag their fifth title in six years. Three defeats later, they are finding that point harder to come by than heatstroke on a wet and windy November night at their own stadium. Still, if Rovers can just draw their game in hand against Galway United at home this evening, they will finally be crowned champions.While their recent run of five consecutive defeats across the league and Tin Pot means bagging a point against a Galway team battling the drop is a far from foregone conclusion, Rovers can still afford to lose tonight and wrap up the league by taking a point from their final game of the season against Sligo. Should the unthinkable happen and the Hoops lose both their remaining matches, it almost certainlystillwon’t matter. With a three-point lead and a vastly superior goal difference of +11 over nearest rivals Derry City, the chances of them Devon Loching this title race are negligible. In the extremely unlikely event they were to ship a five- or six-goal hiding tonight, though, they would certainly be entering the puckered, unedifying realms of the Squeaky Bum.What was supposed to be a canter to the title for Rovers has come to resemble a sloth attempting to escape from quicksand but if their head coach, Stephen Bradley, is even remotely concerned by his side’s recent collapse in form he is hiding his anxiety well. While his players prepared for their 2-1 defeat against Derry at the Brandywell last Sunday, he and his assistant, Glenn Cronin, stayed behind to run the Dublin marathon. As the fathers of children who have been affected by cancer, the duo raisedover €50,000 for Oscars Kidsbefore boarding a helicopter that flew them to the game. “It’s very unlike us,” said Bradley of the unprecedented back-to-back league losses on his nine-year watch. “We want it to get done but obviously in the last couple of weeks it hasn’t happened. That’s life, that’s football, it’s just about getting back to what we do, winning games and everything else will be fine.”Despite their late wobble down the home straight, it has been a fine season for Rovers, who also have an FAI Cup final against Cork City ahoy and are still hopeful of making the knockout stages of Tin Pot. In centre-back Pico Lopes, they also boast the only Irishman on the planet likely to play in next year’s Geopolitics World Cup, where he is set to line up for Cape Verde. “We had to get him over the line because he wasn’t sure about leaving the bank,” said Bradley of the former part-timer turned international stalwart he persuaded to leave his “proper” job to come and play for Rovers. Now the club has another line to drag themselves over and hope to do so tonight, at the fourth time of asking.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for hotMilk Cup coverage of Liverpool 1-2 Crystal Palace, while Michael Butler will be clockwatching the rest of the evening’s action.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Do you remember Stoke City when they made the throws?

Over half have issues with their breasts when undertaking physical activity, be that pain, movement or fear of judgment; 40% of girls during puberty have urinary stress incontinence.“You ask girls to use their bodies and then their bodies do things that don’t feel like they work with sport; like having a period, like developing breasts, like leaking urine when you’re jumping around. But we don’t create an environment that says ‘this is normal and here’s what we can do about it’. If we can get that right we’d be on a winning streak.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A question mark also hangs over the 27‑year‑old Sophia Dunkley, whose highest score all tournament was 22. “We do need to improve our batting – I don’t think it’s been consistent enough at times,” Edwards said.Edwards said she was proud of the progress England had made since she took on the head coach role six months ago, but emphasised she needed to be given time to embed changes. “I’m a winner. I don’t like losing. But equally I knew what I took on with this role – I knew it wasn’t going to be a quick fix.”Sciver-Brunt agreed with her head coach’s assessment: “We’ve come a long way since the summer. We’re a different side from then, and we’ve learned a lot about ourselves. This will hurt, but hopefully in time we’ll be able to learn from it and come back stronger.”England’s defeat was inflicted after the South Africa captain, Laura Wolvaardt, struck 169 from 143 balls – a knock she described as her best in one-day international cricket.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Manager John Schneider insisted afterwards that the Dodgers “won a game, not the World Series”. Twenty-three hours later, his team offered emphatic proof.The Dodgers again struck first. Max Muncy walked in the second inning, advanced on a single and scored on Kiké Hernández’s sacrifice fly. But the early breakthrough did not rattle a Toronto team that led Major LeagueBaseballwith 49 comeback wins this season.They answered immediately in the third. Nathan Lukes lined a one-out single to centre and Guerrero stepped in hunting a breaking ball.Shohei Ohtanileft a sweeper up and Guerrero sent it screaming over the left-center wall. It was his first extra-base hit of the World Series and his seventh home run this postseason – a new club record – restoring the Blue Jays’ advantage after 13 scoreless innings and changing the tone of the night.That swing also halted Ohtani’s history-making streak of 11 consecutive plate appearances reaching base. The two-way phenomenon had smashed two homers and reached safely a record nine times in the Dodgers’ Game 3 walk-off. But on Tuesday, he started on short rest – his shortest ever – after requiring an IV to recover from the previous marathon.Ohtani’s fastball velocity sat below his seasonal average and he labored more as the game wore on. Even so, he showed flashes of his usual command, retiring 11 of 12 after Guerrero’s blast and striking out six. He even drew a walk in the first inning to extend hisWorld Seriesrecord. But the Blue Jays made him work: six hits and four runs were charged to him in six-plus innings.The bigger problem for Los Angeles was what followed when Ohtani finally ran out of steam.View image in fullscreenFans take in the action during Game 4 of the World Series.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPADaulton Varsho opened the seventh inning with a clean single to right, and Ernie Clement drilled a double off the wall to put two on with no outs. Dave Roberts had little choice but to pull Ohtani, who departed to a standing ovation from the home crowd. The Dodgers’ relief corps could not finish the escape.Anthony Banda inherited the mess and immediately fell behind. Andrés Giménez battled to a full count before driving in Varsho with a single to left. Ty France followed with a groundout to make it 4-1, and that was enough to knock Banda out of the game. Blake Treinen came in next but also failed to stem the momentum: Bo Bichette and Addison Barger punched RBI singles through the infield, completing a four-run barrage that pushed the margin to 6-1.The Blue Jays’ ability to absorb early blows and respond has defined their entire run. They once again did it without George Springer, the injured leadoff man who left Game 3 after tweaking his right side.Bieber, meanwhile, was everything Toronto required. Acquired mid-season while finishing rehab from Tommy John surgery, the former Cy Young winner stranded multiple runners and quieted the Dodgers’ dangerous lineup. He allowed one run on four hits and three walks before Schneider called on rookie left-hander Mason Fluharty to face the heart of the order in the sixth. Fluharty needed just four pitches to retire Max Muncy and Tommy Edman, preserving a fragile lead that soon grew comfortable.View image in fullscreenShohei Ohtani of the Dodgers throws a pitch during the third inning.Photograph: Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesConverted starter Chris Bassitt then worked a clean seventh and eighth as the Dodgers’ bats continued to sputter. Los Angeles have scored only three runs over their last 20 innings, an abrupt slowdown for a team that ranked among baseball’s elite lineups all season.The Dodgers scraped a run in the ninth when Tommy Edman grounded out to score Teoscar Hernández after a walk and Max Muncy’s double put two aboard. But Louis Varland closed it down without allowing a rally to build.After a night when Toronto stranded a World Series-record 19 baserunners and collapsed after wave upon wave of missed chances, Game 4 was ruthlessly efficient. Six different Blue Jays recorded hits, five drove in runs and the team cashed nearly every run-scoring opportunity presented in the late innings.The win ensures the World Series trophy will be awarded at Rogers Centre, where the Blue Jays have not celebrated a championship sinceJoe Carter’s famous walk-off home run in 1993. They now know they are guaranteed a packed house in Toronto on Friday night – and possibly Saturday – no matter what happens next in Los Angeles.Game 5 looms with the series reset and momentum swinging north. Dodgers left-hander Blake Snell (3-1, 2.42 ERA) will try to arrest the Blue Jays’ surge. Toronto counters with rookie Trey Yesavage (2-1, 4.26 ERA) in a rematch of Game 1, when the Blue Jays chased Snell earlyin an 11-4 win.Explore more on these topicsWorld SeriesToronto Blue JaysLos Angeles DodgersShohei OhtaniBaseballUS sportsWest CoastShareReuse this content"

The message was clear: pitch around the superstar at all costs.“His performance was really good. He’s arguably the best player on the planet,” said Schneider.By the time Game 3 ended, Ohtani had become the first player to reach base nine times in a postseason game, surpassing the previous mark by three. Ohtani also became the first player in postseason history with multiple home runs, multiple doubles and multiple walks in a single game.Dodgers manager Dave Roberts praised the Blue Jays’ tactical decision, calling Ohtani “the best player on the planet” and noting that Schneider “smelled that and wasn’t going to let Shohei beat him at all.”“You just don’t see that type of behavior from opposing managers and that’s just the ultimate sign of respect,” said Roberts, highlighting the extraordinary lengths to which teams will go in order to neutralize baseball’s most dominant force.But the Jays’ Ohtani strategy comes with a built-in problem – the loaded Dodgers lineup that follows him. Even after intentionally walking Ohtani, who is the first player with three multi-homer games in a single postseason, the Blue Jays immediately face two former MVPs, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. It was Freeman, after all, who ended Game 3 with a home run in the 18th inning, marking the first walk-off win in the World Series since his grand slam ended Game 1 of last year’s Fall Classic.“There’s certain times where I feel like you feel better about someone else beating you,” said Schneider. “If that someone else is Mookie Betts or Freddie Freeman it still stings. But [Ohtani] had a great game and we’re just going to try to continue to execute.”The Blue Jays will be unable to avoid Ohtani in Game 4 as he is set to make his World Series pitching debut, in which he will try to put the Dodgers on the brink of a repeat title.However, despite Schneider’s pre-game comments, the Blue Jays did at least begin Game 4 by pitching to Ohtani. Shane Bieber threw two strikes past the Dodgers’ leadoff hitter but the end result was a familiar one: an Ohtani walk, albeit of the unintentional variety.Explore more on these topicsShohei OhtaniMLBWorld SeriesLos Angeles DodgersToronto Blue JaysUS sportsBaseballnewsShareReuse this content"

The companies are frequently gagged from alerting the affected customer their information has been turned over. This is either because the law enforcement agency has the power to demand this or a court has ordered them to stay silent.For Israel, losing control of its data to authorities overseas was a significant concern. So to deal with the threat,officials createda secret warning system: the companies must send signals hidden in payments to the Israeli government, tipping it off when it has disclosed Israeli data to foreign courts or investigators.To clinch the lucrative contract, Google and Amazon agreed to the so-called winking mechanism, according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian, as part of a joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand Hebrew-language outletLocal Call.Based on the documents and descriptions of the contract by Israeli officials, the investigation reveals how the companies bowed to a series of stringent and unorthodox “controls” contained within the 2021 deal, known as Project Nimbus. BothGoogleand Amazon’s cloud businesses have denied evading any legal obligations.The strict controls include measures that prohibit the US companies from restricting how an array of Israeli government agencies, security services and military units use their cloud services. According to the deal’s terms, the companies cannot suspend or withdraw Israel’s access to its technology, even if it’s found to have violated their terms of service.Israeli officials inserted the controls to counter a series of anticipated threats. They feared Google or Amazon might bow to employee or shareholder pressure and withdraw Israel’s access to its products and services if linked to human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories.They were also concerned the companies could be vulnerable to overseas legal action, particularly in cases relating to the use of the technology in the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.The terms of the Nimbus deal would appear to prohibit Google and Amazon from the kind of unilateralaction taken by Microsoft last month, when it disabled the Israeli military’s access to technology used to operate an indiscriminate surveillance system monitoring Palestinian phone calls.Microsoft, which provides a range of cloud services to Israel’s military and public sector, bid for the Nimbus contract but was beaten by its rivals. According to sources familiar with negotiations, Microsoft’s bid suffered as it refused to accept some of Israel’s demands.As with Microsoft, Google and Amazon’s cloud businesses have faced scrutiny in recent years over the role of their technology – and the Nimbus contract in particular – in Israel’s two-year war on Gaza.View image in fullscreenEx-Google employees speak about Google’s Project Nimbus at the University of California, Berkeley, in Berkeley, California, on 25 April 2024.Photograph: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty ImagesDuring its offensive in the territory, where aUN commission of inquiry concludedthat Israel has committed genocide, the Israeli military hasrelied heavily on cloud providersto store and analyse large volumes of data and intelligence information.One such dataset wasthe vast collection of intercepted Palestinian callsthat until August was stored on Microsoft’s cloud platform. According to intelligence sources, the Israeli military planned to move the data to Amazon Web Services (AWS) datacentres.Amazon did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about whether it knew of Israel’s plan to migrate the mass surveillance data to its cloud platform. A spokesperson for the company said it respected “the privacy of our customers and we do not discuss our relationship without their consent, or have visibility into their workloads” stored in the cloud.Asked about the winking mechanism, both Amazon and Google denied circumventing legally binding orders. “The idea that we would evade our legal obligations to the US government as a US company, or in any other country, is categorically wrong,” a Google spokesperson said.Quick GuideContact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Nothing has changed. This appears to be yet another attempt to falsely imply otherwise.”However, according to theIsraeli government documents detailing the controls inserted into the Nimbus agreement, officials concluded they had extracted important concessions from Google and Amazon after the companies agreed to adapt internal processes and “subordinate” their standard contractual terms in favour of Israel’s demands.A government memo circulated several months after the deal was signed stated: “[The companies] understand the sensitivities of the Israeli government and are willing to accept our requirements.”How the secret code worksNamed after the towering cloud formations, the Nimbus contract – which runs for an initial seven years with the possibility of extension – is a flagship Israeli government initiative to store information from across the public sector and military in commercially owned datacentres.Even though its data would be stored in Google and Amazon’s newly built Israel-based datacentres, Israeli officials feared developments in US and European laws could create more direct routes for law enforcement agencies to obtain it via direct requests or court-issued subpoenas.View image in fullscreenAn Amazon Web Services datacentre in Stone Ridge, Virginia, on 28 July 2024.Photograph: Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWith this threat in mind, Israeli officials inserted into the Nimbus deal a requirement for the companies to a send coded message – a “wink” – to its government, revealing the identity of the country they had been compelled to hand over Israeli data to, but were gagged from saying so.Leaked documents from Israel’s finance ministry, which include a finalised version of the Nimbus agreement, suggest the secret code would take the form of payments – referred to as “special compensation” – made by the companies to the Israeli government.According to the documents, the payments must be made “within 24 hours of the information being transferred” and correspond to the telephone dialing code of the foreign country, amounting to sums between 1,000 and 9,999 shekels.Under the terms of the deal, the mechanism works like this:If either Google or Amazon provides information to authorities in the US, where the dialing code is +1, and they are prevented from disclosing their cooperation, they must send the Israeli government 1,000 shekels.If, for example, the companies receive a request for Israeli data from authorities in Italy, where the dialing code is +39, they must send 3,900 shekels.If the companies conclude the terms of a gag order prevent them from even signaling which country has received the data, there is a backstop: the companies must pay 100,000 shekels ($30,000) to the Israeli government.Legal experts, including several former US prosecutors, said the arrangement was highly unusual and carried risks for the companies as the coded messages could violate legal obligations in the US, where the companies are headquartered, to keep a subpoena secret.“It seems awfully cute and something that if the US government or, more to the point, a court were to understand, I don’t think they would be particularly sympathetic,” a former US government lawyer said.Several experts described the mechanism as a “clever” workaround that could comply with the letter of the law but not its spirit. “It’s kind of brilliant, but it’s risky,” said a former senior US security official.Israeli officials appear to have acknowledged this, documents suggest. Their demands about how Google and Amazon respond to a US-issued order “might collide” with US law, they noted, and the companies would have to make a choice between “violating the contract or violating their legal obligations”.Neither Google nor Amazon responded to the Guardian’s questions about whether they had used the secret code since the Nimbus contract came into effect.“We have a rigorous global process for responding to lawful and binding orders for requests related to customer data,” Amazon’s spokesperson said. “We do not have any processes in place to circumvent our confidentiality obligations on lawfully binding orders.”Google declined to comment on which of Israel’s stringent demands it had accepted in the completed Nimbus deal, but said it was “false” to “imply that we somehow were involved in illegal activity, which is absurd”.A spokesperson for Israel’s finance ministry said: “The article’s insinuation that Israel compels companies to breach the law is baseless.”‘No restrictions’Israeli officials also feared a scenario in which its access to the cloud providers’ technology could be blocked or restricted.In particular, officials worried that activists and rights groups could place pressure on Google and Amazon, or seek court orders in several European countries, to force them to terminate or limit their business with Israel if their technology were linked to human rights violations.To counter the risks, Israel inserted controls into the Nimbus agreement which Google and Amazon appear to have accepted, according to government documents prepared after the deal was signed.The documents state that the agreement prohibits the companies from revoking or restricting Israel’s access to their cloud platforms, either due to changes in company policy or because they find Israel’s use of their technology violates their terms of service.Provided Israel does not infringe on copyright or resell the companies’ technology, “the government is permitted to make use of any service that is permitted by Israeli law”, according to a finance ministry analysis of the deal.Both companies’ standard “acceptable use” policies state their cloud platforms should not be used to violate the legal rights of others, nor should they be used to engage in or encourage activities that cause “serious harm” to people.However, according to an Israeli official familiar with the Nimbus project, there can be “no restrictions” on the kind of information moved into Google and Amazon’s cloud platforms, including military and intelligence data. The terms of the deal seen by the Guardian state that Israel is “entitled to migrate to the cloud or generate in the cloud any content data they wish”.Israel inserted the provisions into the deal to avoid a situation in which the companies “decide that a certain customer is causing them damage, and therefore cease to sell them services”, one document noted.The Interceptreported last yearthe Nimbus project was governed by an “amended” set of confidential policies, and cited a leaked internal report suggesting Google understood it would not be permitted to restrict the types of services used by Israel.Last month, when Microsoftcut off Israeli accessto some cloud and artificial intelligence services, it did so after confirming reporting by the Guardian and its partners, +972 and Local Call, that the military had stored a vast trove of intercepted Palestinian calls in the company’s Azure cloud platform.Notifying the Israeli military of its decision, Microsoft said that using Azure in this way violated its terms of service and it was “not in the business of facilitating the mass surveillance of civilians”.Under the terms of the Nimbus deal, Google and Amazon are prohibited from taking such action as it would “discriminate” against the Israeli government. Doing so would incur financial penalties for the companies, as well as legal action for breach of contract.The Israeli finance ministry spokesperson said Google and Amazon are “bound by stringent contractual obligations that safeguard Israel’s vital interests”. They added: “These agreements are confidential and we will not legitimise the article’s claims by disclosing private commercial terms.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsGoogleAmazonIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just three months ago, the Silicon Valley chipmaker was the first to break through the barrier of $4tn in market value.In comparison, Nvidia’s value is greater than the GDP of India, Japan and the United Kingdom, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It has far outgrown its competitors in the chip industry, gaining momentum as numerous tech stocks have surged in recent days.Shortly after US stock markets opened on Wednesday, Nvidia’s shares touched $207.86 with 24.3bn shares outstanding, putting its market cap at $5.05tn. Ravenous appetite for Nvidia’s chips, seen as the most cutting edge in powering artificial intelligence products and software, is the main reason that the company’s stock price has increased so rapidly since early 2023.The US stock market has reached multiple record highs this week, buoyed by expansive investment in artificial intelligence.On Tuesday, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, disclosed $500bn in chip orders. The company also announced a partnership with Uber on robotaxis and a $1bn investment in Nokia, with the two planning to work together on 6G technology. In addition, Nvidia is teaming up with the US Department of Energy to build seven new AI supercomputers.Nvidia to invest $100bn in OpenAI, bringing the two AI firms togetherRead moreOpenAI’s expansive plans for scaling its AI infrastructure are also heavily dependent on Nvidia’s technology. Last month, Nvidia announced that it will invest $100bn in OpenAI as part of a partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI datacenters to ramp up the computing power for the owner of the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT.Huang and Nvidia have also gained the backing ofDonald Trump, who called the CEO an “incredible guy”during a speechin South Korea on Wednesday. The US president has frequently touted the company as a success story and suggested that he may allow a less-powerful version of the company’s Blackwell chip to be sold to China, a move that could potentially send Nvidia’s shares even higher. Trump alsohas a financial interestin the company – disclosing in a financial report that as of the end of last year he owned up to $1.3m worth of Nvidia shares.Trump said on Air Force One last week that he would speak with the Chinese president,Xi Jinping, about Nvidia’s chips.Hitting the new benchmark puts more emphasis on the upheaval being unleashed by an artificial intelligence craze that is widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs presented the first iPhone 18 years ago. Apple rode the iPhone’s success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $1tn, $2tn and eventually $3tn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The head of the IMF has raised a similar alarm.Part of the concern over an AI bubble revolves around the circular nature of some of the industry’s deals. Nvidia’s $100bn investment in OpenAI, for example, hinges on OpenAI’s own plans to buy millions of Nvidia’s chips. The need for these chips is also primarily driven by the tech industry’s desire to massively scale its computing power, even as there is growing concern from analysts over companies showing that they arefailing to secure revenuereturns on their AI investments and thatnearly all AI pilot programsin businesses fail.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)Stock marketsOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

His family laid blame for his death at the feet of Character.AI and argued the technology was “dangerous and untested”. Since then, more families have sued Character.AI and made similar allegations. Earlier this month, the Social Media Law Center filed three new lawsuits against the company on behalf of children who have either died by suicide or otherwise allegedly formed dependent relationships with its chatbots.As part of the sweeping changes Character.AI plans to roll out by 25 November, the company will also introduce an “age assurance functionality” that ensures “users receive the right experience for their age”.“We do not take this step of removing open-ended Character chat lightly – but we do think that it’s the right thing to do given the questions that have been raised about how teens do, and should, interact with this new technology,” the company wrote in its announcement.Character.AI isn’t the only company facing scrutiny over the mental health impact its chatbots have on users, particularly younger users. The family of16-year-old Adam Rainefiled a wrongful death lawsuit against OpenAI earlier this year, alleging the company prioritized deepening its users’ engagement with ChatGPT over their safety. OpenAI introduced new safety guidelines for its teen users in response.

California became the first state to pass an AI law that included safety guidelines for minors in October 2025, which is set to take effect at the start of 2026. The measure places a ban on sexual content for under-18s and a requirement to send reminders to children that they are speaking with an AI every three hours. Some child safety advocates argue the law did not go far enough.On the national level, Senators Josh Hawley, of Missouri, and Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, announced a bill on Tuesday that would bar minors from using AI companions, such as those found and created on Character.AI, and require companies to implement an age-verification process.“More than 70% of American children are now using these AI products,” Hawley toldNBC Newsin a statement. “Chatbots develop relationships with kids using fake empathy and are encouraging suicide.

She noted that four youths had been charged with terrorism-related offences this year as a result of 10 investigations.Since 2020, a total of 48 youths aged between 12 and 17 have been investigated on suspicion of terrorism offences with 25 charges laid.Barrett said 54% had been identified as being religiously motivated, 22% as ideologically motivated, 11% as having mixed or unclear ideology and 13% as having motivations yet to be determined.In one case in 2022, Barrett revealed a 14-year-old was investigated after they used Snapchat to post about issue-motivated violent extremism.The 14-year-old had access to firearms and explosives and a tip-off outlined they were planning a school shooting in Australia.Upon their arrest, police found a tactical vest, ballistic helmet and “extremist-type” drawings, Barrett said.The commissioner’s speech addressed the AFP’s ongoing investigation into the Adass Israel Synagogue arson attack, with Barrett claiming the suspected individual was allegedly also responsible for a number of tobacco shop firebombings.“That person is a national security threat to this country,” she said.“Of all the alleged criminals accused of threatening Australia, he is my number one priority, and I have tasked my most experienced criminal hunters to target him.”Barrett’s arrival as the AFP’s new commissioner after the retirement of the former head, Reece Kershaw, has also signalled a shift in the police force’s mission.The AFP will now exist to “defend and protect Australia and Australia’s future from domestic and global security threats”, resulting in more overseas actions and operations.One of those Barrett outlined was the AFP’s collaboration with Colombian law enforcement. AFP members were deployed in remote parts of the Colombian jungle to “deliberately destroy cocaine production laboratories”, she said.“The AFP has had enough of crime gangs targeting Australia and, where we lawfully can, we will work with local law enforcement to target criminals in their own back yard,” she said.“Just in the past couple of years alone, the AFP-Colombian cooperation has seized more than eight tonnes of cocaine.”The partnership with Colombian authorities has also resulted in the seizure of a weapons and explosives cache from narco-terrorist groups, used to attack police and military personnel.Barrett said the AFP helped authorities seize 295 military-grade grenades, 200 detonators, two firearms and ammunition.Explore more on these topicsAustralian federal policeAustralian security and counter-terrorismArtificial intelligence (AI)Australian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Choosing a cordless vacuum isn’t a decision that should be taken lightly. You’re likely to keep a vacuum cleaner for years, relying heavily on its ability to suck up dust, crumbs, mud, pet hair and any other dry spillages or sheddings that end up on your floor. Choosing the right model can be the difference between an effective cleaner that’s a delight to pull out of the cupboard and a dud that you dread having to unblock, detangle and clean after every use.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In this review, I took 13 of the leading cordless vacuum cleaners from a range of manufacturers and at various prices and inflicted the same cleaning tests on each one. That takes all the guesswork out of picking your next cleaner: I can tell you exactly which ones picked up the most mess.At a glanceBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251£539.17 at AmazonBest budget cordless vacuum cleaner:Vax HomePro Pet-Design£179 at AmazonBestcordless vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detect£549 at CurrysBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick Pro£398 at AmazonBest cordless/robot vacuum combo:Eufy Robot Vacuum E20£278.99 at AmazonBest handheld cordless vacuum cleanerDyson Car+Boat£249 at John LewisWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing technology and home products for more than 30 years. In the past few years, I’ve specialised in testing vacuum cleaners. During that time, I’ve tested more vacuum cleaners of various shapes, sizes and types than I’d care to count, from handheld helpers to heavy-duty dirt-shifters.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach vacuum was put to the test against flour, cat litter pellets and pet hair.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianMost cordless vacuum cleaners are designed to work on carpet and hard floors, so I tested them all on both. To do this, I weighed out spillages of flour, recycled wood cat litter pellets and pet hair. Flour and cat litter are easy enough to come by, but my dog doesn’t shed enough hair to test this many vacuums. So I’m also the proud owner of a box of sweepings from a friendly (but slightly bemused) local dog groomer.I gave each vacuum cleaner a chance to pick up as much of the spillages as possible, with a single push-forward and pull-backwards motion, and weighed the collection bins before and after.Most vacuums will collect more if given more chances to go over a mess, particularly from a different angle, but I wanted relatively tough tests that would truly differentiate one vacuum from another, so I allowed only a single sweep.I also tested the batteries by seeing how long it took them to run down from a full charge – at full suction and in each one’s most economical setting. I performed these tests with the floor head attached, where possible.Lastly, I tested the suction using a pressure gauge. While strong suction is useful, the cleaning tests were more important because other factors play a big part in the overall cleaning prowess. For example, a well-designed floor head can make a moderate sucker as good a cleaner as a more powerful model with an inferior brush or roller.All the machines I tested are being sent back to their manufacturers or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best cordless vacuum cleaners in 2025View image in fullscreenThe lineup of test subjects.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBestcordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£549.99 at Shark£539.17 at AmazonIf there’s one thing that makes cordless vacuum cleaners a pain, it’s the emptying: taking it to the bin and jettisoning the debris after vacuuming. And, if your family is anything like mine, you may have to do it before you clean too because someone else didn’t bother to empty it. That won’t be the case with this Shark vacuum, though: it empties itself. It’s also very good at cleaning.Why we love itThe Shark IP3251 comes with a base station that operates as a stand and charging dock. When you rest the cordless vacuum cleaner on it, it springs into life, opening the base of the vacuum’s collection bin and sucking its contents into a larger container, leaving the cordless stick empty and ready for next time. The secondary bin has a volume of two litres, so it can take a few empties of the 0.7-litre stick.That would all be pointless if the device itself wasn’t up to snuff, but it’s an excellent cleaner. Its floor head has a fluffy roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpet, and it works well on both surfaces, performing a literal clean sweep in my tests.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty got to work on the flour, pet hair and cat litter.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …I found it worked better if I held it lower while vacuuming on some carpets, with fins on the base otherwise catching when I pulled it back.

It also performed well in all the tests.Why we love itIt’s comfortable to hold and use, and simple to operate, with just two large buttons – one to switch it on and the other to boost the power. Battery life is displayed by a light-up ring and lasted a decent 34 minutes in our rundown test.Emptying it is straightforward, too, with a button to open the collection bin, while a pump action lifts dirt off the filter, so you don’t have to poke your hands in. It’s one of the few cordless stick vacuums that can support itself when standing up, so there’s no need to find somewhere to lie it down between cleaning jobs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Vax HomePro Pet-Design took to the floor to suck up the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the floor head is a basic single-brush bar, which is unsophisticated when compared with the alternatives you get on Shark and Dyson models. Still, for the price, it’s ultimately forgivable.Weight:3.5kgMax suction power (measured):19kPaBattery life (measured):34minsDust capacity:0.7lAdditional filters supplied?NoBestcordless vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detectView image in fullscreen£549 at Currys£549.99 at DysonLet’s not beat about the bush: this top-of-the-range Dyson is the most expensive vacuum cleaner here at full price. It’s also the best, making short work of all my tests. If it’s any recommendation, it’s the vacuum cleaner I used to clean up any residual mess when I’d finished testing the other models.Why we love itAs with Shark, Dyson provides a soft roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpets. However, it does this with two separate detachable floor heads, rather than rolling both into one. That means you have to switch heads each time you change surface, but it also means that they’re adept at their assigned roles.The hard-floor head has a green light that illuminates the dust on the floor as you clean. Not only can you see where you need to clean, but you can also witness what a super job the roller does of vacuuming everything up. The carpet-floor head has an anti-tangle mechanism that combs it free of long hair as it rotates.A dusting brush and crevice tool are inside the extension wand, so you don’t have to seek them out when converting to handheld mode. It also comes with a mini motorised tool that’s perfect for lifting pet hair from upholstery or just cleaning the stairs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Gen5detect tackled the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …its screen is useful to indicate battery life, but it also insists on counting how many particles of various sizes it’s collected – a feature no one asked for.Weight:3.5kgMax suction power (measured):31kPaBattery life (measured):56minsDust capacity:0.77lAdditional filters supplied?NoBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick ProView image in fullscreen£399.99 at JD Williams£398 at AmazonMost cordless sticks create a dust cloud when you deposit the contents of their collection bins into your dustbin. The Henry Quick Pro is the only cordless vacuum we’ve reviewed here that doesn’t do that because of its disposable dirt-capturing bags.Why we love itWe can’t emphasise this enough – it’s frustrating to vacuum the floor only to have the dust billowing out of your bin and back into the air when you empty it. With the Henry Quick Pro, you push a lever on the top, and the base opens, jettisoning the bag of collected rubbish out of the bottom. It leaves no mess and has the added benefit of no filters to clean.In my tests, the Quick Pro performed decently enough, other than on hard floors with the cat litter, which it pushed ahead instead of sucking up. That job would be better tackled by removing the extension wand and using the device with a handheld attachment. It comes with a comprehensive selection of accessories, including a motorised mini head for stairs and upholstery, a flexible hose and a useful handle extension for taller users.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Henry Quick Pro tackled the flour and pet hair but left some of the cat litter behind.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the bags have a plastic top that holds them in place inside the collection bin.

You’ll still need a cordless stick or upright cleaner for heavy-duty jobs, focused spot cleans and hard-to-reach places that robots find difficult. The Eufy Robot Vacuum E20 solves this by offering both devices in one package.Why we love itWhile I was testing the E20’s cordless capabilities, I also ran it as a regular robot.

It comes with basic handheld accessories (a crevice tool and a combo funnel/dusting brush), but also an extension wand and floor head to convert it into a full cordless stick.The floor head has a regular brush bar that proved very effective on carpet in my tests, picking up all of the cat litter and 98% of the flour. Pet hair was also plucked from the carpet, although some stuck to the roller bar as there’s no anti-tangle mechanism. It was less effective on hard floors but still performed well.It’s a shame that …it has a fairly small collection bin that’s fiddly to empty.

The result is a handheld device so powerful that you may wish you could also use it on the floor.Why we love itThe Dyson Car+Boat is a cunning repackage of theDyson V8. That model is now the bottom of the range of Dyson’s regular cordless stick cleaners, but it makes for a handheld unit that performs above and beyond expectations.It comes with three key attachments: a mini motorised tool for upholstery and stairs; a crevice tool for gaps; and a combination dusting brush and funnel. It’s a powerful combo that cleaned up my test messes with aplomb. I had to use the funnel rather than the motorised tool to collect cat litter, though, because there’s no way this smaller device wouldn’t just push them ahead.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Car+Boat devoured the detritus on the mat.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …you can stillbuy the V8, with the extension tube and attachments, for a similar price.

Previously, Dyson’s top-end cordless vacuums came with two interchangeable floor heads, which needed switching over as you changed surfaces.The new floor head has several design tweaks, but basically uses a brush bar with both bristles and fluffy strips so that it works with either surface.

These flick debris out from the very edges of skirtings and kickboards into the path of the suction.

That’s largely thanks to the lack of additional features you get when compared with the likes of Shark and Dyson. It performed well in my cleaning tests but generally proved better on carpets than on hard floors.It operates in either floor or handheld mode.

It’s useful, but possibly not useful enough to justify its higher-than-average cost.The overall build quality is excellent, though. I loved the spring-loaded filter-clearing lever on the back, which means you can empty the collection bin in a smooth single-push motion rather than the banging and poking you have to do with most other vacuums. This lever can also compact the rubbish as you clean to reduce how often it needs emptying.

It’s light and petite but has small attachments, too, which aren’t large enough to pick up larger particles. It doesn’t collect dirt as well as the best vacuum cleaners here, but for a fraction of the price, it does a reasonable job.The biggest problem was cat litter, which was sucking OK from the floor but caused a blockage after only a tiny amount had entered the collection bin. It was surprisingly proficient at removing flour from hard floors but failed to agitate my test carpet enough to replicate that success.

There’s no cable to unwind and no need to find a power socket – you just take the vacuum to the mess and get started.The downside is that they run on battery power. The batteries can last anywhere between an hour or so on light settings and down to a few minutes on full blast. They should last long enough to get around an average-size housein one go, but larger spaces might need a mid-clean charge, which can take a few hours (or an expensive extra battery).What should you look for in a cordless vacuum cleaner?All cordless vacuum cleaners will have a good go at your carpeted areas, but they work on hard floors, too. The best hard-floor models tend to come with a fluffy roller, which will be better at picking up dust from smooth surfaces, as well as a standard brush bar.One particularly good thing about cordless vacuums is that they tend to break down into handheld devices if you remove the extension wand. Check that the one you want comes with the attachments you need. If you have stairs you may like to look for a mini motorised tool, which is a bit like a miniature version of a regular floor head, ideal for vacuuming smaller areas, such as stairs and upholstery.Do cordless vacuums have good filtration systems?Yes, cordless vacuums quote high levels of filtration, with some claiming to trap even the tiniest of particles, such as pollen. However, emptying cordless vacuums that don’t use bags can create a messy dust cloud, so these may not be the models for you if you’re allergic to dirt particles. Filters also need regular cleaning, which is something you won’t be used to if you’re moving away from a vacuuming system that uses disposable bags.How to clean your cordless vacuum cleanerMaintaining your vacuum cleaner doesn’t stop at emptying the collection bin. There are a few other areas that deserve your attention if you want top performance and a long life from your vacuum.The first is keeping the filter clean. This doesn’t need doing after every use, but it’s worth keeping an eye on how dirty it’s getting and cleaning it before it gets too clogged up. Dyson recommends doing this once a month. With Dyson vacuums, you remove the filter by twisting it and lifting it out of the body of the cleaner, then rinsing it in cold water to remove the dirt. Let it air dry for at least 24 hours and check it’s completely dry before refitting.The filters on most other brands can be cleaned in a similar way, but some don’t like getting wet, so check your vacuum’s instruction manual if you’re not sure.The other problem area is the brush bar. Anti-tangle floor heads have improved things in recent years, but even these can be clogged up with hair, fluff and dirt over time. The brush bar can usually be removed from the floor head, and you can attack entangled hair with a pair of scissors. If the bristles are loaded with fluff, you can tease it out with your fingers or use an old comb.For a really deep clean, you can dismantle most vacuum cleaners and wash any non-electrical parts with a damp cloth. Make sure it’s all properly dry before putting it back together.What to do with your old vacuum cleanerWhile you might have decided to move on from your old vacuum cleaner, a working model could still hold value for others. It’s worth seeing if you can sell it locally or donate it to someone who can still get some use out of it.Alternatively, when you buy your new vacuum, ask the retailer about its WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment) recycling scheme. The UK’sWEEE Regulationsstate that companies selling such items must accept the device you’re replacing and responsibly recycle it.Lastly, you can always recycle it yourself. Your local recycling centre should have a section for electricals, and you can find your nearest atRecycle Your Electricals. Alternatively, check your local council’s website to find out about its recycling services and opening hours.The best window vacs for clearing condensation: seven expert picks for streak-free shineRead moreAndy Shaw is aconsumer journalist and technology addict.

First, it’s interesting to see what Dyson’s engineers have developed to try to persuade us that a £750 vacuum cleaner will be a vital addition to our lives. The other is that it usually pushes down the price of older models, which is great news for bargain hunters.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The V16 Piston Animal has several new features, the most significant being its floor head. Besides the introduction of anti-tangle combs, we haven’t seen such a departure from the status quo since Dysonlaunched its Fluffy floor headfor hard floors back in 2015. There’s arguably a good reason behind this conservatism, because Dyson’s previous designs have performed brilliantly in the cleaning tests I’ve put them through over the years. However, perhaps controversially, this model ditches the duo of brush bar and fluffy roller floor heads that have been a Dyson staple for a decade, using just one combination floor head for both carpet and hard floor.As I’ve already alluded to, the V16’s £749.99 launch price has already pushed down the prices of its predecessors. At the time of writing,some V15 modelsare reduced by £150, and the even more powerfulGen5detect(which launched at £850 just last year) has dropped to £549 at some places. The new V16 has its work cut out to persuade us that it’s better value for money than these reliable favourites.View at DysonView at John LewisHow I testedView image in fullscreenThe Dyson V16 Piston Animal’s performance in our mat cleaning test.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianI tested the Piston Animal in the same way I testedthe other cordless vacuums I’ve reviewed for the Filter. I started by measuring the suction using a vacuum gauge – somewhat problematic with Dyson vacuums because they’re programmed to cut out when the airway is blocked. It still gives an idea of their suction power, but can’t be used to reliably compare them with their rivals.Next, I tested the battery life by timing rundowns from a full charge, both in a vacuum’s most economical mode and at full power. I then tested the vacuum on a trio of troublesome spillages: flour, cat litter and pet hair. These tests are run on both hard floor and carpet, which makes for a useful comparison between vacuum cleaners, including recent Dyson models, such as the Gen5detect.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenEach cone in the head combines two brushes, one for carpets and another for hard floors.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianView at DysonView at John LewisThe new floor head is an intriguing proposition. Dyson has built its reputation on its vacuuming performance, and while suction strength and battery life play an important role in a decent vacuum, it’s the superlative performance of the two standard floor heads that have helped Dyson to stand out in recent years. The only downside is that you need to switch them over when moving from carpet to hard floor and vice versa.While the likes of Shark and Vax have tackled this problem by placing fluffy and brush rollers in parallel, Dyson’s new roller (which has the confusing name “All Floors Cones Sense”) uses two conical brush bars that sit side by side. Each cone combines two brushes, one that’s stiff enough to tease dirt out of carpets and another that’s soft and fluffy to lift dust from hard floors. The floor head automatically detects the surface you’re using it on and adjusts the rotation speed accordingly, for a gentler clean on hard floors. It also has a green light to illuminate dust and dirt on hard floors, which genuinely helps with spotting otherwise invisible dirt.View image in fullscreenSome of the included attachments.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianAlong with the new floor head, the Piston Animal comes with Dyson’s usual trio of useful handheld attachments: the crevice tool for getting into nooks and crannies; the combination brush and funnel for upholstery; and the Hair Screw Tool 2.0, which, although aimed at getting pet hairs off furniture, is also brilliant on stairs. Annoyingly for owners of previous models, the V16 uses new connectors, so you can’t use your old favourite attachments on this vacuum or vice versa.Scouring the specifications, there are a couple of other factors worth noting. The V16 has a larger collection bin capacity of 1.3l compared with previous versions that held 0.77l. This is something of a magic trick, with a redesigned interior mesh filter taking up considerably less room inside a similarly sized collection bin. There’s also a new dust compactor mechanism that helps to create more space in the bin without emptying it.It comes with an easier way of releasing the floor head from the extension wand, with a release catch now at the top of the wand as well as the bottom. That would have been more handy with the old floor head system, but you can still make good use of it if you buy the version withDyson’s Submarine floor washing attachment (£899).SpecificationsWeight:3.4kgMax suction power (quoted):315 air wattsMax suction power (measured):21kPaBattery life (quoted):1hr 10minsBattery life (tested):1hr 11minsCharge time (quoted):4hrs 30minsDust capacity:1.3lAdditional filters supplied?NoDimensions:25 x 26 x 130cmWhat we loveView image in fullscreen‘Automatic surface detection is a nice touch.’Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianAccording to the specifications, the V16 is Dyson’s most powerful cordless vacuum cleaner to date. We’ll have to take its word for it because, as I’ve mentioned already, Dyson cleaners cut out when their airway is blocked, and the V16 did so even sooner than the Gen5detect in my tests.Also improved is the battery life, which Dyson claims to have increased from an hour on the V15 to 70 minutes here. That’s in line with Dyson’s claims for the Gen5detect, but I found the V16 lasted even longer in my tests, managing 1hr 11minson its Eco setting, compared with 56 on the Gen5detect.Combining hard-floor and carpet cleaning into one floor head is a genuinely useful feature, because switching floor heads regularly can be quite annoying. Indeed, I suspect there are more than a few Dyson owners who don’t bother switching to their fluffy rollers because the standard roller bar does a sufficiently good job. This new floor head incorporates some of the benefits of the old fluffy roller, including the very useful dust light, and its automatic surface detection is a nice touch too.View image in fullscreenDyson’s Hair Screw tool was great at avoiding tangles.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt doesn’t have the same open-ended front, though, which seemed to help the fluffy roller trap and pick up everything from dust particles to larger lumps such as cat litter. Instead, it’s enclosed in a plastic shell similar to the standard floor head, except that it has a split down the middle with two brush cones, one on either side.We’ve seen a conical, anti-hair wrap concept before in Dyson’s Hair Screw tool, which has been included with top-end Dyson vacuum cleaners for a few generations. The idea is that it doesn’t just comb hair out from the roller, but also pushes it off the end of each cone, thanks to the single point of attachment and the diminishing screw shape.In practice, this worked a treat when it came to avoiding tangles. I tested it on my daughter’s bedroom floor, which is usually awash with long hair, and there was no sign of any tangling on Dyson’s new floor head. Annoyingly, it sometimes ejected clumps of hair off the end and left them on the carpet, though, which I haven’t experienced with Dyson’s previous brush bars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

With such a high price tag, it ought to be approaching perfection in my cleaning tests (just like its V15 and Gen5detect predecessors), but sadly, it fell short.In the cat litter test, I was left with more uncollected cat litter after a single forward pass and backward pull than I was with the Gen5detect, both on carpet and hard floor. The V16 was good at picking up pet hair, but no better than its predecessors, which are also excellent at this job.Flour was the most disappointing test. On both carpet and hard floor, the V16 Piston Animal failed to transfer about 30% of my test spillages into the collection bin. Some of this was left on the floor, particularly in a central smear where there’s a gap between the two rollers. I also found flour in various nooks and crannies around the floor head, including a surprising amount inside the rollers themselves.Dyson has designed the new floor head to reflect the angular shape of the cones inside, so it has a point in the middle and tapers back at each side. Without a straight edge at the front, it’s impossible to push right into the corner of a room, so you’ll have to use an attachment to pick up dust and dirt from such places.The vacuum has a colour screen that tells you how long the battery should last in minutes and seconds, which is genuinely useful, but it also flashes up information about how many microscopic particles it’s collected, of which I can’t see the point. New to this model is also a smartphone app, which I installed but didn’t appear to do anything useful.Warranty, repairability and sustainabilityView image in fullscreenSpare parts can be bought from the Dyson website.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianDyson’s cordless vacuum cleaners come with atwo-year warranty, which covers defects in the materials and workmanship. It doesn’t include wear and tear, blockages or replacement filters.All parts are available to buy as spares, from replacement rollers and filters to the main body of the unit. This means you should be able to keep a Dyson going for as long as the company keeps the parts available. To give you an idea of how long this might be, the oldest cordless vacuum that the Dyson website still has parts available for is the V6/DC56, which was launched in about 2013.TheDyson support websiteis good, with plenty of instructional videos available to demonstrate cleaning and maintenance. There’s also a full library of manuals available as PDFs and a helpline if you need to speak to someone. If you’re not inclined to fix your own, there are plenty of independent repairers who will service Dyson products and attempt to fix things for you.You canbuy a refurbished vacuum from Dysonat a reduced cost. They come with a reduced one-year guarantee and might have small scratches and blemishes from their previous owners, but are delivered in full working order.All Dyson vacuums come packaged in recyclable cardboard packaging.Dyson V16 Piston Animal: should I buy it?View image in fullscreenThe main body of the Dyson V16 Piston Animal.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianDyson’s latest vacuum cleaners are never cheap, and this one is no exception. However, new models usually perform better than their predecessors, which goes some way to justifying the price increases. That doesn’t apply here, with the new All Floors Cones Sense head failing to perform as well in my cleaning tests as Dyson’s previous models.That’s a huge disappointment for the V16 and one that makes it difficult to recommend. However, its arrival has conveniently pushed down the price of the better-performingGen5detectto its most affordable yet at some places – at least at the time of writing – and that vacuum is well worth a look.View at DysonView at John LewisFor more cleaning inspiration from the Filter:The best cordless vacuum cleaners for a spotless homeThe best robot vacuums, testedThe best steam cleaners and mopsAndy Shaw is a consumer journalist and technology addict.

I used to dread hair-wash days: the chore of shampooing, conditioning and rinsing my hair, plus the time – and aching arms – spent getting it dry again.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My clunky, bargain-bucket hair dryer of seven years was weighty, deafeningly loud, and took a painstaking 20 minutes to dry my hair completely. So happier days really did arrive when I switched it up for a new model.My current hair dryer uses a lightweight digital motor that’s not only far quieter, but is also powerful enough to dry my hair in just five minutes. It seems modern hair dryers have stepped up their game. Here, you’ll find the best hair dryers I’ve ever tested, from gentle options with diffusers for curly hair to ultra-fast models that shave significant time off your morning routine. You’ll also find expert hair-drying guidance from celebrity hairstylist Melissa Timperley.At a glanceBest hair dryer overall:Hershesons the Great£225 at HershesonsBest budget hair dryer:BaByliss Hydro-Fusion£29.99 at AmazonBest for curly hair:Panasonic Nanoe Moisture+£199.99 at CurrysBest hair dryer for sensitive scalps:Dyson Supersonic Nural£299 at John LewisBest lightweight hair dryer:Head Jog Futaria£99.95 at Salons DirectWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing beauty products for four years and have amassed a near-encyclopaedic knowledge of hair care. I’ve attended countless styling masterclasses, interviewed hair stylists, and completed a cosmetic science course where I learned exactly how hair growth, styling and care work at a cellular level.I’ve tested and reviewed more than 57 hair-styling tools – including hair dryers, curlers,hot brushes, wavers andstraighteners– from big-name brands and newcomers alike. And perhaps most impressively, I’ve walked away with my hair healthy and intact.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach hair dryer was tested for speed and sound levels.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianHaving researched the most popular brands and models, I put 20 hair dryers through their paces for this test. I also spoke to a hair stylist to find out what she looks for in a hair dryer, before cherrypicking the best 10 from my tests to include here.I used an anemometer to test each model’s maximum wind speed, which ranged from a measly 16 metres a second (m/s) to a mind-boggling 48m/s, and also a sound meter to measure noise levels from 15cm away.Claims of “enhanced shine or smoothness” aren’t quantifiable, but I did use every hair dryer to complete the same task, noting how long it took to rough-dry hair and then to finish. I also tried my hand at using a round brush to achieve a smooth, bouncy blowout. While I’m no professional at this, it did allow me to make a judgment about how easy a hair dryer’s controls are to use, how precise and versatile its settings are, and comfort levels over the course of styling.When testing was complete, I returned the samples to the manufacturers who sent them. If samples could not be returned, they were sent to the RedbridgeReach Out domestic abuse service, who provide support and refuge for survivors.The best hair dryers in 2025View image in fullscreenBlown away: the hair dryers vying for approval.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest hair dryer overall:Hershesons the GreatView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£225 at HershesonsTesting the Hershesons the Great hair dryer confirmed my belief that there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. This hair dryer perfects the basics and irons out any common niggles. It’s the lightest option I’ve ever tested, almost the quickest – and an easy recommendation.Why we love itThe Great hair dryer has four speeds, three heat settings and a cool shot. It reached a super-fast 38.4m/s in my tests, rough-drying my hair in less than five minutes, and leaving it soft and healthy-looking.You change the settings using buttons on the hair dryer’s handle, which can then be locked into place. This is unlike button controls on other models, which can be accidentally pressed mid-use.One distinctive feature of the Hershesons hair dryer, and something that goes a long way to justify its premium price, is its heat-proof mat. This will automatically switch off the dryer when it’s placed on to it, resuming again once it’s lifted. I found this invaluable when blow-drying my hair with a round brush, since I could plonk the hair dryer down to section my hair without having to faff around with the controls.Add on two concentrator nozzles, a diffuser, a fabric bag and a sturdier storage case, and the Great is a hair dryer that truly feels designed with the user in mind.It’s a shame that …it’s so expensive. Next to hair dryers with magnetic attachments, the push-on system here also felt archaic and made it more difficult to switch out tools.Weight (without wire):294gCord length:2.75mHeat settings (including cool shot):fourSpeed settings:fourAttachments:concentrator nozzles and a diffuserMaximum wind speed:38.4m/sVolume range:82-86dBBest budget hair dryer:BaByliss Hydro-FusionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£60 at Lookfantastic£29.99 at AmazonIf you ever struggle with frizzy hair after blow-drying, chances are you need an ionic dryer. This budget-friendly BaByliss option has a good range of speed and heat settings, a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser, making it suitable for numerous hair types. Furthermore, thanks to its 2,100W motor, its 26.4m/s maximum wind speed rivals some of the pricier options on this page.Why we love itIt was immediately clear that the Hydro-Fusion was well built and powerful. It rough-dried my hair in about 10 minutes, leaving it feeling healthy and totally free from frizz and flyaways. Despite this power, it’s quieter than many of the models here, too.Attachments securely clicked into place and stayed on without issue while I completed my round-brush blow-dry test. I found the hair dryer’s two speed settings offered plenty of control for more precise styling, and the cool shot came through quickly compared with other cheaper hair dryers I’ve tested. Once styled, my hair was bouncy and shiny, with a frizz-free finish that lasted multiple days.It’s a shame that …its design is pretty basic; there are no frills here. A few more colour options would have been welcome, too, but you’re unlikely to find a better hair dryer for the price.Weight (without wire):430gCord length:2.5mHeat settings (including cool shot):fourSpeed settings:twoAttachments:concentrator nozzle and a diffuserMaximum wind speed:26.4m/sVolume range:78-85dBBest hair dryer for curly hair:Panasonic Nanoe Moisture+View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£199.99 at Currys£329.99 at PanasonicAs counterintuitive as it sounds, this hair dryer adds moisture to your hair. Panasonic’s Nanoe technology creates microscopic water droplets that penetrate the hair’s cuticle to add extra moisture to the hair’s deepest layers. It claims this helps to reduce colour fading, flyaways, split ends and breakage.Why we love itI tested the Panasonic EH NA0J hair dryer after several hair washes and found its distinctive shape intuitive to use. For rough-drying, I used heat and the fastest speed setting (23.4m/s), and was impressed at how quickly the hair dryer worked its magic (in about 10 minutes).Compared with the other models here, the Nanoe appeared to separate wet clumps of hair into smaller sections, drying strands faster. Despite using the one and only heat setting, my hair felt smooth and healthy after a rough dry. And when attempting the round-brush blow-dry, the Nanoe set the style quickly using its cool shot.This hair dryer is particularly good at gently diffusing curly and coily hair types. The diffuser attachment locks securely on to the front of the body, and its long prongs are well designed to spread air gently from the root to the tip of a curl. Add in its moisturising capabilities, and you’ll be left with soft, shiny, healthier curls with each use.It’s a shame that …it has only one heat setting. Instead, the Nanoe offers multiple modes: alternating hot and cold for preserving shine; a scalp care mode and a skin care mode. These won’t be right for every user, particularly if you like adjusting the heat levels manually. But if your hair needs extra nourishment, this hair dryer is worth a shot.Weight (without wire):460gCord length:2.7mHeat settings (includingcool shot):one (plus scalp care and alternating modes)Speed settings:threeAttachments:concentrator nozzle and a diffuserMaximum wind speed:23.4m/sVolume range:73-84dBBest hair dryer for sensitive scalps:Dyson Supersonic NuralView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at DysonDyson was once best known for its vacuum cleaners, but in recent years has cultivated a reputation for luxury hair styling tools. The 2016 Dyson Supersonic was the brand’s first hair care product, with a distinctive design that ripped up the hair dryer rulebook. And in 2024, Dyson launched the Supersonic Nural, which mirrors the original design but adds some handy scalp care features.Why we love itThe Supersonic Nural had to do some heavy lifting to justify its high price tag. It looks just like its predecessor aside from a small sensor in the middle, which controls the Nural’s new Scalp Protect mode. This tweaks the temperature of the air based on the hair dryer’s proximity to the scalp, ensuring you never burn your scalp or frazzle the delicate hairs at the hairline.As someone with a fussy scalp, I often find the highest temperatures of hair dryers too harsh, but this ensured I was completely comfortable throughout drying. At the same time, it dried the lengths of my hair without frazzling them or causing unnecessary damage. You can also switch this mode on and off if you prefer to control the temperature yourself.There are three speeds and four temperatures, and the button controls are intuitive. Its evenly weighted design was comfortable to hold, its motor was very quiet, and I found its magnetic attachments convenient and easy to use. I particularly liked the flyaway attachment, which quickly and comfortably smoothed down my frizz and flyaways after rough drying my hair.It’s a shame that …it’s very expensive and the hair dryer wasn’t quite as quick as others I’ve tested. It took about seven minutes to blow dry my hair, but I was grateful that it could take care of my scalp without me having to make adjustments. It’s easily the best option for those with sensitive scalps.Weight (without wire):485gCord length:2.8mHeat settings (including cool shot):fourSpeed settings:threeAttachments:concentrator nozzle, diffuser, flyaway attachment, gentle air attachment and a wide-tooth combMaximum wind speed:29.2m/sVolume range:75-81dBBest lightweight hair dryer:Head Jog FutariaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99.95 at Salons Direct£139.95 at AmazonThis is the fastest hair dryer I’ve ever tested, and weighing in at 304g, the Futaria is just 10g heavier than the lightest option – the Hershesons above. It was the dark horse here; I hadn’t encountered Head Jog before my most recent round of testing, but with its super-fast wind speeds of 43.8m/s and reasonable price point, it’s an easy favourite.Why we love itThe Futaria hair dryer packs a serious punch, rough-drying my hair in a blisteringly quick four minutes. Thanks to its three speeds and four heat settings, I could master a precise round-brush blow-dry without much effort at all. Personally, I found the wider concentrator nozzle best for styling larger sections of hair, which sped up the process even further.The digital motor also makes the Futaria relatively quiet, and despite its light weight, the design feels sturdy and evenly weighted, plus its rear filter is easy to clean and maintain. As such, this model is perfect for use in busy salons to reduce wrist strain and maximise time efficiency. And those of us at home will also benefit from the dryer’s sleek design, which is available in blue, pink and black.It’s a shame that …since it’s tailored to professional stylists, it’s not as widely stocked as other hair dryers. Also, those concerned about damage may find the knock-your-socks-off power a little much. That said, if you’re careful with the highest intensity settings and use a heat protection spray, you shouldn’t fry your hair.Weight (without wire):304gCord length:3mHeat settings (including cool shot):fourSpeed settings:threeAttachments:twoconcentrator nozzles and a diffuserMaximum wind speed:43.8m/sVolume range:78-84dBskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

According to the brand, the Parlux 3200 Plus (previously Compact) is the most widely used professional hair dryer on the market. I found it well balanced and comfortable in the hand and liked its tactile, retro-feeling switches.During testing, it dried my hair incredibly quickly, leaving a glossy, frizz-free finish. That’s thanks to the inclusion of Parlux’s K-lamination motor, which provides the power of a 2,800W motor while using only 1,900W. The hair dryer is available in a wide range of colours, and is a stylish option – if you can look past the box, which looks freshly fished from the early 2000s.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s heavier than other options here, plus it lacks the design refinements of more expensive models.Weight (without wire):588g;cord length:3m;heat settings (includingcool shot):three;speed settings:two;attachments:two concentrator nozzles;maximum wind speed: 26m/s;volume range:80-85dBCloud Nine the Airshot ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£299 at Lookfantastic£199 at AmazonBest for:quiet operationTaking both the highest and lowest noise levels into account, the Airshot Pro is the quietest hair dryer I’ve tested. In addition, my hair was left with gorgeous shine thanks to the Sericite-infused heat tech that features in Cloud Nine’s heat-styling tools.As well as offering a great range of temperature controls, with a continuous cool shot option, the Airshot’s magnetic concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachments proved secure and suited to a range of hair types.It didn’t make the final cut because …it lacks a dedicated cool shot button, and it’s not as speedy as others in this price range. Still, some may be swayed by its quiet operation.Weight (without wire):448g;cord length:3m;heat settings (including cool shot):four;speed settings:three;attachments:two concentrator nozzles, diffuser;maximum wind speed: 23.8m/s;volume range:75-79dBBellissima B-travelView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£49.99 at Boots£50 at AOThe dinky Belissima B-travel hair dryer is a brilliant option for trips and holidays. It has dual-voltage controls, so you can use it wherever you are in the world. Its folding handle and carry case keep everything safe in transit, and it feels very sturdy considering its price.Unlike most hotel hair dryers, which only let out a pathetic trickle of air, this hair dryer provides wind speeds of up to 18.9m/s – faster than some full-size options I’ve reviewed and highly impressive given the hair dryer’s light weight. You also get a concentrator nozzle for precision styling and two speed options.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s one control switch, so you can’t adjust the heat setting independently from the speed settings, and the difference between the two heat settings is negligible. Its travel-based use case is limited; for the same price, you’d be better off investing in an alternative with multiple temperature settings to use at home.Weight (without wire):305g;cord length:1.8m;heat settings (includingcool shot):two;speed settings:two;attachments:concentrator nozzle;maximum wind speed: 18.9m/s;volume range:79-84dBGtech DryOnicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£179 at AO£179 at CurrysBest for:precise temperature controlsOne of my biggest bugbears with hair dryers is that you never quite know how much heat you’re using on your hair. Thankfully, the Gtech DryOnic has a screen on the back that displays the airflow setting and its temperature. With temperatures that range from 40C to 100C, you can make precise adjustments for your hair type.I found the various airflow settings useful and liked how securely the magnetic concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachments fitted on to the dryer. After styling, my hair felt soft and hydrated, with minimal frizz.It didn’t makethe final cut because …it’s not quite as quick as others here at a similar price, and its 2m cord isn’t quite long enough for my liking. I also found it too easy to accidentally press the buttons and change the temperature midway through styling.Weight (without wire):426g;cord length:2m;heat settings (including cool shot):five;speed settings:four;attachments:concentrator nozzle and diffuser;maximum wind speed: 18.8m/s;volume range:78-85dBRemington Shine TherapyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£26 at AO£25.99 at AmazonBest for:tight budgetsThis lesser-known hair dryer is the sister product to the popular Remington Shine Therapyhair straighteners. It offers equally brilliant value and is designed to add shine to the hair using ionic technology.While difficult to quantify in tests, I found the hair dryer did dry my hair relatively quickly and left it shiny and smooth after a round-brush blow-dry. Multiple heat and speed settings, plus a concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachment, make it a good option for all hair types.It didn’t make the final cut because …of its short 1.8m cord and the fact that it’s pretty noisy compared with other models here. That said, it can’t be beaten on price and is a sensible choice if you’re hoping to upgrade an old hair dryer on a budget.Weight (without wire):449g;cord length:1.8m;heat/cool settings:four;speed settings:two;attachments:concentrator nozzle and diffuser;maximum wind speed:18.6m/s;volume range:84-89dBWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianIinterviewed Melissa Timperley, hair stylist and founder ofMelissa Salons, to discover her tips for choosing a hair dryer. “When it comes to protecting your hair and achieving the style you want, the tool you use matters just as much as the products you pair it with,” she says.What features should I look for?According to Timperley, the key features are adjustable speed and heat settings, which “allow for better control and protection, depending on your hair type and styling needs”. Look for hair dryers with a cool shot button, too, which “help to seal the cuticle and set your style”.Design-wise, consider weight, which is “especially important for longer hair or professional use” to prevent armstrain. Also look for a dryer that has a removable or self-cleaning filter, as “this makes cleaning and maintenance easy, which helps preserve motor life”.What to avoid when choosing a dryerTimperley warns that there are some features, or omissions, that could be detrimental to hair health. It’s best to avoid “single-setting dryers that don’t allow heat or speed control”, as well as low-wattage dryers under 1,800W, because “they often take longer to dry hair, exposing it to heat for too long”.However, some of the dryers I’ve chosen here are below 1,800W. That’s because these use digital motors, which are smaller and lighter than brushed motors and produce faster airflow. That means, in those cases, the difference in drying speeds is negligible.She also warns against buying “heavy, bulky dryers that are uncomfortable to use regularly” and “poor-quality nozzles or diffusers that don’t fit securely or distribute air properly”.Put simply, she says: “If the dryer doesn’t clearly list its motor type, wattage or heat settings, that’s a red flag.”What makes a hair dryer good for different hair types?Picking out the right hair dryer for your hair type can be challenging. “The best hair dryers cater to your hair’s specific needs – whether that’s smoothing frizz, protecting fine strands or cutting through thick, coarse textures,” says Timperley.For fine or damaged hair, Timperley advises looking for “lower heat settings and a ceramic or tourmaline dryer that distributes heat more gently”. For thick or coarse hair, “higher wattage and powerful airflow are essential – infrared, ionic and titanium dryers are great for cutting drying time without excessive heat”. And finally, for curly or textured hair, “a diffuser attachment is key, as is a dryer that offers heat control without sacrificing volume or natural texture”.What’s the difference between ionic and ceramic hair dryers?“Ionic hair dryers emit negative ions that help break down water molecules faster, reducing drying time and frizz,” says Timperley. “They’re great for smoothing and shine, especially if you have thick, frizzy or unruly hair.”Conversely, “ceramic hair dryers use ceramic heating elements to distribute heat evenly, which helps prevent hotspots and damage. They’re ideal for fine or delicate hair”.“Some of the best hair dryers,” says Timperley, “combine both technologies, giving you faster drying without sacrificing hair health.”For more, read the Filter’s guide tothe best hair masksSarah Matthews is aconsumer journalist who specialises in health and beauty reviews.

Political, unpredictable and replete with ass puns, Asses.Masses is, on the one hand, a fairly rudimentary-looking video game made by Canadian artists Patrick Blenkarn and Milton Lim with a small team of collaborators. But the setting – in a theatre, surrounded by others, everybody shouting advice and opinions and working together on puzzles – transforms it into a piece of collective performance art.Here’s how it works: on a plinth in front of a giant projected screen is a controller. In the seats: the audience. Whoever wants to get up and take control can do so, and they become the avatar of the crowd. The game opens with a series of questions, mostly about donkeys, some in different languages, and quickly it becomes obvious that you have to work together to get them right. Someone in our crowd spoke Spanish; another knew the answer to an engineering question; I knew, somehow, that a female donkey is called a jennet.This is what makes the game a collective experience. Usually, no more than one person has their hands on the controller but, nonetheless, everyone is participating as you guide a group of donkeys on a long, surprising and increasingly surreal quest to get their jobs back from the farm machines that have made them redundant.View image in fullscreenEveryone is participating as you guide a group of donkeys on a long, surreal quest … Asses.Masses.Photograph: Patrick Blenkarn + Milton LimOver 10 chapters (with, thank God, food and frequent breaks), we took control of a whole cast of amusingly named asses, ruminated on collective action, industrialisation and labour politics, debated over what to say and what to do, and laugheda lotat the cheekier parts. Without spoiling it, the show’s content warnings give you a fair idea of what to expect: references to violence, strong language, simulated sex (donkey), simulated sex (human), police brutality as well as references to drug use and suicide. I was amused to discover that this Glasgow performance prompted a mini moral panic from a group called Parents Watch Education, which the Daily Record seized upon under the headline “Parents slam show aimed at teens featuring simulated donkey sex, murder and drugs”. (The show is advertised as 14+, and very much prioritises humour over realism.)Asses.Masses is a thought-provoking game made worthwhile by its even more interesting means of play. It is also, and this must be said, a true endurance test. I had to duck out for a couple of hours in the middle to go and lie down for a bit; it has been many years since I have played any video game for eight straight hours. Thankfully, I brought a friend with more stamina, who filled me in on what I’d missed before I took up the controller for the final chapters. At one point, overwhelmed by the audience’s different opinions, I put the controller down, put my hands on my head, and silently empathised with every union or labour organiser who has ever had to corral and prioritise the ideas of an opinionated membership.The game could have done more with the idea of herd mentality – I’m fairly sure that few of our group decisions actually amounted to anything and, really, what we were mostly doing was watching someone else play the game rather than actively participating. It was, in that sense, like a live Twitch stream. Theatre people tend to get very excited about anything that incorporates video game elements into performances, but I often wonder if that’s because they aren’t necessarily familiar with the mass participation and crowd dynamics that video gamesalwaysinspire, whether through multiplayer, streaming, or just spirited online conversation.View image in fullscreenA thought-provoking game and a true endurance test … the crowd at Asses.Masses.Photograph: undefined/Patrick Blenkarn + Milton LimIt made me want to invite friends round my house and pass the controller around all day like we used to in our early 20s. My friend was reminded of a video game book club she used to run, where six people would play through a game such as What Remains of Edith Finch together (and laugh at it, in that specific instance). Asses.Masses is specifically designed around collective play, but I can think of plenty more shortish, thought-provoking games that could be staged like this, and that would inspire an interesting reaction from audiences. And if the number of people who engage with Twitch is any indication, I think a lot of people would come.Stumbling out of the theatre and into the rainy Glasgow night, I felt a real sense of camaraderie with the small crowd I’d been playing with. Often when I finish a game, I’m on my own in the living room in the middle of the night, while my family sleeps, and I have nobody to turn to to discuss it with. This time, I had a whole group of people to debrief with, and it reminded me that it is always the addition of human players that animates games with soul.Assess.Masses ison aglobal tour till September 2026What to playView image in fullscreenSpooky but not too scary … Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival.Photograph: Adam Robinson-YuI have two spooky (but not too scary, because I’m a wuss) recommendations for Halloween week.

Specifically: a remake of the original (and best, don’t @ me) Halo: Combat Evolved will be releasing on all platforms next year, with Xbox’s execs peddling the line that console exclusives are now simply outdated. Asformer Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra put it: “Go tell Nintendo that.”A report fromBusiness Insideroutlines how EA’s management has been asking its employees to use itsin-house AI“for almost everything”, from coding to conversations about promotions. Several employees expressed concerns that they are essentially being paid to train their replacements, and generating even more work for themselves in the meantime in correcting AI’s mistakes.Following crossovers with everything from KPop Demon Hunters to Daft Punk, thenext big Fortnite collaborationhas been announced:The Simpsons, featuring a whole Springfield map as well as character skins.

The image, which appears to be AI-generated, shows President Donald Trump wearing the armour of Halo’s iconic protagonist, Master Chief, standing in salute in front of an American flag that’s missing several stars. In his left hand is an energy sword, a weapon used by the alien enemies in the Halogames. Posted in response to a tweet from US game retailer GameStop, the text accompanying the image reads “Power to the Players” in reference to the store’s slogan.GameStop and the White House exchanged anotherHalomeme or two, and then, on 27 October, the official Department of Homeland Security X account joined in – using Halo imagery of a futuristic soldier in an alien world to encourage people to join its increasingly militaristic Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). Stop the Flood, this one reads, equating the US’s immigrant population with the parasitic aliens that Master Chief eliminates.“Yet another war ended under President Trump’s watch – only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J Trump,” said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai over email, when I asked for the official line on this post. “That’s why he’s hugely popular with the American people and American gamers.” (Microsoft has not replied to any requests for comment.)View image in fullscreenThe White House’s image on X of Donald Trump as Halo video game protagonist Master Chief.Photograph: @WhiteHouse on XThis spate of sharing video game imagery may seem odd, but Trump and his various allies have been leaning into gamer culture for nearly a decade. Trump has courted gamers – a demographic that includes a significant subsection of disaffected young men – since his first presidential campaign. Media executiveSteve Bannonjoined that campaign as chief strategist and senior counsellor in August 2016, bringing with him a wealth of knowledge of video game culture and the online behaviour of its biggest fans.Bannon had previously worked with and secured funding for Internet Gaming Entertainment, a Hong Kong company thatpaid Chinese workers low wages to farm goldin the multiplayer game World of Warcraft. According to Joshua Green’s book on Bannon(Devil’s Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency), it was during this time that Bannon learned that “these guys, these rootless white males, had monster power”. In 2014, Bannon watched asGamergate, an amorphous online army massing in the darker corners of the web, routinely targeted women and other people marginalised in the video game industry. He saw how the movement’s behaviour led to real-world actions, such as organised harassment and doxing (the sharing of private information with the public).Once Bannon joined the Trump campaign, he leveraged his understanding of gamer culture to push Trump’s presidential campaign to previously untouched places. “You can activate that army. They come in through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned on to politics and Trump,” Bannon told Green.That army was ready to engage in memetic warfare at any given moment, and it did. Throughout the campaign, Trump’s meme army monitored then candidate Hillary Clinton’s every move, sharingfabricated allegations of health problemswith the hashtag #HillaryHealth. It regularly produced memes supporting Trump based on internet in-jokes and nerdy pop culture references. Arguably, Trump defeated Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign with the help of this army.When Trump failed to beat Joe Biden in the 2020 election, he turned to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to regularly lambast Biden and the Democrats throughout Biden’s four-year term. He continued to court gamers and the online reactionary right, before winning the presidency again. The secondTrump administrationstill utilises the tactics and frameworks of online agitators (or trolls), but there’s one major difference this time around: Elon Musk.View image in fullscreenThe US Department of Homeland Security’s X post showing an image from Halo as part of its ICE recruitment drive.Photograph: @DHSgov on XThe South African entrepreneur bought Twitter in October 2022 and quickly reinstated Trump’s account and a host of others that had been banned. Musk, who regularly invokes gamer culture and posts memes on his own X account, and spent a few weeks earlier this year embroiled in a ridiculous fight over whether he was faking his gamer credentials(he was), loosened the restrictions on hate speech on the platform and boosted the exact kind of toxic gamer culture that the White House is now courting.Since Trump’s January inauguration, the White House and various federal institutions have taken up meme posting. Last month, theDepartment of Homeland Security’s official X accountand theWhite House’s official TikTok accountshared a video of ICE raids set to the Pokémon theme music, interspersing imagery from the animated show with clips of agents arresting people and using the “Gotta catch’em all” slogan from the franchise.ThePokémon Company International told the BBCthat “permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property”. The video is still up at the time of writing.The video game industry at large has long remained silent when it comes to the reactionary politics and ideologies spreading among its communities. For millions of Americans who play games, but are massively embarrassed by an administration that iswarning pregnant women against taking Tylenol, or pushing the narrative that immigrants are parasites, or that diversity, equity and inclusivity movements result in unqualified workers, watching this unfold is incredibly frustrating. The more the administration leans into video game iconography and internet memes, the more video game companies find themselves associated with the divisive and reactionary politics of the right – whether they want it or not.Explore more on these topicsGamesUS politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskHaloICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)featuresShareReuse this content"

But it wasDonald Trumpwho emerged the biggest winner. A $40bnlifelinefrom the US president gave Mr Milei’s beleaguered government just enough credibility – and apparent firepower – to halt the Argentinian peso’s slide. Crucially, this helped to stabilise consumer prices in the final weeks of the campaign. The US rescue engendered a short-lived aura of competence thatallowedMr Milei to shift the blame for rising prices back to the opposition, despite his own role in accelerating inflation bydevaluingthe currency when he took office.Mr Milei’s wasn’t a decisive triumph. His rightwing coalition got40% of the midterms votethanks largely to a low turnout and a fragmented opposition. His “chainsaw” programme of privatisation and public spending cuts has not been popular. Polls suggest thatsix in 10 votersdisapprove. Unsurprising, perhaps: since Mr Milei took office in December 2023, Argentinians’purchasing powerhas fallen sharply, real wages have declined and more than 200,000 jobs have been lost.Matías Vernengo of Bucknell University argues that without capital controls and new policies, Mr Milei’s so-called stability will end as previous neoliberal efforts did: in devaluation andcrisis. Prof Vernengo, who worked at Argentina’s central bank,blamesthe International Monetary Fund. It agreed a $20bn bailout to Argentina in April, underWhite House pressure, on the condition that Mr Mileiremovedforeign exchange controls. The following months proved why this was a bad idea. Argentina cannot use interest rates to stabilise its currency. Set too high, they invite speculative inflows. Too low and they encourage capital flight. Interestingly, Prof Vernengo favours temporary high interest rates to prevent the peso sliding uncontrollably.As long as the country can’t build dollar reserves through exports, any “strong” peso isillusory. Using recession and wage suppression to make a misaligned exchange rate “stick” is no panacea. That’s why Latin America’s third-largest economy requires foreign exchange controls and fiscal coordination for stable, equitable development. It’s either that or a forced devaluation for a more chaotic ride. Daniela Gabor, of Soas University of London, correctly says that Argentina isfinancially subordinatedto a Trumpian agenda. In effect, Mr Milei’s Argentina, which has borrowed heavily in a currency – dollars – it lacks, is continuing with self-defeating austerity to maintain access to $40bn in American credit. This is a Potemkin stability. Argentina risksbecominga Trumpian client state as Washington is directly intervening to prop up the peso.A developing nation should treat its current account not as a constraint to be financed, but as a strategic policy tool managed through accumulating dollars and an industrial policy. Argentina’s history did not begin with Mr Milei. Its first democratically elected president after the junta years,Raúl Alfonsín, attempted to protect living standards but was forced into submission byWashington’s threats, reportedly including one to block essential medicines. He was punished by isolation and forced into IMF orthodoxy. Mr Milei’s position is the mirror image of Alfonsín’s: instead of defying creditors and being penalised, he is submitting to them pre-emptively and being rewarded. But the mechanism of control is the same. History suggests it is a trap that Argentina will have to escape if it is to prosper on its own terms.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For instance, he hatesLetitia James, the New York attorney general who in 2022 successfully brought a civil fraud case against him and whom he has since urged the justice department topursue for mortgage fraud. But that’s just basic revenge – see also his pursuit of ex-FBI directorJames Comey. More interesting are the fleeting, trivial things that set Trump off, including his meltdown last week over aTV commercial from Canada.On the surface it didn’t seem like a particularly big deal: a TV ad airing on US television, paid for by the Canadian province of Ontario, in which an audio clip of Ronald Reagan denouncing tariffs ran over inspiring footage of the American west and industry. In a folksy voice Reagan explains: “When someone says: ‘Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports’, it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while it works – but only for a short time.” He then demolishes the premise of tariffs as anything but an instrument that “hurts every American worker”.Reagan’s words were taken from a 1987 radio address, and both Trump and the Reagan foundation instantly attacked the ad – in which some of the former president’s remarks were run out of chronological order – with Trump declaring it “FAKE”. (The sentiment of what Reagan said wasn’t altered.) Clearly, however, it’s not the edit that bent Trump so out of shape that, after the ad aired, he called off tariff talks withCanada– the only G7 country that has yet to reach a trade deal with the US – then doubled down by announcing he was “increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now”. This was temper, pure and simple – an expression of pique far outweighing the apparent scale of the insult that had clearly struck some very particular nerve.When it comes to analysing Trump’s overreactions, I always return to the delicious and staggering freakout he had at the New York Times columnist Gail Collins in 1992 when she referred to him as the “financially embattled thousandaire”. In the wasteland of Trump’s interior life, “rich” is probably the single most crucial pillar of his identity, and by suggesting that he had exaggerated his wealth, Collins cut as close to the marrow as it gets. Sure enough, Trump’s response was, for bizarreness, up there with Elon Musk calling the Thai cave rescuer a “pedo guy” for criticising his dumb submarine: hesent a copyof the column back to Collins with the words “The Face of a Dog!” scrawled over the picture.Trump wasn’t president then and had only harmless theatrics at his disposal. Obviously things are different now, and by threatening to raise tariffs to 60% onsome Canadian goods, Trump will probably hurt US consumers and workers for years to come, not least as Canada seeks to find alternative trade partners. What remains curious is what exactly in the ad so aggressively triggered him – and it has to do, I suspect, with the status of Ronald Reagan relative to the status of Donald Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in the years since his death, in the US Reagan has come to stand for unimpeachable political authority – and not just on the right – an American icon on a par with John Wayne and a symbol of the soul of the Republican party. At the end of the Ontario ad, a clip of Reagan recording the address shows him wearing a plaid cowboy shirt, and looking rugged and authentic.There is almost no point of comparison for Trump as far as this image is concerned. Burnished by exactly the nostalgia Trump has leveraged for his own political gain, Reagan’s words and image in that ad pitch the current president’s emptied-out, shiny-suited, barely Republican Maga movement against Reagan’s “Morning in America again” original – or at least against the modern spin on the original that has so much power today. Con artists are always aware, at some level, of their own fundamental fraudulence, which is why it can be so dangerous to confront them with the truth. I don’t think Trump’s excessive response at the weekend was down to a political disagreement about tariffs. Instead it was about a man suffering a brief, piercing and clearly quite painful collapse in his self-delusion.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionCanadaTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

And the deals keep comingWed 29 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 08.02 EDTShareIn Donald Trump’s first term, his son-in-law and senior adviserJared Kushnerwas omnipresent. He worked on criminal justice reform, Covid-19 vaccine development and modernizing technology across federal agencies. His portfolio extended to foreign policy, as he brokered a new North American trade agreement and negotiated peace deals in the Middle East. But when Trump returned to the White House in January, Kushner stayed out of the limelight and declined to take a formal role in the administration.A few weeks ago, Kushner re-emergedas a central playerbehind Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, which so far has achieved a ceasefire, an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory. Kushner took a victory lap, as Trump and others in the US administration gave him significant credit for helping negotiate a ceasefire after two years of Israel’s brutal war on Gaza. Kushner is being hailed as theconsummate deal-maker, a private citizen whose business acumen succeeded where career diplomats failed.But as in Trump’s first term, Kushner’s diplomatic work often overlapped with his business dealings, raising questions about financial conflicts. In fact, his potentialconflictsare even more conspicuous today. Kushner’s key role in brokering the Gaza deal, which includes a framework for the territory’s postwar redevelopment, cannot be separated from the investment firm he owns, Affinity Partners, which is overwhelmingly financed by the very Arab petrostates critical to the agreement and potential reconstruction – Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Together, these three states provided crucial support to Kushner after he left the White House in January 2021, investingbillions of dollarsthat allowed him to launch and expand his private equity firm.Six months after the end of the first Trump administration, Kushner’s newly created companysecured a $2bn investmentfrom Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. It was an unusually large stake, considering that Kushner and his firm had little experience or track record in private equity. In fact, the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, overruled a group of advisers who had objected to investing in Kushner’s new project. The advisers warned that due diligence conducted on behalf of the Saudi Public Investment Fund had found the firm’s early operations “unsatisfactory in all aspects”. But leaked internal documentspublished by the New York Timesshowed that Prince Mohammed dismissed those concerns, and he was more focused on using the infusion of Saudi cash to cultivate a “strategic relationship” with Kushner.It’s no surprise that the prince would want to reward Kushner for his steadfast support during Trump’s first term – and hedge the kingdom’s bets in case Trump returned to power. Throughout his first term,Trump tried to shield Prince Mohammedfrom blame for the 2018 assassination of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was ambushed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member hit team. Despite a CIA assessment that concluded, with “high confidence,” that the princehad ordered the killing, Trump and Kushner offered the Saudi regime continued political support andbillions of dollarsin US weapons sales.The scale and timing of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund’s commitment to Kushner suggests its $2bn in funding wasn’t driven by market forces, but rather a bet by the crown prince on continued goodwill from a futureTrump administration. A subsequent congressional investigation revealed that the Saudi leader did not earn a traditional return on his investment.In September 2024, as Trump was running for president, a US Senate committee found that Kushner’s firmhad been paid $157min management fees from foreign clients since 2021 without returning any profit to its investors. The Senate investigation, which was launched by Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon who chaired the finance committee at the time, showed that Affinity Partners hadcollected $87m in feesfrom the Saudi wealth fund. In a letter to Kushner’s company, Wyden questioned why the firm had not generated any profit for its investors, despite charging hefty management fees – and he raised concerns that the entire venture was a way for foreign powers to buy influence in anticipation of Trump returning to power. “Affinity’s investors may not be motivated by commercial considerations, but rather the opportunity to funnel foreign government money to members of President Trump’s family,”Wyden wrote.In December 2024, Kushner revealed that he had raised an additional $1.5bn for Affinity Partners from investment funds controlled by Qatari and UAE government officials. In a podcast interview,Kushner saidhe had “pre-emptively tried to avoid any conflict” by securing new funding from his existing investors before Trump won the presidential election. The added funds brought the firm’stotal assets to $4.8bnby the end of last year, nearly 99% of it from foreign sources. The increase in management fees raked in by Affinity has also boosted Kushner’s personal wealth, and turned him into a billionaire,according to Forbes.After Republicans regained control of the Senate in January, Wyden lost the finance committee chair position and his investigation into Kushner’s company foundered. With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, and a supreme court ruling last year that gave Trump broad immunity for official acts, Trump and his family are facing little scrutiny in Washington for exploiting the presidency to promote their business interests.Aside from being the primary funders of Kushner’s firm, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE also have deals at various stages of development with Trump’s family business. Those Trump-branded real estate projects, hotels and golf resorts are worthbillions of dollars. And like most foreign deals negotiated by the Trump Organization, the company won’t put up any capital but will earn millions of dollars in branding and management fees once projects are operational. As he’s done throughout his career, Trump continues tosell his nameto make easy money.The Trump administration insists that Kushner’s diplomatic work in the Middle East – while he manages an investment firm funded by three Arab monarchies – poses no conflict of interest. When a reporter asked about the appearance of self-dealing at a press conference on 1 October, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,snapped back: “I think it’s frankly despicable that you’re trying to suggest that it’s inappropriate for Jared Kushner” to help Trump negotiate the Gaza ceasefire deal. She added: “Jared is donating his energy and his time to our government, to the president of the United States, to secure world peace, and that is a very noble thing.”Trump also praised his son-in-law’s diplomatic skills, telling acabinet meetingon 9 October: “I put Jared there because he’s a very smart person and he knows the region, knows the people, knows a lot of the players.”It’s true that Kushner leveraged his relationship with Arab leaders, along with a family friendship with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to finalize Trump’s 20-point peace plan. And Kushner helped persuade both the Israeli government and Hamas to accept a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner swap, while delaying thornier questions to later negotiations.But even as he brokered the fragile ceasefire agreement, Kushner continued to negotiate business deals that benefit his firm and foreign partners – including Saudi Arabia, which the Trump administration was consulting as part of its emerging Gaza deal. On 29 September, the same day that Trump and Netanyahu revealed their Gaza agreement at the White House, Kushner and the Saudi sovereign wealth fund announced that they had reached a$55bn dealto acquire the video game publisher Electronic Arts. The game maker is dominant in sports gaming, and Saudi Arabia has made a push in recent years to buy soccer teams and other sports franchises.The Electronic Arts deal will require approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, a panel of federal regulators that evaluates large foreign deals which could raise national security concerns. In 2023, members of Congresslaunched an investigationinto the Saudi fund’s investments in US sports, especially the Saudi-backed LIV Golf, a rival to the PGA Tour.Will the Saudi interest in Electronic Arts face similar scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment under the Trump administration? That’s highly unlikely, considering that the president’s son-in-law will be one of the deal’s beneficiaries. TheFinancial Times reportedlast month that Kushner’s involvement could ease the sale’s path with US regulators.Unlike his central role during Trump’s first term, Kushner now seems to prefer serving as a powerful deal-maker behind the scenes in the Middle East. And with no formal job in the current administration, Kushner has avoided most previous criticism of his business dealings. He has no White House title, and far less oversight this time around.But he will probably remain at the center of negotiations about rebuilding Gaza, and reviving a potential diplomatic agreement between Israel andSaudi Arabia, a longtime goal of the Trump administration. And with little resistance from Congress, Kushner and the rest of Trump’s family will continue to reap the financial benefits of dominating the US government.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsJared KushnerOpinionTrump administrationGazaSaudi ArabiaQatarUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

The future of peace in the region depends on itWed 29 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 10.39 EDTShareDearDonald Trump,You still want that Nobel peace prize, right? You believe youdeserveit, don’t you? Even as yousendthe world’s biggest warship towards Venezuela,promiseto just “kill people that are bringing drugs into our country … they’re going to be, like dead”, andthreatenfurther national guard invasions of Democratic-run cities here in the United States.I suspect you aren’t helping your case for a Nobel right now. But I do have a suggestion for you. One that might guarantee you the hallowed peace prize that you so obviously crave in 2026.It’s super-simple: getBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to release 66-year-old Marwan Barghouti from prison in Israel.You remember Barghouti, right? Youtold Time magazineearlier this month that you were “literally being confronted with” his case “about 15 minutes before” they called you, that it was the “question of the day”, and that you would be “making a decision” soon.Be sure of this: many of the horrors the west allowed in Gaza will come closer to home | Owen JonesRead moreYou also told Time that the Palestinians “don’t have a leader right now, at least a visible leader … because every one of those leaders has been shot and killed”.For once, we agree! But Mr President, I do hope you realize that Barghoutiisthat leader. Described by theNew York Timesin the 1990s as one of the “young, charismatic and energetic” members on the Palestinian Legislative Council, today he commands support across the Palestinian political spectrum, from Fatah to Hamas, which hasrepeatedly tried(and failed) to get him included in their prisoner swap deals with Israel. He is, far and away, themost popularPalestinian leader alive. Opinion polls – and I know you’re a keen student of polls – have consistently found an imprisoned Barghouti beating all his rivals in hypothetical presidential matchups; in June 2024, he was even defeating the then Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in ahead-to-headby a landslide. A reminder: IsraelassassinatedHaniyeh, Hamas’s chief negotiator, in Tehran the following month.You want a unifying Palestinian leader with the stature and credibility to negotiate a proper peace deal with Israel in all of historic Palestine, and not just a ceasefire in Gaza? Barghouti is your man. In 2002, before his imprisonment, hewrotein the Washington Post he “recognized Israel on 78% of historic Palestine”, that he was strongly opposed to “the targeting of civilians inside Israel”, and that he didn’t seek to “destroy Israel” and wanted “peaceful coexistence between the equal and independent countries of Israel and Palestine”.Isn’t that the kind of Palestinian leader you and the US government could get behind? Isn’t that the kind of Palestinian partner thatIsraelhas long claimed to want?Of course, the Israeli government will tell you that Barghouti cannot be released because he is a terrorist; because he is servingfive cumulative life sentencesfor the murders of five Israeli civilians during the second Intifada. Don’t listen to them. An international observer sent to his 2004 trial in Israel, by the Governing Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, concluded in hisofficial report: “The numerous breaches of international law recalled in this report make it impossible to conclude that Mr. Barghouti was given a fair trial.”In fact, according to the report, only about one in five of the 100 witnesses called to testify against Barghouti during his trial were actually in a position to testify directly regarding his alleged role in the attacks – and none of them even accused him of being involved in them.Mr President, he wasnotgiven a fair trial – and I know how strongly you personally feel about people not being given fair trials. You havepardoned and freedhundreds of prisoners here in the US since January whom you believe were wrongly convicted and unfairly imprisoned. I don’t happen to agree with you on those pardons and commutations, but why not push for the release of Barghouti, too?The“Palestinian Mandela”,as he has become known, may be the key to the enduring peace in the Middle East that you say you want to achieve. Don’t believe me? Listen toRon Lauder, the pro-Israel president of the World Jewish Congress and one ofyourbig donors, who offered to travel to Sharm el-Sheikh earlier this month to try and persuade the Israeli government to include the release of Barghouti in the Gaza ceasefire deal. His attempt, sadly was rebuffed by Netanyahu. “A two-state solution is only possible if you have a good leader and Marwan Barghouti will be the right leader for it,” LaudertoldTime.Listen also to Ami Ayalon, former head of the Shin Bet, Israel’s equivalent of the FBI. Barghouti is “the only leader who can lead Palestinians to a state alongside Israel”, Ayalontoldthe Guardian in January 2024. “First of all because he believes in the concept of two states, and secondly because he won his legitimacy by sitting in our jails.”Listen to the Economist magazine, whichcallshim “the world’s most important prisoner” and the “one Palestinian who could help end the conflict”.Imagine the headlines you would get, Mr President, if you secured the release of “the world’s most important prisoner”. Imagine the crowds across the Middle East gleefully chanting your name in their tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands, if his release did indeed “help end the conflict”. They might even start naming their sons “Donald” in honor of your achievement. You’dreallylike that, wouldn’t you?I want to be very honest and blunt with you, Mr President. For the past decade, I have been one of your most ferocious critics. I remain skeptical of the Gaza ceasefire deal that you oversaw the signing of in Egypt. I also remain disturbed by yourconstant useof the word “Palestinian” as a pejorative, as a slur. Nevertheless, if you persuade (pressure?) your pal Bibi to free Barghouti from prison, even I will be forced to praise you.You suggested to Timeyou would be “making a decision” on this in the near future. Time is not on the 66-year-old Palestinian leader’s side. His familysayshe was beaten by Israeli prison guards last month as he was being moved from one prison to another. In August, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir,released a videoshowing him berating and threatening Barghouti inside his prison cell.If, God forbid, Barghouti were to join themore than 70 Palestinianswho have died in Israeli detention since 7 October 2023, then the prospects for a solution to the Israel-Palestine issue on your watch will slip away. So too will that Nobel prize.Pick up the phone, Mr President. Tell Bibi to release Barghouti. Then maybe get ready for thatcall from Norway.Mehdi Hasan is a broadcaster, author and a former host on MSNBC.

This is how democracy crumblesOwen JonesWe’re watching the Orbánisation of the US – and as in Hungary, control of the media is key to consolidating powerWed 29 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 08.36 EDTShareDemocracy may be dying in the US. Whether the patient receives emergency treatment in time will determine whether the condition becomes terminal. Before Donald Trump’sreturn to the presidency, I warned of “Orbánisation” – in reference to Hungary’s authoritarian leader Viktor Orbán. There, democracy was not extinguished by firing squads or the mass imprisonment of dissidents, but by slow attrition. The electoral system was warped, civil society was targeted and pro-Orbán moguls quietly absorbed the media.Nine months on, and Orbánisation is in full bloom across the Atlantic. Billionaire Larry Ellison, theOracle co-founder, and his filmmaker son, David, have become blunt instruments in this process.Trump boaststhey are “friends of mine – they’re big supporters of mine”. Larry Ellison, second only to Elon Musk as the world’s richest man, haspoured tens of millionsinto Republican coffers. Shortly after the 2020 election, he joined a call that discussedchallenging the legitimacyof the vote. His son, David, has a history of backing Democrats – but at one time, so did Trump, his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.In August, David Ellison’s Skydance Media acquired Paramount Global with financial support from his father, leaving him as chair and CEO of the new entity. Beyond a vast slice of Hollywood, this acquisition brought control of CBS News – one of the US’s “big three” networks. During the last election,Trump demanded CBSlose its broadcasting licence over alleged political bias and even sued the network over what he called a flattering edit of Kamala Harris’s 60 Minutes interview. His mood has since improved. Ellison is “going to do the right thing” with the network,Trump crowedwhen its ownership shifted. His optimism was swiftly vindicated: aTrump appointeewas installed as CBS’s ombudsman to monitor “bias”, and Bari Weiss – a former Democrat turned anti-woke crusader – was made editor-in-chief.Now, Trump officials are briefing that they are also in favour of Paramount Skydance buying Warner Bros Discovery, the parent company of HBO and CNN. “Who owns Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) is very important to the administration,”a senior Trump officialtold the conservative New York Post. The pro-Trump newspaper states that rival bidders will face “regulatory hurdles”, with WBD’s CEO forced to consider the Trump administration’s willingness to crack down on what it sees as rampant leftwing bias across the mainstream media.Larry Ellison, meanwhile, also leads a group of investors set to take over TikTok’s US operations, with other partnersreportedly includingRupert Murdoch and Abu Dhabi’sgovernment-owned investmentcompany. Although much of Trump’s own criticism of TikTok has focused on China, key Maga figures such asJosh HawleyandMarco Rubiohave called for the app to be banned over “anti-Israel” bias, and for shifting younger Americans’ sympathies towards Palestinians. Ellison is a fervent supporter of Israel, and has previouslydonated millionsto its military through the non-profit Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. They will be pleased to have him in charge.In 2015, Safra Catz, Oracle’s Israeli-American executive chair, and former CEO, reportedly told former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barakin an emailthat: “We believe that we have to embed the love and respect for Israel in the American culture.” Oracle willhave oversightof the TikTok algorithm.But this goes much further than the Ellisons’ acquisitions. Trumpthreatened Meta ownerMark Zuckerberg would “spend the rest of his life in prison” if he crossed him. The social media mogul has little to worry about now, having done his best to ingratiate himself with the administration. He abandoned third-party factchecking in the US, dropped restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender, and appointedTrump supportersas head ofglobal affairsand to the executive board. At the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post, columnist Karen Attiah saysshe was firedfor “speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America’s apathy toward guns” after Charlie Kirk’s assassination.Liberal comedian Jimmy Kimmelhad his ABC show suspended after the pro-Trump chair of the Federal Communications Commission demanded action. TheCorporation for Public Broadcasting– long deemed hostile by Trump – has been defunded and shut down.The administration took controlover which media organisations have access to the White House, ejecting the Associated Press.US media outletswere stripped of their Pentagon credentials after refusing to only report officially authorised information issued by the Department of Defense. Trump’s lawsuits against media organisations have further cowed them.It goes far beyond media control. Witness Trump deploying the national guard to Democratic strongholds andcentralising controlover elections. Republicans have launchednew gerrymandering offensives,while demanding thedenaturalisation and deportationof socialist New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, as Trump threatens to defund the city if he wins. In Hungary, too, Orbánslashed fundingfor opposition mayoralties. Opponents are threatened with arrest: the arch warmonger John Bolton may be politically loathsome, but the charges filed against him are the harbinger of worse to come.Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannonclaims there is a plan to circumvent the constitution to allow his former boss to take a third term.

Does married sex need a rebrand?Wed 29 Oct 2025 19.39 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 20.28 EDTShareIn my youth, when my friends and I first started dating people, nothing was off-limits when it came to talking about our sex lives. But now, after being married for 17 years, the closest I’ve come to discussing my sex life is with my obstetrician. Not hot.Sex talk isn’t off-limits when we’re with friends who are single, dating or in new relationships. So why is mentioning anything about sex in long-term relationships kind of cringe?I’m a sex educator. Here’s the biggest myth about desire in long-term relationshipsRead moreIt could be something about respecting boundaries and protecting our partners from scrutiny, but that logic fails. I have had deep and respectful conversations about partners with friends many times, and there is an implied understanding that in sharing this information, our opinions of our partners will not change. We discuss, we learn, we move on. This would also be true if we discussed our sex lives.The same could be said when it comes to other areas of our lives. We talk about our parenting fails (numerous) and wins, dissect work dramas and family dynamics. We come from a place of zero judgment and the base assumption that they are an amazing (yet potentially flawed, as are we all) partner, parent, employee, employer, son or daughter. Nothing is off-limits.Except, apparently, sex.My friends and I have been through a lot. There have been critically sick children, brain surgeries, sick parents, grief, IVF, miscarriages, organ transplants, cancer diagnoses, caring duties, redundancies. And while we talk about how these major life changes impact our relationships, identities, financial security, mental and physical health, sex never comes up.I’d much rather hear about you getting railed on the kitchen bench than your new granite benchtopIn the early days of our son’s cancer diagnosis I readRobert Delaney’s A Heart That Works, which explores the death of his young son Henry from a brain tumour: “[W]e were so crazy and scared and holding each other so tight, we actually wound up having sex, twice, a few hours apart,” he wrote. “I realise it sounds insane to say that we had sex twice while our one-year-old had brain surgery across the street. I would normally omit that very personal fact, which might horrify some people, but I am sharing it primarily for the benefit of other parents who might have been through something similar and were terrified and crying and nearly hyperventilating with anxiety. I guess we were just so scared and wanted to be so close, and the horror of what was happening around the block didn’t erase the fact that we loved each other, and sometimes that love manifests as sex, even in the absolute worst of times. It’s probably good that we did, because in the months to come, the fear and anxiety would not always be kind to our libidos.”It was a validation of sorts, and held up a mirror to our own lives. And isn’t that something we all need? When I asked one of my oldest friends whether she spoke to other people in long-term relationships about their sex lives, it reinforced that not talking about it was in fact a universal thing. This led to a deep discussion about post-miscarriage sex, trauma and what that means in the context of sex and relationships.It wasn’t sordid, prying or pushing boundaries. And it reinforced that, in the Venn diagram of Big Life Things, sex is a circle that overlaps with almost everything.‘I felt like I was his carer’: why straight women in relationships lose interest in sexRead moreDoes married sex need a rebrand? Even when I wrote the words ‘married sex’ my face did a kind of involuntary wince. There are plenty of (usually sexist) jokes about a lack of sex in long-term relationships. And sure, once you start shitting with the door open, it’s probably a sign your romantic priorities have shifted. But common wisdom tells us the more you do something and the older you get, the better you get at it. Practice makes perfect, etc. So why is there an assumption that sex in the throes of new lust is hot, but in long-term relationships is reduced to three humps in missionary? Surely the opposite is true!It’s possible I’m just a perv. But it seems as though married sex (I did the involuntary wince face again) or sex in long term relationships is seen as taboo, which just further stops people from talking about it. And honestly, I’m happy to talk about your house renovations and all, but I’d much rather hear about you getting railed on the kitchen bench than your new granite benchtop. I want to know you’re late for dinner because you had a shower quickie while the kids were watching TV. I want to know about your fantasies and self-pleasure and the impact of grief on your libido and the way terror and love and stress and boredom impact every area of your life. Because it’s important. Or because I’m just a perv.Natasha Sholl is a writer and lapsed lawyer living in Melbourne.

But there’s a way outSahil DuttaWith living standards falling and the far right on the rise, the chancellor has the power to make decisions, not simply accept diktats from the marketsWed 29 Oct 2025 11.49 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 14.46 EDTShareMore than three decades ago, James Carville, political adviser to Bill Clinton, made what became afamous quipabout the power of bond markets to “intimidate everybody”. Clinton had entered office promising to transform the US’s infrastructure, only to be told that big public spending would spook investors, drive up borrowing costs, and sink his presidency.Today, if there is one thing that Britain has in common with Clinton’s US, it’s that the bond markets loom large again in political discussion. Clinton shelved large-scale investment plans and slashed welfare in the belief that doing so would prove his economic credibility with investors. Likewise, in Britain, ever sinceLiz Truss’s botched mini-budget, politicians have continually pointed to the risk of bond market revolt as the reason why public investment can’t be afforded.The bond markets are inarguably important. Governments and central banks support public spending by selling bonds to investors on financial markets. When those investors lose confidence, demand for bonds falls, and governments feel compelled to pay higher rates to keep investors on side. When the cost of borrowing shot up globally after the pandemic, it hit Britain particularly hard. Having borrowed significantly tobail outthe banking sector in 2008 and again during Covid, the country’s national debt now stands at101% of its GDP. This imposes real constraints on public spending. But the idea of a funding crisis is overblown.For one thing, investor demand for government debt remains resilient, and the yields – the rates government pays to borrow money when issuing bonds – are less than they were through most of the New Labour era. If the government wanted to improve living standards, it could increase taxes and borrow to invest in local government, public housing and public transport. To try to limit the impact of an adverse bond market reaction, a supportiveBank of Englandcould use its own balance sheet to buy up government debt itself. By increasing the demand for government bonds, yields overall could be contained.This is all to say that governments have choices about how they respond to the bond markets, and these choices are guided by politics, rather than cold economic necessity. If the Bank still had to raise interest rates and hit leveraged investors and mortgaged homeowners with higher costs, other interventions – such as adjusting price caps on utilities and introducing rent controls – could mitigate the broader impact. Whatever path the government and the Bank take, there are winners and losers. The point is that who benefits is a political choice – not market diktat.At the moment,Labourand the Bank seem to have made their choice: contain public investment, keep growth of disposable income in check, and hope to lower interest rates. Ironically, this approach may be intensifying bond market pressure. Take Labour’s fiscal rule. While Labour believes this is a means of reassuring investors, it actually creates uncertainty for them. Twice a year, the government has to show it is on track to keep its promise that current spending will be matched by tax revenues, and debt will be falling as a proportion of GDP, which leaves the government having to make kneejerk changes to tax and spending when forecasts change.It’s a similar story with tax. The stronger a country’s tax base, the more secure and desirable its bonds are to investors. Since publishing its manifesto, Labour hid behind the fanciful idea that growth would naturally increase tax revenues, so that redistributive taxes wouldn’t be needed. The government is now facing up to a reality where GDP has grown just 0.7% over the last year. This is an opportunity to substantially overhaul the tax system, reducing the government’s need to borrow on the bond market and providing the basis to repay when it does.Another underlying problem is that we’ve come to see central banks as institutions that are insulated from democracy or people’s everyday needs. Instead, we think of them as institutions that exist primarily to keep financial markets happy. This is inherent to the design of the Bank. Shortly after the Bank was givenformal independenceto set interest rates in 1997, an independentDebt Management Officestarted to handle the issuing of national debt. This was justified, again, in the name of the bond markets. It embedded the idea that governments had the power to tax, but not the power to shape the terms on which public spending is financed.It’s worth remembering that this wasn’t always the case. From the 1930s into the 1950s, the Bank worked with the government to restructure the national debt and lower the interest payments the government faced on its war debts. The national debt was far higher than it is now, but a so-called cheap-money policy engineered by the Bank and the Treasury supported the war, and helped Labour rebuild the country once it was over. This approach continued well into the 1970s. More recently, the Bank bought up vast holdings of government debt to support Covid bailouts, again demonstrating how closely debt management is tied to government policy.Acknowledging that public spending is a political choice taken by governments, rather than one dictated by remote financial investors, is especially important now. The poorer 40% of households in the UK are set to see their living standardsfall substantiallythrough this parliament. Public investment is one urgent part of reversing that trend, but it will be far harder to do without fixing the foundations of public finance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At present, the Bank is costing the government around£20bn a yearin its handling of public debt, partly because of the interest it pays to private banks on the reserves created during quantitative easing, and partly because it is now selling those government bonds back into the market at a loss (these sales also risk pushing up yields).The government could change the rule that leaves it liable for losses the Bank makes on interest payments and bond sales, or it could claw back some of these costs with a tax on banks’ windfalls. The Bank, meanwhile, could pause bond sales when they are loss-making. Carville had another notorious line: “It’s the economy, stupid!” A truly healthy economy will come from a government taking responsibility for delivering meaningful change, not evoking the bond markets to avoid it.Sahil Dutta is a lecturer in political economy and co-author of Unprecedented: How Covid-19 Revealed the Politics of Our EconomyExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsBondsBudgetBank of EnglandLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

She told the audience at the Australian Business Economists annual dinner that thejump in the unemployment rate to 4.5%was “a bit of a surprise” but that “monthly numbers can be volatile”. She then concluded that it “is still pretty low, compared with where it was pre-Covid”.That is not a great comparison given that in 2019 all the talk was whetherwe were headed for a recession. But oh well, we’re still doing better than that, so no need to cut rates!Now the inflation rate means the RBA has an easy reason to ignore rising unemployment.Inflation in the past year rose 3.2%, up from 2.1% in the year to June. That was the fourth-biggest jump in annual inflation over the past 40 years.If the graph does not display click hereSo what happened? Where is our glorious inflation within the RBA target band of 2% to 3%?It is worth noting that the trimmed mean, which is the underlying measure of inflation that the RBA and those who constantly argued for higher rate cuts prefer to look at, is 2.95%. The weighted median (which is another way underlying inflation is measured) is 2.85%. Both measures are still within the target band. So let’s not panic.Things are still mostly where they should be. The CPI bounced up because, unlike the trimmed mean, it doesn’t get rid of the big jumps (or falls) in prices.The story this quarter was one of big jumps in electricity prices due to the end of the state subsidies.The rise in electricity prices accounts for about 15% of the total increase in inflation. That’s a pretty sizeable impact for something that only accounts for 1.8% of the average total of things we spend money on.Behind electricity prices was a jump in property rates and charges, and also new dwelling purchases, which is actually the cost of building a new home:If the graph does not display click hereOne way to see just how big of an impact the state electricity rebates have had on inflation is to look at the price of electricity in Perth and Brisbane:If the graph does not display click hereThe price of electricity in Brisbane in the September quarter this year was 1,694% higher than it was a year ago, when the state rebate was in full swing. That’s not because the price of electricity has actually risen that much, but the amount paid by households has because they no longer get the subsidy.Overall, we can see that the full impact of the rebates has essentially gone, with only the federal rebate still having an impact:If the graph does not display click hereNow, you might think this is a bad thing but the whole point of the rebates was to lessen inflation when it was high, and to come off when overall inflation is lower.Before the state electricity rebates came into effect in September 2023, overall inflation was growing at 6% a year. Now when they are taken away it is 3.2%. That is exactly how they were meant to work – take away the heat while prices are on fire, and then come back when things have cooled down.The good thing, however, is that overall most prices did not see a big jump. The inflation increase was largely driven by an increase in a small number of items that rose over the past year by more than 5%, while at the other end the number of items whose prices fell did not change.If the graph does not display click hereOne concerning aspect is that because the inflation is being driven by electricity prices, property rates and also rents, once again the prices of “non-discretionary” items are rising faster than the more luxury items.If the graph does not display click hereIn the past year, the cost of discretionary items rose just 2.4% on average. Given richer households spend more of their incomes on these items, it suggests that once again low-income households are the ones hurting the most. The lack of interest rate cuts will also least hurt those households that have either already paid off their mortgage or took it out back when interest rates were much higher.It’s worth remembering that both inflation and the supposed “cure” of higher interest rates can hurt younger and poorer households more than those who have plenty of savings to rely on.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsReserve Bank of AustraliaInflationcommentShareReuse this content"

Not only do they reportedly prefergoing to the gymthan the pub, andstaying at homeandgoing to bed at 9pmrather than going clubbing, now they arerefusing to sign upfor medical trials. Back (way back) when I was a lad, it was all pubbing, clubbing and medical trials. And I’ve still got the scars to prove it.TheMedicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencystates that all human medicines must undergo human testing before they are made widely available. This is mainly to investigate any unwanted side-effects. The cure for the common cold is no good if it also makes your genitals fall off. Alternatively, the side-effect may be useful when studied further: aspirin works as a blood thinner; some antidepressants curb nicotine withdrawal. It must have been a hell of a day when they tested Viagra and discovered some unexpected side-effects: its original purpose was to treat chest pain caused by angina.View image in fullscreenThe author undergoing one of his medical trials.Things have gone wrong, of course. The2006 Theralizumab clinical trialfor autoimmune diseases left all six volunteers who were given the drug with severe swelling, disfigurement and life-threatening organ failure. So, lots for gen Z – already a nervous generation – to worry about. But by not volunteering, they also risk missing out on new treatments that won’t find approval as trials stall. And they should consider that if medicines aren’t tested on young people, researchers could miss discovering side-effects that only occur in the young. Someone needs to have a word. And that someone is me, as I volunteered for more than my fair share of medical trials back when I was the age gen Z is now.At university in Nottingham, the Queen’s Medical Centre offered a smorgasbord of easy payouts. People running medical trials are only allowed to pay for a reasonable coverage of time and travel, and never officially as an incentive. But as a skint student, the amount of money I considered an incentive was somewhat lower than the regulators expected. You could spend an hour taking psychology tests for £20 cash – the price of a night out. I remember looking at weird diagrams, unsure if I was being tested for colour-blindness, or if it was a Rorschach test to see if I was a psychopath. You could have a new type of “invisible” stitching that disintegrated. Rumour had it that having your big toe amputated and sewn back on two weeks later paid out more than your student loan. True or not, I was genuinely tempted.I later lived in Sydney, where, having established myself as one of those journalists who would do anything for money, I was challenged to do just that. I got paid £20 to sit under an ultraviolet light for three hours at the Australian Photobiology Testing Facility to trial the effectiveness of sun creams. I got £35 to guzzle either a load of anti-ulcer drugs, or a placebo (I was never told which one, but mine tasted like Refreshers), at a Sydney cancer centre, give two blood samples and wee in a bottle. I nearly got paid £900 to eat Ropinirole, used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, over 10 weeks at the GlaxoSmithKline medicines research unit, but it involved giving up alcohol, which, at the time, would have been a clinical trial of its own.Male bias in medical trials risks women’s lives. But at least the data gap is finally being addressed | Caroline Criado PerezRead moreMy piece de resistance was when I answered an advert in the Sydney Morning Herald from the gastroenterology department at St George’s hospital, and got paid £200 to have a long, bendy, 17-lumen silicone tube stuck up my nose, down my throat, around my entire digestive system, and out of my bottom. This – need I explain – was to help study the relationship between distal ileal and propagating proximal colonic pressure waves.Getting the tube inserted made me gag like when Ed Harris’s character inhales liquid oxygen in The Abyss. I then had to push the tube one further inch up my nostril every 15 minutes. It took three days to achieve an “all-over body floss” and for the tube to come out, erm, the other side. I then had to lie still under an X-ray machine for five hours with the tube wired to a machine, watching films on a TV turned on its side (I’ve only ever seen Mission: Impossible 2 rotated 90 degrees), so the activity around my ileocolic junction could be measured, the results of which, I was later told, played a starring role in a conference in the US.Was it worth it? Probably – although for me the cash was a big motivation. Did I help humanity with the future of medicine? In a small way, yes – and that’s what should really matter. Would I do it again all these years later? Well, considering I now also prefer to stay at home than go out clubbing, probably not. But someone has to. Come on, gen Z.

I want a school that understands play is learningRhiannon Lucy CosslettIn England, young children go from glitter clay and building dens to classrooms a Victorian would recognise – and that system is failing many of themWed 29 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 10.16 EDTShare“Childhood doesn’t end the day you turn five,” Ruth Lue-Quee said to me on the phone as she shepherded her son to the playground this half term. “Playing is what children are born to do. It’s innate in them. It is how they learn.” The former deputy headteacher’spetition to make play-based pedagogya core part of the key stage 1 (KS1) national curriculum in England has garnered almost the required 100,000 signatures for debate in parliament.Observe any nursery or reception class and you’ll see what she means: kids roaming freely, modelling wet clay encrusted in glitter, playing pretend kitchen, banging on drums in the music cupboard. They’re interacting in an organic, self-guided way, moving around, using their imagination and following their own initiative. This is how the vast majority ofearly yearspupils spend their time learning. Yet the moment a child finishes reception and begins year one, the English education system essentially dictates that playtime is over.I’ve been touring schools for my son recently, so in some cases I have seen this shift from childhood to mini-adulthood take place before my very eyes. You exit a reception classroom alive with movement and chatter to enter one for the year above only to see a marked shift in atmosphere and environment. The children look so small to be sitting at their tables with a teacher standing at the front of the room delivering a maths or a phonics lesson. Like many others, I find myself wondering if we are setting them up to fail by pushing too much on them too soon, and by making them sit still when they want to move their bodies.This shift at age five makes England something of a global outlier. In Scandinavian countries, formal schooling is delayed until the age of six or seven. Perhaps surprisingly to some, high-performing Asian countries such as China and Singapore have systems that incorporate play as a key principle in kindergarten or lower primary. Even closer to home, in Scotland and Wales,play is a statutory partof their KS1 curriculum equivalents. In England, some headteachers, such as Tina Farr at her Oxford primary, are bucking the trend, but it is mostly the case that,to quote Farr: “If a time traveller arrived from Victorian times into a school they would recognise it immediately.”In her old job, Lue-Quee worked at three state primary schools in the West Midlands and so was on the frontline of the move away from play-based learning. In much of the western world, as in the UK, a gradual shift has been taking place for decades, against the advice of many teachers. But it was in 2014, with Michael Gove’scurriculum changes, that Lue-Quee noticed a profound shift towards more formal learning. She had tried hard to incorporate play in her schools. Working with a class of 30 pupils with severalSendchildren and some with limited English, she says that play-based learning provided an environment to develop skills many of them hadn’t yet secured. “It meant no child was in a classroom where they felt lost,” she said.Lue-Quee had introduced a role-play area in the form of a wooden “home” corner that the children could turn into whatever their imagination desired – a kitchen, a den, a space rocket – which had a “phenomenal” impact on their language development and social skills. There was also a creative corner – a space where children could access drawing, craft and art materials to play, create and build of their own accord, aiding their motor skills and helping them learn to hold pencils and write. When the school became an academy trust, the executive headteacher told Lue-Quee that these spaces didn’t belong in a KS1 classroom, and they were removed and replaced with desks.It wasn’t long before Lue-Quee quit to become aneducation consultantand campaigner specialising in the importance of play. Like many teachers, she felt these shifts in education directly contradicted thebody of researchon how play underpins the foundation of learning in childhood, fostering everything from social skills and language development to fine and gross motor skills, as well as aiding the literacy, numeracy, critical-thinking and problem-solving skills that so many politicians seem to think have to be delivered through top-down teaching methods. It plays an essential role in wellbeing too, offering kids physical exercise and helping them self-regulate their emotions and manage stress.Not only are English pupils being deprived of their need, and arguably their right, to learn through play, but also they are having to learn more formally and far sooner than their predecessors. In 2009, under Ed Balls, the school admissions code was changed, making it the norm for all children to start school at age four. Couple that with Gove’s raised learning expectations, and what used to be taught in year one is now being taught in reception – and to much younger children. It’s no wonder that it’s become quite common to hear parents speaking of wanting to defer the start of reception, especially forsummer-born children, because they simply aren’t ready yet.The Guardian view on early years education: new nurseries must be the start of something bigger | EditorialRead moreIn refusing to accept that children learn in specific ways, and by shortening the critical development stage for play-based learning, the English education system has gone badly wrong. Certainly the constant headlines about children not being developmentally ready to start school, the record numbers ofschool-refusing childrenand the inability of the system toadequately support Send pupilsseem to suggest that.Are young kids really failing – or is the system failing them? The hope of campaigners is that the Labour government will agree that it’s the latter and carry out urgent reform. Meanwhile, all parents like me can do is try to find a school that, when you walk around it, still feels alive with laughter and play, and hope there is a place for their child there.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEarly years educationOpinionEducation policySpecial educational needsSchoolsChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

The tragedy triggered the longestwave of proteststhe country had seen in a decade – a spontaneous uprising against corruption, negligence and the arrogance of power. One year on, the cracks in Serbia’s concrete have turned into fissures in its political foundations.The calamity cut deep for two reasons.First, every Serbian has a story about that station. Built in 1964 and reconstructed in recent years to serve the new high-speed line between Belgrade and the Hungarian border, Novi Sad’s station has long been a meeting place for the north of the country – a place where families and friends said hello, or goodbye. Only a week before the collapse, I had left my wife and daughters waiting in its shadow to buy water and snacks from a nearby kiosk. What happened to those 16 victims could have happened to any of us.Second, infrastructure is the regime’s pride and propaganda. For more than a decade, President Aleksandar Vučić’s ruling party has measured its success in kilometres of asphalt and track. Every election campaign features new promises of roads, bridges and tunnels. The forthcomingExpo 2027in Belgrade is the government’s showcase. But in Vučić’s Serbia speed, patronage and political gain are seen to comebefore safety or oversight.Novi Sad’s station, for example, has been ceremonially opened twice, in 2022 and again in 2024. The prominent March 2022 reopening took place during election campaigns in Serbia and Hungary: Viktor Orbán and Vučić stood side by side, a fitting pairing of two leaders whose regimes seem to compete only in their control of media, their disdain for institutions, and their courting of Moscow.This summer, Vučić inaugurated another motorway section even though part of it lacked a proper permit, and a tunnel had no automatic safety monitoring. The government’s solution was to suspend the tunnel-safety rulebook and station round-the-clock emergency crews – firefighters, police and an ambulance – at its entrance.The canopy’s fall did not create Serbia’s crisis; it exposed it. Over the past 12 years, the regime has captured every institution, hollowing out a democracy painfully built between 2000 and 2012. With courts, media, and regulators under party control, the street remains the only public forum. Since 2016, Serbia has seen near-annual protest waves – each one a training ground for the next generation of demonstrators.Since the huge Belgrade protest on 28 June, the regime has dropped all its masks. During regular protests across the country, police beat and chased peaceful demonstrators through the streets; nearly a thousand citizenshave been arrestedsince the uprising began. The state no longer hides its fear – it wields it.Vučić’s government likes to appear as if it sits on several geopolitical chairs, balanced between east and west, but in reality it runs the country for the president’s benefit, taking money from Brussels andorders from Moscow. The weaker Vučić’s party becomes in the polls, the more it relies on its core support, which largely pro-Russian, nationalistic and rightwing – and the more it leans towards Moscow. Such an ungovernable equilibrium carries with it the risk of instability spilling over, into the rest of the western Balkans.Russia’s grip on Serbia’s security apparatus remains dangerously underestimated. Its intelligence networks move with impunity, from the suspected training campsuncovered on Serbian soil– where operatives rehearsed chaos for Moldova’s election day – to the corridors of Belgrade’s own institutions. Meanwhile, the so-called “anti-protest movement” – a motley crew ofhired thugs and regime loyalists– borrows straight from the Kremlin’s playbook, a Serbian remix ofUkraine’s anti-Maidan.By late 2024, even before the fall of the canopy, the public mood had shifted decisively. Anational pollin September 2024 found more Serbs saying the country wasmoving in the wrong direction(47%) than the right one (46%). Since then, disillusion has deepened, to 53% versus 36%. Inflation remains above the EU average, wages lag behind costs, and debt, while no longer hitting new records, remains staggering. In response to the protests, Belgrade city council even made public transport free – a gesture emblematic of a broader trend of governing as if state resources will never run out, in a capital that was effectively bankrupt last year.Vučić’s Serbia now resembles a governmental Ponzi scheme: borrowing legitimacy through spectacle while deferring collapse. The US sanctions on the mostly Russian-owned Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), which took effect on 9 October 2025, threaten the country’s energy stability and an entire reindustrialisation growth model built on cheap Russian gas. The government’s ad-hoc response only underlines the absence of any coherent policy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Western diplomats still hope for calm: the EU prefers not to rock the Balkan boat while the war in Ukraine rages and Moscow stirs hybrid threats. But Serbia cannot go back.Ahead of the 1 November anniversary protests, several paths are possible, yet one thing is clear – the pre-canopy status quo is gone for good. Neither civil society, nor the opposition, nor the students will return to the staged “dialogues” that passed for politics before.Serbia’s students have joined a global gen Z front of defiance. Their refusal to be silent in the face of corruption and impunity shows that democracy’s renewal may once again come from the streets, and from the young.A year on, the system that brought down the canopy that killed 16 people still stands. The protests sprang from grief, but they now persist in the spirit of endurance. What Serbia has built in 12 months is not a new station but a new awareness – that stability under Vučić was never real. It was always borrowed time, a peace mortgaged against the next collapse.Srdjan Cvijić is a writer and the president of the International Advisory Committee of the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy thinktankExplore more on these topicsSerbiaOpinionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

This creates a generational mirror, with two-thirds of under-35s now voting for a progressive party.In contrast, Labor has managed to stabilise its generational decline, although the particularly strong 2025 election result may distort this somewhat. But it is Greens and independents from both the right and left who are picking up the scraps with their share of the under-35 vote.Tories have always taken heart from the adage that people become more conservative as they get older, but the impact of rising intergenerational inequity is that younger people are now acquiring little to conserve as they age.These demographics mean any Coalition leader, no matter how dynamic and focused, will always be swimming against a demographic tide.To be fair, Sussan Ley’s approvals have been no worse than most first term opposition leader; it’s just that her team is so hopelessly divided and lacking in direction and discipline that all she can try to do is bag her opponent’s wardrobe.Sussan Ley goes after Anthony Albanese’s Joy Division T-shirt as the Coalition tears itself apart, againRead moreThe proxy for leadership has become the Coalition’s dalliance with net zero, something that the Australian public still overwhelmingly supports but which inside forces seek to weaponise.As the traditional killing season for leaders approaches, a veritable Melbourne Cup field of contenders are jockeying for position, although most punters are not prepared to throw their money at any candidate, with “someone else” or “don’t know” harnessing more than half the vote.Which ONE of the following people would be the best person to lead the Liberal Party?Careful readers will note we have mischievously slipped the teal independent Allegra Spender into the mix and while she only outranks Tim Wilson, a separate question finds half of all Coalition voters wishing the Liberals would take a more progressive position in general.In those few short days after the federal election when the Coalition fractured, there was a credible scenario that the Liberals could invite the likes of Spender or the West Australian independent Kate Chaney into a unity shadow cabinet.Our figures suggest rapprochement with these community independents, either formally or at least in a realignment of core values, remains a condition precedent for the current Coalition forming anything resembling a majority.But the total collapse of the Liberal party’s left flank is just one of the structural challenges the party faces. The alternate chimera of a nativist majority fashioned on Maga, UK’s Reform and Sky After Dark seems more difficult in a system where compulsory voting centres political gravity.View image in fullscreenAnthony Albanese arriving back from his US trip wearing the Joy Division T-shirt.Photograph: Nine NewsWhy should Albanese care about the Coalition’s existential woes? Because as the leader of a major party he too has a stake in maintaining a two-party system rather than a new order of fragmented representation and shifting alliances.More immediately, an effective government needs genuine scrutiny and while it is true that the Greens still hold a narrow balance of power in the Senate, the lack of coherent friction with a government commanding such a strong majority does not make for robust policymaking.Compounding this challenge is the reality that Albanese’s internal triumph has seen his loyal left faction move to a dominant position within the government, removing the internal friction that anchors effective Labor governments in their social mission.From Jim Cairns pushing for a hastier retreat from Vietnam under Gough Whitlam, to the likes of Brian Howe and Carmen Lawrence driving the case for the social wage under Hawke-Keating to the internal debates on climate, asylum seekers and general sanity that Albo himself led under Rudd and then Gillard, internal progressive forces have played critical roles in Labor governments.But with the PM and his key factional allies controlling the castle, those voices have fallen silent, particularlyaround the Aukus treatywhere criticism has been outsourced to party elders like Bob Carr and Doug Cameron.A final question shows that for all the elite elation that Trump will honour this transfer of wealth and sovereignty, none of the key elements of the Aukus deal has majority public support, leaving a significant weakness in the government’s own defences.To what extent do you support or oppose the following outcomes of the meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Albanese?For all the things he has achieved so far in power, the one thing Albo lacks is an Albo; someone whose role is to keep the government on course by making his life harder from within.Friction is democracy’s richest source of energy. It’s not just the testing of ideas, it’s the mediation of power, through committees, inquiries, legislative debates and yes, elections that need a genuine contest.Look, if domination of the charts is the PM’s biggest problem, I don’t think he will be losing much sleep on the flight home. But for those of us who want to see a long-term progressive government, some democratic dissonance would be a welcome sound.Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that undertook research for Labor in the last election and conducts qualitative research for Guardian Australia.

Almost everyone regarded this as an impossible task. His remains had gone undiscovered for more than 500 years. It was a folly, a fool’s errand. She was out of her depth, an amateur. No letters after her name.But Philippa diligently did the work and did her research. She had an inner conviction that she would find him, and she did. It was a staggering achievement, and yet when the news broke of this startling discovery, and it was beamed round the world, there was little to no mention of her.I saw the Channel 4 documentary The King in the Car Park, which featured this woman I hadn’t even heard of. She was a little eccentric, odd even, and obsessive in her quest to find Richard’s remains. There was a disconnect between what I was seeing on screen and the headlines I’d read months before.I contacted her representatives and arranged to meet her for lunch. Her health was frail, and there was a vulnerability to her. The more Jeff Pope and I researched the whole saga, the more convinced we were by her absolute integrity.Man who won damages over Richard III film calls for more regulation of fact-based dramaRead moreWe set about writing a screenplay to tell the story of her journey from Edinburgh to Leicester andthe archaeological discovery of the century. A story which, it appeared to us, had been subsumed by bigger, louder voices.The resultant film, The Lost King, is one of which I’m immensely proud. It handed the megaphone to a woman whose story was largely unknown.In our film, Richard Buckley, the head archaeologist, is depicted as a champion of Philippa, but ultimately with feet of clay. Her ex-husband John Langley, whom I played, is seen as loyal, but sometimes impatient with Philippa’s obsessiveness. And then there’s Richard Taylor, the former deputy registrar at theUniversity of Leicester.We depict Philippa as imperfect and sometimes challenging. Ultimately, she is both ordinary and extraordinary. She also suffers from ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome), something she is open about and is shown in the film. Philippa’s ME and ongoing concomitant health issues meant that she was unable to testify at the impending civil trial to establish whether the film depicted Richard Taylor unfairly.I was looking forward to our day in court together, a chance for a judge to look at all the evidence and come to a fair conclusion. But Philippa’s absence meant we had lost our star witness and would have gone to trial with one hand tied behind our backs. No one wants to pressurise a woman who is unwell into doing something which could well make matters worse. Sometimes you have to fall on the sword.Consequently, we had to settle. Richard Taylor wanted to have the film altered or withdrawn. He didn’t get that. I’m pleased to say not one frame of the film has changed bar a clarification in the pre-title sequence. This card states that the Richard Taylor in the film is fictional and bears no relation to the Richard Taylor in reality who, as the card says, “always behaved with integrity”.View image in fullscreenSally Hawkins as Philippa Langley and Steve Coogan as John Langley in The Lost King.Photograph: Graeme HunterI noticed the University of Leicester’s website carries Richard Taylor’s statement in full, but not any of my statements. I’m sure that’s just an oversight. Philippa initiated the search for Richard III. Philippa determined the precise location in the northern area of the social services car park. When funding was withdrawn and the dig was in peril, Philippa raised the funds to ensure the project survived. When leg bones were exposed in the trench, it was Philippa who insisted that they be excavated. It revealed curvature to the spine and injuries to the head consistent with historical accounts of injuries incurred by Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth. In other words, it was him.Richard Taylor said subsequently in a podcast that he had to create a firewall between the university and Philippa. For that, I give him full marks. At the press conference to announce that the remains discovered were those of the king, Philippa was the 13th to speak out of 13 speakers.One thing is for sure, had Philippa been on the payroll of the University of Leicester, you can bet your bottom dollar that she would have been front and centre of all the university’s announcements. Not Richard Taylor. But as the University of Leicester liked to remind us yesterday: “She is an amateur”. Let’s face it, it’s always awkward when the amateur finds the remains of a 500-year-old dead king on your doorstep.Back of the net! Steve Coogan film roles – rankedRead moreRichard Taylor has suggested that there should be an inquiry. I would welcome any inquiry which affords the opportunity to look in detail at his and the University of Leicester’s behaviour during that tumultuous period.In the meantime, I’ll happily debate with Richard Taylor in a public forum on all the issues surrounding this saga. Our intention with The Lost King was only ever to give a voice to Philippa and her crowning achievement. That is something to celebrate.Richard Taylor is right about this having been a David and Goliath fight, except in our version, he and the University of Leicester are the Goliath, and the David is Philippa.The Lost King is available for all to see. I’m sure people will watch it and draw their own conclusions.Explore more on these topicsSteve CooganRichard IIIUniversity of LeicesterMonarchyLeicestercommentShareReuse this content"

A low, circular mound of fine, granular soil that rises to meet me, like a bulging ocean swell. Not a speck escapes its edge. An almost hemispherical dome of smooth, compacted clay, whose surface cracked as it dried from the mould it was cast in. The hemisphere stands on the floor like an igloo in the desert. Nearby, a wall of beeswax curves away, with a slightly peppery, honey smell. It leads me to a bristling stockade of tangled branches, foliage and autumnal berries. Inside, it suddenly feels like Christmas, which I doubt is quite the effect the artist was aiming for.American artistMeg Webster’s sculptures are round things disposed about a circular space that rises to a distant glass and iron roof at the Bourse de Commerce, originally built in the 1760s as a wheat silo and exchange. Later it became the Paris Commodities Exchange, and now the Bourse is home to French billionaire Francois Pinault’s art collection, which numbers more than 10,000 works. Dramatic, oddly vulnerable and beautiful, Webster’s art refers back to minimal art, but its materiality is somehow more primal than that. I last saw her work at theDia Art Foundation at Beacon, New York. Jessica Morgan, Dia’s director, has curated Minimal, working with Pinault’s vast collection and loans from other institutions.But this is less curating than wrestling, as much with the huge building as with the art. The Bourse is a kind of Tower of Babel, and Minimal is an odd mixture of solo displays, like Webster’s, and rooms where single works by different artists are bought together thematically, according to the rubrics Light, Balance, Surface, Grid, Monochrome and Materialism. Aside from spaces dedicated to Webster andOn Kawara,Robert Ryman, Brazilian neo-concretistLygia Pape(a compendious show in its own right) and the JapaneseMono-ha group, it often feels a bit rushed and perfunctory.View image in fullscreenOn Kawara’s Date Painting, made on 13 September, 2001.Photograph: © One Million Years FoundationThings begin well, full of promise and pleasure, as we’re plunged into a room occupied by a marvellous group of small, late paintings by Ryman, whose white aggregated fields of pigment jostle, nestle and nudge the edges of their coloured canvas supports. White sings against rust-red, a dirty khaki, a muted green. Ryman did so much with so little. His art is all about surface and volume, nuance and touch and knowing when to stop. A low, rectangular pile of wrapped white sweets, their cellophane catching the light, sits on the floor below Ryman’s paintings. An iteration ofFelix Gonzalez-Torres1991 Untitled (Portrait of Dad), the quantity of sweets (about 175lb, or 79kg) corresponds to the weight of the artist’s father. Visitors are allowed to help themselves to the mints. Gonzalez-Torres liked the idea that his art would leave a sweet taste in the mouth, to linger like a memory.Around the perimeter of the central space antique cabinets hang in the corridor, originally installed here for the 1889 Exposition Universelle. Each contains a single On Karawa DatePainting, in which white lettering and numbers denote the date of the painting’s manufacture. If the Japanese artist didn’t finish by midnight, he ditched the incomplete work. Below the painting, in a box, sits a page from the day’s newspaper, from the city where On Karawa made the painting. Beneath the painting dated 5 October, 1982, a newspaper tells us that Israeli planes have attacked Syrian missile sites. In the box beneath June 20, 1975 there’s a full-page printed advert for the movie Jaws, which opened in US cinemas on that day. The world passes by and we pass with it.Including works made between the 1950s and the 2010s, by artists working in the Americas, Europe and Asia, Minimal is not a show about minimalism as a movement so much as about the less-is-more, enough-is-enough tendency, and there is an awful lot of it here. This is minimal to the maximal.From the sparse and somehow dispiriting light works in the basement, where things flash and glow and look a little wan, up to the first floor, whereSusumu Koshimizu’s lump of hewn granite sits alone in a wonky, open-topped cube of hemp paper, and his bronze tetrahedrons slant this way and that across the floor as part of a display devoted to the Mono-ha or School of Things movement, we’re crossing not just continents but worlds of thought.View image in fullscreenAgnes Martin, Blue-Grey Composition, 1962.Photograph: © Agnes Martin Foundation, New York / Adagp, Paris, 2025The clunky galvanised steel air-conditioning ducts I passed on the landing are sculptures byCharlotte Posenenske, who worked almost entirely with ready-made industrial sections. On the next floor up I’m surrounded by the quietly humming, repetitively worked paintings ofAgnes Martin, in a room devoted to the artist. It also includes a relief in which heavy-duty boat spikes have been drilled into sections of wood, the hexagonal heads of the spikes roughly painted in dark red and white. It is like a weird rejoinder to the delicacy of her repetitive, hand-drawn lines and grids, the infinitesimal shifts in weight and tempo of her art.From Martin we go to a more general look at grilles and grids – anEva Hessepanel of grommets, aSol LeWittgridded drawing of arcs and circles, and a great, lone 1966Bridget Rileypainting in which a grid of little black ovoids mess with your retinas and seem to blink back at you as they tilt this way and that, as if there’s too much mental stimulation going on for the brain to cope with. British-Pakistani sculptorRasheed Araeen’s 16 large open wooden cubes, in red, yellow, blue and green, occupy an alcove, and visitors are invited to re-stack, balance, tilt and configure them in any way they wish.Quite soon, I’ve stopped caring about the niceties of the thematic displays. I need to take a deep breath and spend time with Pape, whose career in Brazil encompassed not just a huge variety of materials, manners and approaches but also successive movements in Brazilian art, and whose art seemed to cover all bases, minimal or not.View image in fullscreenLygia Pape, Divisor, 1968, Performance at Museu de Arte Moderna, Rio de Janeiro.Photograph: Projeto Lygia Pape/© Projeto Lygia PapeIt’s one thing after another, though how amusing it is to see a glum, early 1970s diptych by New York artistBrice Marden, with its smoothed-out waxy surface, in relation to the bright panels of sewn-together, shop-bought cotton fabrics stretched by the late German artistBlinky Palermo.Things are dangling from hempen cords: stones used in Korean weaving practices that also reference shamanic beliefs, and lengths of wood bundled and suspended from another rope. I guess this is all about balance, like theRichard Serrathat leans insouciant and immobile against the wall. Lengths of barbed wire hang from the wall, too, connected to lengths of chain byMelvin Edwards.Senga Nengudi’s bulbous and pointy transparent vinyl bags, partly filled with dyed water, flop and bulge from heavy ropes, hinting at bodies that sprout and leak and won’t behave.Ryman reappears, with works more casual and more eccentric than those on the ground floor, and I’m dying to come across something byCady Noland, but she’s not here. There’s noBruce Nauman, and noRobert Morris. More ropes and chains snake over the floor, inMaren Hassinger’s River, which intends to evoke the despoliation of nature and the journeys that took enslaved Africans to the Americas.What links these objects and images and what divides them? Can we look at them all the same way or must we approach them differently? It is very difficult not to just clock things, tick the checklist and keep on climbing the stairs and circulating, in pursuit of a conclusion that is endlessly deferred. The minimal is always with us.Minimal is at the Bourse de Commerce, Paris, until 19 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsParisSculpturePaintingInstallationreviewsShareReuse this content"

Often with his work it’s less important to ask what it means, more how it feels; not to work out exactly how he’s meshed different dance forms or redrawn mythical stories, but to get immersed in its sensory impact.Thikra has plenty going on in that area. The piece was made earlier this year for an arts festival at Wadi AlFann, a new “cultural destination” in AlUla, an ancient oasis city and trade route in the Saudi Arabian desert. It’s a collaboration with London-based Saudi artist Manal AlDowayan, who originally built her rocky set on the desert sand. And you can imagine the early scenes of the 60-minute piece having an impact in a vast outdoor setting. Khan has a strong graphic sense, the 12 dancers in unison in bold type and satisfying lines that cut and splice. It’s crisply danced by the all-female cast, all with long hair swishing in sync.View image in fullscreenChing-Ying Chien in Akram Khan’s Thikra.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellAt the centre is a young woman dressed in white (Ching-Ying Chien) and what follows has the appearance of an initiation or sacrifice, perhaps an exorcism. In fact, in this mythological tale fabricated by Khan and AlDowayan, she is an ancestor, summoned by a tribe of women on this “night of remembering”, for a rebirth of sorts, a ritual healing from the past. It’s no dreamy-soft spiritual journey, but a place of anger and searching (as well as great beauty in compelling performances by Azusa Seyama Prioville as the matriarch, Nikita Goile one of her daughters). Samantha Hines is the supposed vessel for the ritual, but she’s like a beastly scavenger picking over Chien’s body, and then a mildly terrifying puppet master.The narrative details don’t really matter (which is just as well) because Khan’s choreography bypasses thinking mode and goes straight for weighty but intangible worlds of colour and emotion, life and death, animal spirit, magic and witchery. The score by Aditya Prakash (with sound design by Gareth Fry) is head-filling in volume and density, with a really physical sense of rhythm, drawing on Arabic music, plus a blast of Bulgarian choral music and a hint of Purcell’s Dido. It’s intense, but you can only melt into that atmosphere and await catharsis.Until 1 Novemberat Sadler’s Wells, London; thentouring.Explore more on these topicsAkram KhanDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

After throwing it in to pursue her musical dream, she minted a spooky, singular sound that made fans of David Byrne and Feist. At 64, her irreverence remains intactWed 29 Oct 2025 07.28 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 12.52 EDTShareJuana Molina answers our video call from a hospital bed, reclining in a green T-shirt with two cannulas in her hand. She has done her back in while also playing Whack-a-Mole with hernias, two last year, and two new ones now. “Do you know those toys, made of little pieces of wood, and you press the bottom and it goes” – she makes herself floppy, mimicking a push puppet – “that’s exactly how I was yesterday.” But now, says the 64-year-old Argentinian musician, “I have so many painkillers, that I …” She wobbles her eyelids, gurns and gives me two thumbs up.For the avoidance of doubt, Molina seems entirely with it, and insists we continue when I offer to reschedule. She is ultra precise on the technical odyssey she undertook to make her new record, and also extremely funny company, cheeky and withering about anyone who’s too serious – or worse,boring.In the early 90s, Molina was one of Argentina’s biggest comedians with her sketch show Juana y Sus Hermanas (Juana and Her Sisters), in which she portrayed a series of outre characters with some degree of John Waters in their DNA. (Some of them still go viral on TikTok, which she doesn’t let herself use because it’s too addictive.) But in 1993, on bed rest while pregnant with her daughter, she realised that if she didn’t pursue her lifelong dream of becoming a musician, she would one day be a bitter old woman railing at the pop charts. So she quit. It was as much of a shock to the nation as it would be if Kristen Wiig swapped SNL for MTV.It worked out, winning Molina ardent fans such as David Byrne and Feist, and a good chunk of her career signed to Domino. Next year marks 30 years since her musical debut, Rara. For three decades, or at least since things solidified on her 2000 breakthrough, Segundo, she has minted her own unique sound, made of dry, rhythmic guitar loops, drones, low pulses and incantatory voices rich with mystery. It’s enveloping in a comfortingly spooky sort of way.Juana Molina: Siestas Ahí – videoTo record, Molina says, she has to get out of her own way to enter “the world of pure music. There’s no thought, no concepts or pre-ideas. It’s flowing, and I am driving and being driven at the same time, tourist and guide.” Nothing gives her more pleasure than working alone at home in Pacheco, outside Buenos Aires, surrounded by her three dogs, cats and the plants she “cohabits” with. The house once belonged to her grandmother. “I sometimes spend 14 hours in the studio and I don’t even drink a cup of tea, nothing!” she says. “All of a sudden, I hear birds. The whole night has gone by and I didn’t realise because I’m in a tunnel where the only language is music.”That may also be how Molina ended up in this hospital bed. “I think what’s happening to me is because I am all the time bent over, playing and looking for things, and I don’t even think about my [posture],” she says. For her eighth album, Doga, her first since 2017’s Halo, she has been trying to master the furiously difficult world of analogue synths, hunching over instruments that resemble old-fashioned telephone switchboards to invent sounds that don’t rely on pre-programmed waveforms. “You can do whatever you want, and you need to know a lot,” says Molina.She recorded everything she made but became overwhelmed by the hundreds of hours of tape. It prompted her to work with a producer, Emilio Haro, for the first time since her debut. Doga is deeper and more spacious than its predecessor, with synthesised orchestral touches: the guitars on Miro Todo (I See Everything), says Molina, sound like violins that “are somehow out of tune, but in a very nice way, like played as if the player wasn’t feeling like playing.” She makes a beleaguered, twitchy face to illustrate. Often the experimentation was truly analogue: Molina would play guitar while Haro moved knobs, “which is something you can’t do while playing”, she says, “unless you have extraordinary feet”.View image in fullscreenMolina photographed for the Guardian in 2007.Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianRecently, Molina tried to re-record her first album, having lost the rights to a former label. Rara is an outlier in her catalogue, her only full-band record: she says most people who love that album don’t like her others. “I recorded half of it and when I started singing it, I felt it wasn’t right,” she says. The problem was that although it was recorded in 1995, it featured songs she had written as a young woman in 1983. “Those lyrics, they’re so romantic and suffering,” she says, rolling her eyes. “The first song talks about a girl that has a picture of a boy in her book, she thinks of him and wonders if he thinks about her. Then we go to his story and he’s put her photo in an old jacket, he checks the pockets and throws it away. He doesn’t even remember her!”Molina looks stricken that she ever told such a story. (And she has since got the rights to Rara back.) But otherwise she says she remains intimately connected to herself at all ages, in defiance of the idea that there are certain ways she should be at 64. On her 2013 album Wed 21, a song called Las Edades (The Ages) was about starting to feel that she repelled younger people. “Maybe it’s a survival thing that you need to mate with someone your age in order to have children and all that,” she says. “But the weird thing is that I can be with children, eight years old, and feel as if I’m eight. If I’m with 16-year-old guys, I feel as if I’m 16. It’s not that I am only 64; it’s not that all those ages disappear. It’s just a way that people count ages. Age became so important for society, and it hurts when you get older. You feel the rejection.”She recently attended a 60th birthday party, and lamented how “incredibly boring” a lot of the conversations were, about politics and the economy. “One of the things I hate the most in life is to be solemn,” she says. “Solemnness is for a burial. But when you are solemn about life, things need to be donethis wayand you can’t dressthat wayand you can’teat with your hands,” she intones in a dreary voice, “there’s a huge boredom”.Juana Molina: Cosoco – videoProof of the eternally rejuvenating properties of curiosity, Molina would rather “talk about a chair, the way a glass is made or why the handle of a cup has that shape, things that are not important but are so much fun to talk about”, or learn how things work so that she can mend them herself: “If I fix the window, it feels good.” She recently co-founded a label, Sonamos, and thrills at the enthusiasm and knowledge of her partner Mario Agustín de Jesús González. “His curiosity has no limits,” she says. “Though sometimes I get a bit like, let’s talk about pizza.”‘We need anger to fight for our lives’: Mexican musician Silvana Estrada on grief, violence and the indignity of ‘el ghosting’Read moreWhen people bug her saying that Argentina needs her back on TV (even though she has a small part in Netflix women’s prison drama En el Barro), she wonders why they don’t realise that online comedy clipsarethe new TV. On her Instagram, she frequently addresses fans while disguised by a novelty filter – maybe her as an elderly woman, or a field of seven babies wearing strawberry hats. “When I think I spent hours with wigs and makeup, and now I just scroll and an unexpected character is there, it makes me so joyful that you can bring them to life immediately,” she says. As with music leading her, “the filters tell me what to do with them, it’s like an instant impersonation.” Similarly, the cover of Doga features Molina convincingly Photoshopped as a very fluffy dog.Maybe this resistance to branding herself as aserious artistehas constrained Molina’s deserved legacy a little outside South America. But her allergy to gravitas and even to the concept of legacy feels refreshing; she mostly seems intent on giving listeners the same feeling of “pure music” as she experiences. At her gigs, she eschews visuals “because I thought, if the music doesn’t give you enough images then it’s a failure”, she says. She hopes she’s still making music in another 30 years’ time “if my body allows me to”, and only hopes she’ll have some more help in the studio. “I would love to have assistance to help me with whatever sound I want to get,” she says, “instead of being there breaking my back on the instruments.”Doga is released via Sonamos on 5 NovemberExplore more on these topicsMusicExperimental musicArgentinainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Political, unpredictable and replete with ass puns, Asses.Masses is, on the one hand, a fairly rudimentary-looking video game made by Canadian artists Patrick Blenkarn and Milton Lim with a small team of collaborators. But the setting – in a theatre, surrounded by others, everybody shouting advice and opinions and working together on puzzles – transforms it into a piece of collective performance art.Here’s how it works: on a plinth in front of a giant projected screen is a controller. In the seats: the audience. Whoever wants to get up and take control can do so, and they become the avatar of the crowd. The game opens with a series of questions, mostly about donkeys, some in different languages, and quickly it becomes obvious that you have to work together to get them right. Someone in our crowd spoke Spanish; another knew the answer to an engineering question; I knew, somehow, that a female donkey is called a jennet.This is what makes the game a collective experience. Usually, no more than one person has their hands on the controller but, nonetheless, everyone is participating as you guide a group of donkeys on a long, surprising and increasingly surreal quest to get their jobs back from the farm machines that have made them redundant.View image in fullscreenEveryone is participating as you guide a group of donkeys on a long, surreal quest … Asses.Masses.Photograph: Patrick Blenkarn + Milton LimOver 10 chapters (with, thank God, food and frequent breaks), we took control of a whole cast of amusingly named asses, ruminated on collective action, industrialisation and labour politics, debated over what to say and what to do, and laugheda lotat the cheekier parts. Without spoiling it, the show’s content warnings give you a fair idea of what to expect: references to violence, strong language, simulated sex (donkey), simulated sex (human), police brutality as well as references to drug use and suicide. I was amused to discover that this Glasgow performance prompted a mini moral panic from a group called Parents Watch Education, which the Daily Record seized upon under the headline “Parents slam show aimed at teens featuring simulated donkey sex, murder and drugs”. (The show is advertised as 14+, and very much prioritises humour over realism.)Asses.Masses is a thought-provoking game made worthwhile by its even more interesting means of play. It is also, and this must be said, a true endurance test. I had to duck out for a couple of hours in the middle to go and lie down for a bit; it has been many years since I have played any video game for eight straight hours. Thankfully, I brought a friend with more stamina, who filled me in on what I’d missed before I took up the controller for the final chapters. At one point, overwhelmed by the audience’s different opinions, I put the controller down, put my hands on my head, and silently empathised with every union or labour organiser who has ever had to corral and prioritise the ideas of an opinionated membership.The game could have done more with the idea of herd mentality – I’m fairly sure that few of our group decisions actually amounted to anything and, really, what we were mostly doing was watching someone else play the game rather than actively participating. It was, in that sense, like a live Twitch stream. Theatre people tend to get very excited about anything that incorporates video game elements into performances, but I often wonder if that’s because they aren’t necessarily familiar with the mass participation and crowd dynamics that video gamesalwaysinspire, whether through multiplayer, streaming, or just spirited online conversation.View image in fullscreenA thought-provoking game and a true endurance test … the crowd at Asses.Masses.Photograph: undefined/Patrick Blenkarn + Milton LimIt made me want to invite friends round my house and pass the controller around all day like we used to in our early 20s. My friend was reminded of a video game book club she used to run, where six people would play through a game such as What Remains of Edith Finch together (and laugh at it, in that specific instance). Asses.Masses is specifically designed around collective play, but I can think of plenty more shortish, thought-provoking games that could be staged like this, and that would inspire an interesting reaction from audiences. And if the number of people who engage with Twitch is any indication, I think a lot of people would come.Stumbling out of the theatre and into the rainy Glasgow night, I felt a real sense of camaraderie with the small crowd I’d been playing with. Often when I finish a game, I’m on my own in the living room in the middle of the night, while my family sleeps, and I have nobody to turn to to discuss it with. This time, I had a whole group of people to debrief with, and it reminded me that it is always the addition of human players that animates games with soul.Assess.Masses ison aglobal tour till September 2026What to playView image in fullscreenSpooky but not too scary … Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival.Photograph: Adam Robinson-YuI have two spooky (but not too scary, because I’m a wuss) recommendations for Halloween week. Firstly:The Séance of Blake Manor, a folk-horror detective game that Keith absolutely loved, featuring an eccentric cast of characters gathering in a gothic hotel for a séance on All Hallows Eve. And secondly:Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival, an annual time-limited virtual Halloween party originally created as a lockdown replacement for real-life gatherings. Here, you create your own sheet-ghost with a drawn-on face, carve virtual pumpkins, and then head into a creepy little microworld to display them for other players. There is a surprising amount to explore, from hay rides to creepy movie theatres to a whole haunted house escape room. It’ll be live until a week or so after Halloween, and is available onitch.ioon a pay-what-you-like basis.Available on:PCEstimated playtime:15-20 hours (The Séance of Blake Manor),two hours (Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is so exasperating because it is so difficult and you often end up falling back to the beginning and having to start all over again – but at the same time it is compelling. Which are the most deliberately difficult but compelling games to play?”You’ve made an astute connection here, Emily, because Bennett Foddy is one of the three main developers (and voice actors) behindBaby Steps, and a natural extension of his game-design philosophy of making players howl with self-pity. (Here’s aninteresting talkhe gave about suffering and games.)Foddy’s oeuvreis a masterclass in this, and he makes the interesting observation that, since the 1990s, games have focused onremovingsuffering, making things smoother for the player. In doing so, they’ve taken away something that made them so interesting.I play a lot of games that make me suffer, for reasons Foddy has helped me understand: the bigger the pain, the bigger the gain (and the less likely you are to be bored – my personal hell).

He reflects on pain, pride and regretInterview byEmine Saner. Portrait byNadav KanderWed 29 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 12.48 EDTShareView image in fullscreenDon McCullin photographed at his home in Somerset, October 2025War photographers are not meant to reach 90. “Fate has had my life in its hands,” saysDon McCullin. Over his seven-decade career covering wars, famines and disasters McCullin has been captured, and escaped snipers, mortar fire and more. How does it feel to be a survivor? “Uncomfortable,” he says. No wonder he finds solace in the beautiful still lifes he creates in his shed, or in the images he composes in the countryside around his Somerset home.McCullin is proud of escaping the extreme poverty he was born into, and the interesting and adventurous life he has lived, but he says the accolades – including a knighthood in 2017 – make him uneasy. “I feel as if I’ve been over-rewarded, and I definitely feel uncomfortable about that, because it’s been at the expense of other people’s lives.” But he has been the witness to atrocity, I point out, and that’s important. “Yes,” he says, uncertainly, “but, at the end of the day, it’s done absolutely no good at all. Look at Ukraine. Look at Gaza. I haven’t changed a solitary thing. I mean it. I feel as if I’ve been riding on other people’s pain over the last 60 years, and their pain hasn’t helped prevent this kind of tragedy. We’ve learned nothing.” It makes him despair.The most harrowing photographs are McCullin’s best-known, but his career, which began 67 years ago, spans many genres, including beautiful landscapes, portraits and photographs of ancient ruins and antiquities. On a recent late autumn day, we sat at his table, surrounded by laden bookshelves, in a lovely room overlooking land on which he has planted many trees, and he talked me through his life in pictures.Guvnors, Finsbury Park gang, 1958View image in fullscreenMcCullin grew up in north London, in a damp two-room basement in a tenement building. His father sufferedchronic asthma and died when McCullin was 14. He left school soon afterwards.National service with the RAF followed, and that was where he discovered photography. This photograph, of a gang of young men McCullingrew up with, was published in the Observer when he was 23 and had been working at a London animation studio. It started his career.In Finsbury Park, people’s doors were always open. My mother was never home because she worked on the railway. We had gaslight, and there were lots of horses around, delivering coal or for the brewery. Sometimes, they’d let you sit on the back of one. I come from another culture.During the war, I was evacuated three times, and each time I’d come back to a London that was more derelict. We would climb these bombed buildings. It was like climbing inside cathedrals, the carcasses of these buildings, and we’d sit at the top eating chips stuffed into a roll. In a way, I had a real childhood. Sometimes, we would get the train up to Cockfosters, run across the live rails into the countryside and capture grass snakes and birds’ eggs. Children don’t have a life like that today.I used to get battered by bullies. I’d win the odd fight, but I would lose a lot of others. These boys in the photograph, all they talked about was violence, robbery, housebreaking. One of them was an armed robber who had been in prison.I was surrounded by violence and bigotry and it was getting to me. These people hadn’t travelled like me. I’d been to Sudan, Egypt and Cyprus with the RAF, and started developing a mind of my own.But my background of no education, bigotry and all that awfulness makes me feel like the impostor in the room. Despite all I have learned, I still feel uncomfortable.Near Checkpoint Charlie, Berlin, 1961View image in fullscreenBy the early 1960s, McCullin was freelancing for the Observer and other newspapers and magazines. He and his first wife,Christine,were still living in Finsbury Park in a two-room flat – one room was bathroom, kitchen and his dark room combined.I was sitting in a cafe with my wife in Paris on a belated honeymoon. I saw a man reading Le Figaro, which had a picture of an East German soldier with his Kalashnikov. I said to her: “When we go back, would you mind if I went to Berlin?” We’d only been married a few months. I asked the Observer if they wanted pictures, and they said: “We’re not sending you. It’s up to you if you go or not.” I went with a camera that I had used to photograph the Finsbury Park gang. It was a Rolleicord I had bought when I finished my national service. It was very difficult to compose [pictures with it] because it’s in a square format. I had pawned it once for five quid, and the one decent thing my mother did was she got that camera out. I saw other international photographers arriving, draped in all the latest cameras and I remember feeling shabby.Protest picture during the Cuban missile crisis, Whitehall, 1962View image in fullscreenThis man ran away from Trafalgar Square and they immediately blocked his way to Whitehall. I did a lot of political demonstrations when I worked on the Observer in the early 60s, and I loved it. There used to be brawls some days, which I could get involved in, photographically. I find this photograph amusing. Despite everything, there is laughter in me. I’ve got a huge sense of humour.The Cyprus civil war, Limassol, 1964View image in fullscreenDuringthe first war he covered, McCullin found himself in the middle of a gun battle when Greekssurrounded theTurkish quarter of Limassol. Turkish civilians had hidden in communal buildings, such as cinemas, where this photograph of a Turkish gunmanwas taken.I went into the Observer newspaper – I had a contract with them for two days a week for 15 guineas – and the editor said: “Would you consider going to cover the civil war in Cyprus?” I felt as if I was levitating. On my first day in Limassol, I took this picture, by the side of a cinema. It looks like a Hollywood still: the man is far too well dressed. In the evening, when the battle stopped, I had nowhere to stay, and the Turkish police said I could sleep in a cell block. That was my baptism in war.On another day, I was walking towards a village, and a British solder said: “Dead body up there.” I walked, looking at the ground, afraid to raise my head and I found the first body. I went to a house, knocked on the door, but there was no answer. I gently opened it and the first thing that hit me was a warm smell of blood. There was blood all over the floor. There were two dead brothers, and their father was in the kitchen at the back, murdered by the Greeks. I was in the house, photographing, when suddenly the door opened and several people came in, including a woman, crying for her dead husband, who she’d only married a couple of weeks before. I thought, “They’re going to attack me”, but they didn’t. They were very generous towards me.I felt I had chosen the right thing to do, because I found what I was photographing so outrageous that I couldn’t wait to get back to England and see my pictures published, to show the world how wrong it was. When you’re young and ambitious, you haven’t really worked it all out. You’re drawn to this tragedy, but it doesn’t belong to you – you’re imposing yourself upon the situation. You’re not welcome or invited and you’re stealing in a way. You’re stealing other people’s emotional tragedies. You’re stealing images of people, dead, who haven’t given you consent. I was aware it wasn’t totally right, and I believe it to this day. That’s why I come back here and do the English landscape. I feel as if I have to release myself from my guilt, which I still carry.Suspected Lumumbist freedom fighters being tortured, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1964View image in fullscreenTheGerman magazine Quicksent McCullinto cover events inDRC,where followers of theassassinated prime minister Patrice Lumumbahad captured the eastern part of the country. Arriving in what was thenLéopoldville(nowKinshasa), he discovered members of the media were being banned from leaving. Meeting a mercenary in his hotel bar, one of many mercenaries employed by the government to fight the rebels, McCullinpersuaded him to lend him a uniform and get himon a military plane to the rebel strongholdStanleyville(nowKisangani).I got on the runway in the early morning and before I got on the plane, they were running off people’s names. I thought: “Oh my God, they’re going to discover I’m not a mercenary.” The guy said: “What’s your name?” I said: “McCullin.” He said: “Get on the plane”, and I flew 1,000km to where [military leader] Joseph-Désiré Mobutu said no press were allowed to go. When I got to the other end, I found [the loyalist gendarmerie] were torturing boys as young as 17 and maybe younger. They were shooting them in the back of the head and kicking them in the river. These boys were Lumumbist. They were beating them; one of the boys had been stabbed in the face with a knife.Sheep going to slaughter, London, 1965View image in fullscreenThat was on the Caledonian Road, where there used to be big abattoirs on either side. I was working on a magazine story with the writer Eric Newby, who has long died. So many people I’ve worked with have died, I feel as if I’m one of the few left who knew this world I worked in.Grenade thrower, Hue, Vietnam, 1968View image in fullscreenMcCullin went to cover the Vietnam war for the first time in 1965, and returned several times.I joined these US marines, and they said it was going to be a 24-hour operation in the ancient city of Hue. Twelve days later, we were still there – they got a terrible hiding. They lost about 40 men; a sniper was picking them off every day. You can see the devastation in this photograph. I slept in a hut, on the floor, under a table, using my helmet as a pillow. I loved being tested to the limit. In the mornings, I always left the hut one way, and then one day I decided to turn another way. Behind the hut, I found a dead North Vietnamese soldier who had been lying almost head-to-head with me. He was about 18, his eyes were open and full of rainwater.Shell-shocked US marine, Hue, Vietnam, 1968View image in fullscreenI am slightly fed up with my more known pictures, because they’re classically, iconically composed. So what are they saying? They could almost be negative because they’re too perfectly designed by me, and people would say: “It’s almost artistic.” I’m afraid of falling off that very fine line.I never harmed any of the people in my pictures. I didn’t kill them. I didn’t torture them, the way this man has been tortured by his own breakdown.Every night, I remember the battle that that man was in. I didn’t get his damaged brain, but my brain has never been free of certain images. I have bad dreams and this pause every night before I sleep, but I’ve never suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.I was moving fast. I would go straight back to another war. There’s an adrenaline rush. It’s all very selfish and stupid, but you’re not telling the truth if you say you didn’t find some sides of it exciting. The excitement of incoming shells. But then you think, “That shell just blew some guy’s leg off,” or killed another four or five guys. I’ve been swimming in a whirlpool of huge misadventure, and it’s been a cesspit, really, my life. There’s no other way of describing it.I’ve risked my life a few times. I was in a gun battle once in Cyprus, and I saw an old lady who couldn’t walk. I thought, if someone doesn’t do something, that old girl is going to die in the next five minutes. I gave my friend my cameras and ran and picked her up and then ran back with her. I thought: “I can’t keep taking all the time. You’ve got to do something, give something back.” In Vietnam, I carried a soldier away from battle on my shoulders. He had been hit by a bullet and was in such pain. I thought: “I’ve been stealing all these years. I’ve got to hand some of that back.” But you risk your life doing it.Starving boy, Biafra, 1968View image in fullscreenThe day after his third child was born, McCullin left to cover the war that had broken out sinceBiafra had broken away from Nigeria in 1967. After witnessing battles, executions and more horrors, then coming down with malaria, McCullin was about to see the sights that would probably haunt him most, at a hospital for war-orphaned children, where hundreds were starving.This is possibly the most atrocious picture I’ve ever taken in my life. There were 600 children dying in this camp. They were dropping down and dying in front of me. When they see white people, they think you’re an aid worker coming to bring them food. So you can understand my guilt, can’t you? It was not kind of me to be there, really.That boy is holding a tin of corned beef, which he had completely licked dry to get every gram. I gave him a barley sugar sweet, which I had in my pocket, and he went away, licking it. I went off and spoke to a Médecins Sans Frontières doctor, and I felt someone take hold of my hand. It was the boy. It made me feel so bloody guilty.I haven’t printed that picture for nearly 30 years now. I don’t want to see it coming up in the dark room. I even feel guilty that these pictures – I have about 70,000 negatives – are in the house.Homeless Irish man, London, 1969View image in fullscreenThere are social wars on your doorstep. People used to write me letters, saying, “I want to be a war photographer.” I’d say: “Help yourself – it’s in your cities.” This man slept by a fire in Spitalfields market, very close to the City of London, which generates billions and billions of pounds for the people who own it. You couldn’t have more of a contrast. One side is everything, and the other side is nothing.I call this picture Neptune, because he looks like the sea god. I thought he was one of the most handsome men I had ever seen.Catholic youth escaping CS gas fired by British soldiers, Londonderry, 1971View image in fullscreenDuring the late 1960s, McCullin was barely home. He covered war in Chad and trekked to rebel camps in Eritrea. Even though he was injured while photographing the civil war in Cambodia – watching the man who had taken the full force of the mortar blast die in front of him on the way to hospital – he was back several months later. He photographed tribes in the Amazon rainforest, whose lands were being taken, and the refugee crisis caused bywar in Pakistan. On that particular trip,McCullin decided he was more interested in showing the impact of violence on civilians – something he was able to do in Northern Ireland.I spent six weeks in Northern Ireland. This is the gassing, in the Bogside area, of Catholic youths. I got gassed really badly that day, and hit in the back with a rubber bullet. I was led away, totally blind, into a house where there was a hell of a lot of swearing and shouting. “Get him a damp cloth!” It was chaotic.Man and British soldier, Londonderry, 1971View image in fullscreenThat man is coming home from work and that soldier’s behaving like a soldier. It does seem to be the extreme contrast of a normal man coming back from a normal day, having to share the street.Local boys in Bradford, 1972View image in fullscreenLocal Boys in Bradford 1972Photograph: Copyright: Don McCullin/Courtesy The TateBack from whatever war zone he had been sent to, McCullin would set himself photographic projects. He often went to the north of England, drawn to documenting people’s hard lives in run-down industrial landscapes.I used to walk the streets, and the people in the north are very friendly, a lot more trusting than the people in the south. I went to Bradford, and I saw that amazing slogan on the wall, against the racism of that period. I’m proud of my work in the north of England. I was evacuated as a child to Lancashire, to a chicken farm for 18 weeks, and I had a really horrible time. That is one reason why I don’t treat other people badly.If I had been to university, I think I would have been a more sensitive person, even more than I already am, and I would not have been able to sleep among dead bodies and rat-infested trenches and things like that. Also, I knew how to conduct myself. You smell poverty when you go into a house and it smells just like the house I grew up in as a boy.A winter’s victim, Hertfordshire, undatedView image in fullscreenIn 1972, McCullin and other journalists were captured inUganda, and he was sure he would die in the notoriousMakindye prison, listening to fellow prisoners being taken away to be beaten or executed, and watching trucks taking bodies away. After four days, he was released and deported, arriving home to his family – now living in a farmhouse in Hertfordshire.I found this sparrow outside my house one day, at dusk. I’ve got good eyes, I spot stuff on the floor, everywhere. I kind of X-ray things.Young Christians celebrating the death of a Palestinian girl, Beirut, 1976View image in fullscreenHaving been to Lebanon several times in the 1960s, when Beirut was a decadent playground for the rich, McCullin returned to cover thecivil war in the mid-1970s. Arriving in Beirut, he decided attaching himself to theChristian Phalangemilitia would give him the best access. Over the next few days, he photographed the massacres in a district in east Beirut populated largely by Palestinians – which wouldput McCullin’s name on a death warrant.One morning I was told: “We’re going to Karantina and we’re going to clear out the rats.” They meant Palestinians. I slept in the morgue that night and then in the early morning, they attacked the area.I was told to leave the area by the Christians. They said: “If we see you taking any more photographs, we’re going to kill you.” I’d been watching them kill Palestinians in groups, pouring magazines into men’s heads and exploding them. I was leaving when I heard this strange music and I saw this. This is a dead Palestinian girl lying in the rain, and this boy had a mandolin, which he found in one of the houses. He couldn’t play it, but he was giving the impression that he was serenading the death of this girl. I was looking around, thinking: “I’ve got to get this picture.” I took it very quickly.Dew pond, Somerset, 1988View image in fullscreenBy the mid-1980s, McCullin’s type of work had fallen out of favour at the Sunday Times, newly acquired by Rupert Murdoch, and he left. Personally, it had also been a difficult time – he had been injured inEl Salvador, after falling off a roof in a gun battle, and he left his first wife for the woman who would become his second, something he says he still feels guilty about (he has been marriedto histhird wife, Catherine, awriter and podcaster,formore than 20 years). Money was short, and he turned to advertising photography, even though it didn’t fulfil him. Moving to Somerset, he found peace in photographing the landscape around his new home.Dew ponds are very rare things. They are almost mythological. They’re completely round, and this one was at the foot of a hill fort. We’re surrounded here in Somerset by history and myth. I use that. This was in the early morning, but I usually work in the evening, when the sun is going down.I can stand in these fields for two or three hours and not get a picture. That doesn’t mean to say I’m disappointed, I’ve had the privilege of standing there. There’s nothing greater.Photojournalism has taken a nosedive, and it’s because newspaper proprietors want beautiful women, rich people, celebrities. They do not want my kind of pictures in their paper, spoiling their day. They don’t want that tragedy.Tulips with a mind of their own, undatedView image in fullscreenI study things. You watch tulips, they start in a very kind of pristine way, and in the end they start dancing in different directions. This is free of charge, a total joy ride. They can’t say to me: “Don’t photograph us in our deaths.”The road to the Somme, France, 1999View image in fullscreenI was commissioned by Royal Mail to create a commemorative stamp of the first world war. I was in a French bistro one day having lunch and it had been raining. I was going back when I suddenly saw this silvery wet road, and I swung my car around. I thought that that horizon would be the huge graveyard of thousands of men who didn’t want to die, men who hadn’t had a life at the age of 18 and younger.Refugee camp, Chad, 2007View image in fullscreenI was sent by Oxfam to photograph refugee camps in Chad [people fleeing violence in Darfur].In places I’ve worked, I have seen television crews coming in, treading on kids and pushing people around, thinking they are more important. I’ve always been tough with those people – growing up in Finsbury Park meant I wasn’t a pushover. But when it comes to my work, I am very sensitive, very polite. I’m a human being. I would never have got pictures of people who are injured and angry and hurt without that, and I’ve managed to allow them to give me that moment of trust. If I wasn’t thinking like that, my pictures wouldn’t have a sensitive way of trying to speak to you.The exhibitionDon McCullin: A Desecrated Serenityis at Hauser & Wirth, New York, until 8 November. McCullin’s new book of still lifes and landscapes, The Stillness of Life, is published by Gost Books, price £80.All Photographs copyright Don McCullin.

These are some of the highlightsJohn SelfWed 29 Oct 2025 11.34 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 11.36 EDTSharePaul Bailey, whodied last October aged 87, was best known as a novelist of comic brilliance, wide-ranging empathy – even for the worst of his characters – and a cleverness that was never clinical. His fiction was frequently occupied with the impact of memories on our lives, and usually heavily driven by sharp, syncopated dialogue. But he was also a memoirist, poet and more besides – so here’s a guide to the legacy of books he left behind.The ones to keep you companyBailey was a social creature, a great talker and lover of “trivial chit-chat”, as one of his characters puts it. Bailey and his friend Beryl Bainbridge used to watch Coronation Street and then compare notes over the phone. This fondness for a gossipy conversation is brought out in his novels Trespasses (1970) and Peter Smart’s Confessions (1977). Both feature a man surrounded by funny, maddening, over-the-top characters, who are usually so closely related to him that he can’t escape the gravitational pull of their nonsense. “Who wants to be normal anyway?” asks Ralph’s mother in Trespasses when he comes out to her as gay. Like spending an evening with your wittiest, and sometimes cheekiest, friend.The ones to make you laugh and cry at the same timeBailey wrote brilliantly about old age, at both ends of his career. His debut novel At the Jerusalem (1967) follows the experiences of Faith Gadny as she tries to settle into life in an old people’s home, where the other residents provide the warmth lacking from the staff, whose idea of taking an interest in the residents is to ask, “Why aren’t you ladies watching the television?” In Bailey’s penultimate novelChapman’s Odyssey(2011), an elderly man in hospital slips between tussling with the doctors (“I only drink superior wines”, he assures them when they rebuke him for his liver test results) and being bombarded by memories of his mother, his lovers and classic literary characters, from Dickens’s Pip to Austen’s Emma. Both books are full of funny exchanges but marked by the shadow of the inevitable end. Always in Bailey’s novels, smiles are not to be trusted. In At the Jerusalem, “the matron smiled, shut the smile off quickly”; Mrs Gadny laughs with nerves when her behaviour is challenged. In Chapman’s Odyssey, Harry warns the medics that “my smiles aren’t what they seem”. The reader’s smiles are real enough, though.Paul Bailey obituaryRead moreIf you want to know the facts behind the fictionAs well as his novels, Bailey was a brilliant memoirist, publishing two volumes of autobiography. An Immaculate Mistake (1990) is a masterpiece of remembrance, its title taken from his mother telling him, her third child, that “You were our mistake. You ought not to be here, by rights.” (“She was old now, and letting go of her secrets,” he adds. “This one, she knew, would be of particular interest to me.”) It’s in this book that we see where all those misguided, loving but infuriating parents in his novels come from. But it’s also a beautiful portrait of a young man growing up gay in the 1940s and 50s, when homosexual acts were illegal and his family thought it suspicious for a boy to buy his mother flowers; and of an aspiring actor (Bailey was on the stage before he turned to the page) who memorised Hamlet at the age of 15. His second memoirA Dog’s Life(2004) focuses on life with his mongrel puppy Circe and his former partner David, his love for Romania – which inspired his later novels Kitty and Virgil,Uncle RudolfandThe Prince’s Boy– and of course dollops of gossip, including a splendid account of a literary event with Iris Murdoch, where she calls one audience member a “stupid cow”.If you’re pressed for timeBailey’s novels are mostly short anyway – the tremendous Old Soldiers (1980) is barely 100 pages long – but if you want something even briefer, then trythe poetry he turned to late in his career. The two volumes, Inheritance (2019) and Joie de Vivre (2022), show the best of Bailey’s wit, empathy and precision in capsule form. They are poems full of death and life. Two themes of love recur: for his mother (“I’m closer to you now – / I need to tell you – / than I ever was in life”) and for his civil partner Jeremy Trevathan. In Amazement, he writes of the pleasures of “watching an idiotic TV entertainment” together, and concludes: “It’s awesome, in its way, this act of eating cheese / and drinking wine, as the world keeps darkening.”If you only read oneThere would be little dispute that Bailey’s most ambitious and wide-ranging novel is Gabriel’s Lament, which was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 1986. (He also judged the prize in 1982, an experiencehe hated.) This was the book Bailey was proudest of, even though – or perhaps because – “it drained me. It took everything out of me”. It tells the story of Gabriel Harvey, whose mother disappears and whose father becomes an insufferable snob after coming into a pile of money – and the two events may be connected. It’s a portrait of 20th-century London, an account of mental collapse, and as simultaneously funny and sad as anything Bailey wrote. If you want more, it inspired a sequel, Sugar Cane (1993), which Bailey researched by becoming “a regular visitor to a brothel” – as a spectator.Explore more on these topicsPaul BaileyWhere to start withPoetryFictionAutobiography and memoirfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Stern heirs are now seeking the painting’s return and damages.“In the decades since the end of world war two, this Nazi-looted painting has been repeatedly and secretly trafficked, purchased and sold in and through New York,” alleges the suit filed this week in federal district court in Manhattan, which was first reported by theNew York Times.The Stern family fled Munich and went to California with their six children in 1936 as a result of Nazi persecution, but were prevented from taking the artwork, painted by the Dutch post-impressionist in 1889, according to the complaint.“Before the family’s emigration, the Nazi government declared the painting to be ‘German cultural property’ and prohibited the Sterns from bringing the painting (and others in their collection) with them abroad. After obtaining permission from a Nazi official, a ‘trustee’ appointed by the Nazis sold the painting in Germany on the Sterns’ behalf, but the proceeds of the sale were deposited in a ‘blocked account,’ which the Nazis later confiscated,” lawyers for the heirs said in the filing.In 1948, or shortly after, the painting arrived inNew Yorkand was bought by Vincent Astor, one of America’s wealthiest people, whose wife, Brooke Astor, served on the board of trustees of the Met from 1964 until 1983. It was later sold through a gallery to the Met, which sold it to Basil Goulandris and his wife, Elise, in 1972.The Greek couple established in 1979 the Basil & Elise Goulandris Foundation (BEG), which operates a museum in Athens where the painting is on display.The foundation and a surviving nephew of Basil Goulandris are named as defendants in the lawsuit, which alleges the family “and its related entities have hidden and obscured the painting’s ownership and location from plaintiff”.“To this day, the Goulandris defendants continue to conceal how and when the BEG came into possession of the painting; the Stern family’s ownership of the painting from 1935 to 1938; and the facts that the Nazis looted the painting from the Stern family, coerced the Sterns into selling it via a Nazi-appointed agent, and confiscated the proceeds of the sale,” according to the court papers.The Stern heirs filed a similar complaint in California in 2022 but it was dismissed in 2024. An appeal was dismissed in May.Tattoo fixers on removing Nazi symbols: ‘You don’t know if they’re changing or hiding’Read moreThe lawsuit argues the Met’s purchase of the painting was approved by Theodore Rousseau Jr, the museum’s curator of European paintings and “one of the world’s foremost experts on Nazi art looting”.“Rousseau and the Met knew or should have known that the painting had probably been looted by Nazis,” the court filing alleges.The Met said in a statement that it “takes seriously its longstanding commitment to address Nazi-era claims”.“At no time during the Met’s ownership of the painting was there any record that it had once belonged to the Stern family – indeed, that information did not become available until several decades after the painting left the museum’s collection,” a spokesperson said.“The Met’s sale of the Olive Picking met the museum’s strict criteria for deaccessioning – specifically, it was recorded that the work was deemed to be of lesser quality than other works of the same type in the collection. While the Met respectfully stands by its position that this work entered the collection and was deaccessioned legally and well within all guidelines and policies, the museum welcomes and will consider any new information that comes to light.”William Charron, a lawyer representing the BEG, said: “The Goulandris Foundation is a highly prestigious organization in Athens. The attempt to sue and smear the foundation and the Goulandris family in the US upon misleadingly incomplete allegations was previously dismissed, twice. We are confident it will be again.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsVincent van GoghNazismNew YorkMuseumsArtShareReuse this content"

The actor, who won a Tony award last year for his performance in the Stephen Sondheim revival Merrily We Roll Along, will perform at the Hudson theatre in New York, from 21 February to 24 May 2026.Written by Duncan Macmillan, along with the show’s original star Jonny Donahoe, the play has been a hit in London’s West End, where it is currently being performed at @sohoplace by Minnie Driver until 8 November. Described by the Guardian as“both heartfelt and buoyant”, it revolves around a child reacting to their mother’s suicide attempt. Determined to help her, they make a list of all the things that make life worth living – with the audience encouraged to join in by shouting out the listed reasons. As the child becomes an adult, the list continues to develop, although it is now the grownups who are in need of reasons to remain hopeful.The play debuted at the Edinburgh fringe in 2014 and has since become a global phenomenon, performed in more than 80 countries. Since Donahoe first stopped performing it in 2017, the role has been taken on by Sue Perkins, Lenny Henry and Ambika Mod among others.The play’s structure allows it to be tailored for specific audiences. When Melina Theo starred in the Greek premiere, the text was infused with references to Greek popular culture from the 90s. A reference to a particular brand of ice cream was included in Oliver Chong’s performance in Singapore.It will be the latest Broadway role for Radcliffe who has previously performed in The Lifespan of a Fact, Privacy and The Cripple of Inishmaan, as well as the record-breaking run of Merrily We Roll Along. The actor, who found fame as a child in the Harry Potter films, first appeared on stage in 2007, playing opposite Richard Griffiths,in Peter Shaffer’s Equus.“When Daniel told us how much he loved the play, I couldn’t have been more thrilled,” said Macmillan. “He has the intelligence, quick wit and charm to roll with the spontaneous moments that the show invites – he can be a clown one moment, then grab you by the heartstrings the next. He has huge depth and humanity. I can’t wait to get started.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreDaniel RadcliffeBroadwayHarry PotterShareReuse this content"

Will you fuck off? Just fuck off! I’m so annoyed.’”Thompson went on to say that her run-ins with technology are not new, and that when she was finishing the Sense and Sensibility script, “I came back from the loo to find that it had changed the entire script into hieroglyphs … completely gone.”She then went in her dressing gown to Stephen Fry’s house, where he spent eight hours recovering the script, “and it came out in one long sentence”.Thompson then “had to re-do it. The computer had taken it and hidden it … like it had done it on purpose.”Speaking in 2023 at a conference in Cambridge, Thompson railed against the new labelling of creative storytelling as “content” and said that focusing on raw honesty while writing was key to a script’s efficacy.“What is authentic, whether you like it or not,” she said, “is going to be meaningful to somebody. You find your audience by being completely authentic.”Down Cemetery Road review – Emma Thompson is magnificent in this thriller from Slow Horses’ creatorRead moreTrying to produce a script according to a formula, she said, led to films that elicited unhappy results. “You sit there and you watch them and you wonder why, at the end of it, you feel a bit ill.”Thompson is promoting new TV detective seriesDown Cemetery Road, and won rave reviews for her performance as a widow who tries to thwart kidnappers in the recent filmThe Dead of Winter.Hollywood is fighting back against the rise of AI in both unauthorised use of images and in the scripting and production of movies. Over the weekend, the director Guillermo Del Toro said he would “rather die” than use generative AI while making films.“I’m 61,” he said, “and I hope to be able to remain uninterested in using it at all until I croak … The other day, somebody wrote me an email, said, ‘What is your stance on AI?’ And my answer was very short.

In this piece, it’s all about realism and authenticity.”A House of Dynamite review – Kathryn Bigelow’s nuclear endgame thriller is a terrifying, white-knuckle comebackRead moreBigelow compared the film with her previous dramas Zero Dark Thirty and Hurt Locker, calling them “work[s] of fiction … that lean in hard on realism”.In the film, ground-based interceptor missiles, launched from Alaska, fail to stop a nuclear strike on Chicago.In an internal memo dated 16 October, andobtained by Bloomberg, the US’s Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said: “The fictional interceptors in the movie miss their target and we understand this is intended to be a compelling part of the drama intended for the entertainment of the audience,” but results from real-world testing “tell a vastly different story.”The memo added that the US’s missile interceptors “have displayed a 100% accuracy rate in testing for more than a decade”.Yet external agencies have disputed this claim, alongside Bigelow and Oppenheim, a former news journalist, who over the weekend said he “respectfully disagree[s]” with the MDA’s assertion.Nuclear physicist Laura Grego, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Bloomberg that the threat represented in the film was arguably the most straightforward that the US might have to deal with. “A robust defence should anticipate facing multiple incoming ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles] and credible decoys, and direct attacks on missile defense elements, but none of those were part of the story in this film. The fictional threat is arguably about as easy as they come.”Bigelow reiterated her hope that the film would trigger conversations, both within government and among the public.“In a perfect world, culture has the potential to drive policy,” she said, “and if there’s dialogue around the proliferation of nuclear weapons, that is music to my ears, certainly.”The film has topped Netflix’s streaming charts since its release and was watched by more than 20m accounts over its first three days. Bigelow credited its appeal to the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons.“It’s grappling with the idea that we’re surrounded by 12,000 weapons. We live in a really combustible environment, hence the title – we live in A House of Dynamite. The unthinkable – it’s time to address it and, in a perfect world, begin discussions about reducing the nuclear stockpile.”Bigelow told the Guardianthat the film did not seek endorsement or cooperation from the Pentagon to ensure its independence, saying: “Our nuclear armoury is a fallible structure. Within it are men and women working thanklessly behind the scenes, whose competence means you and I can sit and have this conversation. But competence doesn’t mean they’re infallible.”The US currently has 44 ground-based interceptors, based in Alaska and California, and in 2020 the Pentagon awarded a $13.3bn contract to Northrop Grumman for a new generation of ground-based missiles, due for delivery in 2029. In May, Donald Trumpproposed a “Golden Dome” missile system, featuring space-based weapons to intercept strikes against the US.Explore more on these topicsKathryn BigelowNuclear weaponsDrama filmsNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

I am banned,” Soyinka said.The US embassy in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, said it could not comment on individual cases, citing confidentiality rules.The Trump administration has made visa revocations a hallmark of its wider crackdown on immigration, notably targeting university students who were outspoken about Palestinian rights.Soyinka said he had recently compared Trump to Uganda’s Amin, something he said Trump “should be proud of”.“Idi Amin was a man of international stature, a statesman, so when I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment,” Soyinka said. “He’s been behaving like a dictator.”The 91-year-old playwright behind Death and the King’s Horseman has taught at and been awarded honours from top US universities including Harvard and Cornell.His latest novel, Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth, a satire about corruption in Nigeria, was published in 2021. Soyinka described the book as his “gift to Nigeria”in an interiviewwith the Guardian.In February, the Crucible theatre in Sheffieldstaged Death and the King’s Horseman.Soyinka left the door open to accepting an invitation to the United States should circumstances change, but added: “I wouldn’t take the initiative myself because there’s nothing I’m looking for there. Nothing.”He went on to criticise the ramped-up arrests of undocumented immigrants in the country.“This is not about me,” Soyinka said. “When we see people being picked off the street – people being hauled up and they disappear for a month … old women, children being separated. So that’s really what concerns me.”Trump’s crackdown has seen national guard troops deployed to US cities and citizens temporarily detained as part of aggressive raids, as well as the curtailing of legal means of entry.Explore more on these topicsWole SoyinkaNigeriaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationAfricaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the series, Adam Brody plays the so-called “hot rabbi” and love interest of Kristen Bell’s character, an atheist podcaster considering conversion. Together, the pair navigate cultural differences and disapproving family members. Or at least I assume that’s what happened – I was too distracted by all the product placement to focus on the plot.Nobody Wants This review – Kristen Bell and Adam Brody’s chemistry is electricRead moreHere’s a quick summary of the first five episodes of season two, with, technically, some spoilers. The two lovers get coffee and doughnuts from Dunkin’. Brody’s Noah gives Bell’s Joanne a gold Jennifer Meyer necklace. Joanne’s sister (Justine Lupe) calls the family “DoorDash people” and eats her “favorite snack” of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos by a pool. The couple goes to a pasta making class, which the chef reminds them was booked through an Airbnb experience. Something happens in a bathroom. I don’t know what, other than there was an extended money shot of the aforementioned Estée Lauder serum.View image in fullscreenJustine Lupe appears with an Estée Lauder product in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixAnd, oh yes, there is gossip and intrigue and life lessons learned along the way. Sadly, all I retained was the incredibly un-subliminal message that I should order takeout and buy some skincare. The medium is the message, indeed.I took my qualms to Reddit: had the show really become sponcon slop? I was not alone in this assessment. “The number of product placements this season is hilarious to the point that it’s basically a giant infomercial,” one user posted. “It’s literally like they wrote the scene around the products,” another wrote. “It’s almost like a parody of product placement in movies, but it’s not, and that’s a huge bummer,” another opined.View image in fullscreenAdam Brody (left) and Kristen Bell hold Dunkin’ Donuts products in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixI understand that it’s hard to make films and TV today, even if you’re Netflix (the company is doing well butnothing is certainin the volatile streaming market). I am a lifetime Los Angeles romanticist, and I’m troubled by the fact thatHollywoodhas entered aslow death spiral. Filming in town is at ahistoric low, with productions fleeing to Atlanta or New York or the UK orAustraliato save on costs. So many releases these days are big-budget franchises orspin-offs, rather than the types ofcharacter-driven romcomsthat I and so many others love. Nobody Wants This, shot in LA, was an exception to all that: smart, funny and disarmingly charming. So what if Netflix solicited a little financial boost from our benevolent corporate overlords?It would be naive to turn to television as an escape from the capitalist hellhole that is my phone’s endless scroll of thinly veiled #ads and influencer brand collaborations. From the early days of the first soaps (called that as they were sponsored by personal hygiene brands), TV existed to both entertain and sell stuff. Yet the nonstop hawking in Nobody Wants This feels particularly egregious. Sure, I’ll buy that Joanne, a privileged and slightly vapid podcaster, would be a brand snob who totes a yuppy-ish Clare V handbag and stocks her refrigerator with Spindrift seltzers. But in its best moments, the show encourages us to reflect on our own belief system: how it came to be, and how it might change with time. That introspection becomes difficult when your eye is being pulled to the bottle of Seventh Generation disinfectant spray (available at Target) in the frame.View image in fullscreenJustine Lupe eats Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixNetflix has long promoted brands during its shows. But the companyswearsit’s nottheiridea. Netflix, which did not respond to my request for comment, told the New York Times in 2019 that “most of the brands that appear in shows and movies are added by creators who believe they add to the authenticity of the story”, and that such placements were “rare and not a business focus” at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One early Netflix success story, House of Cards, ran from 2013 to 2018. Its product placements (BlackBerry, Sony, Cartier) fit into the world of the show – mostly. At one point, thelead characterFrank Underwood, then a US House of Representatives majority whip, asked one of his colleagues about his PlayStation Vita. “I oughta get one of these for the car,” he said, before the episode cut to credits.View image in fullscreenKristen Bell wears a Fly By Jing chili crisp-branded sweatshirt in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: NetflixNetflix’s Stranger Things, set in the 1980s, prominently featured products from that era, leading to a modern-day boon for brands such as Coca-Cola, Eggo, Cadillac, Schwinn, Nike and Burger King. In 2019, CBS Newsreportedthat the total advertising value for the more than 100 brands that appeared in the series was estimated to hit over $15m in the first three days of season three streaming.Last year, the Daily Mailfoundthat Emily in Paris, a bubblegum dramedy starring Lily Collins, plugged 37 brands throughout 10 episodes. Some you might expect for a show about an American who moves to Paris, which Sex and the City’s costume designer consulted on: Chanel, Dior, Hermès. But not every sponsor was as chic: Starbucks, Apple and –mon dieu! – McDonald’s.Maybe I’ll finish Nobody Wants This tonight. Or maybe I’ll go watch five straight hours of car commercials on YouTube; I’m not sure there’s much of a difference at this point.Netflixexecutives, if you see this, maybe cut back on the product placement.

And what he did was Ballad of a Small Player, which feels like the exact opposite of Conclave. A sweaty, vibrant, Macau-set fever dream of a thriller, it sees Colin Farrell hamming it up as an aristocratic English gambler scrambling to pay off his debts while trying to shake off Tilda Swinton, playing a woman who knows his true identity. While the results aren’t quite as satisfying as Conclave, it’s nevertheless very exciting to see a director as elegant as Berger turn his hand to something so trashy.Stuart HeritageHedda(Nia DaCosta, 2025),out now, Prime VideoBetween Marvel and her 28 Years Later sequel, Nia DaCosta has quietly snuck out an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s 134-year-old play Hedda Gabler. It’s far from the first – there have been at least 20 others – but it’s certainly the most modern. Tessa Thompson plays the lead, and the debauchery is ramped up beyond all comprehension. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a review of this film that doesn’t compare it to Emerald Fennell’s Saltburn; if nothing else, it should slake your thirst for sexy period fare until Fennell’s Wuthering Heights comes out in February.Stuart HeritageLate Night With the Devil(Cameron and Colin Cairnes, 2023), 9pm,Film4Just when you thought found footage horror had run out of steam, along comes 2023’s absurdly good Late Night With the Devil to revive it. The found footage comes in the form of a Halloween episode of a 1977 talk show that flies off the rails after an appearance by a 13-year-old possessed girl. The joy doesn’t just come from how scary it is but in the glee it takes in destroying show business tropes. It’s a note-perfect reconstruction of a time when late-night hosts were the most powerful people on TV.SHExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But on actual politics, she is less assuredHouman BarekatWed 29 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTShareAccepting a literary prize in Ohio last year, the novelistZadie Smithdescribed “feeling somewhat alienated from myself, experiencing myself as a posthumous entity”. Smith is only 50, but there is indeed something of the afterlife about the material gathered in her new book, which bundles various odds and ends from the past nine years: speeches, opinion pieces, criticism and eulogies for departed literary heroes – Philip Roth, Martin Amis, Hilary Mantel.In Some Notes on Mediated Time – one of three completely new essays in the collection – Smith recalls how the “dreamy, slo-mo world” of her 1980s childhood gave way, within a generation, to the “anxious, permanent now” of social media. If you lived through that transition, you don’t have to be very old to feel ancient. When this estrangement is compounded by the ordinary anxieties of ageing, cultural commentary becomes inflected with self-pity. Smith’s identification with the protagonist ofTodd Field’s Tár, a once revered conductor who finds herself shunned by the younger cohort, takes on existential proportions: “Our backs hurt, the kids don’t like Bach any more – and the seas are rising!”Those pesky “kids” stalk the pages of Dead and Alive, most noticeably at the level of language. When Smith deploys a nonchalant “IMHO” in an otherwise stately meditation on historical fiction, it feels plausibly organic. But many of her flirtations with the vernacular are prefaced by awkward, vaguely apologetic disclaimers: “as the youngs [sic] say”; “as the kids say”; “as the present cliché goes”; “To use one of the template phrases of the moment”. The cumulative effect is a little embarrassing. (In one unfortunate instance, a puzzling reference to “the circle-jerk of contemporary dating”, it seems she doesn’t know the meaning of the slang expression she has commandeered.)It’s as though Smith can’t quite decide if she’s a bien pensant pragmatist or an idealistic dreamerThere are upsides to being slightly out of touch. One is that you feel less obligated to pay lip service to the reductive pieties that grease the wheels of cultural commentary. Reflecting on a Parisian exhibition of global objets d’art originally collected in 18th-century Dresden, Smith suggests the word “Eurocentric” is doing too much heavy lifting in the gallery texts, “as if the curators, in their wisdom, had decided to take power – especially colonial power – at its own word”. Elsewhere, she bemoans the “unhinged” tone that lets down some biographies of overlooked literary women: “by turns furious, defensive, melancholy and tragic, their very intensity keeps the muse in her place, orbiting the great man”. In such works, score-settling zeal can obscure the complexity of human relationships: “If male artists sometimes stage dramas of power, it is not unknown for female artists to make a performance of masochism. Neither performance should be entirely trusted.”The moral bean-counting school of criticism makes for an impoverished discourse, as Smith notes in an essay on the painter Kara Walker,whose workriffs knowingly on racialised caricature. Minority artists are routinely upbraided from both sides, either for pandering to the white gaze or “being insufficiently empowering … neglecting to provide, for a black audience, some necessary form of ‘self-care’”. They should be allowed “to make work without shame”. Smith steers a similarly sensible middle course on the vexed debate around “cultural appropriation” in fiction, acknowledging the understandable “desire to be once and for all free of the limited – and limiting – fantasies and projections of other people” while insisting on the prerogatives of the novelist. There is more to people than their identity – “we can, sometimes, forget the mystery that lies at the heart of all selfhood”.The point is well made in a thoughtful piece on James Baldwin and the craft of writing, originally a lecture delivered to creative writing students over Zoom during the pandemic. Smith reminds her students that the essence of Baldwin’s brilliance was his ability to process politics through personal experience: he “submitted to his consciousness first and then re-examined what that might mean for his conscience”. This is sound advice, and Smith’s positions on the politics of creativity are beyond reproach, albeit commonsensical – amounting, essentially, to a caution against overcorrection and incuriosity.When it comes to actual politics, she is less assured. Her New Yorker op-ed on the war in Gaza, published in May 2024, was widely interpreted as unhelpfully equivocal, and seemed to conflate anti-war protesters with antisemites. She has since added her signature toan open letter acknowledging Israel’s actions as genocidal. The New Yorker piece, reprinted here with a new preamble hailing the protesters as “heroic”, is an intriguing artefact: the prose is mealy mouthed, heavy on the passive voice – all the more conspicuous since Smith’s writing is normally so clear and crisp. Grasping to account for this, I was reminded of her observation in a speech to environmental activists just a few pages earlier that “most street-level climate denial is actually sincere. Because the truth really is too terrible to contemplate.”In another speech, from 2018, Smith pays tribute to the postwar settlement that bequeathed us the NHS and the modern welfare state, and is being “deliberately dismantled by means of a concerted, fifty-year-long process of financial deregulation and privatisation … which it is well within our power to reverse”. On the eve of the 2024 general election,she reiterates this sentiment, in hope that “the next time the bright bird of potential equity flies past the ship of state, we might remember what it looks like … and not let any Tories or Neo-Liberals rush up on to the deck to shoot it down”. This modest aspiration would place Smith firmly to the left of the Starmerites, but her political instincts are centrist; she showed little enthusiasm for Jeremy Corbyn during his leadership of the Labour party, even though his platform was broadly in line with the views expressed here. (She has uttered his name in print just once, to put the boot in after Brexit.)It’s as though Smith can’t quite decide if she’s abien pensantpragmatist or an idealistic dreamer. In this respect she’s perhaps no different to many thousands of ambivalent liberal-ish voters. Fair enough – she’s a novelist, not a political theorist. What’s interesting is how all this relates to her metier, given that the catastrophic stagnation of centre-left politics – up to and including the present government – has coincided with a crisis in media. “For the past 15 years we have … been subjected to a truly monumental network of psychological influence that our governments have failed to regulate,” she writes. The same technological forces that have riven the body politic are threatening to destroy literary culture as we know it.Against this backdrop, Smith’s nostalgic evocations of analogue-era television are doubly poignant. TV dramas, she suggests, were not so very different to novels: “The seamlessness, the sharp cuts, the fades in and out … the storification of every element of life.” She believes the novel, with its unique capacity to generate empathy, can act as a bulwark against the oppressive uniformity of the algorithm. A lovely sentiment, but at this point it feels like an article of faith: the genie is out of the bottle. “I would rather the kids knew stories than soundbites,” Smith writes, and most sensible people would concur. The trouble is, as every embattled parent knows, that’s no longer her call – or ours – to make.Dead and Alive: Essays by Zadie Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton (£22).

Alongside the rage many terminally ill people feel against the dying of the light, there are the memories that return to flagellate the conscience: the failures of kindness, the misjudged words that can’t be unsaid, the feelings left catastrophically unexpressed. Crimes of the heart – and sometimes, worse.The malaise of regret and the yearning for absolution vibrate through Andrew Michael Hurley’s latest work of fiction, a wildly atmospheric, deceptively simple tale that borrows tropes from cosy crime only to snare you into something deeper, darker and more chilling.The driving animus of Hurley’s fiction has always been place. In his bestselling debut,The Loney, set in Morecambe Bay, and the folk-horror works that followed –Barrowbeck,Devil’s DayandStarve Acre– he evokes the atmosphere and folklore of his settings with deft, idiosyncratic brushstrokes that bring the reader into territory as psychic, even mythic, as it is physical. In Saltwash, the titular town of his new novel is a semi-abandoned coastal resort whose estuary has become “suckled down to a delta of dark streams and vast sandbanks”, and on whose tattered streets “the neglect … was so rife as to seem wilful”. Saltwash is not so much a town as a state of mind: one that the novel’s septuagenarian protagonist, Tom Shift, will be forced to reckon with during the course of his brief but soul-shaking visit.He arrives in the pounding rain for a meeting proposed by Oliver, the mercurial, enigmatic penpal brokered for him by the clinic where he goes for therapy. But Tom is drawn to their rendezvous at the crumbling Castle Hotel as much by curiosity as by friendship. Why do Oliver’s letters, though larded with literary allusions to mortality, shy away from the intended subject of their correspondence – which is that both of them are dying?Something is horribly awry here. Why is Tom, the only newcomer to the annual gathering, forbidden to know more?While the doomed Tom waits for the doomed Oliver in the hotel bar – all mildewed walls, surly staff and peeling stucco – more elderly people appear, as if for a reunion. Maniacally talkative, and dressed in the finery of their younger incarnations, they are cartoonishly drawn yet ghoulishly credible, and as the booze flows it emerges that they, too, are waiting for Oliver, and this is an annual party, the high point of which is to be a lottery.When Oliver finally appears, he immediately takes over the show, scattering bons mots and performing magic tricks with a verve and panache at odds with his unwashed clothes and skeletal appearance. As the night wears on, Tom catches dark hints about some of the other guests, but remains an innocent if increasingly anxious bystander to their simmering conflicts and intrigues. Yet as the meal is served – starting with an eel, celery and tomato soup so vile that one of the party vomits – his feeling that “he needed to be that rare thing, a better person” begins to build to a pitch he can’t ignore. Something is horribly awry here. Why is Tom, the only newcomer to the annual gathering, forbidden to know more about the lottery? And why is everyone so desperate to win?Easy to read but challenging to process, the novel left me entertained, but also feeling as raw, unsettled and existentially shaken as Tom, its hapless everyman. And perhaps that is exactly the intention. While Saltwash may not be the ideal Christmas gift for anyone confronting their mortality, for some unexamined souls it may be perfect. Welcoming on the outside, and increasingly unnerving as you reach the core of its gruesome, shocking proposition, Hurley’s latest offering is Heart of Darkness wrapped in candy.Saltwash by Andrew Michael Hurley is published by John Murray (£16.99.

For those who remember Riz Ahmed’s turn inthe award-winning 2019 movie Sound of Metal, about a heavy metal drummer who loses his hearing, there is moreover an extra frisson.Here Ahmed plays a lonely Muslim guy who grew up in the post-9/11 US; a lifetime of suspicion drove him to drink and now he’s in recovery. He runs an illegal and very lucrative specialist service for corporate employees in crooked organisations who wanted to be whistleblowers but lost their nerve and now just want to hand back the evidence without getting into further trouble. For a big fee, he will broker the return of the incriminating material while keeping back a copy for insurance purposes. To make contact with everyone, he usesa “relay” telephone servicewhich connects deaf and speech-impaired people using telephone operators who read aloud typewritten prompts and keep no records of what is said: an ideally secure message-drop system.Lily James plays Sarah, a woman who gets in touch with him saying she once wanted to expose her employer with a document she’s stolen; now she’s scared and just wants out. The fixer agrees to help, but breaks his own rules by getting emotionally close to her. Sam Worthington plays the sinister surveillance operative who wants to neutralise Sarah; it is nice to see Worthington get a break from boring Avatar duty. There are some very coolly orchestrated scenes in the big city and Mackenzie ratchets up the tension in style.Relay is in UK and Irish cinemas from 31 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersRiz AhmedLily JamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

He was in charge from 2014 to 2024 and this documentary, with remarkable access, shows us his final 12 months – day-by-day, moment-by-moment – after Joe Biden had persuaded him in 2023, when his tenure was technically at an end, to stay on for another year after Russia’s invasion ofUkraine.Perhaps, until that moment, Stoltenberg had been happy to assume that for all the meetings and stress, the secretary-generalship was an agreeable prestigious technocratic position without any real danger. But now he was faced with the possibility of executing Nato’s raison d’être. Ukraine can’t be admitted to Nato because that would mean war on Putin. But how about Nato giving money and weapons to Ukraine for attacks on Russian soil? Wouldn’tRussiasee that the same way?So the film shows us Stoltenberg taking endless public love-in photocalls withVolodymyr Zelenskyy, promising to bring him over to Norway for a fishing trip. Zelenskyy’s reply was: “After the war, after our victory, we will have time …”; it is like the beginning of a poignant poem. And Stoltenberg is shown fixing dissent within his own ranks, bro-hugging and backslapping friendly western leaders while keeping the nationalist-naysayers on side. When Turkey’s Erdoğan objects to Sweden joining Nato, Stoltenberg buys him off with American F-16s; when Hungary’s Orbán objects, Stoltenberg contrives an “opt-out” exempting Hungarian taxpayers from the cost of bankrolling Zelenskyy. And the fiercest sceptic of all, Trump, is appeased by getting everyone to stump up more cash.The film, for all that it finally verges on complacency and self-congratulation, subtly shows us that these temporary problems are in fact not so very bad for Stoltenberg and Nato; they always need a diplomatic excuse for delay, for not taking bold action against Russia. And then there is the long-term game: maintaining the body language of unity while the war and sanctions grimly continue.The international cabaret theatre of summitry with Zelenskyy is maintained: the sequined high-kicking chorus-line of western leaders who must keep smiling no matter what the backstage tensions are. And they have to be prepared to play the waiting game. Who will crack first? Putin knows more than anyone what the answer was to that question the first time, in 1989 – with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the breakup of the Soviet Union. Stoltenberg is a cool customer: outwardly bland but a shrewd fixer. He comments that the TV character he most sympathises with is Tony Soprano – who has to keep everyone happy.Facing War is in UK cinemas from 31 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsNatoRussiaUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s also the melancholy sensation of watching actors with just as much potential who didn’t enjoy the same success.Where Boston Kickout really stands out is in its depiction ofStevenagein Hertfordshire; the sort of in-between place rarely depicted in British cinema that possesses neither the affluence of the home counties nor the gritty “realness” of the north of England. But here Stevenage feels wonderfully real; these guys aren’t living in slums, but nobody has a mansion either. It captures with wonderful acuity the way that this kind of place in the 1990s would have felt so limited to four teenagers. It’s not a million miles off the kind of milieu depicted in The Inbetweeners, but instead of boredom and cluelessness leading to sitcom japes, their options, as they experience it, are: violence, escape, drugs and marriage (too young, to the first person you meet).For the most part, the lads are lower middle class, but enamoured of what they perceive as the authenticity and excitement of delinquent behaviour. Lincoln’s relatively suave character is the one clearly heading for wider horizons, while Warren’s thuggish lout is headed for prison one way or another, with the others caught somewhere between the two extremes. None are exactly appealing characters, but all ring true. There’s not a huge amount of plot, in truth: the lads knock around Stevenage, waiting for their A-level results, mostly drinking and trying to pick up girls. A near contemporary to Trainspotting and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, it makes a certain sense that in the final act Boston Kickout overplays its hand a little.Boston Kickout is on digital platforms from 25 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsJohn SimmAndrew LincolnMarc WarrenStevenagereviewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve watched many of these films, includingMan on Wire, about Philippe Petit’s audacious stroll between the twin towers, andFree Solo, about climber Alex Honnold’s compulsion to live, quite literally, on the edge.And yet, I can’t recall a scene in any of them that truly explains why these often highly intelligent people risk so much, beyond the usual talk of “feeling alive” or whatever existential itch this sort of thing is meant to scratch. I’ve never felt I really understood any of them or the appeal of what they do.Nor did I feel I understood this after watching Deeper, an entertaining and quite well-made film focused on a team of cave divers as they explore New Zealand’s Pearse Resurgence cave system, well-known in the diving world for its “potential to be the deepest dived cave in the world”.These divers include Richard Harris, one of the heroes of theThailand cave rescue, who famously played a crucial role in anaesthetising the trapped boys so they could be carried safely through flooded tunnels. Perhaps no series of words or images can fully express how a person’sraison d’êtrecan emerge from the alignment of danger and purpose.Journey Home, David Gulpilil review – an elegant celebration of one of Australia’s great actorsRead moreIn Deeper, Harris (who was played by Joel Edgerton in Ron Howard’s movieThirteen Lives) describes himself as “definitely not a brave man”, adding humility to his already annoyingly large list of virtues. Harris and his team of “wet mules” – Dr Craig Challen, Ken Smith, Dr Simon Mitchell, Luke Nelson, Dave Hurst, Dave Apperley, John Dalla-Zuanna and Martyn Griffiths – want, like all deep divers and their supporters, to go farther into the Earth’s bowels than anyone before them. This is slightly more complicated than bunging on a diving suit and emailing the Guinness book of records. We learn, for instance, about high-pressure neurological syndrome, which causes tremors, cognitive impairment and other disturbances that worsen with depth, sometimes to the point where divers can barely use their hands.View image in fullscreen‘In spatial terms, Deeper pursues the reverse trajectory of Peedom’s cracking Mount Everest doco Sherpa.’Photograph: Madman EntertainmentThe group believe they’ve found a workaround by using hydrogen as a breathing gas, prompting the “Hydrogen Expedition” of 2023, in which they decide to deploy themselves as guinea pigs. This daring voyage gives the film its dramatic arc, even though we know the key players survive; they’re right there in the interviews. That’s partly why lines like “this is it, the moment of truth” and other reflections about nerves and risk don’t land with much oomph. It’s in the storyteller’s best interests to show things going awry, creating friction and anticipation, but Peedom is a classy documentarian – not the kind to manufacture peril for the sake of narrative convenience.I’m obsessed with cave diving. This is the closest environment we have to spaceRead moreIn spatial terms, Deeper pursues the reverse trajectory of Peedom’s cracking Mount Everest docoSherpa– its verticality pointing downwards, towards the Earth’s crust rather than the clouds. One core challenge is that deep diving, which involves navigating pitch black cavernous spaces, doesn’t exactly scream “visually interesting” the way summiting Everest does. There are pretty drone shots of lush New Zealand wilderness but there’s no escaping that much of this film isn’t visually thrilling once the dive begins.Ultimately, while the team’s voyage is important, it’s likely to mean most to the deep-diving community. More could have been done to communicate its significance to the rest of us. Still, the film remains interesting throughout and creates a sense of adventure – especially for those, like me, whose idea of risk is reheating leftovers twice.Deeper is in Australian cinemas from 30 OctoberExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsAustralian filmNew ZealandDivingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both are true: no two gigs by this fantastic off-the-cuff comic are ever the same, and yet all of them cleave tightly to the same free-associating formula. Tonight’s show, part of his Cranium of Curiosities UK tour, is no different. I suspect these two hours of wildly divergent nonsense hit a fair few pre-scripted marks, but if they do, it’s deftly concealed among the expertly extemporised riffs – dreamed up, developed and kept going in constant dialogue with his audience – on Gregg Wallace, fairy figurines anddugongs.It is,and always has been, quite the feat, of which Noble, now 49, is the effortless master. If I were feeling churlish (or when I’ve watched his work too frequently), I might feel fatigued at the attritional meaninglessness of his shows, which stubbornly refuse to coalesce into anything resembling a theme, point or argument. Sometimes, too, Noble’s meta-commentary on his own wackiness, and how mindblown we supposedly are by it, gets a bit much.But tonight is one of those nights where it’s easier just to marvel at the craft, and laugh helplessly at the many startling images conjured by the geordie’s fizzing comic brain. Maybe his hypothetical West End musical of latterday video nasty The Human Centipede is first base – but his gag about how its cast might travel incognito is a keeper. A proposed TV gameshow, Hips or Piles?, will linger long in the memory, and a routine about how to stay safe in a hi-vis factory is a mini-masterpiece of surrealist standup.Then there’s the act-out of a scene involving Bear Grylls, Dame Judi Dench and a jellyfish in the desert, concluding with the imperishable assertion: “If he was a true Christian, he’d slide his leg under her.” You had to be there, of course – and Noble at his carefree, escapist best takes you all the way there, far from the rational tyranny of your own life, loosed from sense and propriety entirely.Ross Noble: Cranium of Curiositiesis touring until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Five years later it’s coming to Glyndebourne. He tells us howMark-Anthony TurnageWed 29 Oct 2025 06.04 EDTShareIhave history withGlyndebourne. Back in 1984 when I was a naive 24-year-old, I was a music copyist to make ends meet. My great friend and teacher Oliver Knussen got me work on his opera Where the Wild Things Are ahead of its premiere by Glyndebourne Touring Opera.I decamped to Lewes and stayed up, often all night, handwriting orchestral parts with my colleagues. I learned a lot during those high-stress days. I’ve been to many performances at Glyndebourne since, and 20 years ago was in talks with the artistic team about writing a new opera, but I never found a subject that suited. A decade later, my partner Rachael Hewer started working there as an assistant director and I regularly went to stay during the summer and autumn seasons, often at Gus Christie’s house (the wonderful Glyndebourne House, which once belonged to the festival’s founders John Christie and Audrey Mildmay). I started thinking it would be fun to write an opera for all the new friends I’d met there. Then Covid struck. Rachael and I, like everyone else, needed to do something constructive with all those extra hours on our hands. We hatched a plan: to write an opera.I know lockdown was tough for most people, but as a composer I’m used to being solitary. I always write at home, apart from short spells working with musicians and singers in concert halls and opera houses. The idea of months and months where I can’t do anything other than compose makes me happy. Sometimes though, I feel we’re in danger of forgetting what those very early days of the first Covid lockdown were like. I remember them so clearly – as we watched the daily briefings, with those numbers skyrocketing almost by the hour. We were genuinely frightened for our futures. Would life ever go back to what it was before? Would theatres ever reopen, would we ever hear an orchestra in person again? It felt like such a precarious existence, even though looking back I realise that we were in a very fortunate position.View image in fullscreenRachael Hewer and Mark-Anthony Turnage during a Railway Children workshop at Glyndebourne, October 2024.Photograph: Pablo Strong/Glyndebourne Productions LtdRachael and I did have to juggle home-schooling for my kids. Rachael did most of that. They were three days with us, then three with their mum. On our three days off we furiously worked on The Railway Children. We chose it partly because it’s a beloved book by E Nesbit and an iconic film that everyone, particularly of my generation loves, but it’s also out of copyright – so we didn’t need permission.As a book, The Railway Children is fairly episodic, so Rachael’s first task was to distil it down, otherwise we would have had a Wagnerian-length opera of six hours. We proceeded in secret. Rachael was upstairs writing a scene, which she would deliver downstairs to my study. I would get on with that (occasionally asking for small re-writes, usually condensing or simplifying). Then she would write the next and so on. It took us just over four months. Normally it can take up to two years to write a full-length opera, but the pandemic helped us there. Then we shelved it and thought, “Well that was a nice distraction.” Rachael went on to direct a film of Ravel’sL’enfant et les Sortilèges(for which she won the South Bank Sky Arts award), and I started work with Lee Hall onFestenfor the Royal Ballet and Opera. We almost forgot about it.View image in fullscreenTurnage’s opera Festen at the Royal Opera House in February 2025.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSometime later, we had another look at it and decided it would be nice to hear it. We organised a workshop with some of our fabulous singer friends. They were sworn to secrecy. Even my publisher didn’t know. These singers did such a great job that it convinced us the opera might have a life. It needed a lot of work and we decided that the Edwardian setting required an update. You never know why the dad goes to prison, so we filled out his backstory, added a spy element and moved it to the 80s, along the way making Mum a much stronger character.If we’re really honest, we have to admit that we only ever had the Glyndebourne stage in mind for this. Once we’d gone back to the piece almost a year later, things had started to open up again and it looked like there would be a world to go back to that might very well have space and scope for a new opera.View image in fullscreenNo red flags… Jenny Agutter, Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett in the 1970 film of E Nesbit’s story.Photograph: Studio Canal/REX/ShutterstockWe decided to bite the bullet and sent it to the opera company’s artistic director Stephen Langridge. We got a proper copy of the whole thing printed and bound, Rachael included a fun-size Wispa bar in the package as a hint to keep it under wraps. He was in no position to commit to taking the project on at that point, so we had to sit tight and let him figure out if he was interested, and then if there was a place for the piece at Glyndebourne. We thought our chances were slim, and we were astonished when Stephen got back to us to say that Glyndebourne would stage it. It was my idea that he should direct it himself.Even after seeing the incredible stage designs by Nicky Shaw in model-form, I still couldn’t believe it was happening. Then news of the production appeared on the website, and people started buying tickets, and here we are in the middle of rehearsals, about to see the action on stage for the first time. I know it’s here in front of me, and I’m well aware of the hard work and determination that has gone into making this a reality, but there is still a big part of me that looks back to how and when it was created, and how different the world was then, and how far we have come since, and at the same time how much we have left behind.The Railway Children composed by Mark-Anthony Turnage with libretto by Rachael Hewer is at Glyndebourne on 30 October and 1 November, with a further staged concert performance at theQueen Elizabeth Hall, London on 8 November.Explore more on these topicsOperaGlyndebourneClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So it was hard to have a bit of a tough time and not be able to give very much.’Photograph: Nick McKinlayAustralian musicInterviewStella Donnelly on the painful friend breakup that inspired her new album: ‘I’m trying to protect them – but I’ve written this record’Brodie LancasterOn her third album, Love and Fortune, the Australian singer has captured the dull ache of being rejected by a friend – and how she fell in love with music againGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailWed 29 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 29 Oct 2025 16.34 EDTShareStella Donnelly didn’t want to write songs about a friend who broke her heart. But any time the Welsh Australian singer-songwriter tried to channel anything else into her lyrics, the hurt was always there on the surface.We have a language for coping with romantic heartbreak, learned from movies and songs – but there are fewer mirrors in art forcoping with the end of platonic bonds. On her third album, Love and Fortune, Donnelly has captured the dull ache of being rejected by a friend who once knew her best of all. It might become the record ghosted friends turn to when they find a person they knew intimately for years no longer wants to hear from them.When it happened to her, Donnelly felt powerless, realising “no amount of questioning or reaching out is going to work. I’d never come up against that in my life.” Any tensions in other friendships she’d had previously could be talked through; this time, she was having a conversation with herself.“It’s so heavy and, for me, never resolved,” she says. “Ever.”As much as the 33-year-old tried not to write about it, it sprang up each time she touched an instrument. She writes of letters left unsent on the track Friends, hiding herself away and not showing up to gigs she thinks her friend might also go to on Ghosts. “It’s as much an offering as it is a journal, in a way,” Donnelly says of the album.View image in fullscreenStella Donnelly wrote Love and Fortune in her head and on her bike around Melbourne’s northern suburbs.Photograph: Nick McKinlayWe’re chatting over kombucha in the garden of Ceres, a farm and nursery in Melbourne’s East Brunswick. Around us flit magpies and other species that Donnelly, a keen ornithologist, notes by name. Birds are a symbol for evolution on the record: over plaintive, soft keys on Please Everyone, she recalls birdwatching with her former friend as sweet recorded chirps arrive on the track. “Wherever you may be, I hope it’s kind to you,” she sings. By the time we get to the album closer, Laying Low, she’s calmer, singing of the feathers left behind when someone flies away. By then, she’s learned, trying to grab them would be a fool’s errand.Donnelly is quick, eager and delightful in conversation, but she has been struggling in interviews, she says, “because I’m so busy trying to protect the other person in all of this. But then I have gone and written this record.” When a freak sun shower prompts us to scurry away for cover, it also gives her respite from having to tiptoe around her words. When we settle again out of the rain, she apologises for “giving politician answers”, explaining the last thing she wants to do is twist a knife in someone else’s side with a more uncensored version of events.Stella Donnelly’s song Feel It Change, from Love and Fortune.Donnelly has taken a deliberate break from the music industry in recent years. From the moment her debut EP, Thrush Metal, was released in 2017, she never allowed herself a pause. That record featured her searing breakout single, Boys Will Be Boys, which arrived at a prescient moment andbecame a symbol of the Australian #MeToo movement. “The first song I put out was the heaviest song I have ever written. That came with pressure.”I think up until this year, I’d been really hard on myself because I was just like, ‘Why can everyone else cope with life?’Donnelly toured internationally, was awarded the inaugural $25,000 Levi’s Music prize at Australian industry conference Bigsound, earned multiple best album nominations at the Air awards for her debut, Beware of the Dogs, and an Aria nomination to boot. “I was just like, ‘I don’t care. I’ll just say yes’,” she says of the workload. “It was a little bit crazy.”After years of saying yes, a crash was inevitable. People around her could tell Donnelly was “at [her] wit’s end for a while but was pushing through”. She was overwhelmed, “a little bit scared, and getting sick”. Shows were cancelled. Her label, Secretly, would later drop her.Hunting for the spark of creativity proved harder than ever when she was deep in burnout. That was perhaps the true warning bell. “I’ve always championed honesty. So it was hard to have a bit of a tough time and not be able to give very much.”View image in fullscreenStella Donnelly performs on stage during Primavera Sound 2022 in Barcelona, Spain.Photograph: Jim Bennett/RedfernsIn an effort to establish normalcy and a daily rhythm outside making, selling and promoting her art, Donnelly got a job at a local bakery. She began riding her bike to work before dawn, where she and her fellow musicians-slash-hospo-workers spent the day listening to community radio stations as they served the local musicians who came in for coffee and sourdough. “I could not escape music if I tried.” And she really did try.Indie rising stars the Belair Lip Bombs: ‘We don’t want to regret not giving it a proper crack’Read moreShe began playing in friends’ bands, rounding out rhythm sections alongside her husband, Marcel Tussie, of the band Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever: “That’s where Marcel and I really, really connect. I play bass and he plays drums, and it’s my favourite context to be in with him because we are just there together, supporting someone else’s music, and it’s not about either of us in that moment.”They swapped headline shows for a fundraiser gig in their back yard last year, when 75 people showed up to helpchef Aheda Amro, a Palestinian refugee, gather funds to buy her own food truck. She watched her friends perform intimate shows to a couple of dozen people. In trying to escape the music industry, she found what a music community looked like. “That’s when I started writing more songs again, because it was just like, ‘Oh, I love this’.”Even learning Secretly wouldn’t pick up her next record eventually felt like a blessing in disguise. “I cried for a day, and then the next day felt really, really free. I felt likethat little kid in overalls again, who wanted to write an EP. It was that feeling of ‘No one actually cares about what I’m doing – so what am I going to do?’”View image in fullscreen‘I’m just a lot kinder to myself now, about everything.’Photograph: Nick McKinlayAfter writing her past two records on tour and on deadline, Donnelly wrote Love and Fortune in her head and on her bike around Melbourne’s northern suburbs.Six months ago, after being diagnosed as neurodivergent, she learned what self-care looks like for a person with a sensitive mind. “It’s just understanding that I need a little extra help here and there with things, and that a motorcycle riding past really loudly on the street can be a day-ruiner for me. I’m just a lot kinder to myself now, about everything.”“Take back my little life … I set myself on fire for someone else’s game,” she sings on W.A.L.K, a song about caring for herself like she would a beloved pet. Tending to her most basic needs became a new daily devotion.“I think, up until this year, I’d been really hard on myself because I was just like, ‘Why can everyone else do this and I can’t? Why can everyone else cope with life?’” she says.She now has “hindsight kindness” for the past versions of her. The ones that couldn’t cope as well, who pushed through the discomfort of touring and sat in bed waiting for a text back – then chastised herself for doing it. “Finally allowing myself to just write a whole fucking album about this big thing that had happened to me made me accept that that’s kind of who I am: I’m this annoying person that writes songs about their personal life. I had to reconcile with the fact that that’s who I am, and grow to love that person.”Love and Fortuneis out on 7 November (Remote Control/Dot Dash Recordings).

In recent years there’s been a steady resurgence of interest in him and his work – not just as a gay, Black composer, but as a significant musical personality whose maverick minimalist beats earned him a reputation for artistic confrontation.This concert, part of US bass-baritone Davóne Tines’sBarbicanresidency, offered a snapshot of his eclectic output. Touch Him When, arranged here for electric guitar and performed with head-banging intensity by Jiji, explored Eastman’s belief in music as a performative art. Distortion pedals and reverb leant the music a doom-metal vibe as consonant and dissonant waves crashed and burned. At the opposite end of the spectrum was Piano 2, a tripartite work with a conventional, early-20th-century feel, presented with calm authority by pianist Conor Hanick.View image in fullscreenAn increasingly sensual pas de deux … Khalid Dunton and José Lapaz-Rodriguez.Photograph: Andy ParadiseThe Holy Presence of Joan d’Arc, composed for 10 cellos, featured chugging rhythms undercut by doleful phrases that rose and fell. Eastman clearly identified with the medieval warrior and defier of gender norms. The originally improvised prelude, where Joan’s spirit guides call on her to speak boldly, was intoned by Tines, his voice resonating like a fist in a velvet glove as he traversed the auditorium. Cellist Seth Parker Woods, who also curated the concert, played live against nine prerecorded lines. It was a fine performance, but how much more powerful might it have been with those nine other cellists?Eastman’s music was often reworked for whatever forces he had available. Here, the iconic Gay Guerilla was arranged for three pianists at two pianos, cello, electric guitar and voice with two dancers and choreography by Kyle Marshall. Tolling chords built and shifted, gaining in harmonic complexity until, two-thirds of the way through, the music erupted with acerbic iterations of the Lutheran battle hymn Ein Feste Burg. Clad as timeless soldiers, Khalid Dunton and José Lapaz-Rodriguez hunted and circled each other in an increasingly sensual pas de deux as the lines between sleep and death, sex and combat became progressively blurred.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Over the last decade, however, the largest island in the Inner Hebrides has been drawing visitors for other reasons – its dynamic food and drink scene. Leading the way are youngSgitheanach(people from Skye) with a global outlook but a commitment to local, sustainable ingredients. It’s also the result of an engaged community keen to create good, year-round jobs that keep young people on the island.Calum Montgomery is Skye born and bred, and he’s passionate about showcasing the island’s larder on his menus atEdinbane Lodge. “If someone is coming to Skye I want them to appreciate the landscape, but also the quality of our produce,” he says. “Our mussels, lobster, scallops and crab are second to none.” Montgomery is mindful of the past: “It means everything to me to use the same produce as my ancestors. My grandpa was a lobster fisherman and we’re enjoying shellfish from the same stretch of water, with the same respect for ingredients.”View image in fullscreenLoch Fada near Portree, Skye.Photograph: Denis Chapman/AlamyMontgomery’s A Taste of Skye menu lists the distances his produce has travelled. I eat fat scallops hand-dived in Loch Greshornish (zero miles), and creel-caught lobster from Portree (12 miles) with vegetables, foraged herbs and edible flowers from the kitchen garden and seashore (zero miles). That connection to produce and producers is key. “Last week I took a young chef out with a scallop diver so he could learn what they do. We shucked scallops straight from the water and ate them raw with a squeeze of lemon. ‘That’s the best scallop I’ve ever eaten,’ he said. That’s what we want to bring to the restaurant.”Driving south, in the shadow of the mighty Cuillin mountains, I meet another culinary ambassador for Skye, Clare Coghill, atCafé Cùil. This year Coghill represented Scotland at Tartan Week in New York, serving lobster rolls with whisky butter, and haggis quesadillas from a Manhattan food truck. She initially launched Café Cùil in Hackney, London. Returning home to Skye during the pandemic, a series of pop-ups proved there was a market here too.View image in fullscreenCafé Cùil’s blood orange and beetroot-cured trout on sourdough and creme fraiche.Photograph: Lynne Kennedy PhotographyOver a machair matcha (topped with dried machair flowers) and delicious blood orange-cured trout, Coghill tells me: “I’m really proud I opened in London, but I couldn’t do what I can do here. Getting fresh ingredients was a huge mission, but here the scallops come straight from the sea to my door. My creel fisherman only speaks to me in Gaelic.” Her love of Skye’s produce, people and landscape is clear across her colourful, creative dishes, all imbued with local flavours, with a twist of Gaelic. “My connection to Gaelic culture and language is so important,” she says. Visitors can use little lesson cards on the tables to learn a few words while they eat.A lot of us worked elsewhere. We’d see the produce arrive miles from where it was landed, and it’s just not as goodSkye’s more longstanding food destinations are not resting on their laurels.Kinloch Lodge, a boutique hotel run by Isabella Macdonald in her family’s ancestral home, has long been a foodie destination. Isabella’s mother, Claire, Lady Macdonald OBE, writes well-loved books on Scottish cookery.The kitchen continues to innovate, with a dynamic young team led by head chef David Cameron. When they’re not in the kitchen the chefs grow herbs and spices in the hotel greenhouse, and forage for wild greens in the gardens and sea herbs like sea aster and scurvygrass from the shoreline of Loch na Dal. In autumn they follow deer trails to find mushrooms in the woods.View image in fullscreenHogget with asparagus and spinach, at Edinbane LodgePhotograph: Lynne KennedyI feast on Skye scallops, pak choi and peanuts in a delicious dashi; Shetland cod with Scottish asparagus, and house-smoked lobster. Kinloch’s ghillie, Mitchell Partridge, takes guests out for activities including foraging and fishing “There’s a huge appetite for experiences from our guests,” says Macdonald. “People want to come and really get to know the island and the landscape.”The whisky industry is also helping to keep young people on Skye, in jobs that last beyond the peak tourism months. Dougie Stewart, operations manager atTorabhaig distillery, tells me: “The fish farm was a big employer in the past, but now most of the jobs are automated. House prices have gone up so much it’s harder for young people to stay. The whisky industry has become a really important employer.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In other distilleries, that’s an honour usually reserved for retiring distillers. The visitor centre and cafe employ many people from around the Sleat peninsula. “We meld into the community because we brought the community here,” says tour guide manager Anne O’lone.To pick up supplies for my journey home I stop byBirch, a speciality coffee roaster and bakery serving gleaming pastries and colourful brunch dishes. It’s owned by Niall Munro, who also founded the hugely successfulSkye Livemusic festival. His brother Calum Munro is chef-owner at fine-dining restaurantScorrybreacin Portree, somewhere I’m desperate to try, but I’ve sadly run out of mealtimes. More local success stories, and incredible food.“We’re all deeply rooted in Skye,” says Calum Montgomery. “A lot of us left and worked elsewhere. We’d be seeing the produce we knew arrive miles from where it was landed, and it’s just not as good as what we grew up eating. I’m so proud of the whole place now.”Journeying across Skye, I’m constantly asked where I’ve been and where I’m eating next. It’s a real testament to this food community that everyone is keen to champion other island businesses. It’s collaborative, not competitive, and the quality?

Keep and combine any trimmings into a ball and re-roll as and when required.Pastrykeeps well in the freezer, and by skipping two time-consuming steps in the traditional recipe – that is, making the pastry and caramelising the onions – this one comes together about an hour faster. Instead, the onions are cooked upside down, steaming and caramelising beneath a blanket of pastry with anchovies and black olives for a fast, fun twist on a French classic. And if you have less pastry, you can always halve the recipe.Quick upside-down pissaladière tartsThe current wave of upside-down tarts, which went viral on TikTok and Instagram a couple of years ago, may have begun with Lily Ghodrati’s delicious and simplepeach and honey puff pastryor Dominik Franks’inspirational onion tart, which even led to a whole book on upside-down cooking. I’ve also been having a lot of fun cooking upside down lately, frommy extra-long leek tartto these speedy pissaladière tartlets. It’s a simple, playful way to create something that feels extra-special.Makes4 individual tarts1 red onion2 tbsp olive oil1 tbsp honeySalt and black pepper8 anchovies(or 4, for a milder taste)Pitted black olives, to taste120g pastry– I used puff but shortcrust works, tooHeat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Peel and trim the onion, then cut into four thick, round slices (cross-sections of onion). Line a hob-appropriate oven sheet with baking paper, then imagine where you will put each piece of onion. Drizzle those areas with olive oil and honey, then season. Lay two anchovies on top of each seasoned patch and cover them with a piece of onion. Nestle a few black olives in and around the onions, then season with a little more olive oil, honey, salt and pepper.Turn on two adjacent hob rings to a medium heat, put the tray on top of the rings and leave the onions to cook undisturbed for five minutes.Meanwhile, on a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry and cut it into four rectangles just large enough to cover each piece of onion. Carefully lay one pastry rectangle on top of each piece of onion, press down around the edges with the back of a fork, then bake for 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Lay a board on top of the pastry tray, then flip to invert the tarts on to the board. Carefully peel away the paper and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wastePastryBakingVegetablesSnacksStarterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You have all the preserves from the warmer months to work with, prolonging the essence of balmier days, but, as colder weather draws in, it’s also a time to think about heartier fare to warm our bellies. Root vegetables, mushrooms and dark red meat play a prominent role in making the winter chill not just bearable but somehow even desirable.Duckis one of my favourites for a weekend lunch, and we’re lucky to have incredible produce here in Yorkshire to pair it with.Honey-roast duck with beetroot and poached pears (pictured top)Chill48 hrPrep20 minCook1 hr 30 minServes4For the pears2 large, ripe williams pears, peeled, quartered and cored600mlred wine300g caster sugarStrips of zest and juice of 1 orange3 bay leaves1 rosemary sprig1 thyme sprigFor the duck200g baby beetroot, halved1 garlic bulb2 red onions, peeled and quartered2 rosemary sprigs2 tbsp olive oil2 tbspraspberry vinegar, or balsamic vinegar1 duck crown, left uncovered in the fridge for 48 hours (this helps to dry out the skin)3 tbsp runny honeySaltHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the pears in a pan with the wine, sugar, orange zest and juice, bay, rosemary and thyme. Cover with a cartouche (a circle of baking paper laid directly on top of the poaching liquid), bring to a gentle simmer and poach for about 15-20 minutes, until tender.Meanwhile, put the beetroot, garlic, onion, rosemary, olive oil and vinegar in an oven tray, mix well, then roastfor 25 minutes.Rub the duck all over with the honey, and season liberally with salt. Once the beetroot mix has had 25 minutes, sit the duck crown on top and return to the oven for 10 minutes. Turn the tray 180 degrees, roast for another eight minutes, then remove and leave to rest for 20 minutes.Carve the duck and serve each portion with two slices of warm poached pear as a garnish (keep the poaching liquid: reduce it until it’s syrupy, then save for pouring over vanilla ice-cream). This would be lovely with some mash and/or a bitter-leaf salad alongside.Yorkshire pudding stuffed with slow-cooked duck leg, liver parfait and wild mushroomsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian.

Divide the duck fat evenly between two four-hole yorkshire pudding tins (or deep muffin tins – to make eight), then put the trays in the hot oven to heat up.Meanwhile, make the batter. Tip the flour into a bowl, then beat in the eggs until smooth. Gradually beat in the milk then continue to beat until the mix is completely lump-free. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the melted butter and pour the batter into a jug. Take the hot tins out of the oven, then carefully and evenly pour the batter into the greased holes. Return the tins to the oven and bake undisturbed for 20-25 minutes, until the puddings have puffed up and browned. Remove and set aside while you make the stuffing.Meanwhile, put a large, lidded ovenproof casserole on a medium heat, then brown the duck legs in it for 10-15 minutes (their fat will render so no need for oil), turning every few minutes so they colour all over. Transfer to a plate and remove all but a tablespoon of the duck fat from the casserole (save the excess for roasting spuds). Once the yorkshire puddings are out of the oven, reduce the temperature to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.Add the wild mushrooms to the hot casserole and cook, stirring, for four minutes, until they start to take on colour. Add the shallots and garlic, and fry, stirring, for two or three minutes, just to soften. Add the flour, cook, stirring, for a minute, then return the duck legs to the pan. Pour in the red wine, stock and rosemary, bring to a simmer, then cover and transfer to the oven for an hour and a half.When the duck is cooked, lift the legs out of the pot and shred all the meat off the bones. Put the casserole on a medium heat and reduce the liquid for about four minutes, until it turns nice and glossy, then stir the shredded duck back into the mix.Put two hot yorkshire puddings on each plate (reheat them gently in the oven first), and put a large tablespoon of the parfait in the centre of each one. Pile some of the duck and mushroom mixture on top and serve immediately.Joshua Overington is chef/owner ofMýsein Hovingham, North YorkshireExplore more on these topicsFoodDuckMain courseBritish food and drinkAutumn food and drinkVegetablesBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"
