But I found that a mix of apps and other tools, as well as a happy attitude, led to a world of potential new palsEmily BrattSun 23 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTShareTonight, Rachel, Elvira and I will meet for dinner. A year ago, none of us knew the others existed. Six months ago Rachel and Elvira were strangers until I introduced them. But now, here we are, something as close to firm friends as is possible after such a short time.If you’ve ever consumed any media, you would be forgiven for thinking that life after 35 is a burning wasteland of unimaginable horrors: the beginnings of incessant back pain, an interest in dishwasher loading, the discovery that you’re ineligible for entire industries billed as “a young person’s game”, and, apparently, an inability to make friends.“It becomes harder to make friends as you get older,” goes the adage, and indeed, 69% of people in aUS surveyby Talker Research agree that making close friends becomes more difficult as you age. Research shows that it takesabout 200 hoursof contact to form a close friendship and, according to psychotherapist Kaytee Gillis, that kind of dedicated time evaporates in adulthood. “Unlike in childhood, where free time is abundant and social interactions are woven into the fabric of everyday life,” she writes, “adults often have to actively carve out time for social activities amid their busy schedules.” Add to this the fact that we’re living in an increasingly disconnected age and in a recognised globalloneliness epidemic, and it feels as if we are doomed.Or not necessarily. I’m living proof that making friends doesn’t have to be confined to the school playground, freshers’ week or your first job. Over the past year, I have slowly gathered a small network of new people in whose presence I feel content.I crashed into my mid-30s unprepared for a dramatic shift in my social life. My social diary contained gaping weekend-sized holes, where once, in my roaring 20s, it had been full to the brim with after-work drinks, brunches, lunches, birthday parties, and nights out for no reason other than it was Saturday (or Friday, or Thursday, or Wednesday …).View image in fullscreenIllustration: Lena Yokohama/The GuardianThe same friends who once stood on pub chairs singing at 2am, suddenly, and in quick succession, moved to suburbia (and other countries), got married and had children. But all of us – the newlyweds and the not-weds – staunchly maintained a delusion that nothing about our friendships would change.I, in the latter camp, realised my life path was rapidly diverging from that of my nearest and dearest. Those who had started families were now less available or able to be spontaneous. I understood this and I was happy for them in their new lives and roles. But emotionally, it felt like a loss. It wasn’t just their physical presence I missed – I didn’t necessarily need us all to be back together, shrieking in pubs every weekend – but our connection generally. Even phone catchups fell by the wayside; we would spend days, sometimes weeks, circling each other’s calendars like confused birds unable to land a time to just talk.Then there came the pang of watching friends embark on a life I couldn’t relate to, but society told me I was supposed to be living. Unpicking the expectations for women of marriage and motherhood has taken me years, so tightly woven were they within my being. In the process, I felt like an anomaly – a failure, sometimes – among trusted friends with whom I’d once shared so much.The desire to fit in is a basic human instinct. And so, as much as I loved these friends and would continue to spend time with them, I also knew I needed to meet people living a similar life to me.We would spend days circling each other’s calendars like confused birds unable to land a time to just talkA friend overseas extolled the virtues of Bumble BFF, the platonic version of the popular dating app. This time, you’re not browsing a catalogue of faces to see which you find attractive, but are instead attempting to discern which face suggests friendship material. In a dating culture already warped by swipe-based judgment, it felt wrong – almost antithetical to my feminist values – to be a woman scrutinising other women in this way. But the aforementioned friend insisted Bumble BFF had given her the gift of a new friendship circle, so, reluctantly, I got swiping.Fun fact: it doesn’t matter whether you’re swiping for friends or lovers, you’re never immune to feelings of rejection and self-doubt. In fact, being ghosted by a potential new pal is, arguably, worse. I can accept that someone might not fancy me, what’s less palatable is someone finding me so completely unfriendable. One woman, with whom I’d exchanged a few lighthearted messages, disappeared from the app two hours before we were due to meet.But thankfully there were more tangible connections than ghosts. Rachel and I were each other’s first friend date. We met in a cafe and bonded over parallel childhoods spent at swimming practice. It wasn’t without awkwardness; we both acknowledged that the very nature of what we were doing felt bizarre. Plus, we are completely different as people: she is a scientist and avid Spurs fan; I am a creative who doesn’t even really know what “Spurs” is. And yet, somehow it works. Almost a year on, we’ve swum together, eaten together, hung out with her dad, and jointly signed up for swimming events.Later, I succumbed to some aggressive Instagram marketing and signed up for Timeleft, an app that invites you to dine with six strangers. Through it, you are asked to complete a personality quiz – apparently used to match you with six like-minded friends-to-be. Then you’re briefed on where you need to be for dinner and when. Once again, the unnaturalness of the situation made me slightly uncomfortable. We were one of several groups of strangers, positioned across a restaurant floor, all relying on an algorithm to find new friends – it was like an episode of Black Mirror.But there was a comfort in learning that these six strangers were in this for similar reasons. Most were at a time in their lives where old friendship trajectories had changed course and there was a desire to seek out new kindred spirits. Elvira turned out to be one such kindred spirit. Seated opposite me but one, she was the quietest of the group and initially I assumed we had nothing in common. Then she made a dry, acerbic comment under her breath, giving me a wry smile, and I realised in that moment that we shared the same sense of humour.That was enough for us to keep in touch and hang out periodically over the next 11 months. In that time, I introduced her to another friend, with whom she has formed a friendship of her own, and now the three of us meet for dinner and join each other’s social events.Then there have been the semi-accidental friendships (albeit with a gentle helping hand). When I moved earlier this year, I called on SpareRoom – the flatshare platform – to help me find new lodgings. I answered Abi’s ad and after she showed me around her beautiful apartment, we sat chatting on the sofa. We clicked instantly and while I didn’t end up becoming her lodger, I became her friend instead. After the viewing, I asked her if she wanted to meet for a drink, and she did. Several dinners, exchanges of hilarious embarrassing stories and a Fleetwood Mac tribute night later, I count her as a good friend in my new city.At points, I couldn’t believe my luck – it all seemed far easier than I’d imagined.My new friendships aren’t all app-based; I can happily confirm that in 2025 it is still possible to form connections “in real life”. In July, as the Cribs played Brighton’s On the Beach festival, I met Loveday organically and unintentionally. Ticketless locals were watching and dancing on the roadside. I, alone and on my way home, might not have had the nerve to join them but my love for early-2000s indie pop rock is strong. So was the man’s next to me, who knew every word. His girlfriend, who was less of a megafan, struck up a conversation and at the end of the set, we found ourselves chatting like old friends in the local pub. Four months on and I accompany Loveday on weekend walks on the South Downs, where we put the world to rights.Elsewhere, I’ve found budding acquaintances in co-working spaces, exercise classes, monthly supper clubs and even local cafes. And these connections haven’t just been women, although, as a heterosexual woman, I tend to seek out new female friendships to avoid muddied waters or it feeling too much like dating – which hasn’t been the purpose.At points I couldn’t believe my luck, it all seemed far easier than I’d imagined. Far easier than the research suggests. It is true that I’ve always been an extrovert and not particularly shy when it comes to meeting new people and I’m aware this might give me a boost in the friend-making domain. But I think there’s more to it than extroversion.Spiritual leaders and Instagram memes alike preach refrains such as “what you put out comes back”, “like attracts like” and the importance of “loving yourself before you can love another”. All concepts I’ve rolled my eyes at in the past. However, I am almost certain that these friendships could not have materialised 18 months previously, because I was navigating a difficult time in my life. But at some point I found a measure of peace and discovered that happiness is a feedback loop: the happier I began to feel, the more interesting the world became – and as the world became more interesting, I grew happier and, apparently, more interesting to others, too.The stats may suggest that it’s harder to make friends as you age. But what they also do is instil in us defeatist beliefs about our agency in the world. Age doesn’t stop you from making friends – fear, anxiety and sadness do. I believe that once you dedicate time to moving through difficult emotions, you will tend to find that there are swathes of fantastic people out there ready to be your pal.Explore more on these topicsFriendshipHealthLonelinessHealth & wellbeingAppsMenWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, four hours after the race and following an investigation by the FIA, both were disqualified after the skid blocks on the floor of their cars were found to have been worn down below the 9mm limit defined in the rules.Max Verstappen dominates F1 Las Vegas GP to keep championship hopes aliveRead more“We apologise to Lando and Oscar for the loss of points today, at a critical time in their championship campaigns after two strong performances from them all weekend,” said McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella. “As a team, we also apologise to our partners and fans, whose support means so much. While this outcome is extremely disappointing, we remain fully focused on the last two races of the season.”The adjusted result means Verstappen has closed from 49 points behind Norris to only 24, level with Piastri, with two meetings remaining, in Qatar and Abu Dhabi, and 58 points on the table. Norris must outscore both his rivals by at least two points in Doha across the sprint and grand prix to be 26 points in front and claim the title there, but with the fight so tight it looks increasingly as if it will go down to the season finale in Abu Dhabi.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri was also disqualified from the Las Vegas Grand Prix.Photograph: Joao Filipe/DPPI/ShutterstockNorris was disappointed that his efforts in Las Vegas had proved to be in vain. “It’s frustrating to lose so many points,” he said. “As a team, we’re always pushing to find as much performance as we can and we clearly didn’t get that balance right today. Nothing I can do will change that now, instead full focus switches to Qatar, where we’ll aim to go out and deliver the best possible performance in every session.”Piastri said: “[It is] disappointing to come away from this weekend with no points after an unfortunate disqualification due to skid wear. With how close the grid is, we’re always looking at where we can gain performance, and we didn’t get it right this time. We now need to reset, refocus and push to get the best points possible in the final two rounds, both tracks that we’ve been strong at previously.”Quick GuideLas Vegas Grand Prix revised resultsShow1Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull1hr 21min 08.429sec2George Russell(GB) Mercedes at 23.5463Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedesat 30.4884Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrariat 30.6785Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williamsat 34.9246Isack Hadjar(Fr) Racing Bullsat 45.2577Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauberat 51.1348Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrariat 59.3699Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haasat 1:00.63510Oliver Bearman(GB) Haasat 1:10.54911Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martinat 1:25.30812Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bullat 1:26.97413Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpineat 1:31.70214Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bullsat 1 lap15Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpineat 1 lapNot classified:Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams35 laps completed,Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Sauber2 laps completed,Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin0 laps completedDisqualified: Lando Norris(GB) McLaren, Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLarendue to breaches of F1's technical regulationsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The FIA issued a statement at 1.30am local timeafter a meeting with McLaren representatives that lasted for more than an hour and a quarter, an unusually long time in what are often considered open and shut cases with skid block wear. The FIA said in its decision: “The team argued that mitigating circumstances existed in that there was additional and unexpected porpoising at this event, limited opportunity to test due to the weather on day one, and shortened practice sessions.” The governing body added that, as has been the case in previous breaches of this rule, there was no grey area, but accepted that McLaren had not attempted to deliberately break the regulations.“The FIA argued that unfortunately there was no provision in the regulations or in precedent for any penalty other than the usual penalty [ie disqualification],” it stated. “The FIA noted that it strongly held the view that the breach was unintentional and that there was not deliberate attempt to circumvent the regulations.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The planks were once made of wood but are now made of permaglass, a glass-reinforced laminate composition. The titanium plates are what cause the sparks to fly from beneath the car when the downforce pushes them into contact with the track and wears them down. The thickness of the plank assembly is required to be 10mm, plus or minus 0.2mm when new, and is allowed some wear during running but cannot fall below 9mm.Teams are expected to take this restriction in hand when setting up the ride height of their cars for races but will often try to sail as close to the wind as possible as a lower ride height can confer a performance advantage.Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Who will offer them hope?Sun 23 Nov 2025 08.02 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 14.42 ESTShareAnother week, another set of sobering economic numbers. Last Thursday, the Office for National Statistics published itslatest quarterly estimateof the number of 16- to 24-year-olds who are so-calledNeets– people not in education, employment or training. As usual, experts have warned that figures extracted from the UK’s flawedlabour force surveyshould be taken with a pinch of salt. But there was still universal agreement about the huge issues the figures highlighted, and the hundreds of thousands of young people,946,000, if the stats are to be believed, who are living on the UK’s social and economic edge.The government has announced itslatest reviewof all this, led by the New Labour veteran Alan Milburn, who will apparently focus on the relevance of disability and mental health. This week, moreover, Rachel Reeves is reportedly going to make the predicament of Neets one of the big themes of her budget. As ever, mood music is being provided by parts of the media that tend to specialise in the kind of condescension and generational loathing recently crystallised by aDaily Mail headlinethat might easily have been coughed out by ChatGPT: “Sicknote youths to dodge clampdown: Pledge to stop benefits for the workshy won’t include those with anxiety”.The day the Neet figures came out, I had a half-hour conversation with Roman Dibden, the Manchester-based chief executive of a brilliant employment charity calledRise Up, which works with people aged between 16 and 30. What he talked about was filled with a sense of raw humanity. It began with his own life – he dropped out of school when he was 14, then spent the eight months that followed his 16th birthday unemployed, experiences that echo those of the young people he and his colleagues help. This year, the charity has assisted 120 people into work.He often sees young people who have been unemployed for a lengthy period pivoting into what officialdom calls “economic inactivity” – moving on to sickness and disability benefits as either poor mental or physical health begin to dominate their lives – or withdrawing from the reach of the state altogether, a way of living that now defines about44% of Neets. Inevitably, he talked about the long shadow of the Covid lockdowns, and the sense that their consequences for millions of young lives amount to a generational debt that has yet to be settled. “We’re talking about the Covid generation,” he told me. “A lot of it’s about anxiety, and confidence. And things that other people take for granted: the way that you walk into a room, the eye contact – they’ve not developed those things. And that’s a huge barrier.”But so too, he said, is the sheer impossibility of navigating a benefits system and job market that are both full of trapdoors and dead ends. “Our young people have often just faced endless rejections,” he told me. “They’re disillusioned. And at the jobcentre it feels more like a monitoring exercise, so they feel under pressure. They’ll be applying for 150 or 200 jobs, to absolutely no avail – and they feel shit, frankly.” When they get to engage with employers, he said, the experience can be awful: “We get people telling us that with, say, certain parts of the banking industry, they’re doing interviews with an AI bot.”Even if young people manage to make it into employment, they seem to run an ever-increasing chance of being tipped back out. About 170,000 jobs have beenlost from UK company payrollssince last summer, and recently published analysis by the Guardian suggests that nearly half of those losses hit people under 25, presumably because of the age-old thinking summed up in the dreaded phrase, “last in, first out”. In that context, Reeves’s decision last year toincrease employers’ national insurance contributionsand thereby discourage hiring was an epic mistake.Afterlast year’s planfor a “youth guarantee” – which promises 18- to 21-year-olds in England access to an apprenticeship, training, education opportunities, or help to find a job – the idea is obligatory “work placements” for young people who have been on universal credit for 18 months or more without “earning or learning”. Outwardly, these should be undeniable steps in the right direction, but the latter comes with a grimly familiar bit of Whitehall boilerplate: “Those who do not take up the offer could face being stripped of their benefits.” Much the same logic ran through some of the abandoned welfare reforms that Reeves now says will be re-attempted – and clearly, the whip-crack of benefits “conditionality” will only make young lives more precarious and insecure, while barely scratching the surface of an issue that touches almost every area of policy.When I spoke to Xiaowei Xu and Louise Murphy, Neets experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation, they both talked about problems that are systemic. Answers to the Neets emergency, for instance, are usually the responsibility of the Department for Work and Pensions. But by the time someone collides with the benefits system, it may be too late. Many of the problem’s roots lie in the schools and colleges overseen by education ministers who need to think much more radically: though the government hasplans to boost vocational qualifications, our education system still operates on the basis that high-flying academic success is the only sure route to a secure career and a good life. Worse still, there are no clear ways back into education for young people who drop out, mostly because the further education colleges that ought to be at the heart of the modern economy are still feeling the effects of long years of insaneunderfunding and neglect.And all the time, the job market becomes more and more impossible. New York magazine – along with other outlets –recently published anexhaustive pieceabout how AI seems to be drastically reducing companies’ dependence on the kind of entry-leveljobs that have always given people a means of starting their working lives. It quoted the founder of a data sharing platform who has stopped hiring junior coders: “There’s just no reason to deal with young employees”. And there was more evidence of what seems to be afoot: the online retail service Shopify, for instance, has told its managers that they must now justify hiring a human by first explaining why AI can’t do the relevant job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The verdict must take account of the geopolitical minefield they took place inSun 23 Nov 2025 05.21 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 07.58 ESTShareCop30 in Belém wrapped up on Saturday night more than 24 hours later than planned, and with an Amazonian rainstorm thundering down on the conference centre. The UN structure just about held, as it has done these past three weeks despitefire, savage tropical heat and blistering political attacks on the multilateral system of global environmental governance.Dozens of agreements were gavelled through on the final day, as the most collective form of humanity worked to resolve the most complex and dangerous challenge that our species has ever faced. It was chaotic. The process very nearly collapsed and had to be rescued by last-ditch talks that went on into the early morning. Veteran observers told me the Paris agreement was on life-support.But it survived. For now at least. The outcome was not nearly enough to limit global heating to 1.5C. There was a considerable shortfall in the finance needed for adaptation by the countries worst affected by extreme weather. The importance of rainforest protection barely got a mention even though this was the first climate summit in the Amazon. And the power balance in the world is still so skewed towards gas, oil and coal interests that there was not even a single mention of “fossil fuels” in the main agreement.Yet, for all these flaws, Belém opened up new avenues of discussion on how to reduce dependency on petrochemicals, and it increased the scope of participation by Indigenous groups and scientists. It made strides towards stronger policies on a just transition to a clean energy future, and crowbarred the wallets of wealthy nations a little further open. A debate is now raging as to whetherCop30was a success, a failure or a fudge. But any judgment needs to take into account the geopolitical minefield in which these talks took place. Here are five threats that will have to be avoided at next year’s climate summit in Turkey.1. Global leadership vacuumThe US walked out. China failed to step up. Many of the problems that beset the talks could have been avoided if these two climate superpowers – the world’s biggest historical emitter and the world’s biggest current emitter – had been able to coordinate a shared approach as they used to do before Donald Trump came to power.Instead, Trump has attacked climate science, cursed the UN and staged a summit in Washington with the Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Little wonder Riyadh felt emboldened at Cop30 to stymie any mention of fossil fuels, even though language on this was agreed at Cop28 in Dubai.China, by contrast, was present in Belém and geared towards helping its Brics partner,Brazil, to stage a successful conference. But its advisers made clear that Beijing did not want to fill US shoes when it came to finance, nor to lead alone on any issue beyond the manufacture and sale of renewable energy products.2. Divided Brazil, divided worldAmong the key fractures in global politics today is that of the relationship between extraction and conservation interests. One wants to endlessly expand agricultural frontiers, dig ever deeper for minerals and ignore the toll on forests and oceans. The other says such activities are breaking planetary boundaries with ever more catastrophic consequences for the climate, nature and human health. This division is evident across the world.It was also apparent at Cop30, where the Brazilian hosts sometimes seemed to send mixed messages, according to observers from Asia, Europe and Latin America. While the environment secretary, Marina Silva, was the driving force in pushing for a roadmap away from fossil fuels and deforestation, the foreign ministry – which has spent decades promoting agribusiness and oil exports – was far more hesitant and needed prompting by thepresident, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.The Amazon rainforest appeared to have been a victim of this, getting only one brief and vague mention in the main negotiating text.3. European parsimony and the rise of the far rightEurope has often presented itself as a leader on climate action, but it was heavily criticised at Cop30 for lagging on promises of climate finance for developing countries. It too was woefully divided, partly due to the rise of the far right in many countries. As a result, the EU had to delay its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) climate plan and only decided halfway through the Belém conference that it would make a fossil fuel transition roadmap one of its negotiating “red lines”.This was incompetent at best, because such major issues need far more advance coordination. Little surprise that many global south participants were suspicious that this sudden conversion to the roadmap was a ruse or a bargaining chip to delay action on adaptation finance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

European politicians said their budgets had shifted towards re-arming in response to the rising threat posed by Russia. As a result, they have slashed overseas development aid and it becomes an ever more difficult challenge to allocate funds for climate finance.At one time, that might have provoked an outcry, given polls showing the vast majority of people in the worldwant their governments to do moreto address the climate crisis. But it is increasingly hard for the public in many countries to know what is happening in climate talks.None of the fourmajor US news networks sent a team to Belém. Reporters from British and European broadcasters were present, but many said it was hard for them to get space in news programmes for their stories.This feels defeatist and contrasts with the incredible positive energy on thestreetsandriversof Belém.5. Rusty, cranky global decision makingThe UN, which turns 80 next year, is showing its age. Consensus decision making at Cop means any country has a veto. That might have made sense when cold war politics were a global priority, but it is inadequate now humanity faces an existential threat to its planetary home.As at previous Cop gatherings, frustrations about this – particularly among small island states – were glaringly apparent at Cop30. Dozens of high-ambition nations led by Colombia issued their own Belém declaration and announced plans to hold a parallel process on phasing out fossil fuels, which will have a first conference in Santa Marta, Colombia next April. The organisers say it is intended to complement rather than replace the UN process, but it could also widen the gap between major fossil fuel producers and those who champion renewables.On the political level, that might be an inevitable break, but the global economy is increasingly moving towards renewable power, which is now cheaper than fossil fuels, and demographic trends are shifting power to the global south. Meanwhile, underpinning everything are the unrelenting physics of the climate crisis, for which there can be no veto. These realities needs to be recognised by a revamped and more dynamic system of global governance. Or the Paris agreement may not make it unscathed from future Cops.Explore more on these topicsCop30View from the AmazonBrazilClimate crisisAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

And if you are thinking, “But what isTim Dowlingbuying the cat this year?” Well, we’ve got that covered too.Yotam Ottolenghi, chef and food writerView image in fullscreenThe thing about food gifts is that they’re really just an excuse to be a bit extra about the everyday business of eating and cooking. A candle that makes your entire house smell like a tomato plant? Excessive, sure. But that’s rather the point – Christmas gives us permission to be slightly ridiculous about the things and people we love.Here are a few ideas for anyone who gets way too excited about what’s for dinner …Professional-grade knivesView image in fullscreenSmall, £29 at Allday GoodsLarge, £140 at Allday GoodsWe’ve been using Allday knives in our kitchens for years: Japanese blades from a fourth-generation forge in Sakai, paired with handles made from recycled packaging (including our own tahini lids and gochujang pots).Micro-batchchocolateView image in fullscreen£42.30 at Bare Bones ChocolateGlasgow-based bean-to-bar chocolate made in batches of around 30kg.

I love these food-focused prints.Grace Dent, restaurant criticView image in fullscreenI once did a Jimmy Carr comedy pilot with James Corden, Holly Valance and Richard Bacon. It was filmed near Christmas in a grand manor house bedecked in tinsel. I’d been called that week and begged to perform due to, they said, how hilarious, wise, charismatic and sparkling everyone thought I was. Especially Jimmy. “Jimmy loves you!” they said.After the recording, I was put in a taxi with a bag of fancy Jo Malone candles and fragrances and a Christmas card from the crew. My heart thumped with pride – until I opened it breathlessly and read: “Thank you so much, Rochelle. You’re a star!”I immediately twigged that I was a last-minute stand-in for Rochelle Humes from the Saturdays, but no one had thought to change the name on the gooodie bag. And that, my friends, is showbiz. Even at Christmas.A 1kg wheel of cheeseView image in fullscreen£49.19 at The Fine Cheese Co.The ultimate Christmas foodie gift.

Previous gifts of this order include an afternoon spent carving a wooden spoon atLondon Green Wood, and some beautiful fabric, which my husband bought me with an accompanying visit to a tailor so I could make my own outfit.Those were very nice, but last year I received a present that was life-expanding and immediately gratifying – in the form of the Nintendo Switch. Woah Nelly! I could almost feel the wind whooshing around my ears playing Mario Kart and the adrenaline pumping as I overtook my four-year-old daughter. What a thrill – and absolutely perfect to settle into when all the walks have been walked, the big meals eaten, there’s a nip in the air and snowflakes tumble their way down.Clever ice-cream scoopView image in fullscreen£40.78 at Nisbets£24.70 at AmazonThis uses heat-conducting fluid to help you scoop straight from the freezer.

A vintage Welsh blanket from eBay to add to my collection, a gift voucher, olive oil, a vintage magazine or a perfect mug (they have to be large, pottery not porcelain for heat retention, and white inside so I can properly gauge the colour of the tea) will all keep me very happy.I’ve nonetheless received some brilliantly imaginative presents over the years. My husband once bought me the complete catalogues of the late Elizabeth Taylor’s belongings, which I treasure (and subsequently bought for my best friend). My girlfriends once adopted me a rescue goat, because I adore them. Recently, all my friends clubbed together to commission the ceramicist Alice Mara to make a miniature replica of my house, and it is now my most beloved item.Neal’s Yard Beauty SleepfoamingbathView image in fullscreen£15.20 at Neal’s Yard£13.53 at AmazonA recent discovery, now a hopeless addiction, this earthy, herbal, sudsing soak has that essential ‘ouchy’ relief upon contact.

Another time, she got him a 200-year-old olive tree for their estate in Provence as a Valentine’s gift. I guess she set the bar pretty high when she bought him Ernest Hemingway’s actual typewriter as a wedding gift. Anecdotally, this does not suggest that gift giving is a guarantee of a happy marriage, so maybe don’t sweat your beloved’s pressietoomuch. But I do love the treasure hunt of Christmas shopping, and a wrapping session with a good podcast or two. Here’s what I’ve got my sights on this year …Crystal embellished cardiganView image in fullscreen£36.80 at M&SI’ve had my eye on this for a while.

A travel-sized envelope of delicious smelling bath salts is such a perfect little treat.Tim Dowling, columnistView image in fullscreenMy wife once gave me a salad spinner for Christmas. When I looked a bit put out she said, “Is it the colour? Because they come in other colours.” In truth, I wasn’t the least disappointed. In fact I was thrilled, because she is normally good at buying presents, and I am not. So I wrung as much mileage out of her rare lapse as I could, obliging her to defend her odd choice in front of people for weeks afterwards. “He likes salad!” she would scream.I have a poor track record. One year I gave her an oven glove, although in fairness I never intended for her to use it. It was more of a presentation oven glove, for display (it had a drawing on it of a little girl hugging her horse, and the horse was saying, “I hate everyone too”).Choosing these presents has been painful for me, requiring me to revisit a lot of past failures. Not exclusively failures, though: as I write this, I am looking at that oven glove, proudly on display on a kitchen shelf, absolutely untouched.Steel salad spinnerView image in fullscreen£66 at Harts of SturIf you’re going to get someone a salad spinner for Christmas, don’t skimp.Finisterre cardiganView image in fullscreen£110 at FinisterreMy wife is against me wearing cardigans, but I don’t see what her opinion has to do with the spirit of giving.

I’d spotted it on a stylist during a shoot and had fallen in love, but I rarely splash out on anything so indulgent. When I unwrapped it, I was floored. I’ve worn it every day for the last five years. For me, that’s a hallmark of a great gift: something you’ll actually use that also feels like a luxury you wouldn’t buy for yourself.Another of my most treasured gifts is a handmade quilt from a talented friend. Every time I use it, I think about them and the love and time stitched into every square. The worst gifts?

Nothing winds me up like a loved one wasting their money on buying me something random just for the sake of tradition. I know this must sound Grinch-ish, but it is possible to get me a gift I’ll love – if you subscribe to my belief that the best presents are an elevated version of something you’d likely buy anyway.I especially love giving people gifts they can eat, particularly if it’s a super-fancy version of something they already have in their kitchen, such as an extra virgin olive oil so flavourful you’d only eat it slathered over really good bread and wouldn’t dream of cooking with it.

Perhaps not surprisingly they involve those very close to me. For example, theMrs Piggle-Wiggle bookmy mum gave me for my 11th Christmas, which taught me so much about life and consequences. Then there was the storage trunk my dad got me because I’d mentioned I could do with one. And when my dad died, the most romantic present my husband ever gave me was clearing out my dad’s shed, which I couldn’t bear to go into because I’d sit there and talk to him while he made wine. A few years ago, my children gathered together quotes from my friends, and below-the-line comments from my column, and stuck them in a This is Your Life book.When people say it’s the thought that counts, that’s true.

In the course of a few weeks, the US president started showing everyone his plans for a gilded ballroom twice the size of the White House and then began unilaterally ripping down the East Wing to build it. Then, after nationwide protests against his rule, he posted on social media anAI videoof himself wearing a crown and piloting a fighter jet labeled “King Trump”, which proceeded to bomb American cities and Americans with a graphically vivid load of human poop.He has done things 10,000 times as bad – thecurrent estimateof deaths from his cuts to USAID is 600,000 and rising, and this week astudypredicted his fossil fuel policies would kill another 1.3 million. But nothing as definitional. No other president would have dared – really, no other president would have imagined – unilaterally destroying large sections of the White House in order to erect a Versailles-style party room, with theactive collaborationof some of the richest Americans, almost all of whom have business with the government. And no one – not Richard Nixon, not Andrew Jackson, not Warren Harding, not anyone – would have imagined boasting about defecating on the American citizenry. Even the worst American leaders were willing to maintain the notion that they represented all the people; Trump has managed to turn America’s idea of itself entirely upside down. And he has done it with the active consent of an entire political party. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, when asked about the poop video, for once did not bother lying that he had not seen it. Instead he said: “The president uses social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media.”We went from ‘the meek shall inherit the Earth’ to ‘the meek shall die of cholera’As disorienting as it is to watch the president try to upend the old idea of democracy and replace it with its polar opposite, there is one large group of Americans who should not find it completely novel. That is those of us – in older age cohorts a near majority – who were raised as mainline Protestant Christians.We have watched over the years as rightwing evangelical churches turned the Jesus we grew up with into exactly the opposite of who we understood him to be. At its most basic, they turned a figure of love into a figure of hate who blesses precisely the cruelties that he condemned in the Gospel; we went from “the meek shall inherit the Earth” to “the meek shalldie of cholera.” This has happened more slowly, over decades instead of months, but it is nonetheless unsettling in the same ways, a disorienting gut punch for many of us.What particularly hurts is the fact that at no point did we manage to fight back, not effectively anyway. Without intending to, we surrendered control of the idea of Jesus. It is a story that may provide some insights into how to fight the attack on democracy.The rise of end times fascism | Naomi Klein and Astra TaylorRead moreMany readers, younger ones especially, will require some backstory. In 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the building that would house the National Council of Churches on the Upper West Side of Manhattan – on that day, according to ahistory of Protestantismby Mark Silk, a cool 52% of Americans were part of the so-called mainline denominations: Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Episcopalians and the like. That meant most of the nation subscribed at least nominally to a religious life marked by a kind of polite civic normality and a somewhat progressive reading of the Bible – every one of these denominations eventually backed the civil rights movement, and Dr Martin Luther King’s March on Washington was literally planned from the Methodist national headquarters, the closest private building to the Capitol. (Catholicism accounted for another third of Americans, an important piece of the story I will get to eventually.)In the 60 years since, all that has changed; the mainline denominations are now barely a sixth of population, our churches largely aged and declining. Now the most public and powerful forms of Christianity, the vast and often denominationally independent megachurches and TV ministries, are as wildly different from that version of Protestantism asDonald Trumpis from Eisenhower.Paula White-Cain, for instance, who leads the newly created “White House Faith Office”, held a livestreamed prayer service the day after the 2020 electionto callon “angelic reinforcement” from Africa and South America to swing the election away from Joe Biden. Doug Wilson, the self-taught pastor who co-founded Pete Hegseth’s denomination hasinsistedthat it was a mistake to let women vote. (He also teaches that sex “cannot be made into an egalitarian pleasuring party”, because “a man penetrates, conquers, colonizes, plants. A woman receives, surrenders, accepts.”)View image in fullscreenTrump and Paula White-Cain, head of the White House Faith Office, at the White House on 14 July 2025.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesChristianity, it must be said, has always trafficked in angels and had some serious trouble with the role of women. The actually distinctive things about this newly ascendant version ofChristianityis that it meshes easily with the savage cruelty of the new political order, one whose tenets and tempers are directly contradictory to that older version I grew up in. They share the sameforms, in that all pay homage to Jesus and quote from the Bible, just as the president still inhabits the same White House (or what is left of it). But the Jesus of this imagination – muscular, aggressive and American – is a different man than the one I grew up worshipping. The idea that he can be invoked to justify cutting off aid to foreign countries and bundling immigrants into the back of unmarked vans is repulsive to me, but also mystifying – as if gravity suddenly pulled objects upward.View image in fullscreenA toxic Christianity takes holdSo let me first describe the Jesus that I grew up with, because theoretically Jesus is the center of any Christian faith, and because the fastest-growing cadre of Americans might have little sense of him since they are atheists or agnostics or nones. I have no problem with any of these traditions, nor with any other faith (of my three particular political heroes, only one – Dr King – is a Christian. Gandhi was Hindu, and his colleague, the too-little-known Abdul Ghaffar Khan – was a Muslim). But I do think that there are pearls of great price in the Christian story (though it should be said that I am no theologian, only a layperson and occasional Sunday school teacher).It is emphaticallynotthe story of a mighty king arising; instead, a baby is born to homeless parents in a garage, who must quickly flee to a different country to evade secret police. The baby grows up in humble circumstances, a working carpenter; his message is about love for others, especially for the poor – and not a sentimental love, but a concrete one, expressed by feeding and sheltering. Christ’s response to violence is to turn the other cheek – not as an act of passive acceptance, but as a way to educate the attacker; his crime policy is that if someone steals your coat you should give him your sweater too. This person’s message is sufficiently subversive that he is eventually put to death by the reigning imperial power, but that execution is powerless to quell his spirit or his message, which then spreads across a growing community of followers who try to behave as he had.It is entirely fine to reject the supernatural elements of that story, or to bemoan the fact that it has been repeatedly captured, twisted and exploited by the powerful – but the story itself is one of the unlikely, distinctive and remarkable expressions of human civilization; it has been pressed into service behind any number of bad and violent plans from the Crusades on down, but it has also inspired an unfathomable number of artists, educators, physicians and helpers across the centuries.In no small measure, it made me who I am. I grew up in the suburbs in the 1960s and 70s when mainline Protestantism retained its strength. I was baptized as a Presbyterian in California; the pastor who previously led my church, Eugene Carson Blake, headed the National Council of Churches, marched with King, and was on the cover of Time in the days when that was ultimate imprimatur. I was confirmed in a Congregational church in Lexington, Massachusetts – the direct descendant of the church where theoriginal Minutemenhad worshipped 200 years before. In college, at Harvard, my preacher was a man named Peter Gomes who exemplified the cross-cultural power of that tradition: a Black American with an anglophile’s appreciation for high church solemnity and a Republican by temperament who prayed at Ronald Reagan’s first inaugural, he was nonetheless a profound believer in the liberal tradition in which he came up. And when I left college I ended up for a few years in William Sloane Coffin’s Riverside church in New York, built by John D Rockefeller as more or less the St Peters of American Protestantism where Harry Emerson Fosdick had once preached – a name few recognize today but all would have known at a certain point in our history, for he was the foremost preacher of the first half of the 20th century. Riverside was right next to that building that Eisenhower had dedicated in 1958, the National Council of Churches headquarters sometimes known as “the God Box” – though that institution was already turning into a shell of its former itself, its corridors emptying as the mainline denominations downsized and then downsized again. Sunday morning church was no longer a civic obligation for Americans the way it had been in my youth, and for those who still wanted a Christian life, the evangelicalism we now see in full flower was beginning its rise.I am less concerned with the shrinkage of the mainline church than with the replacement of its Jesus with this very different one. In some ways the Jesus of my early years was a good fit with the New Deal and then postwar politics – at once concerned with others, and also a figure of peace in a tense bipolar world. Not a pacifist, but an apt figure for an age reacting to Auschwitz, Hiroshima and Montgomery. The new Jesus is none of that. Indeed, according to his acolytes, he rejects all of it, and utterly.Consider, for instance, one heir to Charlie Kirk’s place at the top of Maga Christianity. Allie Beth Stuckey, grew up in a megachurch; her father, a Texas state legislator, is senior adviser to the Heritage Foundation, the cradle of Project 2025. She is a distillation of the currently dominant American Christianity, and above all, her Jesus rejects empathy. This year, she published a bestselling book describing the concept as toxic and unbiblical; she is enthusiastic in her support for the president, including his immigration policies, which she describes as scriptural. As shetold a reporterrecently: “We can only look to scripture to see the principles of nations, of governance, of laws, of borders, of security, of God’s provision through walls, the Book of Nehemiah, and say: ‘OK. Can we apply those principles to America today? Do they still have wisdom? Does it make sense why God wanted secure walls for Jerusalem? Does that still apply to America?’”The idea that personal salvation was at the heart of Christianity always bordered on the heretical, but ... it has morphed into [an] absurd farceBasing your support for ICE raids on terrified immigrants on a relatively obscure passage in a relatively obscure Old Testament story is a good example of what is known as prooftexting – the citing of some verse somewhere to support your predetermined beliefs. In this case, a story about Nehemiah rebuilding walls in parts of Jerusalem becomes a reason to ignore the utterly clear and oft-repeated instruction of Jesus to welcome the stranger. Indeed, Jesus tells the parable of the good Samaritan, which quite clearly extends this welcome beyond our nationalities. “Philoxenia” is the Greek term used in the New Testament for this love of strangers – it is the opposite of xenophobia, which is what JD Vance and Trump were practising when they started lying about immigrants dining on cats and dogs. To continue with the gastronomic theme, as a theologian the cherrypicking Stuckey, in her citation of Nehemiah and his walls, is like a restaurant critic who has visited a steakhouse, noted that it has creamed spinach on the menu, and declared confidently that it is a vegetarian eatery. (And as long as we are on the subject, Nehemiah, once done with his wall project, spent a fair amount of time chasing entrepreneurs out of the Temple because they had been using it for their own commercial purposes; tickets for Stuckey’s recent Share the Arrows conference, according to the Wall Street Journal, cost between $99 and $5,000, which bought VIP seating and a private lunch and dinner with Stuckey. Attenders strolled hallways lined with vendors selling everything from Christian-themed clothing and children’s books to Patriot cell service: “America’s Only Christian Conservative Wireless Provider – Defending God-Given Rights & Freedoms”.)But the Bible at least talks about walls. It has almost nothing to say about the rest of their favorite culture war hobby horses – you can find five scattered references to what might be homosexuality in the Bible, though recent scholarship makes clear they were actually attacks on prostitution and abuse. Jesus himself had exactly nothing to say on the topic – not a sermon, not a parable, not even an offhand nasty joke. He also did not talk about transgender people, even though they have been a feature of every culture any anthropologist has ever studied. In her concession speech after her loss in the Republican Virginia governor’s race, Winsome Earle-Sears declared that she was “a Christian first and a Republican second”. But57%of the Republican party’s advertising spending in her race had reportedly gone to attacking transgender people, a topic – again – that Jesus ignored. None of that spending went to attacking Elon Musk (a recently self-proclaimed “cultural Christian”), who had managed to kill 600,000 poor people by “feeding USAID into a woodchipper” in the first weekend of his Doge campaign. Musk’snew pay raisemeans that he could have, if he had pleased, made each of those 600,000 people a millionaire instead, but he did not, which may explain why Jesus thought that it was easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle than a rich man to heaven. If you think I am being hyperbolic here, a “rich young ruler” actually presented himself to Jesus and asked what he should do, and Jesus said he should sell his stuff and give it to the poor. This is what Jesus was about.View image in fullscreen‘If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.’ Matthew 19:21.Illustration: Heinrich Hofmann, Christ and the Rich Young Ruler, 1889The obvious and straightforward fact that the Jesus of the gospels calls for a kind of radical love centered on the poor is what has always made Christianity something of a scandalous religion: appealing to the masses, but because of its inherent radicalness needing to be contained. In the 1950s it was contained by dilution – Protestantism was so dominant that it basically baptized the status quo. The 1960s broke that – the leadership of these churches, who were among the most committed followers of Jesus, found that they had little choice but to march in Selma, literally or figuratively. But many of their followers did not want to; they had been on board because Protestantism was part of the fabric of American life, not a challenge to it. Membership in mainline churches began dropping off. And for many of those who still felt a cultural or personal need for Christianity, evangelicalism was on the rise: it meshed wonderfully with the emerging Reagan-era emphasis on individualism and spoke directly to Americans who rejected the movements of the civil rights era.The idea that personal salvation – as opposed to concern for others – was at the heart of Christianity always bordered on the heretical, but over the decades it has morphed into the absurd farce we see now, where Jesus is held to bless every show of dominance and aggression we can imagine. There is, by now, a well-established genre of Republican officials posing for Christmas cards with submachine guns; Nashville Republican congressman Andy Ogles passed them out to his entire family fora picture. He was one of the congresspeople who led the charge not only to freeze USAID funding for the poorest people in the world, but tousethat money instead for increased deportations from this country. It is as if he had decided to see exactly how un-Christlike it was possible for one human being to be – indeed, he demanded that the local private Christian college Belmont University lose federal funding because it had a hope, unity and belonging department that he thought was too much like “DEI”.Mainline Protestantism made a serious mistake: surrendering its vision of Jesus without much of a fightEvangelicals are not unanimous in their support for Trump. For years I have written acolumnfor the progressive evangelical magazine Sojourners, for example, but even its publishers would confess that they are very much a minority. Realistically, white evangelicalism is the base of Trump’s support, and this flock has not broken with him the way many of his other followers have in the past nine months.For most readers, rightly, none of this inside baseball will matter much. For me, personally, it certainly does: it is as weird to me as a Christian as it to me as an American to see King Trump fantasizing about offloading his bowel movements from a plane on our heads. But the reason I bother to write about it is not personal but strategic. That is because mainline Protestantism made a serious mistake: surrendering its vision of Jesus without much of a fight. It is not entirely gone – there remain thousands of wonderful and vibrant congregations, and leaders like the Rev William Barber who occasionally manage to break through in public. Episcopalbishop Mariann Edgar Budderaised a ruckus this winter when, with Trump in attendance, she prayed for him to show compassion to immigrants; there have been more than a scattering of pastors in the protests outside immigration offices, just as there are in almost every social movement in this country. But these exceptions prove, I fear, the rule of general passivity: in general, the old mainline Christianity never was able to offer a very potent defense against the aggressive and toxic new forms of Christianity.View image in fullscreenA Save America rally for Trump in Wilmington, North Carolina, on 23 September 2022.Photograph: Allison Joyce/Getty ImagesThere were structural reasons for that passivity – five or six declining and theologically similar denominations never really considered uniting into one more powerful one, and there were conservative movements within Methodism or Presbyterianism or most of the others that sapped their strength. And there were intellectual reasons – this older tradition wrongly believed, right back to the days of Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority, that the new emerging take on Jesus was so transparently bogus that eventually people would snap out of it and return to their former orthodoxy. They were wrong, and that is not an error I would like to see repeated in the struggle for democracy; having lost for now the cross, I am not eager to surrender the flag as well.View image in fullscreenA struggle for the best of usSo I have been heartened to see the steadfast resistance to Trump arise in this past year. It has been great solace to help build the movement that has taken to the streets in rally after rally, and seems to have inspired voters to turn out in numbers in the off-year elections earlier this month. (As the founder of Third Act, which organizes progressives over 60, I am especially gratified by the number of older Americans in the streets, many of them the children of the Eisenhower era, and appalled as I am at the foulness of the president). We will need to continue it, and in the same spirit, with American flags at every demonstration and appeals to the best parts of American history.We’re going to be asked ... how did you receive the foreigner? Did you receive him and welcome him or not?Pope LeoAnd indeed, there are signs of this starting to happen. In Texas, a young Democrat named James Talarico has surged into contention in the state’s Senate race largely on the strength of his forthright declaration of the kind of retro Christianity I have been describing. A part-time seminary student (Presbyterian, one of those mainline denominations that used to dominate America’s spiritual landscape), he said in a sermon two years ago: “Jesus came to transform the world. Christian nationalism is here to maintain the status quo. They have coopted the Son of God. They have turned this humble rabbi into a gun-toting, gay-bashing, science-denying, money-loving, fear mongering fascist. And, it is incumbent upon all Christians to confront it, and denounce it.” (Talarico is doing well enough that he recently came under attack for the sin of following several OnlyFans models on Instagram; his campaign has said that he “follows back and engages with supporters who have large followings and does not investigate their backgrounds”. Given the president’s record with, say, Stormy Daniels, it is one more example of evangelical absurdity).Talarico is still an outsider. But Pope Leo is not, and in his first months he has begun at least to suggest that the Roman Catholic church may not watch from the sidelines as this era plays out. Catholicism has been a largely conservative force in American politics in recent years, institutionally obsessed with the abortion debate above all things. Globally, however, things are a little different. If you had suggested a generation ago that the Roman church might become one of the planet’s more progressive large institutions, I would have giggled. But Pope Francis made clear that abortion was not the only issue that counted, insisting that the church focus on the poor. His remarkable encyclical, Laudato Si’, usually described as “about global warming”, was actually much broader, a scathing critique of modernity and the politics of division and exploitation. He followed up, in the last year of his life, by firmly correcting new convert JD Vance, who argued that Augustine preferred that people centered their compassion on family and neighbors. Francis schooled him on the saint, explaining that “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups” and urging him to meditate on the parable of the good Samaritan.View image in fullscreenPope Leo XIV at St Peter’s Square at the Vatican, on 19 October 2025.Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty ImagesI was in Rome earlier this autumn for a session to mark the 10th anniversary of that encyclical, and so got to watch Leo close up for a little while. I was glad to hear him say that he will continue the church’s environmental activism unabated – indeed the Vatican will soon be the world’s first fully solar-powered nation. But I was equally as interested to simply take his measure. He is very much recognizable as a midwest American – if he showed up at your Thanksgiving table as a bachelor uncle in a White Sox cap, you would not find him out of place at all. But his 20 years in Peru and elsewhere around the poor world accomplished two things. One, clearly, was to make him as sensitive as Francis to the plight of the impoverished and vulnerable.The climate solution both the right and the left can get behind | Bill McKibbenRead moreJust as important, Leo – Robert Prevost – was more away than not from America all those decades. So in some ways you see preserved in a kind of amber the attitudes of a man who took his first vows in the 70s, when the kind of ugly Christianity that marks the Trumpers was almost unimaginable. Many American bishops moved hard to the right in the decades that followed, identifying themselves with the Republican party, but Leo seems not to have followed. This month, he explicitly called out American immigration authorities for their brutal treatment of arrested immigrants, particularly the fact that they were being denied communion. “Many people who’ve lived for years and years and years, never causing problems, have been deeply affected by what’s going on right now,” he said. But he went further, saying that when God judged humans: “We’re going to be asked, you know, how did you receive the foreigner? Did you receive him and welcome him or not? And I think that there’s a deep reflection that needs to be made in terms of what’s happening.”In the eyes of the new Republican Christianity, that reflection would involve the sin of empathy. Better to build some walls. (This week the president’s staunchest defender, Laura Loomer,accusedthe Catholic church of “work[ing] so hard to try and destroy our country” by “condemning deportations”.) But for many of us it was a welcome reminder that the old Christianity has not yet been stamped out entirely.I got to give the talk on Lexington Green at the last No Kings day, and it was a chance to quote from the American Gospel according to old Sam Adams:The liberties of our country, the freedoms of our civil constitution are worth defending at all hazards; it is our duty to defend them against all attacks. We have received them as a fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors. They purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense of treasure and blood. It will bring a mark of everlasting infamy on the present generation – enlightened as it is – if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle, or to be cheated out of them by the artifices of designing men.America is best defended, in other words, by reference to the best about American history, just as Christianity is best defended by reference to what makes it distinctive and beautiful, which is the example of Jesus. In neither case does it mean pretending the worst of both America and Christianity did not happen; it means both humility and belief, a combination that serious American Christians should be comfortable with.Bill McKibben is the author of Here Comes the Sun (2025), and the founder of Third Act"

Prescott left that role in the summer.Key figures in the row – including Prescott, Robbie Gibb, the influential Conservative-appointed board member, and chair Samir Shah - will appear before MPs on Monday as the culture, media and sport committee examines the memo and a crippling disagreement over how to respond to it.The pressure on Shah and Gibb increased ahead of Monday’s session with theresignation on Fridayof board member Shumeet Banerji. Banerji said in a letter that he was resigning over “governance issues” and had not been consulted over the events that led to the departure of Davie and Turness.Precott’s memo, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, accused the BBC of bias on issues such as Donald Trump, Gaza and trans rights. While the BBC has apologised over a Panorama edit of a Trump speech, it has pushed back on Prescott’s other claims. Shah said Prescott’s memo was a partial and personal account.The fallout from Davie’s resignation has also focused attention on therole of Gibb, who was Theresa May’s communications chief in Downing Street and is a self-styled “proper Thatcherite Conservative”.Gibb was placed on the BBC board by Boris Johnson and given a new term by the last Conservative government. MPs and members of the broadcaster’s staff have called for his removal from the BBC’s board after internal claims that he persistently raised criticisms from the political right about its output. Gibb also had a role in appointing Prescott to his position advising the EGSC.The BBC is under threat like never before. This is how to save it | Pat YoungeRead moreGibb is a member of the EGSC, giving him a significant say in discussions over potential BBC bias. The Guardian understands the BBC is now planning a major overhaul of the EGSC. The plans would expand its membership, ensuring that no voice dominates the forum.In the EGSC’s last two declared meetings, Gibb was one of just four full committee members. The other three – Davie, Turness and Shah – were attending in addition to their jobs running the organisation.Anna Sabine, the Liberal Democrats’ culture, media and sport spokesperson, said: “The crisis at the BBC, now being exploited by the likes of Trump and Farage, stems directly from years of Conservative cronyism.“Gibb is the very last person we should trust with such an important role on the editorial guidelines and standards committee. Liberal Democrats are calling for the government to defend impartial broadcasting, remove Robbie Gibb and end the practice of all political appointments to the BBC board.”Allies of Gibb have pointed out he is a persistent defender of the BBC and has supported the licence fee. They state that Gibb and others had been acting out of genuine concern about BBC coverage. The BBC has said Gibb was just one voice on a board of more than a dozen people – and one of a panel of four that appointed Prescott to his advisory role.Mishal Husain calls for end to ministers picking BBC board members amid ‘existential crisis’Read morePrescott, who has not spoken publicly so far, has said his views “do not come with any political agenda”. Shah has dismissed claims of aninternal rightwing campaignto sway the BBC’s coverage as fanciful.Meanwhile, Shah is understood to have concluded that the challenges of running the BBC are now so great that whoever succeeds Tim Davie needs a deputy. While Davie was editor in chief, he did not have significant editorial experience.Prescott’s most damaging criticism concerned the way in which a Panorama programme edited a Trump speech. The US president has since threatened to sue. Shah said there was an “error of judgment” andapologisedbut the BBC isdisputing Trump’s claimthat the programme defamed him.Bectu, the biggest union at the BBC, has been among those calling for Gibb to be removed from the BBC’s board. It has said staff lack faith in the corporation’s leadership while “a crucial position on the board is filled by someone perceived by many staff and external commentators as sympathetic to, or actively part of, a campaign to undermine the BBC and influence its political impartiality”.Explore more on these topicsBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

A joint statement between the two countries said that any eventual deal would “fully uphold” Ukraine’s sovereignty.The original 28-point US document leaked last week demands Ukraine hand over territory toRussia, limits the size of its army and agrees not to pursue the Kremlin for alleged war crimes.As discussions began in Geneva on Sunday, Donald Trump said Ukraine had shown “zero gratitude” for US efforts to end the conflict. In a conciliatory response, Zelenskyy said he was personally grateful to the US president for the military assistance Washington had given, beginning with Javelin missiles, which had saved Ukrainian lives.Trump’s hostile rhetoric came after a confusing weekend in which Rubio admitted the White House plan was conceived in Moscow, only to then insist the US was its author.Having been blindsided by Washington’s initiative, Ukraine’s European allies published their Kyiv-friendly plan on Sunday. It says negotiations over territory should take place after a ceasefire is agreed and should start from the line of contact – the existing frontline.It says both parties would agree how any truce would be monitored “under US supervision”. Unlike the White House text, the European alternative does not call for Kyiv to withdraw from cities it controls in eastern Donbas. Nor does it rule out Ukraine’s membership of Nato, but points out there is no consensus over its membership.There are further eye-catching proposals. They include that Russia give the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which would split power 50-50 between Moscow and Kyiv. Ukraine’s army would be capped during peacetime at 800,000 soldiers, 200,000 more than in the US draft.Frozen Russian assets would also be used to reconstruct Ukraine, rather than being partly given to US investors. If Moscow were to respect a “sustainable peace”, sanctions imposed since 2014 would be gradually eased and Russia would be brought back into the G8.Ukraine war briefing: Macron says without deterrence in Ukraine plan, ‘Russians will come back’Read moreEuropean leaders at the G20 summit in South Africa signalled on Saturday that the White House’s peace formulaneeded “additional work”. Poland’s president, Donald Tusk, expressed reservations on Sunday, saying: “It would be good to know for sure who is the author of the plan and where was it created.”The document was drawn up by Kirill Dmitriev, Vladimir Putin’s envoy, together with Trump’s special representative, Steve Witkoff. Speculationbased on the use of languagein the plan suggests it may have been written in Russian and later translated into English.A group of US senators said Rubio told them the text was not an American one. It was, they said, a Russian document deliberately leaked by Moscow which the US then passed on to Ukraine. Rubio later insisted the US did author the proposal, with input from Russia and Ukraine.Amid a backlash from some Republican senators, Trump rowed back from his earlier demand that Zelenskyy sign off on the deal by Thursday. Speaking in Washington, the US president said it was“not my final offer”, opening the door to significant changes.View image in fullscreenAndriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, heads to talks in Geneva on the US-led peace plan.Photograph: Elodie Le Maou/AFP/Getty ImagesRubio and Witkoff arrived in Geneva together on Sunday with the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, whoheld talks with Zelenskyy in Kyivlast week.After the talks, Rubio said good progress had been made in addressing unresolved questions in the draft US plan. “I think we made a tremendous amount of progress,” he told reporters at the US mission in Geneva, adding: “We’ve really moved forward, so I feel very optimistic that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”Yermak also said earlier that the sides had made “very good progress”, and were “moving forward to the just and lasting peace Ukrainian people deserve”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fifteen strikes were recorded in six areas of the city in north-eastern Ukraine.A Kyiv negotiating team had earlier spoken to officials from France, Germany and the UK, including Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell.Kirill Dmitriev: ‘ruthlessly ambitious’ Kremlin figure behind Ukraine planRead moreEuropean officials have been scathing about the US draft in private conversations. They say it undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and sets conditions for its EU accession. It would set a dangerous global precedent if accepted, they argue. It also rules out a French- and British-led peacekeeping force for Ukraine and limits where Nato aircraft could be based.One official said Putin was trying to turn back the clock 30 years on Europe’s security architecture and enforce demands made shortly before his all-out invasion. Russia’s president called for Nato’s military forces to withdraw to their 1997 borders, before the Baltic states and central Europe joined the transatlantic alliance.The European counter-proposal will be welcomed by Zelenskyy, who has come under enormous pressure to bend to US demands. He said last week that his countryfaced an impossible choicebetween betraying national interests and losing a major ally in the shape of Washington. “The bloodshed must be stopped, and we must ensure that the war is never reignited,” he wrote on Sunday.Olexiy Haran, a professor of comparative politics at the Kyiv-Mohyla academy, said Ukrainians overwhelmingly rejected the Trump document and would support the European one. “Freezing the frontline is a difficult compromise for us, but one a majority would back,” he said, but that there was no support for giving land to Russia.“Any peace deal isn’t about Zelenskyy. Ultimately it’s about the Ukrainian people and their understanding of Ukraine as a nation,” Haran said. “We definitely can’t allow all these crazy points in this Trump so-called peace plan.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The result was high and he subsequently had a biopsy that revealed the cancer.Lord Cameron, 59, told the Times: “You always hope for the best. You have a high PSA score – that’s probably nothing.Experts consider ‘targeted’ prostate cancer screening to reduce UK deathsRead more“You have an MRI scan with a few black marks on it. You think, ‘Ah, that’s probably OK.’ But when the biopsy comes back, and it says you have got prostate cancer.“You always dread hearing those words. And then literally as they’re coming out of the doctor’s mouth you’re thinking, ‘Oh, no, he’s going to say it. He’s going to say it. Oh God, he said it.’”The former Conservative party leader was urged to get tested by his wife, Samantha, after the couple heard the founder of Soho House, Nick Jones, speaking about his diagnosis on the radio, the Times reported.Cameron received focal therapy for treatment, in which electrical pulses target and destroy cancer cells.He has called on the government to introduce screening to detect cases earlier, when treatment is more likely to succeed.The peer said: “I want to, as it were, come out. I want to add my name to the long list of people calling for a targeted screening programme.“I don’t particularly like discussing my personal intimate health issues, but I feel I ought to. Let’s be honest. Men are not very good at talking about their health. We tend to put things off.”Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the UK, with about 55,000 new cases every year.There is no screening programme for the form of the disease in the UK because of concerns about the accuracy of PSA tests.In October 2024, Chris Hoy, the six-time Olympic gold medallist,disclosed he has a terminal cancer diagnosis.He said a scan found the main cancer to be in his prostate that had metastasised to his shoulder, pelvis, hip, ribs and spine and was stage 4.Cameron resigned as prime minister and as an MP in his Oxfordshire seat of Witney in 2016. He was made foreign secretary by then-prime minister Rishi Sunak in 2023 and was also made a life peer and a member of the House of Lords.His announcement comes days after the first eligible men in the UK were invited to join a major trial testing the most promising screening techniques for the disease.The Transform project will compare screening methods to current NHS diagnostic processes – which can include blood tests and biopsies.It will be delivered in partnership with the NHS through the National Institute for Health and Care Research, which has committed £16m in funding, with the remainder coming from charity ProstateCancerUK.The launch comes as the UK National Screening Committee prepares to announce its decision on whether current evidence supports the introduction of screening for the disease.Chiara De Biase, director of health services, equity and improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “We’re glad to hear that David Cameron found his prostate cancer at an early stage and had successful treatment.“We thank him for sharing his story and in doing so raising vital awareness of this disease, which is completely curable if found early. But men’s lives should not be left to chance.“We lose 12,000 dads, brothers, sons and friends to this disease every year. We’ve reached a tipping point in the UK, with too many men dying from a curable disease and worse outcomes for men at higher risk like black men and men from working-class communities.“Prostate cancer is the last major cancer without a screening programme, and we need change now.”Explore more on these topicsDavid CameronProstate cancerCancernewsShareReuse this content"

Graham said neither Reeves not Keir Starmer should stay in post ifthe budgetwas not Labour enough, by hitting either working people or those who are sick and cannot work rather than the richest in society.As she seeks to head off criticism, Reeves will say she plans to bring in an extra £1.2bn in savings by identifying incorrect universal credit payments up to 2031.A Treasury source said: “We will never tolerate fraud, error or waste in the welfare system – every pound of taxpayers’ money should be spent with the same care with which working people spend their own money.“That’s why the chancellor is doubling down on this next week – extending targeted case reviews to save taxpayers billions and ensure help goes to those who genuinely need it, and safeguard taxpayers’ money so it can be invested in the public services we all deserve.”The government is also freezing rail fares and prescription fees, as well as moving to take some levies off electricity bills, at the same time as bringing in billions in tax rises.Some of the tax rises Reeves is likely to opt for include:Freezing income tax thresholds for an extra two years to 2030, bringing more people into higher tax bands as wages rise.Making salary sacrifice schemes less generous, including those for pension contributions.Apay-per-mile schemeon electric cars to help fill the tax gap from petrol duty as more people opt for green vehicles.Bringing in higher tax on the most expensive properties, including a surcharge on the highest-value houses. The surcharge will reportedly be targeted at homes worth more than £2m, after worries that a lower £1.5m threshold would hit too many in the south-east.Whitehall sources said the chancellor was unlikely to attempt further big savings on the welfare bill in the budget, after scaling back cuts to disability benefits in the face of a huge Labour revolt earlier this year.Reeves has explored the possibility of cuts to theMotability scheme, which allows claimants to use their personal independence payment towards new cars, but disability groups have warned of severe consequences if she goes ahead with the scale of changes that have been floated.Reeves signalled in an article for the Sunday Times this weekend that she was still committed to “reform” of the welfare system. However, this is not likely to take place until after recommendations from the Labour minister Stephen Timms’s review of disability benefits, and the former cabinet minister Alan Milburn’s review of young people not in employment, both due later next year.Milburn said this weekend there should be “no no-go areas” when it came to reform of the benefits system, and he has previously said the UK cannot afford to back off from changes to welfare.Reeves said her budget, which must fill a £20bn fiscal hole, would focus on helping people with the cost of living and would target inflation.The Treasury said the budget would confirm a rise in state pensions worth more than £550 a year, an extra £120 compared with the amount they would have increased by if they had been uprated by inflation, because of Labour’s commitment to the triple lock. The government is seeking to rebuild trust with older voters after infuriating many by removing the winter fuel allowance and then making a partial U-turn.Reeves said: “Whether it’s our commitment to the triple lock or to rebuilding our NHS to cut waiting lists, we’re supporting pensioners to give them the security in retirement they deserve.”The chancellor had spoken out in the run-up to the budget, saying she is“sick of people mansplaining how to be chancellor”after weeks of criticism from the right and left.Starmer defended his chancellor, saying women in public life faced more abuse than men. The prime minister said he was proud to have appointed Britain’s first ever female chancellor, adding that she and other women in politics and the media get attacked more frequently than their male colleagues.“I’m really proud to have the first female chancellor ever. I’m really proud that we’ve got a female chancellor who’s doing a really good job,” he said. “I strongly believe that women in public life get much more criticism and abuse than men. That is in politics, but it’s also across a number of other areas – I’d also say the media, frankly – and I think we need to acknowledge that.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025WelfareRachel ReevesLabourTax and spendingEconomic policyBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

The family requests privacy at this time.”Jeremy Lee, chef at London restaurant Quo Vadis, praised the chef for her “extraordinary life and career … how this lovely lass lit up the world”.The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver wrote: “Terrible sad news. She was an amazing woman and incredible cook and kindhearted. She will be very, very, very missed. Thank you for all you did to inspire young cooks.”Cookery writer and television host Nigella Lawson said she was “heartbroken”.“However ill you know someone to be, their death is always a shock. It’s just awful that Skye is no longer in the world. It’s a tremendous loss, and I’m heartbroken for Holly and Evie and all those who loved her and learned from her,” Lawson wrote.Cyrus Todiwala, a chef who runs Cafe Spice Namaste in east London, said: “A great culinary leader has passed away. May her inspiration carry on with her teams and drive them to achieve all the goals she must have planned.”Australian chef Kylie Kwong wrote that “Skye was one of the greatest cooks of all time”, while Sydney Opera House culinary director Danielle Alvarez called Gyngell “an inspiration to us all”.Gyngell was born in Sydney on 6 September 1963. Her father was the broadcaster Bruce Gyngell, who in 1956 was the first person to appear on Australian television and in the 1980s succeeded Greg Dyke as managing director of the breakfast television franchise TV-am. Her mother, Ann Barr, was a well-known interior designer.While studying law at Sydney University, she took a job washing up at a delicatessen before moving to Paris to train under Anne Willan at the École de Cuisine La Varenne and then worked at the two Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant.The chef moved to London, where she worked at the Dorchester under Anton Mosimann before working at the French House in Soho under Fergus and Margot Henderson.She pioneered the “slow food movement”, a grassroots initiative founded in Italy in the 1980s to preserve traditional cooking and promote a “good, clean and fair” approach to eating.Gyngell transitioned to teaching and private catering to clientele that included Nigella Lawson, Charles Saatchi, Madonna and Guy Ritchie, and was later appointed food editor of Vogue.In 2004, she returned to the restaurant industry after visiting Petersham House, Lord Burlington’s 18th-century villa, and opened Petersham Nurseries Cafe.She also opened Spring at Somerset House in London and ran restaurants Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire.Marle was awarded a green Michelin star in 2022 and has retained it every year since.Last year, the chef and food author was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.The treatment blunted, for a time, her treasured sense of smell and taste. “Savoury foods tasted really salty,” she said. “Anything with chilli was like the spiciest curry in the world.“One teaspoon of sugar in my tea was more like 20 spoonfuls, and I couldn’t taste the tea.”In 1989, she married Thomas Gore; they divorced in 1996, and she is survived by their daughter, Holly, and by Evie, her daughter from a relationship with James Henderson.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Free Birth Society (FBS) is a business run from North Carolina that promotes the idea of women giving birth without midwives or doctors present.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It is led by Emilee Saldaya and Yolande Norris-Clark, ex-doulas turned social media influencers who have gained a global following through the FBS podcast, which has been downloaded millions of times.FBS profits from sales of its instructional video guide to freebirthing, and access to a paid-for membership group for pregnant women. It runs two online schools that train “radical birth keepers” and “authentic midwives” to support women when they are giving birth.In ayear-long investigation, we reviewed hundreds of hours of FBS podcasts, videos, documents and course materials, interviewed 10 former insiders, and analysed thousands of pages of journal entries, medical notes, message threads and legal documents relating to births by its followers.We also interviewed more than 60 mothers influenced by FBS, studied video footage of unassisted births and consulted some of the world’s leading obstetricians and experts in midwifery. Here are five things we learned.1.Many FBS claims conflict with evidence-based medical adviceFor a healthy mother in a low-risk pregnancy, experts say the risk of freebirthing is generally low, although most would not recommend it. “Across whole populations, going through labour and birth without professional support is associated with higher levels of risk for mother and baby,” said Prof Soo Downe, a senior British midwife at the University of Lancashire.Downe was one of four medical experts who reviewed FBS material for the Guardian. All agreed the information FBS provided pregnant women included content that wasmedically illiterate, misleading or dangerous. Examples include the false claim that there is “zero” risk of infection when cutting an umbilical cord, incorrect guidance on how to resolve a rare but potentially fatal condition called shoulder dystocia, and advocacy of a passive approach to newborn resuscitation that posed a high risk to babies of long-term neurological damage or death.2.FBS is linked to real-world harm all around the worldWe identified 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths or other forms of serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS, for example having enrolled in its courses or appeared on its podcasts. Most of the cases of harm relate to mothers in the US and Canada, but they include births in Switzerland, France, South Africa, Thailand, India, Australia, the UK and Israel.When free births go wrong, it is impossible to say whether the outcome would have been different with medical support. But in 18 of the cases, all of which involved in-depth interviews with the mothers, we found evidence suggesting FBS played a significant role in the mother or birth attendant’s decision-making, leading to potentially avoidable tragedies. They include the case of Gabrielle Lopez, a first-time mother from Pennsylvania.Her son Esau got stuck during his birth in 2022 and sustained a brain injury caused by oxygen deprivation. Heis now severely disabled.3.Saldaya, the chief executive of FBS, directly advises women during birthAt times, Saldaya has given direct advice to women during their labours via phone calls or messages. This occurred in the case of Lorren Holliday, who became the first known FBS-linked mother to lose a baby, in 2018. Saldaya has denied advising Holliday, telling students: “I didn’t know this woman at all.” However, the Guardian has reviewed more than 100 messages between Saldaya and Holliday during her five days of active labour in her home in the California desert.Despite numerous signs that Holliday was in a medical emergency, Saldaya encouragedher to keep going, before eventually providing her with a script to deceive hospital staff about the details of her labour. Her daughter, Journey Moon, was stillborn. In 2024, Saldaya also advised Haley Bordeaux, a mother from Virginia, via phone calls and texts to a friend; she had a healthy baby but had several strokes caused by severe pre-eclampsia that made her temporarily blind.4.FBS profits from growing distrust in maternity servicesWomen are attracted to FBS for understandable reasons. Scandals in maternity care, and a concern among some about an overly medicalised approach to birth and, in some cases, negligence and obstetric violence, have created a ready market for FBS. Saldaya and Norris-Clark exploit these concerns, accusing doctors and “medwives” of “sabotaging” women’s births, sexually assaulting and “fingering” mothers, and even committing “murder”. Even some advocates of free birth argue that the pair promote an unusually dogmatic version.But they are also adept businesswomen, good at monetising their ideology. FBS is estimated to have generated more than $13m (£9.9m) in revenues since 2018. Nearly 1,000 students have graduated from the Radical Birth Keeper school, which charged $6,000 for a three-month Zoom course for “authentic midwives”, and the MatriBirth Midwifery Institute (MMI), a $12,000, year-long “gold-standard online intensive midwifery school”.5.The leaders of FBS seem undeterred by mounting criticismSaldaya and Norris-Clark did not respond to requests for comment. There are some signs they may be adapting their approach. In a call with students this year, Saldaya suggested FBS may have gone too far in calling their MMI a “midwifery” school (it has since been renamedthe MatriBirth Mentor Institute). In May 2025, FBS posted a disclaimer on Instagram, saying its content was for “educational and informational” purposes and was not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any medical condition related to pregnancy or birth.However, Saldaya and Norris-Clark are also pushing back at criticism about their business and the risk it poses to mothers and babies. Norris-Clark recently called critics “pathetic losers”, defending FBS as “the most ethical kind of business you can run”. After publication of the Guardian’s investigation, Saldayaposted a statement on Instagramcriticising “propaganda on mainstream news”. “This is what it means to be a disruptor,” she said. “They will try to discredit you. They will lie about you. They will attempt to silence what they don’t understand.”The Birth Keepers, a multipart Guardian podcast series investigating the Free Birth Society, is released in December.

Multilateralism held – just.“We knew this Cop would take place in stormy political waters,” said Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, after a long and occasionally angry final plenary at the climate summit. “Denial, division and geopolitics has dealt international cooperation some heavy blows this year.”Trump, war, absent media: five threats to climate progress that dogged Cop30Read moreButCop30showed that “climate cooperation is alive and kicking”, Stiell added, making an oblique reference to the US, which under Donald Trump opted not to send anyone to Belém. Trump, who has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and a “con job” has come to embody the opposition to progress on dealing with dangerous global heating.Stiell said: “I’m not saying we’re winning the climate fight. But we are undeniably still in it, and we are fighting back. Here in Belém, nations chose unity, science and economic common sense. This year there has been a lot of attention on one country stepping back. But amid the gale-force political headwinds, 194 countries stood firm in solidarity – rock solid in support of climate cooperation.”He pointed to one section of the Cop30 agreement: “The global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.” He argued: “This is a political and market signal that cannot be ignored.”The summit began more than a fortnight ago with the leaders’ summit. The Brazilian hosts promised with early sunny optimism that it would finish on time, but as the negotiations went on the confusion and obvious divisions between parties grew, and the process looked close to collapse on Friday.Overnight negotiations and compromise on all sides meant a deal could be agreed on Saturday. The summit produced decisions on dozens of issues, including a promise to triple adaptation funding to protect communities against climate impacts, an agreement for a just transition mechanism (JTM) and recognition of the rights of Indigenous people.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Ethiopian delegation celebrate their selection to host Cop32.Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, proposals to start planning roadmaps to transition away from fossil fuels and end deforestation were not agreed and were hived off to processes outside the UN to be pushed forward by coalitions of willing nations. The impacts of the food system – such as cattle in cleared tracts in the Amazon – were largely ignored.The overall package was largely seen as incremental at best and far less than is needed to tackle the accelerating climate crisis. Jasper Inventor, a deputy programme director at Greenpeace International, said: “Cop30 started with a bang of ambition but ended with a whimper of disappointment. This was the moment to move from negotiations to implementation – and it slipped.”The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said progress was made but warned it was becoming more difficult to secure agreements. “Cops are consensus-based – and in a period of geopolitical divides, consensus is ever harder to reach,” he said. “I cannot pretend that Cop30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”The EU commissioner for the environment, Wopke Hoekstra, echoed the sense of relief. “It is not perfect, but it is a huge step in the right direction. The EU stood united, fighting for ambition on climate action,” heposted on X, even though that unity was sorely tested.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Mamadou Ndong Toure, the thematic lead for climate and resilience at Practical Action in Senegal, said: “Adaptation cannot be built on shrinking commitments; people on the frontline need predictable, accountable support and a clear path to act.”View image in fullscreenActivists from the Make Polluters Pay coalition protest during Cop30.Photograph: Anderson Coelho/ReutersSimilarly, although Brazil styled Cop30 as the “Indigenous Cop” and the deal recognised for the first time Indigenous people’s land rights and knowledge as a fundamental climate solution, there were still concerns that participation was limited. “Despite being referred to as an Indigenous Cop … it became clear that Indigenous peoples continue to be excluded from the negotiations,” said Emil Gualinga, of the Kichwa Peoples of Sarayaku, Ecuador.And there was frustration that the final text did not refer directly to fossil fuels. James Dyke, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter, said: “Despite the host’s best efforts, Cop30 will not even be able to get nations to agree to fossil fuel phase-out. This shameful outcome is the result of narrow self-interest and cynical politicking.”After several years of these annual UN climate gatherings being held in authoritarian-led countries, there were bursts of colourful protest in Belém as civil society returned in force. A march with tens of thousands of protesters lit up the middle Saturday of the summit and activists made their voices heard in an otherwise, grey, sterile conference centre.“From Indigenous-led demonstrations at the venue to the more than 70,000 people who marched in the streets, there was a palpable sense of momentum that I haven’t felt for years,” said Jamie Henn, the director of Fossil Free Media.At least a path ahead remains, watchers concluded. Prof Michael Grubb, of University College London, said: “The damp squib of an outcome from Cop30 has underlined that a focus on the negative – phasing out of fossil fuels – is fraught with political obstacles. For the road to Cop31, the focus must be balanced by equal attention to the positive – the huge economic potential of accelerating the energy transition, and ways to help countries around the world benefit from renewables and electrification.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisFossil fuelsGlobal climate talksUnited NationsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The president greeted the prince on the south lawn, the White House’s biggest stage. There were uniformed men on horses bearing flags and a flypast of fighter jets.Once inside the newly gilded Oval Office, Trump came across as a man besotted. He grabbed at the prince’s hand and declared more than once what an honour it was to lay claim to the royal friendship. When a journalist pierced this golden bubble by raising the 2018 murder and dismemberment of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi – the main reason Prince Mohammed had not visited for seven years –Trump lashed out, lambasting the reporter and her network, ABC.What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? Trump resurfaces memories of journalist’s brutal murderRead moreHe declared that Khashoggi was “extremely controversial” and not universally liked (as if those were grounds for being butchered) and insisted the prince had known nothing about themurder in Istanbulby Saudi state operatives, in direct contradiction of the conclusions drawn by US intelligence.Trump’s disregard for human rights and US intelligence agencies and his blatant fandom for autocrats are nothing new.US foreign policyhad already shifted decisively in that direction in January, as soon as he took office for the second time. If there was a real shift on show during Prince Mohammed’s visit on Tuesday, it was in the skies over Washington.The F-35 stealth fighter jets on show in the flypast for the visiting royal are up for sale toSaudi Arabia, Trump confirmed. The sale would not be conditional and the specifications of Saudi F-35s would be the same as Israel’s.If the deal goes forward, it will cut against one of the abiding principles of US-Israeli relations – thatIsraelalways gets to buy the best military hardware, giving it a prized “qualitative edge” over other US allies in the region. Appearing to dump that principle, Trump made clear that both countries would get the best as they are equally close to Washington.“[Saudi Arabia] is a great ally and Israel’s a great ally,” the president said. “As far as I’m concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line.”That is not language that Israel likes to hear out of Washington and it was the latest of several setbacks in the bilateral relationship in recent months.Potentially of equal importance to the F35 sale, the administration has announced it would lift the ban on selling advanced AI chips to Saudi Arabia and theUnited Arab Emirates(UAE). The decision significantly boosts Riyadh’s ambitions of becoming a global tech hub with vast energy-intensive datacentres that will be the foundations of the global AI economy in which Saudi Arabia and the US could take a lead together.Gregory Gause, a visiting scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, compared the ambitions of a US-Saudi partnership in the AI economy with the US corporate-led development of Saudi oilfields in the 1930s.“It could be a real solid link between the countries – a better guarantee of an American commitment to Saudi security than anything that could be written on a piece of paper,” Gause said.View image in fullscreenTrump came across as a man besotted when Mohammed bin Salman visted the White House on his state visit.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersThere were other recent events which suggested at least a temporary US move away from Israeli primacy in Middle East policy. On Monday, aUS-drafted UN security council resolutionincluded language about a possible pathway to an independent Palestine, despite desperate Israeli efforts to have the clause removed.A few months earlier, at the end of June, Trumplifted some sanctionson Syria, again in conflict with Israeli preferences. And in May he toured the Middle East to showcase his foreign policy, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, but not Israel.All this marks a drift in US Middle East policy from what was arguably the high point in the US-Israeli relationship, when Trump fulfilled Benjamin Netanyahu’s longstanding aim and joined Israel inairstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilitiesin June,triggering anxietyacross the Gulf.“Saudi leaders were alarmed at how quickly the conflict threatened to spill across the region,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of theMiddle East and north Africaprogramme at the Chatham House foreign policy thinktank.“Although a fragile ceasefire holds for now, Riyadh remains wary that another confrontation could erupt with little warning.”In the wake of the Iran strikes, Netanyahu seems to have taken Washington’s backing for granted and overreached,bombing a target in the Qatari capital, Doha, in a bid to kill Hamas officials. Trump reportedly had very little notice of the plan to bomb a close regional ally.Trump reacted by humiliating Netanyahu during his visit to the White House in late September, forcing him to call his Qatari counterpart from the Oval Office in order to apologise.Saudi Prince Mohammed is being lavished with praise by Trump. It’s clear why | Mohamad BazziRead moreIn Trump’s transactional White House, it is hard for Israel to compete against the Gulf. Prince Mohammed promised $1tn in Saudi investment in the US economy. Qatar has given Trump a$400m luxury planeto use as a new Air Force One.The flow of huge amounts of money occurs in both public and private spheres. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE have together invested near $5bn in a fund managed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.Trump has consistently shown he has a greater affinity with absolute rulers than elected leaders. Prince Mohammed faces none of the constraints that trouble Netanyahu as he struggles to keep his coalition together.Prince Mohammed also consistently makes clear if the US disappoints, his kingdom will go to China for the hardware and security guarantees it needs.The fear that Saudi Arabia might be “lost” to China dates back to the previous administration. It contributed to a reversal in former president Joe Biden’s position on Prince Mohammed, from “pariah” for the slaughter of Khashoggi, to a humiliating climbdown, a visit to Jeddah in July 2022, and a notoriousfist bumpwith the prince.Some observers argue that the wind-shifts of the past few months do not add up to a US “reset” in the Middle East policy. They point out that, beneath the razzle-dazzle of the Saudi visit, there are aspects of the discussion that are more superficial than they initially seemed.View image in fullscreenTrump humiliated Netanyahu when he forced him to call his Qatari counterpart from the Oval Office in order to apologise for bombing Doha.Photograph: Alex Wong/GettyAnnouncing the $1tn investment promise, Prince Mohammed did not mention a timescale. Nor is it clear how many F-35 the US will sell to Riyadh. Several items on the summit agenda do not look as if they are coming to fruition any time soon, like a bilateral defence pact and a civil nuclear power agreement, which can be blocked by Congress.The prospect of Saudi normalisation of relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords came up but was politely shelved by the crown prince. He made clear that normalisation would depend on a solid commitment to a Palestinian state, considerably more than the vague, conditional language inMonday’s security council resolution.When it comes to Gaza and Palestine as a whole, Daniel Levy, the president of the US/Middle East Project and an analyst of the region, sees very little prospect of change.“On the Palestinian file, there’s no joy at all, I would argue,” Levy said. “I think Israel has a very free hand. They’ve got the hostages out, and they’re still bombing Gaza.”But in the bigger picture, he argued that when it comes to US policy in the Middle East, the more it changes, the more it stays the same.“If you just strip away some of the particular stupidity of the Biden administration and add the familial self-interest of the Trump administration, and throw into the mix reactions to events and some of the excesses of Israeli overreach, I don’t think we’re seeing a fundamental reset,” Levy added.US policy over the years has not essentially changed, he argued. “It is policy primarily driven by people with a very shallow understanding of the region essentially taking their cues from Israel and a smattering of rulers in the region.”"

As a crown dependency,Jerseyhas its own parliament, but belongs to the king. The relationship between the two jurisdictions remains something of a black box, with very little public information on how the big decisions are made, or to what extent Westminster is consulted.That changed last week, when Jersey itself released the details of a two-year legal battle with Roman Abramovich, the Russian billionaire and former Chelsea football club proprietor. On Monday, after a gagging order was lifted, the Jersey royal courts began publishing a series of previouslyundisclosed judgments. Fifteen have been released so far, running to 370 pages.They reveal for the first time how, in 2016 and 2017, Abramovich and four of his closest associates were given safe harbour by the tax haven, which granted them residency under a special scheme for ultra-high net worth individuals. Abramovich’s application was approved in September 2017, the files show.It appears he approached Jersey about residency in the summer of that year.The oligarch was also granted permission by the Jersey government to relocate companies controlling the bulk of his fortune to the crown dependency, a five-mile-by-nine-mile swathe of green that sits just off the northern coast of France. Transfers of assets from his offshore network to Jersey took place in 2017, and again in 2021, months before Russia’s full-scale invasion on Ukraine, when holdings worth $7bn (£5.3bn) were relocated, according to the judgments. In 2016, a company of which Abramovich was the ultimate beneficial owner was also granted a licence to operate in Jersey. The company’s name was anonymised but it appears to have been a family office, set up to manage his wealth. It advised on “philanthropic activities”, the acquisition of aircraft, yachts and cars, and investments in Europe and North America.The move was tacitly approved by the British government, the judgments suggest. The records show, in rarely shared detail, how London was extensively consulted on what was considered a politically sensitive matter involving a high-profile individual known for his close ties to Vladimir Putin’s regime.The judgments record at least seven background checks and four face-to-face meetings between officials in Jersey and London over several years.In none of these communications did UK officials raise objections, despite heightened sensitivity around Kremlin-linked figures after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.The door remained open even after the diplomatic storm triggered by the 2018Salisbury poisonings, a botched assassination attempt on a double agent and his daughter by Russian operatives.It was not until Russia’s assault on Kyiv that the tide turned against Abramovich, the judgments suggest. In April 2022 Jersey authoritiesfroze $7bn of assetssuspected of having been connected to him, and searched a number of premises on the island. The oligarch had by then been placed on the UK and Jersey sanctions lists. In January2023, a court ruling revealed the raids were part of a criminal investigation by the Jersey attorney general into suspected money laundering and breaches of sanctions.It has since emerged that the money laundering investigation is focused on whether Abramovich obtained his wealth through corruption, while he was building his oil and gas business, Sibneft, during the 1990s, in Russia’s newly privatised economy. The claims rely on evidence Abramovich himself gave in a 2012 court case in London.His lawyers have denied he was involved in corruption, and they have claimed the decision to investigate him is politically motivated. A lawyer from one of the corporate entities set up to manage his wealth says the oligarch was “encouraged” to bring his assets to Jersey, and that what followed after the invasion of Ukraine was a case of “state-engendered entrapment”.In a legal fightback which began in 2023, Abramovich and associated parties have sought to overturn the asset freeze, the judgments show. Jersey’s court of appeal ruled against them this summer.In a second and more unusual case, which was also rejected by the island’s court of appeal, Abramovich sued for judicial review of the attorney general’s decision to investigate him. The move was an attempt to shut down the investigation before any charges had been brought.The rulings have been anonymised and redacted to protect the identity of Abramovich’s associates, after judges decided they had a right to privacy. The names of the companies they managed have also been removed to prevent identification.The main cases and other related disputes were originally heard in private, and the judgments left unpublished until all routes for appeal had been exhausted. Last week, Abramovich’s bid to have the Jersey court decisions overturned was rejected by the judicial committee of the privy council, bringing an end to this particular battle.One of the main levers through which the British government continues to exert influence over its colonies, the committee, which normally sits in Parliament Square in London, acts as a supreme court for the UK’s overseas territories, crown dependencies and some commonwealth countries.A ‘reputational risk’ to JerseyThe decision to allow Abramovich to move his wealth to Jersey was not taken lightly. Barry Faudemer, the former head of enforcement at the Jersey Financial Services Commission, clearly had concerns.A report he prepared for ministers in late 2016, quoted in the judgments, claimed: “Abramovich’s close association with Putin raises a reputational risk to the island, particularly given the increasing perception of Russia as a rogue state intent on the use of military action to achieve its goals.”He also expressed fears that Abramovich could use a Jersey-registered company “to launder the proceeds of corruption on behalf of third parties including Putin. The island will have no oversight of the activities of the company (unregulated)”.On the other hand, Faudemer said, Abramovich already had “extensive business interests in the island”, he already had homes in the UK and US, and he had “successfully operated in the UK for many years as the owner of Chelsea football club without incident”.“Identifying evidence sufficient to support a refusal to grant a licence is likely to be problematic,” he concluded.In May 2016, a first approach about residency was made by an associate of Abramovich, who is anonymised in the judgments as XB. It was made clear that Jersey had much to gain. “These approvals were given in the knowledge that, if they were granted, [Abramovich’s] substantial wealth would be migrated to Jersey with all the financial benefits which that would bring to the island,” one judgment states, summarising the case put forward by the oligarch.Jersey’s ministers were keen to make it work, but they wanted to proceed with care. A back channel was opened between St Helier and London.Robert MacRae, then Jersey’s attorney general, approached a contact in the directorate of national security at the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), as it was then known.Over the following months, as each residency application was submitted, UK officials ran checks on Abramovich and all but one of his associates, making sure they were not under investigation by any law enforcement agency.After the Salisbury poisonings, all the checks were redone, again via the FCO. In February 2019 the checks on Abramovich were repeated, with Jersey officials concerned about a “hardening of attitudes towards those with Russian connections”.There are accounts of four face-to-face meetings between UK and Jersey officials, including one between Faudermer and the UK regulator theFinancial Conduct Authority(FCA).After each of the checks detailed in the judgment, the FCO official gave the all-clear. They also expressed an interest in continuing to receive information about those wanting Jersey residence. One email sent by the FCO official about Abramovich read: “On RA – we have no significant concerns, issues or adverse traces on this [redacted]. He in particular has a large footprint but not of significant concern or investigation. The information itself however is very helpful in building a wider picture of activity in this space and subject matter however.”No political objections from LondonMacRae also told officials in his own government that there were no political objections from London to opening the door to Abramovich and his billions. In a note written to the attorney general, a Jersey government official recorded:“I noted from our brief conversation the following:You have undertaken appropriate and extensive enquiries.As a result you have confirmed that there is insufficient evidence to prevent this application from proceeding; and that should there have been sufficient evidence the matter would have been referred to senior ministerial level within the UK government.”According to the judgments, Abramovich never took up residence in Jersey. In 2018 he secured Israeli citizenship.Abramovich is nowpursuing a claim of “conspiracy” against the Jersey government. His lawyers said no charges have been brought against Abramovich since the commencement of the Jersey investigation over three years ago and there are no criminal proceedings in the jurisdiction involving him. In a statement last week they said that to their knowledge, “no progress has been made” on the attorney general’s investigation.His lawyers stressed that in the published judgments, the judges had not been required to rule on whether there had been any corruption or admission of corruption by Abramovich regarding his dealings at Sibneft, and that they had not reached any conclusions on this matter. They said the UK courts had in 2012 made no finding that Abramovich broke any law in respect of his business dealings. “There was no suggestion in our client’s defence that his acquisition of the relevant entity was achieved through corruption, and our client denies these allegations.”A spokesperson for Jersey’s attorney general welcomed the privy council’s decision, adding: “The investigation by the Economic Crime and Confiscation Unit in the Law Officers’ Department in relation to Mr Abramovich and others remains live.”Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

She does not come to the door, but her partner passes a handwritten note relaying their meagre existence on benefits as the Guardian joins the local food bank’s morning delivery round.“I have to be careful with electric and gas, and food has to be £1 frozen food,” she writes. “Snacks are a very rare treat. If it wasn’t for theCanterbury food bankwe would have nothing but pasta.“At Christmas my children will have small stuff and that will mean less money on food, more stress and worry.”The charity is in the frontline of an ongoing cost of living crisis that Rachel Reeves has promised to tackle in her budget next weekwith measures to slow price rises.In 2019, the food bank, based on an industrial unit in nearby Whitstable, was giving out 450 parcels a month. Now, a typical month involves well over 1,100 parcels, sometimes in excess of 1,400. The quantity of food going out of the door puts the charity, which covers Canterbury, Whitstable and Herne Bay, in the top 5% of food banks in the country.When these kinds of services were first established in the UK after the 2008-09 financial crisis, most people thought they would outlive their value in two or three years. But on what is the Guardian’s third visit to the food bank in four years this one shows no sign of reaching its use-by date.InFebruary 2022, the charity had gone from spending virtually nothing on food (as donations matched demand) to about £3,000 a month as the Covid crisis segued into acost of living crisis. When we returned the following year, its monthly food bill was £7,000. Today it is £10,000.It receives generous support locally, with food donations rising and coming in at between 1,100 and 1,400kg a month. But demand is up 15% year on year, with the charity using cash donations and grant money to cover its bills. Meanwhile, rising food prices means everypound buys less than it used to.This week’s figures from the Office for National Statistics showed UK inflationeased back to 3.6%in October. However, a deeper dive highlights the pressure on families, as rising prices for bread, cereals, meat and vegetables drove up the annual rate of food and drink price rises to 4.9%, from 4.5% the previous month.View image in fullscreenSince 2019, Whitstable food bank has increased its food parcels from 450 a month to more than 1,100.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian“Every pound we spend buys around 10% less food than it did a year and a half ago,” says Stuart Jaenicke, the charity’s head of finance.The cost of its shopping basket has risen by about 11% in that time, he says, pointing to sharp increases on items such as teabags, hot chocolate and coffee.There has been feverish speculation about Reeves’stax-raising plansbut for the food bank’s small team of staff and 200 volunteers the hope is that thetwo-child benefit cap will be abolished.An end to the policy – which means parents can claim universal credit or tax credits only for their first two children – would mean “my children would be able to have more of the things they need”, continues the Herne Bay mother.Her partner’s mental illnesses prevent him working and she is also unable to work because the special educational needs of two of the children mean “constant calls to go to school”.The chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, Alison Garnham, says getting rid ofthe capis the “right thing to do”. A reversal would instantly lift 350,000 children out of poverty and lessen the hardship experienced by another 700,000, she says, adding: “Removing this invidious policy would mean millions more children get the fair start in life they deserve.”It is on the “financial side” that the food bank is feeling the greatest pressure as even its regular donors feel more hard-up.“Even when headline inflation falls, supermarket prices don’t go back down – they stay high,” says Jaenicke. “We’re paying the same as everyone else.View image in fullscreenFood banks have become ‘a necessary part of the welfare state’, says one social policy researcher.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian“Monetary donations from the public have fallen sharply – down more than £80,000 over the past two years if current trends continue – and grants have become much more competitive and much less predictable,” he adds.This year the charity has received about 60% of the income it expected but is fortunate in that it could keep going for a year on its financial reserves.“So we’re in a position where demand is up, food prices are up, donations are down, and funding is volatile,” he says. “And behind those numbers are real households: more working families, more single parents, more older people, and more people asking for no-cook items because they can’t afford energy.“This isn’t an emergency spike any more. It’s become the new normal.”According to the2025 indices of deprivationCanterbury is an average place, finishing mid-table in the list of 296 local authority districts, according to Peter Taylor-Gooby,research professor of social policy at the University of Kent, who is one of the charity’s trustees.The problems locals face are not uncommon in seaside towns, he says. “It’s got a lot of tourism, a bit of retail and the kinds of jobs you get are insecure and low-paid.”With three universities in nearby Canterbury there is also a large, cheap labour pool that depresses wages, although increasingly students too are turning to the food bank for help.“In the Canterbury area, poverty is becoming deeper and more concentrated, as it is in the country as a whole,” says Taylor-Gooby, who says it is because benefits and wages have not kept pace with rising living costs.With seemingly no light at the end of the tunnel, the populism ofReform UKhas resonated with voters. It took control of Kent county council in May, althougha recordingof a recent internal meeting published by the Guardian revealed bitter divisions as it strained against the financial realities of the job.View image in fullscreenA volunteer at Whitstable food bank.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian“There’s a byelection for the local council in my ward and talking to people you get a sense that ‘nobody has never done anything for us’,” says Taylor-Gooby.On the second floor of the small business unit there is a bank of desks where the staff calmly deal with requests for help from sometimes overwroughtcallers.The most common issue is the cost of living, says Maria. “Prices for food, fuel, and rent keep rising, but wages and benefits just aren’t keeping up. Many people have unpredictable hours or zero-hours contracts, so one quiet week at work can mean an empty fridge.”Her colleague Julia chips in that “any buffer or rainy-day fund is long gone”, so unexpected expenses like children’s clothes or a parking fine can leave people in dire straits.At a time when many Britons are contemplating buying Advent calendars filled with everything from marshmallows to gin miniatures, on the wall a poster advertises a “reverse Advent calendar”. The campaign suggests adding an item a day – from baked beans to mince pies and shampoo – to a bag for life, then donating it.Liam Waghorn, the operations manager, explains that it has to “work harder” for donations as there is more competition. “We have to go and find donations rather than expect them.” Technology helps. One new aid is theBanktheFoodapp, which sends supporters alerts about products in short supply.On each Guardian visit, the food bank – originally a community project run by local churches – is slicker and more businesslike. Screens have replaced pens and papers at picking stations, thanks to the IT wizardry of one of the retired volunteers, giving real-time information as parcel requests are logged.Waghorn proudly relays that it has been able to add fresh food, such as bread and eggs, to its parcels to make them more nutritious. It has also sped up the service to next-day delivery.With poverty more widespread, food banks have necessarily become larger and more professional, says Taylor-Gooby. “Once the goal of food banks was to work themselves out of a job. Now they have become a necessary part of the welfare state.”Explore more on these topicsFood banksPovertyUK cost of living crisisBenefitsFamily financesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The cast, including Joseph Fiennes, are excellentPhil HarrisonSun 23 Nov 2025 17.10 ESTShare“My name is Nazanin. I do not know why I am here.”“Everyone says that.”AsNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffeenters an Iranian prison for the first time and introduces herself to a fellow inmate, you feel the sudden chill, deep in her bones. She knows the Iranian regime has no grounds to be holding her. But straight away, she has learned that that doesn’t matter. Meanwhile, back home in London, her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, is cheerfully preparing their flat for her return – flowers on the kitchen table, favourite ice-cream in the freezer – blissfully unaware that he won’t see his wife for almost six years.This four-part drama – adapted by Stephen Butchard from the couple’s forthcoming book A Yard of Sky – attempts a difficult task. The horror that engulfed this familybetween 2016 and 2022was both brutal and infuriatingly banal. In Iran, Nazanin was confronted with a Kafkaesque nightmare at the hands of an unaccountable theocracy. Without knowing it, she wasn’t a prisoner as much as a hostage; a victim of forces set in motion before she was born. Meanwhile, in London, Richard faced a British government in constant flux, that was scrolling, post-Brexit, through a hopeless series of ministers, seemingly distracted by the chaos and immobilised by the gravity of what faced them.Representing the human trauma at the heart of this perfect, deadly storm is a challenge. Butchard’s script makes the best of snatched, long-distance conversations between Nazanin, Richard and their infant daughter Gabriella, the blankness of her captors, the casual harshness of her (female) guards and the bewilderment of the British diplomats attempting to engage with the case. Its success rests upon communicating a sense of the couple’s tormented internality during this period. Joseph Fiennes as Richard is a study in quiet, racked anguish. Fiennes does an excellent job of portraying the small changes in his demeanour as months turn into years – he becomes sadder but also quicker to anger, resolute but increasingly prone to despair. He shaves less. He sleeps more.View image in fullscreenNarges Rashidi and Joseph Fiennes in Prisoner 951.Photograph: BBC/Dancing LedgeNarges Rashidi, meanwhile, is a revelation as Nazanin – a woman forced to live at the midpoint between defiance and defeat; watching her life, and the childhood of her daughter, slip through her fingers. Montages and dream sequences are put to work as the couple try to bridge the physical distance between them. Inevitably, there are longueurs in any drama of this nature – one of the cruellest aspects of this ordeal was surely the sense of wheelspinning frustration as, in both Britain andIran, diplomacy moved at a glacial pace. Accordingly, this is less a thriller and more a meditation on powerlessness – how do you maintain hope when the world seems oblivious to your plight?‘She was extremely petrified’: the shocking drama about one woman’s six-year ordeal in an Iranian jailRead moreThere is also a sense of simmering anger as a possible/likely (delete depending on how seriously you take denials by the UK government) reason for Nazanin’s detention becomes clear in the shape of a multimillion pound arms debt owed by Britain to Iran since the early 1970s. The government has never acknowledged this as a factor – although, in what was clearly simply a bizarre coincidence, the debt was paid on the day Nazanin was released.There’s a darkly comic scene in which Ratcliffe communicates his desperation while Liz Truss gazes blankly at himThroughout the drama, the status of Britain as a deeply unserious country during this period is reinforced. In a series that understandably isn’t exactly overflowing with light relief, it’s (almost, but very quickly not) a blessing when Boris Johnson turns up on the television in Nazanin’s prison. “How can this man be important?” says one of her fellow inmates incredulously. “He looks like he’s fallen out of a bush.”Of course, Johnson’s role in Nazanin’s continuing incarceration was particularly egregious: by carelessly stating in parliament in 2017 that she was “simply teaching people journalism”, he contradicted the accurate version of events she had given to the Iranian authorities. We watch this incident from Nazanin’s point of view and this prison perspective viscerally emphasises the extent to which Johnson endangered more than just her freedom. Richard, meanwhile, has the privilege of dealing with the then foreign secretary Liz Truss towards the end of Nazanin’s confinement – there’s a darkly comic scene in which Ratcliffe communicates his desperation while Truss gazes blankly at him like a child being shown a confusing card trick.Prisoner 951 arrives at a precarious moment – when political forces in the UK seem to frown upon crosscultural liaisons and care little about potentially dividing families. While this drama is powered by anger, it’s probably best understood as a defiant love story. Even as the cynical, eventually petty affairs of international relations threatened to destroy the tiny, happy world that Nazanin and Richard had built, this extended, multinational, multi-ethnic family – as devoted to each other in Tehran as they were in London – never stopped reminding each other why they couldn’t allow that to happen.Nazanin might not have known why she was in prison. But she knew why she needed to get out. And that’s as good a riposte to our current malaise as it’s possible to imagine.Prisoner 951 aired on BBC One and ison iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeIranMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

But the radical benefits of one piece of kit leave him visibly movedFrances RyanSun 23 Nov 2025 15.45 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 15.47 ESTShareIf a celebrity wins Strictly Come Dancing, alongside the glitter ball trophy, they can expect the BBC to gift them a variety of vehicles for their newfound audience. Stacey Dooley rung in New Year’s Eve and presented a makeup challenge. Rose Ayling-Ellis got two documentaries and a guest spot on Doctor Who. Now, 2024 champion, comedian and self-declared geekChris McCauslandhas his first major appearance: Seeing into the Future, a deep dive into the growth of AI and technology and what it means for him and others with sight loss.Much of the action takes place in Silicon Valley where McCausland, who gradually became blind by his early 20s, explores whether the land of big tech could give him “a whole new level of independence”. We meet McCausland as he uses his iPhone to pick his clothes for the day. Holding up a navy shirt, the AI app – with an alarmingly human cadence – tells him it’s clean but has a few wrinkles he might want to iron out. Before voice-controlled smart assistants, McCausland used to have to cut the labels of each piece of clothing into a shape and use touch to work out what he was looking at. It’s a primer to any luddites watching of how far tech has already come and how, for many disabled people, such innovations aren’t just a fun thing to have – they’re life-changing.And with that, McCausland is on his way to see the future, AKA meet Meta’s head of accessibility. There’s a cursory line about the Facebook parent company’s issues with “privacy violations and data management”, which feels like describing Hannibal Lecter as having issues with violating personal space. I wonder if producers missed a trick in not exploring the tension of disabled people’s lives being improved by companies who cause so much damage to wider society. But McCausland has got his Meta smart glasses on before we have the chance to get philosophical, and you can’t blame him for putting any concerns to the side. “When you have a disability, you have to be dependent on other people. Sometimes, you feel a burden,” he admits. “AI doesn’t seem bothered.”One feature of the glasses that isn’t yet on the market is “live AI”, which can respond in the moment and – as McCausland poignantly puts it – answer “any of my questions about the world around me”. He points his face to the camera crew filming him and jokingly asks if they look as if they’re doing a good job. The AI scans and confirms the men do indeed look professional, as they are using high-grade cameras and appear to be concentrating. It is at this point that viewers of a certain age may find themselves experiencing a flashback to Tomorrow’s World unveiling a new invention called “the cassette player” and feel the fabric of time fold in on itself.Still, not a minute spare to contemplate our own mortality. We’re on to a car that drives itself! San Francisco was one of the first cities in the world to roll out public self-driving vehicles. “First time I’ve ever been in a car alone that’s moving,” McCausland smiles from the back of a taxi as the front wheel turns itself.McCausland is a highly likable and engaging host but is not the sort to give producers any set-pieces of emotion. Staring out at the bay with his smart glasses on, he later claims he “couldn’t give a hoot” about bodies of water (he wants to use the glasses to go vinyl shopping and order a cheeseburger). But as he looks up at the blue sky and AI describes how a plane is flying across the clouds, he can’t quite hide the fact he is visibly moved, if only for a moment.With the West Coast done, McCausland goes to Boston’s Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). There’s a lovely scene in which he tests out a bionic limb designed by a scientist after becoming a double amputee himself, but it’s the possibilities for healthcare that make for mind-blowing television. As well as treating conditions such as Alzheimer’s, the nano chip – injected into the bloodstream and coming in at a 10,000th of the width of a human hair – could in the near future be harnessed for brain surgery to effectively replace the very photoreceptor cells that cause McCausland’s blindness. Deblina Sarka, the MIT engineer behind the tech, tells McCausland it could not only restore his vision but make it superior to other humans.This is when another presenter would have a teary-eyed monologue to camera. But it’s McCausland. So he proposes they do a follow-up documentary where he lets Sarka inject his brain to give him high-resolution night vision “to beat you all at Laser Quest”. You can almost hear the BBC execs calling their insurance provider.Chris McCausland: Seeing into the Future aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewChris McCauslandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Before that, posted workers coming in were undercutting British workers. Under Gordon Brown, it was oil workers that were brought in; since then it’s been hospitality, farms.

In the 19th century, the sap of the plant was still a key ingredient of its confectionary namesake, along with sugar and egg whites. But that connection has long been severed: the modern industrial marshmallow is derived from a mixture of sugar, water and gelatine. Its main ingredient is air.But there’s a lot you can do with the humble marshmallow – here are 17 examples.By all accounts, a homemade marshmallow is infinitely preferable to the store-bought version, although it’s also a necessary compromise – you can’t hope to replicate the exact texture of the machine-made product.Most recipes call for egg whites and gelatine, althoughFelicity Cloake’s perfect marshmallowsdispense with the egg. Fancy variations on this basic theme includeTamal Ray’s lime marshmallowsandJamie Oliver ’s chocolate ale marshmallows.Helen Goh’s redcurrant and marshmallow wreathsare a festive combination of homemade marshmallow, lime biscuits, redcurrant jelly and desiccated coconut.View image in fullscreenSweet potato casserole with mini marshmallows.Photograph: StephanieFrey/Getty ImagesFor the most part, marshmallow recipes – ie where marshmallow is an ingredient, rather than the desired result – call for the shop-bought kind. You could probably substitute your own homemade efforts, but that would be missing the point twice over. You don’t necessarily want your delicate, fussed-over creations to become mere ingredients, and anyway, there is something about a cheap industrial marshmallow – a certain quality, or lack thereof – that’s important here.Mary Berry’s toffee marshmallow squaresare a slightly elevated take on the classic Rice Krispies recipe, which was always on the side of the cereal box, and probably counts as the first thing I ever learned to cook.Tom Kerridge’s popcorn barsprovide a similar mix of sticky and crunchy. Thesechocolate marshmallow wheels, which sandwich layers of commercial marshmallow “fluff” (spread) and jam between two chocolate covered biscuits (akin to the classic Wagon Wheel biscuit), have a particularly decadent appeal.View image in fullscreenPerfect for s’mores … melting marshmallows over a campfire to place between two biscuits.Photograph: Addictive Stock Creatives/AlamyThe similar American s’more is a standard summer barbecue assembly of toasted marshmallow, chocolate and Graham biscuit (a plain digestive is a good substitute), squashed together on site. But even if your barbecue has been stowed for the winter, you can still makeBenjamin Ebuehi’s ginger biscuit s’moreswith a blow torch or under the grill.Liam Charles’s recipe for mini-s’more sconesis another take on the classic.Thanksgiving is upon us, and ambrosia salad offers up a sort of dividing line in American holiday dining. It’s either an annual fixture on your Thanksgiving table, or something you have never seen or tasted, though you are probably aware that some people – many people, in fact – routinely serve a salad with marshmallows in it not as a pudding, but as part of the main meal. I was raised in the latter camp, and I am as perplexed by the recipe as anyone in the UK.Steel yourself: alongside the marshmallows, ambrosia salad normally contains tinned mandarin oranges, maraschino cherries, diced tinned pineapple, grapes, shredded coconut and possibly some nuts. The white gloop that holds it together is most often sweetened whipped cream or a proprietary non-dairy whipped topping (Cool Whip, if you’ve never had the pleasure), but other recipes use sour cream, mayonnaise, evaporated milk or some unholy combination of the above.View image in fullscreenCreamy ambrosia salad with marshmallows, pineapple and mandarin orange.Photograph: EzumeImages/Getty Images/iStockphotoThis one, as an example, uses a mixture of whipped and sour cream, which sounds oddly palatable.This one, from the Food Wine Sunshine blog, uses cottage cheese and orange jelly, which sounds less like something to be thankful for. And, yes, you are meant to put this on your plate next to the turkey and gravy.The other divisive Thanksgiving dish is mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallow topping.

We’re back to homemade marshmallows, although these are spiked with chilli flakes and scorched to blackness before they become soup topping.Sometimes the consistency of a melted and then cooled marshmallow makes it a key textural element in, say,a version of strawberry mousse, or inRichard Bainbridge’s marshmallow cheesecake. Thiscoffee ice-cream fudge cakerequires both marshmallows and marshmallow fluff, along with corn syrup, sugar and ice-cream. My teeth ache just reading the recipe, but in a good way.Finally, a marshmallow cocktail, and not one that just uses a few mini-marshmallows on a skewer as a garnish. Thetoasted marshmallow espresso martinicalls for a burnt marshmallow syrup and, if you can find it, a marshmallow-flavoured vodka. If you can’t find it, you are frankly probably better off.Explore more on these topicsFoodBiscuitsDessertVegetablesCheeseFruitCocktailsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, the tables have turned: it is Great Britain that finds itself at the mercy of major US tech firms – so huge and dominant that they constitute monopolies in their fields – as well as the whims of an erratic president. Yet, to the outside observer, Britain seems curiously at ease with this arrangement – at times even eager to subsidise its own economic dependence. Britain is hardly alone in submitting to the power of American firms, but it offers a clear case study in why nations need to develop a coordinated response to the rise of these hegemonic companies.The current age of American tech monopoly began in the 2000s, when the UK, like many other countries, became almost entirely dependent on a small number of US platforms – Google, Facebook, Amazon and a handful of others. It was a time of optimism about the internet as a democratising force, characterised by the belief that these platforms would make everyone rich. The dream of the 1990s – naive but appealing – was that anyone with a hobby or talent could go online and make a living from it.US tech dominance wasn’t the result of a single policy decision. Yet it was still a choice that countries made – as is highlighted by China’s decision to block foreign sites and build its own. While that move was far easier under an authoritarian system, it also amounted to an industrial policy – one that left China as the only other major economy with its own full digital ecosystem.The pattern was sustained through the 2000s and 2010s. Cloud computing was quickly cornered by Amazon and Microsoft. No serious European or UK competitor emerged to challenge platforms such as Uber or Airbnb. These companies have undoubtedly brought us convenience and entertainment, but the wealth of the internet has not spread as widely as many hoped; instead, US firms took the lion’s share, becoming the most valuable corporations in history. Now the same thing is happening with artificial intelligence. Once more, the big profits look destined for Silicon Valley.How did all this meet with such little resistance? In short, the UK and Europe followed the logic of free trade and globalisation. Nations, according to this theory, should focus only on what they do best. So just as it made sense for the UK to import French burgundies and Spanish hams, it also seemed logical to rely on American technology rather than trying to do it locally. Better to specialise instead in the UK’s own strengths, such as finance, the creative industries – or making great whisky.Datacentres are the bottom rung of the AI economy, private infrastructure that simply channels profits back to US headquartersBut when it comes to these new platforms, the analogy with regular trade breaks down. There is a vast difference between fine wines and the technologies that underpin the entire online economy. Burgundies can be pricey, but they don’t extract value from every commercial transaction or collect lucrative data. The trade theories of the 1990s masked the distinction between ordinary goods and what are, in effect, pieces of market infrastructure – systems essential to buying and selling. That’s what Google and Amazon represent. A better analogy might be letting a foreign firm build toll roads across the country, charging whatever it likes to use them.We’re seeing this again with the build-out of artificial intelligence. During President Trump’s state visit in September, the UK proudly celebratedGoogleandMicrosoft’s investments in “datacentres” – vast warehouses of computer servers that power AI systems. Yet datacentres are the bottom rung of the AI economy, private infrastructure that simply channels profits back to US headquarters.Could urban farming feed the world?Read moreIn another timeline, the UK could have been a true leader in AI. US researchers were once far behind their British and French counterparts. Yet, in a move neither Washington nor Beijing would have permitted, the UK cheerfully allowed the sale of most of its key AI assets and talent over the last decade or so –DeepMind’s purchaseby Google being the most famous example. What remains is an AI strategy consisting of the supply of electricity and land for datacentres. It’s like being invited to a party only to discover you’re there to serve the drinks.If tech platforms are indeed like toll roads, the logical step would be to limit their take – perhaps by capping fees or charging for data extraction. Yet no country has done so: we accept the platforms but fail to regulate their power as we do with other utilities. The European Union has come closest, with itsDigital Markets Act, which regulates how dominant platforms treat dependent businesses. The US government, for its part, is also at the mercy of its homegrown tech giants, yet Congress remains paralysed.If the UK wanted to take a different path, to resist this economic colonisation and extraction, it could partner with the European Union and perhaps Japan in order to develop a joint strategy – one that forces platforms to support local businesses and nurtures alternatives to mature US technologies. So far, though, alongside other nations disadvantaged by American dominance, it has been slow to adapt, instead hoping that the 90s playbook will still work, despite evidence to the contrary.The truth is that we now live in a more cynical and strategic era. One way or another, the world needs an anti-monopoly framework with far greater force than anything seen so far. Wherever you live, it’s clear the world would be better off with more firms from different countries. The alternative is not only costly but politically dangerous, feeding resentment and dependence. We can do better than a future where what counts as economic freedom is merely a choice between relying on the United States, or relying on China.Tim Wu is a former special assistant to President Biden and author ofThe Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity(Bodley Head).Further readingThe Tech Coupby Marietje Schaake (Princeton, £13.99)Supremacyby Parmy Olson (Pan Macmillan, £10.99)Chip Warby Chris Miller (Simon & Schuster, £10.99)Explore more on these topicsTechnologyThe big ideaEconomicsArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Eve NortonSun 23 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 08.41 ESTShareAndy, 55What makes the sex incredible is our chemistry, and the complete lack of judgment and pressureWhen I met Rita through a ramblers’ club 18 months ago, I was instantly fascinated by her, and the more that we flirted at group meet-ups, the more intrigued I became. Still, I waited months to initiate anything – making up some pretext to pop over, then asking permission to kiss her. She agreed, but she said she needed more time to think before taking things any further, which of course I understood – though I was dying to sleep with her.When she did invite me over explicitly for that purpose, the decision felt measured, but the sex itself was wonderfully playful and spontaneous. We’re both obsessed with oral, and we’ve messed around with bondage, too. In general, though, I’d say our tastes are pretty vanilla; what makes the sex incredible is our chemistry, and the complete lack of judgment and pressure. There’s no expectation for me to stay hard for hours on end, which I’ve felt before. But honestly, with Rita I’m aroused constantly.I’m fully aware that what we are doing falls outside the bounds of conventional morality, but the truth is I’ve fallen in love with herI’ve been with my wife for decades, and our marriage is now sexless, which used to sadden me. I have my doubts that we’re going to stay together in the future, but we’re both devoted to our daughter, who’s in the middle of her GCSEs. I’ve broached the subject of opening our relationship before, but it’s never gone anywhere. I’ve had a couple of extramarital flings in the past – but those fizzled out pretty quickly. My situation with Rita feels completely different. I’m besotted – and it’s coming to the point where I feel I have to tell my wife what’s going on. I’d prefer to stay married until my daughter’s left home, but I’d be comfortable with my wife pursuing her own relationships, too.I’m fully aware that what Rita and I are doing falls outside the bounds of conventional morality, but the truth is I’ve fallen in love with her. The other week we sat on a riverbank for an hour, watching a kingfisher, and I just thought: I could spend every day like this. Our connection is so palpable that other people in our ramblers’ group have started commenting.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I’ve spent decades playing the roles of wife and mother – I’ve been divorced twice, and have grownup children – and I felt as if I’d earned the right to pursue my own desires more freely. Still, I hesitated before getting involved with him. Besides the fact that he’s married, he’s also 10 years younger than me, and, although I’m fairly uninhibited, I retain a certain shyness about my body, particularly now I’m in my 60s.Actually, though, both of us being slighter older has made sex better. Initially, we’d almost race through it – when you’ve only got an hour, you feel this pressure to give the other person an orgasm – but that’s trickier when you’re over 50. Now, we’re taking a more Tantric approach; the sex is less urgent, more intimate.I’ve learned first-hand how difficult it is to extract yourself from the kind of situation he’s inTruthfully, I have no idea what the state of his marriage is; though I’m aware he’s had affairs before, and he’s implied I’m the only person he’s sleeping with now. Perhaps it sounds hypocritical, but it’s quite important to me to be respectful of his bond with his wife rather than asking too many intrusive questions. Having been married twice, I appreciate how complicated family dynamics can be.That said, I see less of him than I’d like and I’ve got no agency over when and where we do meet. If you’re longing to see a person, and he can only do lunchtime on Tuesday at your house, you do lunchtime on Tuesday at your house. Now, though, he’s increasingly speaking about us being together in the longer term. I believe he’s sincere but I’ve learned first-hand how difficult it is to extract yourself from the kind of situation he’s in.Soon the glaring question will have to be answered: when an affair becomes something more, how can you move forward with trust?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s what it was like to be part of Cop30 in Brazil. And yet more than 190 countries came together in the rainforest of the Amazon and reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism, the Paris agreement and the need toredouble our effortsto keep global warming to 1.5C.We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life. We know the UK produces just1% of emissions, which is why, as the prime minister said in Belém, our government is “all-in” on working with others to reduce the remaining 99%.We also know there are huge opportunities from driving the transition forward, which is why in Britain we are making historic investments in renewables and nuclear, upgrading millions of homes, and acting to protect nature.It is true that Britain wanted more from this Cop, including details of how we would speed up the global energy transition through an agreement that explicitlypledged a roadmapfor the transition away from fossil fuels. This didn’t happen because some countries would not agree.Yet on this issue, we have seen the emergence of an impressivecoalition of 83 countriesfrom the global north and global south, backed by more than 140global businesses and civil society groups. And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.This offers such an important lesson: that detailed negotiations matter, but the movements we build around them profoundly influence what can be delivered. The roadmap to achieve our goal tohalt and reverse deforestationby 2030 offers the same opportunity to drive forward our global efforts to tackle the nature and climate crises together.There is also a larger picture here. This year’s summit was a test of whether, at a time of political challenge, countries would keep working together on the greatest collective threat we face or, with the USstepping out of the Paris agreement, there might be a domino effect of others departing. For all the challenges, countries chose the path of cooperation.Cop30 therefore forms part of the long history of these negotiations that have seen the world change its trajectory from 4C of warming around a decade ago to 2.3- 2.5C. Despite that progress, our goalis 1.5C for a reason– because the science is clear that every fraction of a degree matters in limiting the impacts people will face here and around the world. That is why it is important that the world has pledged to enhance efforts to meet it through theBelém Mission to 1.5and Global Implementation Accelerator.Ambition on emissions reduction goes hand-in-hand with finance to make that possible, including for developing countries. Last year,countries agreedthat, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries. This year, as a core part of our fight against climate change, we agreed that this finance needs to be targeted at aiming to treble the support to building resilience to climate impacts.Our Brazilian hosts were determined to make this the implementation Cop – and much progress was made outside the negotiating halls. This was, of course, the first Cop in the Amazon, and the UK was proud to work with Brazil in the two years running up to the summit to help it develop the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which offers anincredibly inspiring solutionto global deforestation.We also worked alongside Brazil and many others on the Global Climate Action Agenda, which is about building the coalitions spanning governments, businesses, cities and civil society needed to accelerate action on the ground – on issues from reducing methane emissions and phasing out coal, to unlocking investment in clean energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our researchers, universities, mayors and others were also deeply engaged on climate issues at this Cop. And the UK was key to delivering the final outcomes of this summit, because of our record of climate leadership at home and abroad, as well as the extraordinary skill and determination of our civil service.The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt. We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action. In the face of this opposition, multilateralism is our best hope. For all its flaws, Cop has reaffirmed the belief of the vast majority of the world in this ideal.

It’s no coincidenceSun 23 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 09.12 ESTShareYou probably saw the recent story about a publican who grew suspicious of a team that won his pub quiz every week. He and his staff set abouttrying to discoverexactly how they were cheating. Do you fancy testing your knowledge and recall of topical news? Before you read the next paragraph, for one point name the pub, and for two points name the suburb of Manchester where it’s located.Although I have never set foot in The Barking Dog, or Urmston, as soon as this story broke, my inbox was full of friends and strangers forwarding the link and expressing their amazement – not only because it’s a classic hero’s quest in which good wins against evil, but also because it’s a strange case of life imitating art. This autumn, I publishedThe Killer Question, a crime fiction novel with a plot almost identical to this, albeit with a murder mystery woven in, which admittedly the Urmston case lacks.In my version, a mysterious new team, The Shadow Knights, arrive at a weekly quiz that’s vital to an otherwise failing rural pub. They walk away with the win every week and drive the quiz master to distraction. How can any team be so spectacularly unchallenged by his carefully crafted questions? Are they really such brilliant quizzers, or simply brilliant cheats? Then a body is pulled from the nearby river and everything changes.Yet surely, you’re wondering, with the stakes so low in your average pub quiz, how could it possibly end in bloodshed? Well, I’ve been quizzing regularly for years now with a team of six to eight friends. Take it from me, there’s something visceral about the competitive nature of quizzing that can make any dispute feel like a fight to the death. Add to this the unspoken rule that the question master’s decision is final – even if they are subsequently proved wrong – and frustration levels can soar. One week you win by a country mile, the next come last by 20 points, while losing first place by a single point will trigger seismic feelings of devastation. Standup arguments are not unheard of, fistfights always a possibility, and murder … well, itcouldhappen.For instance, a few years ago my team tried a new quiz at a venue further afield than usual – an intrepid decision that would end in menace. Surrounded by strangers, we were subject to the usual unspoken suspicion reserved for any outsiders in town. But we crystallised these normal levels of hostility by leading all the way and winning by a large margin. We walked out, carrying our prizes of a chocolate bar each, through a gauntlet of disgruntled muttering pitched at just the right volume for us to hear every word. We never quizzed there again.Given a perfect storm of personalities and inebriation, that palpable resentment could easily have turned deadly and provided the spark of inspiration for The Killer Question.Question 1: Are phone cheats killing the pub quiz?Read moreYes, there are some quizzers who are just happy to be there and don’t mind coming last. What drives them, I’ve no idea because the rest of us leave rational values at the pub door. The Urmston team were using voice-activated smartwatches to cheat for a £30 bar voucher shared between six. Financial gain does not come into it. The stakes in a pub quiz are unlike any in the outside world; they are far, far higher. If they weren’t, this tiny local story would never have made national news.So why did the story enthral an entire country? For me, it’s about knowledge and honesty.Knowledge is power, and power means status, respect and self-esteem.How much we know and how thoroughly we know the subjects on which we pride ourselves, especially if we have a professional interest, are intimately entwined with our personal identity. There are few things more embarrassing and humbling than confidently answering a question on your specialist subject, only to get it spectacularly wrong. I know. With degrees in English literature and screenwriting plus a career as a journalist, playwright, screenwriter and novelist, I rarely get an arts or literature question correct. Each one keeps me awake at night. How can I know so little about Dickens, Austen and Shakespeare?Most of the rules (no mobile phones, no eavesdropping, no glancing at another team’s papers) must be taken on trustMeanwhile, how knowledgable others perceive us to be is directly reflected in our social status. Winning a quiz has the effect of raising us above our contemporaries and such status must be earned. Anyone attempting to cheat this process of fair selection can be seen as a thief, stealing the win from an honest team, and can expect scorn to be rained upon them, as well as peanuts, pork scratchings and beermats. This is a level of disdain usually reserved for sports cheats, lying politicians and disgraced celebrities, all of whom can be seen to have unfairly elevated themselves above the rest of us.In the quiz as in life, honesty is key. After all, most of the rules (no mobile phones, no eavesdropping, no glancing at another team’s papers) must be taken on trust, and this transparency extends beyond the quiz itself. For example, in the first episode of Nathan Fielder’s sublime HBO seriesThe Rehearsal, a quizzer lived in such morbid fear of how his teammates would react if they knew he had lied about having a master’s degree (when he only had a bachelor’s) that he sought help from the TV show to finally come clean.The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundupRead moreQuizzing is one of the more inclusive ways to climb the social ladder because it doesn’t necessarily favour the most privileged or educated participants. In The Wizard of Oz the Scarecrow wants a brain, but gets a blank scroll – a symbol of knowledge – that says he is clever and gives him the confidence to believe in his own worth.Some of the best quizzers are people who don’t have a degree. They never got that piece of paper that proves they know things, so they strive to prove it in the quiz. They revise key topics: Premier League results, reigns of the kings and queens, Olympic records … and treat every quiz like a crucial exam.The Barking Dog story reminded me why I wanted to honour the passion quizzers and quiz masters feel for their hobby, the healthy (and unhealthy) competitiveness, the joy of learning new things, of spending time with friends and making new ones.

So, what exactly is the problem?Ellie Violet BramleyThe outrage a J Crew jumper has provoked shows that the US right’s sense of masculinity is far more fragile than it would care to admitSun 23 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 03.01 ESTShareAmen’s jumper by the all-American preppy labelJ Crewhas sent thousands of Maga Americans into meltdown. From a fashion point of view, it couldn’t be more innocuous. It’s got a crew neck. It’s made from wool. It has a Fair Isle pattern at the upper yoke. There’s nothing asymmetric about it, no fringing or tassels, no slogan blasted across the front; no “Make America Kind Again”. So what’s the big deal? Reader, the jumper ispink.The main storm broke underneath a tweet by conservativesocial media commentator Juanita Broaddrick, in which she asked: “Are you kidding me?? Men, would you wear this $168 sweater?” The consensus among her followers was a resounding no, and not because of its price. “No man in my family would wear it!” wrote “MOMof DataRepublican”. “My husband wouldn’t use a pink bathroom towel,” assured another. Another X user was even more passionate: “HELL NO. I’m a man, not gay and won’t be dressing up as a Golden Girl anytime soon.” Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican congressman,called the sweater“something a sorority girl would wear in the 80s”. I think he meant it witheringly; I read that and think it sounds quite fun.For others, it was a case of pointing out who would wear such an enfeebling jumper as this. “I’m sure you’ll be seeing these at the anti-Ice protests,” wrote one X user, with another saying he would wear it “if I was going undercover in dudes for Kamala”. One person went so far as toPhotoshop Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom’s, headon to the J Crew model’s body.That some quarters of the right have taken such umbrage at a J Crew jumper is interesting. It’s a label which is traditionally more aesthetically aligned with the old-school conservative right. It’s preppy and, inThe Kingdom of Prep: The Inside Story of the Rise and (Near) Fall of J Crew, author Maggie Bullock describes prep as “the bedrock of straightforward, unfettered, ‘American’ style” – the “leisure uniform of the establishment”. In the Trump era, however, even this can become the source of conflict: an aesthetic clash between traditional conservatives and the Maga neo-right.Camouflage clothing may be having a moment – but in our violent world, is that wise? | Ellie Violet BramleyRead moreNot to deny thatpink has had a complicated history, but you’d be forgiven for thinking we were past this kind of uproar about the idea of men wearing it. We live, after all, in a post-millennial pink world, where not only have the likes ofHarry StylesandTyler, The Creatorworn pink – and looked great doing it – but also those who aren’t known for being quite so fashion-forward, such asJake GyllenhaalandDaniel Craig, before his association with fashion brand Loewe. Even rightwing men like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump himself have seen fit to take themselves seriously as the Billy Big Bollockses they think they are while wearing pink ties.Yet the hand-wringing this jumper has provoked about the state of American masculinity seems to be keenly felt. The contradiction of course is that any masculinity that feels shaken by a spot of pink on some knitwear is more fragile than it would care to admit.And what is it about pink? Yes, pink is now all about Barbie and cotton candy, but there was a time, over a century ago, when blue was considered more feminine and pink was associated with boys. As a trade publication called theInfant’s Departmentreported in 1918, “pink, being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl”. The lines seem to have been drawn in relation to kids’ clothes and expanded and evolved from there.Ultimately, J Crew will probably be enjoying this free publicity. But, unlike that other recent example of a clothing brand shamelessly stirring the culture war pot (ahem,American Eagle) – this doesn’t feel like a deliberate play for airtime. (Interestingly, shortly after American Eagle’s campaign launched, itsstock rose by almost 18%. At the time of writing, the jumper isstill availablein most sizes.) J Crew is unlikely to be weaponising pink as a way to cause a stir over the perceived emasculation of American men. More likely is that they didn’t honestly see that it would be a big deal. Because, honestly, it’s not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Congress won’t do it – Republicans slavishly follow his orders, Democrats are ill-led and divided. For today’s White House, the concept of constitutional limits on executive power is a quaint relic. The news media, or sections of it, does its best amid constant legal threats. But, too often,they pay him off. Brave reporters who insist on asking awkward questions are insulted or silenced: “Quiet, piggy.”So who will tame Donald Trump? Who will halt his rolling constitutional coup – his ongoingevisceration of US democracy, civil rights, living standards, global reputation and moral integrity? Voters may try to indirectly rein him back in next November’s midterms (as they didrecently in New Yorkand elsewhere). But those elections are a year away. The emergency is today.What the US urgently needs now, metaphorically speaking, is a national champion, a sort of modern-day Saint George to slay the dragon, save the people and ensure the triumph of good over evil. Who, in reality, might fill this role of moral saviour?Step forward Leo XIV, the “American pope”, backed by the US conference of Catholic bishops and the clergy and grassroots activists of the Catholic church – unexpected, newly emerging standard-bearers for country-wide resistance to the Trumpist scourge. The bishops threw down thegauntlet in a “special message”this month. Inequality, immigration and civil rights are the battlegrounds on which the church, and some other Christian denominations, have begun to fight.The US is now a rogue state - look at its extrajudicial killings off Venezuela’s coast | Simon TisdallRead more“We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanising rhetoric and violence,” the statement said. Citing the brutal tactics of immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents, the bishops deplored the “climate of fear” created by Trump’s policies, the profiling of vulnerable citizens, shocking conditions in detention centres and lack of access to pastoral care.Expressing a view, rooted in scripture, that Britain’s Labour government and other western countries would do well to heed, they went on: “We recognise that nations have a responsibility to regulate their borders and establish a just and orderly immigration system for the sake of the common good.” But creating safe and legal pathways for migrants was the preferable, ethical solution. Human dignity and national security were not in conflict, they said.Chicago-born Leo, increasingly outspoken inopposing Trump’s “inhuman” policiessince his election in May, now stands at the head ofthis clerical revolt. Earlier this month, he demanded ICE rethink its demonisation of migrants – more than 2 million “illegal aliens” have been involuntarily removed this year and record numbers detained,official figures indicate. Hecriticised lethal US strikeson suspected drug smugglers off Venezuela, warning violence would fail. And he has challenged Trump’s climate-crisis denial, telling Cop30 that God’s creationis “crying out” for action.Organised opposition to Trumpamong Catholic and other faith groupson the “Christian left” is spreading at grassroots level. From New Jersey to California, parish priests and pastors have led local protests, boycotts and initiatives to counter ICE’s depredations. “Catholics are particularly well positioned to lead such a movement,”wrote Maria J Stephan, a specialist in non-violent civil resistance.About22% of US adults identify as Catholicand more than four in 10are immigrants or children of immigrants. “Many Catholics are likely among those now living in fear of masked agents abducting them in unmarked cars to detention centres … Meanwhile, close to three million black Catholics are experiencing attacks on the voting rights act and the weakening of civil rights protections,” Stephan wrote.The church has also launched assaults on Trump’s signature fiscal legislation, accusing him of “unconscionable” cuts in healthcare and food assistance, and unjustifiable tax breaks for the better-off. “Catholic teaching compels the faithful to uphold human dignity. It is hard to conceive of the law as promoting the sanctity of every life when it cuts key programs for the needy and expands tax cuts to the wealthy,” wroteWheaton College professor of public theology Esau McCaulley.Catholics, like other US religious groups, are far from united in opposing Trump.He won 55% of Catholic voteslast year, although support has since dropped sharply. Conservative critics have lampooned Leo asthe “woke pope”– a reminder that on abortion and other issues, the Catholic hierarchyoften takes an anti-progressive, reactionary stance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As in the secular sphere, the divide is stark. “Christian nationalism is particular rather than universal. It is about protecting ‘us’ against ‘them’ – the native versus the immigrant. It is about power more than love. It is about threat more than hope,”wrote commentator David Brooks. He could have been talking about Maga – or Reform UK.Increasingly erratic dictatorial behaviour, violent nihilism, exploitative religious hypocrisy and blatant corruption: this is the challenge facing the US and the world. Is Leo, speaking up for human dignity, decency and faith, the leader whose hour has come? He’s 70. He has the job for life. Trump has three years left in office. If he chooses to use it, Leo has the moral authority, political savvy and international standingto confront Trump, to positive effect, on poverty, inequality, migrants, civil rights, Russia, Palestine and other pressing issues.The American pope could do what others manifestly cannot: shame and tame the monster. To do so, he needs what Trump’s nemesis, the latePope Francis, prayed for: the support not only of Catholics, but of “all men and women of good will”. That, and maybe a small miracle, too. After all, brave Saint George was martyred.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorThis article was amended on 23 November 2025.

Indeed, she and Keir Starmer hoped that by being the cautious and sensible successors to the five-leaders-in a-decade Tories, they would reap economic benefits.Investors glad to see the back of Conservative chaos would return to the UK; a more stable relationship with the EU would help to reduce trade barriers; growth would follow.But the hoped-for stability has not materialised. Part of the explanation is the shaky global backdrop. But the problem also lies in the miasma of gloom and uncertainty that has surrounded an administration often unable to give a clear account of itself, even to its own MPs.Reeves needs to do at least three things on Wednesday to cut through the fog and buy herself the time and space to deliver another, much less exciting budget in a year’s time.First, she should be brave enough to increase her headroom significantly. Markets appear to be expecting a doubling, to £20bn.There are trade-offs here, as the chancellor has repeatedly made clear. Stonking tax rises threaten economic growth, which is already anaemic. But she needs to give herself enough room for manoeuvre to avoid every spit and cough of economic data fuelling a market reappraisal of whether she can meet her rules.Executed with force and clarity, this approach could pay dividends in lower government borrowing costs. It should also make space for the Bank of England to deliver much-needed rate cuts.Second, Reeves seems to be minded to downgrade the status of the OBR’s spring forecast, so that its chair, Richard Hughes, and his number crunchers will opine on the state of the economy but not mark her against her fiscal targets.This change, recommended by the International Monetary Fund, seems sensible: the UK is an outlier in having what have in effect become two big fiscal events a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The less drama is provoked by the OBR’s next set of forecasts, the better.Third, and perhaps most challengingly, Reeves needs to set a clear and compelling direction of travel. How is it that Labour intends to “change” the UK, as its manifesto pledged? And how can the costs of that transformation be met fairly?The “one and done” framing of last year’s budget, with Reeves telling the CBI she would not have to come back for more after raising taxes by a historic £40bn, left few clues as to how she would handle this year’s main roadblock, of the OBR revisiting its productivity forecasts (something Labour wonks always knew was a possibility, incidentally).When Labour came to power, she didn’t kick off a review into how to tax wealth better, or to reform the crazily regressive council tax, or to look again at the pensions triple lock – offering clues to her principles.Instead, the straitjacket of the manifesto tax promises resulted in the £25bn employer national insurance contributions increase that many observers, including at the Bank of England, believe has put the brakes on hiring and boosted inflation.Some of her clearest language in last year’s budget was reserved for the idea of freezing income tax thresholds, which would, she said, “hurt working people”. She is now expected to do exactly that on Wednesday.Raising income tax, in clear contravention of the manifesto promises, was an alternative way through this week’s budget, as part of a “go big” package that would have jacked up Reeves’s headroom significantly.The argument, tested by the chancellor in her “scene setter speech”, would have been that “if we are to build the future of Britain together, we will all have to contribute to that effort”.If, as expected, she has reverted to a pick’n’mix of tax changes, she will need a different argument to tie them together. They may well, in fact, all be progressive – hitting higher earners and the wealthy harder – but she will need to say that loud and clear to make the budget feel coherent.Everyone – from the bond vigilantes who could sink the budget, to fed-up voters at home – would benefit from a much clearer sense of this Labour chancellor’s principles and purpose. That would make next year’s budget reassuringly boring – if she is still around to deliver it.Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)Economics viewpointEconomic policyEconomicsBudget 2025BudgetTax and spendingRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

But used fairly, it can be a boon for good governmentSun 23 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 09.24 ESTShareDemocracy is colliding with the technologies of artificial intelligence. Judging from the audience reaction at the recentWorld Forum on Democracyin Strasbourg, the general expectation is that democracy will be the worse for it. We have another narrative. Yes, there are risks to democracy from AI, but there are also opportunities.We have just published the bookRewiring Democracy: How AI will Transform Politics, Government, and Citizenship.In it, we take a clear-eyed view of how AI is undermining confidence in our information ecosystem, how the use of biased AI can harm constituents of democracies and how elected officials with authoritarian tendencies can use it to consolidate power. But we also give positive examples of how AI is transforming democratic governance and politics for the better.Here are four such stories unfolding right now around the world, showing how AI is being used by some to make democracy better, stronger, and more responsive to people.The US government is facing a crisis of legitimacy | Daniel MendiolaRead moreJapanLast year, then 33-year-old engineer Takahiro Anno was a fringe candidate for governor of Tokyo. Running as an independent candidate, he ended up coming in fifth in a crowdedfield of 56, largely thanks to the unprecedented use of an authorized AI avatar. That avatar answered8,600 questions from voterson a 17-day continuous YouTube livestream and garnered the attention of campaign innovators worldwide.Two months ago, Anno-san waselectedto Japan’s upper legislative chamber, again leveraging the power of AI to engage constituents–this time answeringmore than 20,000 questions. His new party, Team Mirai, is also an AI-enabled civic technology shop, producing software aimed at making governance better and more participatory. The party is leveraging its share of Japan’s public funding for political parties to build theMirai Assemblyapp, enabling constituents to express opinions on and ask questions about bills in the legislature, and to organize those expressions using AI. The party promises that its members willdirect their questioningin committee hearings based on public input.BrazilBrazil isnotoriously litigious, with even more lawyers per capita than the US. The courts are chronically overwhelmed with cases and the resultant backlog costs the government billions to process. Estimates are that the Brazilian federal government spends about 1.6% of GDP per yearoperating the courtsand another 2.5% to 3% of GDP issuingcourt-ordered paymentsfrom lawsuits the government has lost.Since at least 2019, the Brazilian government hasaggressively adoptedAI to automate procedures throughout its judiciary. AI is not making judicial decisions, but aiding in distributing caseloads, performing legal research, transcribing hearings, identifying duplicative filings, preparing initial orders for signature and clustering similar cases for joint consideration: all things to make the judiciary system work more efficiently. And the results are significant; Brazil’s federal supreme court backlog, for example, dropped in 2025 to itslowest levels in 33 years.While it seems clear that the courts are realizing efficiency benefits from leveraging AI, there is a postscript to the courts’ AI implementation project over the past five-plus years: the litigators are using these tools, too. Lawyers are using AI assistance to file cases in Brazilian courts at anunprecedented rate, with new cases growing by nearly 40% in volume over the past five years.It’s not necessarily a bad thing for Brazilian litigators to regain the upper hand in this arms race. It has been argued that litigation, particularly against the government, is a vital form ofcivic participation, essential to theself-governance functionof democracy. Other democracies’ court systems should study and learn from Brazil’s experience and seek to use technology to maximize the bandwidth and liquidity of the courts to process litigation.GermanyNow, we move to Europe and innovations in informing voters. Since 2002, the German Federal Agency for Civic Education has operated a non-partisan voting guide calledWahl-o-Mat. Officials convene an editorial team of 24 young voters (under 26 and selected for diversity) with experts from science and education to develop a slate of 80 questions. The questions are put to all registered German political parties. The responses are narrowed down to 38 key topics and then published online in a quiz format that voters can use to identify the party whose platform they most identify with.In the past two years, outside groups have been innovating alternatives to the official Wahl-o-Mat guide that leverage AI. First cameWahlweise, a product of the German AI company AIUI. Second, students at the Technical University of Munich deployed an interactive AI system calledWahl.chat. This tool was used by more than150,000 peoplewithin the first four months. In both cases, instead of having to read static webpages about the positions of various political parties, citizens can engage in an interactive conversation with an AI system to more easily get the same information contextualized to their individual interests and questions.However, German researchers studying the reliability of such AI tools ahead of the 2025 German federal election raised significantconcernsabout bias and “hallucinations” – AI tools making up false information. Acknowledging the potential of the technology to increase voter informedness and party transparency, the researchers recommended adopting scientific evaluations comparable to those used in the Agency for Civic Education’s official tool to improve and institutionalize the technology.United StatesFinally, the US – in particular, California, home toCalMatters, a non-profit, nonpartisan news organization. Since 2023, itsDigital Democracyproject has been collecting every public utterance of California elected officials – every floor speech, comment made in committee and social media post, along with their voting records, legislation, and campaign contributions – and making all that information available in a free online platform.CalMatters this year launched a new feature that takes this kind of civic watchdog function a big step further. ItsAI Tip Sheetsfeature uses AI to search through all of this data, looking for anomalies, such as a change in voting position tied to a large campaign contribution. These anomalies appear on a webpage that journalists can access to give them story ideas and a source of data and analysis to drive further reporting.This is not AI replacing human journalists; it is a civic watchdog organization using technology to feed evidence-based insights to human reporters. And it’s no coincidence that this innovation arose from a new kind of media institution – a non-profit news agency. As the watchdog function of the fourth estate continues to be degraded by the decline of newspapers’ business models, this kind of technological support is a valuable contribution to help a reduced number of human journalists retain something of the scope of action and impact our democracy relies on them for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThese are just four of many stories from around the globe of AI helping to make democracy stronger. The common thread is that the technology is distributing rather than concentrating power. In all four cases, it is being used to assist people performing their democratic tasks – politics in Japan, litigation in Brazil, voting inGermanyand watchdog journalism in California – rather than replacing them.In none of these cases is the AI doing something that humans can’t perfectly competently do. But in all of these cases, we don’t have enough available humans to do the jobs on their own. A sufficiently trustworthy AI can fill in gaps: amplify the power of civil servants and citizens, improve efficiency, and facilitate engagement between government and the public.One of the barriers towards realizing this vision more broadly is the AI market itself. The core technologies are largely being created and marketed by US tech giants. We don’t know the details of their development: on what material they were trained, what guardrails are designed to shape their behavior, what biases and values are encoded into their systems. And, even worse, we don’t get a say in the choices associated with those details or how they should change over time. In many cases, it’s an unacceptable risk to use these for-profit, proprietary AI systems in democratic contexts.To address that, we have longadvocatedfor the development of “public AI”: models and AI systems that are developed under democratic control and deployed for public benefit, not sold by corporations to benefit their shareholders. The movement for this is growing worldwide.Switzerland has recently released the world’s most powerful and fully realized public AI model. It’s calledApertus, and it was developed jointly by the Swiss government and the university ETH Zurich. The government has made it entirely open source –open data, open code, open weights – and free for anyone to use. No illegally acquired copyrighted works were used in its training. It doesn’t exploit poorly paid human laborers from the global south. Itsperformanceis about where the large corporate giants were a year ago, which is more than good enough for many applications. And it demonstrates that it’s not necessary to spendtrillionsof dollars creating these models. Apertus takes a huge step forward to realizing the vision of an alternative to big tech–controlled corporate AI.AI technology is not without its costs and risks, and we are not here to minimize them. But the technology has significant benefits as well.AI is inherently power-enhancing, and it can magnify what the humans behind it want to do. It can enhance authoritarianism as easily as it can enhance democracy. It’s up to us to steer the technology in that better direction. If more citizen watchdogs and litigators use AI to amplify their power to oversee government and hold it accountable, if more political parties and election administrators use it to engage meaningfully with and inform voters and if more governments provide democratic alternatives to big tech’s AI offerings, society will be better off.What’s giving me hope nowNathan:I am excited to see examples of people taking the technology into their own hands to fight for what they believe in. In addition to the above, we see US politicalcampaignersusing AI to make door-to-door canvassing more effective, Braziliancivic technologistsusing data to generate oversight of local government, and countless other examples around the world.Bruce:There is a real chance that AI technology will distribute power. Right now it’s concentrating power, because the cost to build these frontier models is enormous. But that cost isdropping dramatically, and the need for smaller and more nimble models is growing. One of the most important things we can do is to break the tech monopolies, and a more distributed AI ecosystem might just help with that.Nathan E Sanders is a data scientist affiliated with the Berkman Klein Center of Harvard University and co-author, with Bruce Schneier, of the book Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship.

While the farewells are always hard, Suzanne usually settles back home after a few weeks, staying connected with video calls and regular messaging even when time differences made it difficult.This time, though, something felt different.Suzanne was struggling with an overwhelming sense of dislocation and disconnection. “I thought a longer visit and more time with everyone would make it easier to come back, but it’s actually made it harder,” she said. “The goodbyes just don’t get any easier, and I feel that my heart is there, even though I live here.”I took my daughter on a holiday to Hong Kong to visit family. I didn’t realise how hard it would be to leave | Lucille WongRead moreSuzanne was particularly upset that the timing of her return meant she had missed her favourite aunt’s birthday celebration by a few weeks. “The family met up for tea and cake, and I felt so sad not to be there. I so wanted to be with her for her birthday and more than anything to just be physically there, not calling in from halfway around the world on a phone.“Then today I felt sad again because I baked a really special cake that turned out perfectly and I wanted to share it with family, but of course they are there not here, and that sadness took away some of the joy of creating it.”As she spoke, it was clear this wasn’t simply nostalgia: Suzanne has spent her adult life navigating two worlds. An extended visit and more time, rather than healing the ache, seems to have sharpened it.The loss of the ordinaryIn trying to understand why this most recent re-entry has been the most difficult so far, Suzanne wondered if “the ordinary parts of life” are the aspects she grieves the most. “I miss the birthdays, popping around to see them for tea, or planning to meet up next week, or linking up for a weekend.”Paradoxically, the longer visits exacerbate her feelings of loss: “Because we don’t get to see each other very often the visits end up feeling pressured and almost too intense, because we are trying to pack everything into the time we have together.”Suzanne described the ache of her realisation that perhaps the visits can’t ever compensate for the everyday presence she grieves for. “Actually, I think it’s impossible, no visit can make up for the fact that I’m not there most of the time, and that means I’m missing out on the ordinary things.”When homesickness doesn’t fadeResearchers often describehomesickness as a distresscaused by being away from home, with an expectation that it eases with time. But for many, the longing never fully recedes. It becomes a form of ambiguous loss – a term coined byfamily therapist Pauline Bossto describe grief that lacks closure or clear resolution.Ambiguous loss occurs when something or someone is absent, yet still profoundly present in our minds and hearts. Suzanne’s family are present for her and she can talk to them, even see their faces – but they remain physically out of reach.Boss’s research shows that this kind of loss can be as enduring and painful as bereavement, precisely because it cannot be completed.Suzanne read about ongoing homesickness and this ambiguous loss in alovely piece in the Guardian. Lucille Wong’s reflections resonated deeply with Suzanne: “When you have two worlds, you always have to say goodbye to one” and carrying with you “the heaviness of having to leave”.Wong also describes some hope and acceptance: “I think how wonderful it is to have two worlds, and despite having to leave one (for now), we hold the experiences, memories and connections. We learn to make room for the best of both worlds.”Making room for the best of both worldsSuzanne had engaged in therapy a few different times earlier in her life and found it helpful for making sense of her experiences and crafting a full life. “I know [from this therapy] that when the homesickness hits I’m grieving, and that grieving comes in waves and layers. And I do know there’s no fix or resolution to it.”In coping with this most recent bout, Suzanne is grappling with the challenge to acknowledge her homesickness and grief, while making room for the best of both worlds. This process of making room has led Suzanne to the puzzle of how to make sense of seemingly contradictory and conflicting emotions.If you’re feeling anxious, take a moment to pause before pouring that glass of wine | Diane YoungRead more“Howdo I make room for gratitude, joy and relationship connection[s] with people in my life here, without being overwhelmed by sadness and loss and longing for people over there?” she asked.Psychological research suggests that mixed emotions – like sadness and gratitude – are not contradictory but coexistent and in factneurologically integrated. This paradox validates Suzanne’s experience and, as Wong identified, appreciating the wonder of two worlds and perhaps a heart in two places may enable Suzanne to find comfort in the transitions, rather than distress.To help with the “how” and find some comfort, Suzanne has been experimenting with recent advice from the grief expertDr Lucy Hone. Hone recommends approaching grief in “manageable chunks”, oscillating between facing and avoiding it, using activities that are distracting to create breaks from grief.In these breaks, Suzanne gets glimmers of feeling more at peace. “I’m trying to feel grateful for what I have here without letting the sadness for what I don’t have take over,” she said. “Maybe that’s the only way to live with it – to make space for both.”Living with it will probably be lifelong for her. In this, Suzanne is not alone. Her story reflects experiences many migrants, expatriates and long-distance families know well: that while longing, love and loss are deeply interconnected, our hearts are flexible enough to hold them all both here and there.*Suzanne is an amalgam of a few different people, all of whom have given permission for their experiences to be shared here.

This isn’t just morally right, it could have scientific and economic benefits tooSun 23 Nov 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 14.41 ESTShareScience is a slaughterhouse. We rarely acknowledge the degree to which animal life underwrites the research that provides us with medicines, or the regulation that keeps us safe. Live animals were used in 2.64mofficially sanctionedscientific procedures in the UK in 2024, many of them distressing or painful and many of them fatal. But the government’s new strategyto phase out animal testing– publishedearlier this month– suggests that in the near future emerging technologies can largely replace the use of animals in our scientific endeavours.The UK previously banned cosmetics testing on animals, and has already taken steps to regulate and reduce their use in research. But some needlessly cruel experiments still take place: theforced swim test(FST) for example, in which a rodent is placed in a body of water it cannot escape and researchers measure whether antidepressants extend the time it struggles for life. The government says no new FST licences will be granted, in effect banning it. Similar targets are set over the next few years to end the testing of caustic chemicals on eyes and skin.This is welcome, but there are many other widespread practices – such as giving mice tumours to research cancer – which most people would still consider acceptable, despite their obvious barbarity. When animal wellbeing is pitted so starkly against human benefit, our collective compassion has a limit. The government will succeed only if it can convince scientists and the public that these longstanding and trusted experimental methods can be replaced with something as good or better.Fortunately, there are emerging alternatives. So-calledorgan-on-a-chip systems, which use lab-grown cells arranged into a miniature network that can simulate complex bodily systems, are already in use. And machine learning systems are provingas adeptatpredicting potential toxic effectsfrom medicines as they have been atpredicting protein structures. These approaches won’t always provide perfect insight into how a given treatment might work for humans, but of course neither do animal tests. Undergraduate scientists are still taught these classic cautionary tales: paracetamol is toxic to dogs and cats, while thalidomide was shown to be safe in rats.Unlike the slogans and aspirations in its AI strategy, the government appears to have areal planfor applying these technologies. There is £60m in direct funding committed– and a focus on identifying specific animal research methods currently in use, measuring their effectiveness and validating animal-free alternatives that could provide similar results. And it is heartening that the strategy maps out several points over the next decade when specific alternative methods are expected to mature, rather than gesturing at technology in general as a panacea.This is an opportunity for both scientific and economic progress. Animal testing isn’t just cruel, it isexpensive and time-consuming. The EU and US havesimilarly committedtoreduce animal experimentation, so there will be rewards for developing technology and knowhow that can be applied worldwide. But most importantly, there is a moral imperative to free these animals. Previous governments greatly reduced the number of so-called charismatic species – animals favoured by humans such as dogs and horses – used in experiments. Today, 95% of lab animals in the UK are rodents, birds or fish.

But wrong that it canunderminethat help in practice. For the last eight years,campaignershave warned that young people in supported housing are penalised more harshly for earning than their non-homeless counterparts – and it’s a UK-wide problem. For every £1 these youngsters earn over their small earnings allowance, theirhousing benefitis reduced by 65p, compared with 55p for those in the private rental sector. Perversely, the flaw crept in during reforms meant to guarantee people on benefits were always better off in work.Penalising young homeless people who want to work more is clearly counterintuitive. Anecdotally, those in the housing sector say it causes plenty of young people to foregomeaningful work. You can see why: someone working 10 hours could lose more than £100 a month for picking up an 11th hour of work. That can narrow their options, as they find themselves having to be prescriptive about their hours, competing with peers who can be more flexible. In the longer run, it can reduce their prospects. In some cases, staff find themselves in theunenviable positionof dissuading young people from taking a job lest they put their housing in jeopardy.For a government that wants to “make work pay”, this can’t be right. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has a chance to fix the problem in the budget. Young people have been the worst affected by rising unemployment, and while Ms Reeves has made the right moves – promisingpaid work for young peopleon universal credit who haven’t found education or employment after 18 months – those plans remain sketchy. It surely makes sense for Ms Reeves to ensure that incentives to work apply equally to all young people.A new campaign,frontedby 150 youth and homeless organisations, warns of a financial “cliff edge” that makes rent unaffordable and increases the risk of arrears. Charities say the earnings allowance should rise from a token £5 to about £57, and the housing benefit taper should be brought down from 65% to 55% to match universal credit.These are sensible, practical measures that would ensure that some of the country’s poorest people get financial help. It would also signal that the government is invested in making the country fairer for them. The homeless charity Centrepoint says it’s a win-win policy. The Treasury, it calculates, will gain£5ma year as more young people move into work. Once wider outcomes – such as improved health and reduced crime – are considered, the net gain is£13mannually.There is a generational crisis bubbling under Britain’s surface in which young people face risingunemployment, insecure housing and fallingreal wages. Their futures, it feels, are being shaped less by opportunity and more byprecarity. If ministers truly want to “make work pay” for everyone, they’ll have to explain why 30,000 young homeless people are the one group excluded from that promise. It’s time to act.Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessOpinionYoung peopleHousingPovertyLabourBenefitsBudget 2025editorialsShareReuse this content"

I was able to generate a £26bn surplus and reduce the basic rate of income tax to 19%, and end the two-child benefit cap at the same time. This was done by limiting pension relief to 20%, closing capital gains loopholes, increasing tax on gambling, reforming council tax and levying banks, which all pass the fairness test. So, chancellor, it really is that easy if you have the political will to improve the lot of ordinary people.Mark BellchambersCrawley, West SussexThe late John Smeed, a lecturer in German literature at Durham University, once began a review: “Books about books about books are seldom a good thing.” He conceded, however, that the work under consideration was an exception.

Like a family using a payday loan to buy their home, yes, we’d end up with a building, but we’ll have to sacrifice meals to keep up with the payments.Given Rachel Reeves’s lack of fiscal wiggle room, no one believes that the NHS’s budget will increase year-on-year to keep pace with the combined financial impact of inflation, the growing health needs of our ageing population and possible rising drug prices. So adding a new private finance debt burden to this cocktail will only result in trusts skimping on the only one of those things they have control over: patient care.Research has shown that some trusts pay out more in annual debt repayments for private finance initiatives (PFI) than they do formedicines for patients. A newbriefing by We Own Itdiscusses different private finance models and how they each damage NHS finances. The Streeting PFI model won’t be any different.There are a number of non‑private finance options available to Reeves and Streeting to fund investment in NHS capacity. Reeves has already shown that she can claw back wasted public funds withCovid contracts, so why not with historic PFI deals?Second, they could introduce VAT on private healthcare, a policy supported by Neil Kinnock. This would raisearound £2bn.Streeting and Reeves’s hands are not tied. If they end up resurrecting private finance in theNHS, it will be a political choice.Johnbosco NwogboLead campaigner, We Own ItLabour MPs urging the chancellor to drop private finance plans for the NHS overlook the danger that, under the current fiscal rules, health centres won’t get built without private investment. As the National Audit Office found, PFI built projects “on time and on budget”. It also locked in maintenance for years – protecting the NHS from cost‑cutting chancellors.Ninety hospitalswere rebuilt under PFIs in less than a decade, with better value for money. By contrast, the non-PFInew hospital building programme, announced six years ago, will not see most hospitals start being built until 2032.TheNHS Lift (local improvement finance trust) programme– which gave a stake to the public sector – built350 health centresin some of the most deprived communities.

A wealth tax. What will that accomplish? Very little, 20 November). He notes that the Wealth Tax Commission in 2020 estimated that an annual wealth tax of 1.12% on assets over £10m could bring in £10bn a year, describing it as “handy, but in Whitehall terms hardly life-changing”. This amount is far from trivial. Earlier this year, our government was trying to push throughcuts to disability benefitsthat would have plunged hundreds of thousands into poverty to save half that. Although a backlash stopped them, Rachel Reeves has said that she can’t “leave welfare untouched” and is still considering how to claw billions from the most vulnerable. These amounts arecompletely life-changing to the people at the sharp end.Although the annual wealth tax is leading the headlines, it’s not proposed in isolation. Groups like Tax Justice UK estimate that new taxes onwealth and pollution could raise up to £60bn a year. These funds should be used to redistribute wealth from the richest to the rest of us: investing in co-ops, taking assets back into public ownership and building council homes.But annual wealth taxes would also be a step towards curbing the billionaire class. The wealth of British billionaires alone has grown bymore than 1,000% since 1990, and we can all see the way that inequality of wealth has rapidly become inequality of power. It’s corrosive to our society. Billionaires should not exist – that should be a policy goal.The American labour economics professor Marshall Steinbaum has estimated that a2% wealth taxand inheritance taxes could undo this in 20-30 years in the US, and we need to be aiming for the same here. Annual wealth taxes alone may not fix everything immediately, but they’re a start to the deep structural change that our society needs.Priya Sahni-NicholasCo-director, Equality TrustAditya Chakrabortty is missing the point. A wealth tax is a political statement, not an economic policy, and it’s necessary. People’s lives are getting worse. Both established political parties have failed to improve things, so people are looking for an alternative. We are in a dangerous place with Reform UK edging its way towards Westminster.Reform UK offers simple solutions. It says our problems are caused by immigration. “Stop the boats! Deport the foreigners – they’re taking your homes, jobs and GP appointments.” This is simplistic nonsense but it works because it’s simple. It fits in a tweet. The left needs an alternative and though its answer lies in long complex arguments about fiscal and macroeconomic policies, few people understand these. You can’t win an argument with someone who thinks “stop the boats” will fix their life by talking about marginal propensity to consume, asset-price inflation or capital controls.So we need simple formulas that indicate change. One of these is the call for a wealth tax. It’s less an economic policy than it is a political truth that money flows to the rich in our economic system. It states the left’s intent to reverse this, that we need to distribute money downwards to give people better lives. Until someone comes up with something better, I’m going to keep arguing for a wealth tax.Clare BurtonShipley, West YorkshireAditya Chakrabortty writes that a 1% tax on the super rich would be insufficient for tackling wealth inequality. He’s right, of course, but the alternative solution he proposes – conducting something like a “giant raid” on “well-to-do families” with assets over £1m – is bizarre.There are 150-odd billionaires living in the UK, and thousands with more than £100m. Why tax those with less wealth when we can tax these few individuals with truly extraordinary wealth at 10% or more? They won’t miss it and we’ll raise much more. Plus, threatening the much more numerous group with a “raid” seems to me like a great way to lose political support.I am not a homeowner and indeed have no assets other than a pre-owned 2016 Vauxhall Corsa that would probably fetch me about £5,000, so I write this not out of fear but out of confusion.Shannon RayTotnes, DevonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He rounded off the scoring following Richarlison’s fine consolation strike for a Tottenham side that showed little ambition throughout and recorded 0.07 expected goals.Brilliant Eze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thump Spurs to extend lead in title raceRead more“Things happen for a reason,” said theArsenalmanager, whose side recorded three successive runners-up finishes before Eze’s signing for £67.5m in the summer. “After the international duty, he had two days off, and after one day he wanted to train, and he wanted to improve, and he wanted to do extra practice and he was asking me questions about this and that.“When a player has such a talent, and his desire is at that level, then these things happen. And he fully deserves it. I’m so happy for him, because since the day that he came, he brought something else to the team.“So it’s a joy, it’s an aurathat this teamneeded and hopefully it will give him a lot of confidence, to him and the team, that at any moment he can win us a game. And that’s the ability that he has and he certainly needs to fulfil that talent.”Eze, who had scored only twice in 15 previous appearances since his move to Arsenal having been rejected by them as a teenager, said: “It is special. Words can’t explain this one today. That’s what I prayed for: a hat-trick and I got it. I’m grateful to God. God gave it to me, that’s faith. All my family is here and that makes it even more special for me. ”Tottenham lined up with a five-man defence but that was abandoned at half-time by Thomas Frank and his side ended up having only four touches in Arsenal’s penalty area.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mallía, the full-back, was forced off late on with what is thought to be an anterior cruciate ligament injury, which meant Argentina, who had used all their replacements, had to finish the match with 14 men.“How old is he?” said Contepomi of Curry. “Twenty-seven? And strong. And I am 48 and he comes and just [shoves me]. I was standing there. He was coming in to say hi to one of our coaches, but we said no because we were upset. I said: ‘Man, you broke his knee,’ and he said: ‘Fuck off,’ and pushed me like that.England edge over line for autumn clean sweep but Argentina fume over Curry scuffleRead more“Maybe that is the way he is, I don’t know him. I am not happy with the situation, after breaking someone’s knee I think you need to be at least humble and respectful enough to say: ‘Sorry, I did something wrong,’ but he did the opposite. Maybe it is his way of being a bully. If we want bullies in this game, good on them. It was a late, late tackle, or reckless.”Steve Borthwick was quick to defend Curry’s honour. “I’m aware there was an incident,” he said. “I didn’t see it. I was in the changing room. But anybody who has had any contact with Tom Curry knows his character is impeccable. He is a fantastic team man, a respectful guy. His character is unquestionable.”View image in fullscreenJuan Cruz Mallía is forced off the pitch after the tackle by Tom Curry.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesContepomi had already been involved in heated exchanges on the touchline over Curry’s tackle, which occurred in the 74th minute, as Argentina were trying to overturn an 11-point deficit. Mallía cleared the ball and was caught late by Curry, an offence for which the Englishman was penalised. No further action was taken. “I am not a good English speaker but I would call [it] reckless. We ended up playing with 14, they ended up with 15 and it was not even checked out. I cannot understand it.”The altercation came at the end of an ugly few minutes after the final whistle. Curry was embroiled in a quarrel with a number of Argentina’s players, joined quickly by Henry Pollock.Contepomi was also upset about the use of the instrumented mouthguards (IMGs), or the non-use of the technology by the officials. Twice his fly-half, Tomás Albornoz, was taken off for a head injury assessment, because he had clapped while holding his gumshield. But it was the lack of action after Pablo Matera’s withdrawal, triggered by the IMG, that worried Contepomi. He felt foul play had been involved and had not been checked by the television match official (TMO).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For the second game in a row they took an early lead through Lukas Nmecha but ended up with nothing, Morgan Rogers producing a pair of remarkable finishes to liftAston Villainto the Champions League qualification slots. Leeds remain in the relegation zone.“Performance-wise we’ve turned back to what we want to be,” said Daniel Farke. “We should’ve taken some points from this game. We are not back to our best. We can still improve, but at the end we are just disappointed we did not get any points.” Given the way Leeds faded in the second half and their lack of guile throughout, that was perhaps an overly sanguine reading.‘No miracles’: Philippe Clement gets instant view of size of task at NorwichRead moreVilla began the season apparently still feeling the hangover from missing out on Champions League football. But they have won nine of their past 11 in all competitions and the depth of their squad is beginning to tell. Donyell Malen began on the bench and, while he may not have scored in his third successive game, his arrival at half-time shifted the momentum as Villa became only the second away side in 26 to win in the league at Elland Road.“We started poorly but we’ve found a bit of rhythm and stuck together as a group,” said Matty Cash. “You have to be resilient in places like this. In the second half we played really well.”Last season, the then Southampton manager Ivan Juric observed that he had expected his side to be technically and tactically inferior to otherPremier Leagueopponents but had been surprised by how physically inferior they had been. The Premier League is a step up from the Championship in every way.The promoted sides seem to have absorbed that lesson. One of the reasons that, as a trio, they have started the season relatively encouragingly is that they have all reinforced with physically imposing players. For three-quarters of the first half at Elland Road, Villa struggled to live with Leeds’s aggression. Had Leeds’s ferocity been allied to slightly more finesse or guile, they could have, in effect, had the game won before Villa at last began to settle in the final minutes before the break.View image in fullscreenLukas Nmecha scores in the eighth minute to give Leeds an early lead against Aston Villa.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesAs it was, their main threat was set plays, particularly those delivered by the right boot of Sean Longstaff. It was his free-kick that brought the opener after eight minutes. The goal was ugly, and Villa protested, but Emi Martínez was far too easily distracted as Nmecha challenged him, allowing Anton Stach to divert the ball goalwards with his back. Ezri Konsa’s hack off the line then hit Nmecha and rebounded over the line.Martínez may have been at fault for the opener, but he did get down sharply to keep out a Brendan Aaronson snapshot after a corner had been half cleared. He made another fine save late on to keep out a Pascal Struijk header for another free-kick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leeds tired visibly towards the end of the first half and struggled to pick it up in the second, when Nmecha was left far more isolated than he had been in the first, the midfield no longer able to get forward to support him. That in turn allowed Villa more of the ball and, under less pressure, they began to use it rather better, in part because of the introduction of the Dutch duo of Malen and Ian Maatsen for the second half.Within two minutes of the restart, the change had paid off, Malen finding space in the right side of the penalty area, taking a cutback from Lucas Digne and drilling over a low cross that Rogers converted with a deft flick. His second, 15 minutes from time, was even better, a strange dipping free-kick from the edge of the box whose startlingly sharp parabola confounded Lucas Perri as it got up and down over the wall. Rogers ran straight to the set-piece coach, Austin MacPhee, to celebrate Villa’s second goal from a direct free-kick in successive games after Emi Buendía’s against Bournemouth. “It wasn’t bad,” Rogers said. “Emi’s been practising, I’ve tried to practise with him. I’m not as good as him. We’ve been practising that technique. I’m happy it worked out today.”Leeds seemed to have equalised almost immediately, only for replays to show that Dan James’s cross-shot had been diverted in by the left hand of Dominic Calvert-Lewin. They applied pressure after that, but that incapacity to create chances from open play cost them. With Manchester City and Chelsea next up, the anxiety is only likely to get worse.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the same way that this city of heatwaves is now being combed by chilly winds and rain, the whole thing just feels wrong. Through years of buildup, the current England team has raised the possibility of being different to those that came before. For anyone who believed it, even a little, it seems as if we all got hoodwinked.In my cricket watching lifetime, English visits have been a procession of the abject. This is not to claim any personal influence, merely to give a temporal window. But the length to which this lifetime has now grown does take the observation beyond the trivial. In 1986-87, when Mike Gatting’s team won the series by the fourth Test, I was too much of an infant to notice. No one then could have predicted the disproportionate brutality of the decades to come.England must avoid Perth 2025 becoming the new Adelaide 2006 | Ali MartinRead moreBy 1991, there were a couple of draws, but three Australian beltings. By the end of each series in 1995 and 1999, England won a consolation match but lost three. In January 2003 the consolation win came after four defeats. Then the zip era began: a couple went 5-0, a couple went 4-0, either side of that single anomaly of a grand old England team whacking Australia 3-1 in 2010-11.One series win out of nine, six Test wins out of 45. All of which is to say, there were very firm grounds for a historically sourced lack of confidence that England would compete this time around. But we kind of, sort of, just a little bit, bought it. Some of us, anyway, following the game across the world, we couldn’t help but hear that this English setup was full of boisterous confidence. They were too vocal about that to miss it. And while that was partly annoying, and certainly irritated plenty of Australians in the lead-up, it was also heartening in its difference. This was not an England team arriving here with tails already lodged between legs, trying to avoid criticism for seeming cocky while instead strangling themselves with deference. This lot said they would bring combative fire and said it for long enough to persuade that perhaps they could.But doing that would have needed the right preparation, the right attention to detail. England got the first part right with their squad selection of fast-bowling options, knowing they needed to launch their campaign in Perth with a bang. They got it right with theirbowling in Australia’s first innings, making up for the failure of their first turn with the bat. A Test match gives the possibility of getting away with failure once, if you fix it the second time around.View image in fullscreenTravis Head is the one Australian batter at the top of his game, but he cannot do it every time.Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PAInstead, from an Australian perspective, England’s second innings procession was a source of bewilderment. We saw a visiting team so insufferably full of self-regard that they thought they could show up, not practise, not adjust, not think, not change, and play in exactly the way that has failed on Perth pitches since fast bowling was invented. Now, having lost in two days, with 11 days to spare before a pink-ball match of the sort few of them have played,they still vacillateover whether it’s worthwhile for their batters to stoop to an acclimatising hit in a tour match.There is no reason on paper that England cannot turn the series around. The Australian batting offers ways in. Jake Weatherald is new, Usman Khawaja is sore, Steve Smith is erratic, Marnus Labuschagne is coming back, Travis Head can’t do it every time. That’s not formidable. But then, in the past few decades, formidable hasn’t been necessary. English teams have been beaten, even flattened, by Australian sides whose runs came from the mid-range talents of Brad Haddin, Shaun Marsh, Greg Blewett, Khawaja, Greg Matthews and Mitchell Marsh. It is counterintuitive that the one team England did manage to beat, even flatten, was the comparatively A-list side with Simon Katich, Ricky Ponting, Mike Hussey and Michael Clarke.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When there’s a trend, we want to identify the moment it changes. There’s always the temptation to be the cleverest person; to say, like Ben Stokes and his charges, that whatever has happened in the past has nothing to do with them, whatever lessons the past may offer are irrelevant to them, because they are here now to author their own brilliant future singlehandedly. To the self-appointed heroes of the present, the past is the country of losers. As of right now though, the losers are watching from the mirror.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

The two teams reached the final despite the absence of their respective star players Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz in Bologna this week.And it was Italy who retained their title after Matteo Berrettini and Flavio Cobolli won their singles matches on Sunday. Berrettini beat Pablo Carreño Busta 6-3, 6-4 in the opening contest and an entertaining tussle between Cobolli and Jaume Munar followed in which the Italian charged back to win 1-6, 7-6 (5), 7-5.Berrettini served 13 aces as he raced through his match in one hour and 18 minutes.The 2021 Wimbledon finalist clinched the only break in the eighth game and went on to serve out the set. Little could separate the pair in the second, but Berrettini again found a break deep into the set to inch the Italians closer to victory.View image in fullscreenFlavio Cobolli recovered from a set down to beat Jaume Munar and seal the title.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images for ITFMunar, needing to win the second singles match to force a doubles decider, stormed through the opening set with two breaks of serve. The Spaniard also broke Cobolli in the opening game of the second, but the Italian immediately responded with a break of his own in the next and went on to win the tie-break. And Cobolli found the crucial break of serve in the 11th game of the deciding set before serving out the match to love to secure Italy’s success.Both teams were missing their key men, with Spain deprived of the injured world No 1, Alcaraz, and Italy without the world No 2, Sinner, who skipped the final to focus on preparing for next season.Explore more on these topicsDavis CupTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

She also won the final slalom of last season, giving her three World Cup victories in a row.Lara Colturi, the 19-year-old who skis for Albania but is the Italian-born daughter of Italy’s 2002 Olympic Super-G gold medallist Daniela Ceccarelli, finished second with Switzerland’s reigning world champion Camille Rast third.The top two were the same as in the season’sopening slalom in Levi, Finland, with Shiffrin 0.31 seconds faster than Colturi in the first leg and extending her advantage to 1.23 at the finish after also going quickest in the second run. The podium was also exactly the same as last year’s top three in the slalom at Gurgl, with Shiffrin celebrating her 99th win that time.“I had to push so hard but it was really nice with the sun on the second run,” said Shiffrin, whose total tally now features a record 66 World Cup slalom victories. “Last year I remember it was so dark so this was a really nice surprise. It was pretty much exactly how I expected. Not easy but I knew the others were pushing so there’s no choice, you have to go.”The race was Colturi’s 60th in the World Cup and she was surprised by her first back-to-back podium.“The snow was really soft and when I saw it, I had a first inspection and I thought ‘ah, it’s probably not my day,” she said.Croatia’s Zrinka Ljutic, who won last season’s slalom crystal globe, straddled a gate on the second run while Austria’s Katharina Liensberger, the Beijing 2022 Olympic silver medallist, failed to finish the first run.The next races on the women’s technical circuit are in Copper Mountain, Colorado, at the end of the month and Shiffrin was looking forward to some time at home.“I have to get some [giant slalom] training again and I’m really excited to go to Copper. I stay in my own bed for the first time during the season,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He told fans at Fukuoka Kokusai Center that he was glad that he was able to compete to the best of his abilities.“I am happy that I am able to achieve a goal of mine,” he said of his victory, which was also televised.Yavhusishyn, who arrived in Japan three years ago after fleeing Ukraine, has climbed the sumo ranks at record speed. The Japan Sumo Association will soon hold a special meeting to promote him to “ozeki”, the second highest ranking under “yokozuna”, or grand champion, national broadcaster NHK said.He competed in the world junior sumo championships as a teenager but left Ukraine after Russia’s February 2022 invasion. Yavhusishyn, who is listed at 6ft tall and 310lbs, arrived in Japan two months later and made a blistering start to his career, reaching sumo’s upper divisions in only a year and winning promotion to the fourth-highest rank.Yavhusishyn was born in Vinnytsia in central Ukraine and took up sumo at the age of seven, becoming a national champion when he was 17. His age meant he narrowly avoided Ukraine’s military draft for men aged 18 and older when war broke out and he sought refuge in Germany before moving to Japan. His parents stayed in Germany and he arrived in Japan knowing nothing of the language. He initially lived and trained with a Japanese sumo wrestler, Arata Yamanaka, who he made friends with at the world junior sumo championships.View image in fullscreenDanylo Yavhusishyn poses with his trophy after his victory.Photograph: JIJI PRESS/AFP/Getty Images“I only met him once in person and he welcomed me, even though I couldn’t speak a word of Japanese,”Yavhusishyn said in 2024. “I was surprised when he said OK.

It’s incredibly disrespectful. At every turn, no matter how many of us have come forward,” said Bensky.She was among the group of Epstein survivors who held up photos of their younger selves at theUS Capitol on Tuesdayas they campaigned for the release of the Epstein files. The group was elated when the billmoved through the House and then the Senate on Wednesday, before it was sent to Trump.“We’ve put so much time and effort into talking to congressional leaders, we’ve been talking to senators, we’ve done everything we possibly can and it feels a lot like America is on our side and has really heard us. What a beautiful moment for American democracy and instead [Trump] chooses to just make it divisive … It’s a double-edged sword,” Bensky said.She was a 17-year-old ballerina when she was recruited in 2004 to give Epstein massages at his New York townhouse. At the time, she was under the impression that Epstein had a medical background and would help her mother, who had a brain tumour.“I brought my mom’s scans to him and that was the day that basically everything changed. He said to me: ‘What are you going to do for me?’ He leveraged the scans and he threatened me: ‘The best anaesthesiologist won’t be on call for your mom if you don’t either procure more girls for me or start doing more around here,’” she recalled.It was after that, when Bensky had turned 18, that Epstein’s abuse escalated to rape, she said.“Coming out of that was really challenging and I disassociated a lot. I stopped looking at myself in leotard and tights and I stopped dancing for a while. I think that that completely changed the trajectory of my life,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I teach dance and the young girls and boys that I teach really have fuelled this fight for me because I just want to change it for them and make sure they never have to go through another thing like this.”Bensky now hopes that facilitators of the late financier’s abuse can be held to account with the publication of the remaining files, which the justice department has 30 days to release.“I hope that they do the right thing and release them in full. But at this point, we are very fearful of evidence going missing and major redactions,” Bensky said. “We just want people to be held to account. That’s it. The same way that the UK is doing.”Bensky pointed to the former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor beingstripped of his royal titlesover his relationship with Epstein as an example.“I think stripping Andrew of his title was such a huge step forward and I think that we need to see more things like that,” she said. “I think a lot of this is really systemically rooted and if we start taking away statues, monuments, scholarship awards - you know renaming the scholarship awards, making sure they’re in the right people’s names. It starts in very small places and then I think we can start to see real change in who we’re honouring in this country.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Instead, it produced warm words, with Trump even saying, “I feel very confident that he can do a good job” and adding, “I think he’s going to surprise some conservative people, actually.”2:55Key moments from the Trump-Mamdani Oval Office news conference – video wrapThe pairagreedto work together on housing, food prices and cost-of-living concerns, and bonded over a mutual love for New York. “We agreed a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump said in the Oval Office, sometimes jumping in to shield Mamdani from aggressive questioning from the press.“It was a conversation where we spoke about the need to deliver on this agenda,” Mamdani told NBC on Sunday, saying that he appreciated how the president took the time to tour him around the cabinet and point out the portraits of previous presidents. “We were not shy about the places of disagreement about the politics that has brought us to this moment and we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on.”Mamdani also addressed questions about his decision to retain police commissioner Jessica Tisch, initially hired by former mayor Eric Adams. “She has driven down crime across the five boroughs while starting to uproot corruption that was endemic in the top echelons of that department under Mayor Adams,” Mamdani said.Kevin Hasset, director of the National Economic Council, which works with the treasury secretary to push forward Trump’s economic agenda,praisedthe move on Sunday and said the White House was pleased with it.“We are really reassured that [Mamdani has] kept the police commissioner. In previous administrations in New York, we have seen law and order really go south,” Hassett told hostJake Tapperon CNN’s State of the Union.“Do the mayor-elect and I agree on everything? No, we don’t,” wrote Tisch in an email to rank-and-file officers, according to the New York Times. She has supported Adams’s plan to hire 5,000 more uniformed officers, whereas Mamdani has said he wants to keep the head count the same.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpZohran MamdaniTrump administrationUS politicsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

The official national news agency said three missiles were fired at the building.Late on Sunday, Hezbollah confirmed “the great commander” Tabatabai had been killed in “a treacherous Israeli attack on the Haret Hreik area in the southern suburbs of Beirut”, without specifying his position within the group.Videos showed damaged buildings in the densely populated Haret Hreik area of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold.Israel has launched increasingly frequent airstrikes in southern Lebanon this month, which it says are intended to thwart a military revival by Hezbollah in the hills north of the de facto border.The campaign is also designed to increase pressure on the Lebanese authorities and army to move faster to disarm the organisation, a key requirement of last year’s ceasefire deal.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told his cabinet before the strike that Israel would continue to fight “terrorism” on several fronts. “We will continue to do whatever is necessary to prevent Hezbollah from reestablishing its ability to threaten us,” he said.After the strike, his office said in a statement: “In the heart of Beirut, the IDF attacked the Hezbollah chief of staff, who had been leading the terrorist organisation’s buildup and rearmament. Israel is determined to act to achieve its objectives everywhere and at all times.”The IDF insisted on Sunday evening that it “remains committed” to the ceasefire.A senior US official said Israel did not notify Washington in advance about the strike, according to an Axios reporter who posted on X.They cited the official as saying the Trump administration was informed immediately after the strike, and a second senior official as saying Washington had known for days that Israel was planning to escalate strikes in Lebanon.Israel used widely banned cluster munitions in Lebanon, photos of remnants suggestRead moreTabatabai, 58, who joined Hezbollah as a teenager soon after its foundation in the early 1980s, escaped an Israeli assassination attempt in 2015. The US imposed sanctions on him a year later, identifying him as the commander of the group’s special forces in Syria and Yemen, andoffering a rewardof as much as $5m (£3.8m) for information leading to his detention.Tabatabai led elite Hezbollah fighters in support of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and is thought to have tutored Houthi forces in Yemen. The Houthis and Hezbollah have close relationships with Iran.Tabatabai escaped Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah’s senior commanders during the 2023-24 war triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 incursion into southern Israel. An Israeli airstrike in Beirut in September 2024 killed the group’s veteran leader,Hassan Nasrallah, and by the time of the ceasefire some weeks later almost it entire military leadership had been killed.Hezbollah says it has abided by requirements for it to end its military presence in the border region near Israel, and for the Lebanese army to deploy there.The Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, called on the international community to intervene firmly to stop Israeli attacks on the country. Beirut “reiterates its call to the international community to assume its responsibility and intervene firmly and seriously to stop the attacks on Lebanon and its people”, he said in a statement.Israel’s Haaretz newspaper told readers last week that the“immediate flash point”was “now in Lebanon, not Gaza”, while Amit Segal, a journalist close to Netanyahu’s coalition government, said “a dramatic escalation against Hezbollah” was “more likely than not”.Explore more on these topicsLebanonHezbollahIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke.’“And the first thing I thought was like, ‘Oh, here I am still copying Jamie Foxx,’” he joked,referring to Foxx’s stroke in 2023. “That’s really like the second thing. The first thing was like, ‘I’m letting everybody down.’ I know it’s not true.”Glover also revealed that he had broken one of his feet, then doctors found a hole in his heart, which required him to undergo surgery twice.“They say everybody has two lives and the second life starts when you realise you have one,” Glover said. “You got one life, guys, and I gotta be honest, the life I’ve lived with you guys has been such a blessing.”Glover, who has won five Grammy awards, has retired his Childish Gambino stage name after releasing his final album, Bando Stone & the New World.

When they arrived, they found Forrester unresponsive and she was declared dead at the scene.A heightened police presence remains in the area while inquiries continue.In a statement on Sunday, DCI Guy Elkins said: “Our thoughts are with Sarah’s friends and family at this awful time.“An investigation into her death is being led by our major crime investigation team and local residents will continue to see increased policing activity in the area.“A 13-year-old girl arrested on suspicion of murder has been bailed and I can confirm that we are not looking for anyone else in connection with Sarah’s death. We continue to urge people not to speculate on the incident.”A statement from Swindon-based mental health charity the Kelly Foundation, where Forrester worked, said everyone was “heartbroken at the sudden loss of our lovely Sarah”.It added: “She was completely committed to the charity and devoted to her two young children.“Sarah was pivotal in the work that we do here at the Kelly Foundation and her loss is a hugely traumatic event, not just for us and her colleagues but more especially for her children and family.“Sarah was an incredible person, kind, thoughtful, considerate, caring and funny and she embodied everything that we hope our charity is and can be.“She enjoyed her role with us and we all loved working with her, she will be truly, truly missed.“Out of respect for her family, we will not be making any further comment at this time.”The foundation was set up in memory of Kelly Jobanputra, a BBC Radio Wiltshire presenter who took her own life in 2019.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

People will have much less need to go to or stay in hospital if they can access diagnostic tests, outpatient appointments and treatment at home or in community settings, to reflect the changed nature of illness that an ageing population has brought, it says.Rosie Beacon, the author of the report, said: “It’s less about counting beds but about what hospitals do and how they do it. Hospitals can become smaller because you can give people the same standard – and often a better range – of care without them being physically present. That [would produce] lower long-term running costs and a system that’s financially sustainable.“Hospitals shouldn’t be made smaller just for the sake of it but because how and where we deliver secondary care no longer needs to be confined to a hospital bed.NHS failing to cut waiting times as promised in recovery plan, report warnsRead more“The natural consequence of a health service that succeeds in reducing hospital footfall, through better prevention and faster treatment, is that hospitals themselves will look smaller and different. Being honest about that isn’t radical; it’s simply facing up to what a modern, preventative NHS requires.”She added: “A smaller hospital footprint is simply the outcome of care becoming faster and more effective. It’s not about cutting services. It’s about delivering them in ways that are faster, more convenient and more financially sustainable.”The supply of general and acute beds in hospitals in England has fallen from 180,889 in 1987-88 to100,916 last month, NHS England figures show. Advances in treatment have given patients shorter stays, relieving pressure on beds. But hospitals have to create thousands of extra beds to help them cope with the usual “winter crisis”.Prof Joe Harrison, the chief executive of Milton Keynes university hospital NHS trust, said: “The only route to stabilising the service, improving access and quality of care, and relieving pressure on exhausted staff is radically rethinking what hospitals do and how they do it.”He said the scale of the crisis facing the NHS was so great that bosses “must be prepared to ask the difficult questions and take the difficult decisions” about how services are delivered.In a foreword to Re:State’s report, the chief executives of NHS Confederation and NHS Providers, which represent England’s 215 health trusts, endorse the case for radical reform of hospitals.While the NHS was “visionary” when it was created in 1948, “that founding vision feels increasingly fragile”, say Matthew Taylor and Daniel Elkeles. “Once revered globally, the NHS has become a service more characterised by waiting than by healing. A model designed in 1945 is not fit for 2025. As the most expensive part of the system, reimagining the hospital must be at the heart of service reforms.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said it was already shifting care out of hospitals as part of its “three big shifts” to revive the NHS.“Pioneering neighbourhood health centres will provide easier, more convenient access to a full range of healthcare services right on people’s doorsteps, stopping them from having to make lengthy trips to hospital,” the spokesperson said.“Community diagnostic centres – many of which are open 12 hours a day, seven days a week – let people get tests, checks and scans closer to home, again reducing strain on crowded hospitals.“The hospitals of the future are being built with more single-patient rooms and with careful consideration of demographics, as well as maximising the latest technology for greater efficiency and sustainability.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

That in turn is helping to further tear at society’s fabric by feeding prejudice.The letter says: “This guidance, which encourages police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile cases, is having a devastating impact on our country, harming our communities …“The guidance was offered as an attempt to dispel misinformation … In practice it has had the opposite effect, becoming a catalyst for crime reporting reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s – reviving a focus on race and migration status.”The policy change was decided in August by the College of Policing, which sets standards in policing, and the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council.Far-right social media accounts hadfalsely claimedthat the Southport attack in 2024 was committed by an asylum seeker, leading police to say the attacker was a British national. That fuelled largely far-right accusations of two-tier policing, namely that police were only releasing ethnicity and race details when suspects were not asylum seekers.The letter says: “Increasingly, a suspect’s ethnicity or country of origin appears to be treated as more important than the crime itself, or the experiences of victims, fostering a dangerous and misleading conflation between race, migration and criminality.”The call for the policy to be scrapped is supported by Amnesty International UK, the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, the chair of the Independent Scrutiny & Oversight Board for police, the National PoliceRaceAction Plan, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Jewish Women’s Aid, Liberty, the Muslim Council of Britain and Inquest.The research underpinning the concern of the groups compared use of terms such as asylum seeker in 2023, before the policy change, and then in 2025, after the change.“Our snapshot analysis … shows an increase in the use of descriptors such as certain foreign nationality, asylum status and ethnicity in crime reporting. For example, the term ‘asylum seeker’ in articles on serious crime increased by five times,” the letter says.“These findings indicate a pattern in which the ethnicity and migration status of people charged – or more broadly accused of unlawful behaviour – is increasingly communicated in ways that represent people of colour as inherently criminal.“This is extremely dangerous and may be seen to encourage the public to perceive ethnicity and migration status as significant factors in the commission of crime. There is … no credible academic evidence to support this perception. As a result, the public is being presented with a false and harmful impression that links ethnicity or migration status with criminality.”A College of Policing spokesperson said: “The police are operating in a challenging environment where there is now a requirement for the release of accurately, timely information to prevent a vacuum and the spread of mis- and disinformation.“The current interim guidance says information confirming the nationality or ethnicity of someone can be released if it is part of a high-profile or sensitive investigation where there is a policing purpose for doing so. This includes a risk to public safety such as rising community tension. There should also be a significant level of media or social media interest before the information is released.”Some forces have decided to release race and nationality details on arrest. One recent case was amass stabbing on a train, when British Transport Police (BTP) publicised details of two suspects they had arrested, saying both were black. One was charged and the other was released without charge, and the racial details dominated hours of coverage. Runnymede said other far more relevant details, such as how many knives were used in the attack, were not revealed.“Why was the number of weapons used not put out by the police, which is directly relevant to the crime, more so than the ethnicity and race of the suspects,” said Shabna Begum, the director of the Runnymede Trust.A BTP spokesperson said the weapons details was released later. “BTP chose to release the ethnicity and nationality of two arrested men in this high-profile case in the interests of transparency and to alleviate the spread of damaging misinformation and speculation,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsPoliceImmigration and asylumRacenewsShareReuse this content"

This month Paul McCartney released asilent two-minute 45 second trackof an empty studio on an album protesting against copyright grabs by AI firms as part of a campaign also backed by Kate Bush, Sam Fender, the Pet Shop Boys and Hans Zimmer.Elton John, meanwhile, called the UK government “absolute losers” over proposals to let tech firms use copyrighted works without permission and has called Kyle “a bit of a moron”.Kendall, who replaced Kyle in September, said that she and the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, “are right now, having a reset on this discussion. We are talking to the creative sector and AI sector together.”The platform exposing exactly how much copyrighted art is used by AI toolsRead moreCampaigners for the rights of artists, musicians and writers not to have their copyrighted works used as training data for large AI models, had voiced fears when Kendall appointed a special adviser in September who had previously said “whether or not you philosophically believe the big AI firms should compensate content creators, they in practice will never legally have to”.But Kendall said: “Views before you come to work for the government are not the views of the government. We’re going to find a deal that helps us move forward together.”She also said she recognised that many parts of the creative sector want transparency about whether their work has been used to train AI systems, which would be a key part of enabling them to be paid.After a $1.5bn (£1.15bn) legal settlement by Anthropic, one of the world’s biggest AI companies, a searchable database of about 500,000 books used to train its models was released last month so authors could find out if their work had been infected and claim payment of about $3,000.Beeban Kidron, a film director and crossbench peer who has battled in parliament to protect creatives’ rights, welcomed Kendall “making clear that she has recognised the need for creators to protect their property and livelihood”.But Lady Kidron said the government had “lost the trust of the entire creative community and the public, who overwhelmingly support the creative industry’s need to receive a fair day’s pay for their work”.An initial report on the government’s plans is expected before the end of the year, followed by a more substantial report by March 2026.Kidron called for the government to act now by no longer signing public sector deals with AI companies in disputes with copyright-holders, requiring AI companies to be transparent about what works they have trained their systems on and “they can make a commitment to respect copyright”.Kendall said: “I understand why … many creatives are urging us to act immediately because so much has happened already.“But we’ve got to get this right … there’s a lot of detail to work out here, but I believe it is possible to find a way forward that delivers for both because we don’t want to have to choose.”Explore more on these topicsRegulatorsLiz KendallArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertynewsShareReuse this content"

But the inquiry proved those companies were dishonest, so people have to make their own moral judgment.”He lives close to the tower block in west London where 72 people were killed by the 2017 blaze which was fuelled by combustible insulation and cladding that did not comply with regulations.Ed Daffarn from Grenfell United, who was a resident of the tower block and predicted the disaster on his blog, said: “I would call on any architect, designer, procurement manager in construction or the housing sector, any landlord who’s got to meet the energy performance certificates, or even if you’re just insulating your loft – do not use these companies.”All three companies were found by the public inquiry to have behaved with “systematic dishonesty” and “engaged in deliberate and sustained strategies to manipulate the testing processes, misrepresent test data and mislead the market”.Arconic, which made the plastic-filled cladding panels that were the main cause of the fire’s spread, “deliberately and dishonestly concealed from the market the true position” of the product it sold for use on Grenfell in relation to the way it reacted to fire.Kingspan, which made about 5% of the combustible foam insulation on the block, was found to have acted with “deeply entrenched and persistent dishonesty […] in pursuit of commercial gain coupled with a complete disregard for fire safety”.Celotex, which made most of the combustible foam insulation, was found to have “embarked on a dishonest scheme to mislead its customers and the wider market”.All three deny any wrongdoing.They were among seven organisations to face possible debarment from public contractsafter the government accepted all recommendations of the inquiry, beforethe process was paused“to prevent any impact on criminal investigations”.The Met police have said it is unlikely any charges relating to its investigation will be announced until late 2026 – almost a decade after the fatal blaze – at the earliest.Clarke said that the three companies he was boycotting were so big in the construction industry they had become “the default suppliers”, but that there were plenty of alternative insulation and cladding companies out there.He added that he found it “staggering” that many in the construction industry still were not fully aware of which companies were implicated and how.“Even after all of those deaths, after all the publicity, after the damning inquiry, the acknowledgment by government, it still amazes me that in the industry, people have gone, let’s just carry on. Morally, I find that really unacceptable. I couldn’t live with it, and I’m surprised that other companies do,” he said.In its latest accounts, Kingspan Insulation posted a pre-tax profit of £14.7m, and all the companies have continued to make yearly profits of millions of pounds in the years since the fatal blaze.“It doesn’t matter whether you’re building a huge government project, whether you’re refurbishing a tower block, or whether you’re doing a small-scale extension on the back of your house, don’t use their products,” Clarke said.A spokesperson for Arconic said the company “was a core participant in the public inquiry into the fire and fully supports efforts to better regulate the UK construction industry and improve safety. We have fully engaged in and cooperated with all the legal processes following the tragedy, and will continue to do so.”Kingspan has previously said it “has long acknowledged the wholly unacceptable historical failings that occurred in part of our UK insulation business” and that it has “emphatically addressed these issues”.Celotex previously said it had “reviewed and improved process controls, quality management and the approach to marketing within the Celotex business to meet industry best practice”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

She was sent to the psychiatric institute in 2018 after pleading guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in a deal with prosecutors to avoid prison.Geyser’s attorney, Tony Cotton, said on Sunday that he did not know what happened with his client and urged Geyser to turn herself in.“It’s in her best interest for her to turn herself in immediately and not continue with this course of action,” Cotton said in an Instagram video post where he addressed Geyser directly at times. “We don’t know any of the facts about what happened or who might have assisted her.”Authorities say Geyser and her friend, Anissa Weier, were 12 years old when they lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a suburbanMilwaukeepark after a sleepover. Geyser stabbed Leutner more than a dozen times while Weier egged her on. Leutner barely survived.The girls later told investigators that they attacked Leutner to earn the right to be Slender Man’s servants and they feared he would harm their families if they didn’t follow through.Slender Man was created online by Eric Knudsen in 2009 as a mysterious figure photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He grew into a popular bogeyman, appearing in video games, online stories and a2018 movie.Weier pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree intentional homicide. She was also sent to the psychiatric center and granted release in 2021.Explore more on these topicsWisconsinUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s still used as an adhesive today, sealing breaks in tools and pots.Ancient ‘chewing gum’ sheds light on stone age teenagers’ dietRead more“We even know [the gum chewer] had brown eyes and hair, which I love because it challenges the assumption that northern Europeans had fair hair and blue eyes. It’s such a relatable but profoundly remarkable thing.”Tartu University is analysing other historic artefacts from across Estonia including an 800-year-old cross depicting genitalia that makes a sound when worn.The metal cross has a hinged piece in the shape of a vulva that covers and knocks against an engraved penis design when moved around.Prof Heiki Valk told Hughes it showed how medieval Estonians integrated pagan fertility symbols with their new Christian faith, adding, “When you wear it, it makes a brilliant noise.”In the programme, Hughes also examined artefacts from a skeleton that was discovered in a 12th-century burial ground in the Estonian village of Kukruse.The “Kukruse lady” was in her 50s and buried with fine bronze and silver jewellery, food to eat in the afterlife, a sieve, daggers and a fertilised bird’s egg, which was discovered at her feet.Dr Ester Oras, the archaeologist who analysed the eggshell, said: “Someone decided that this particularly lady should have this fertilised egg as a grave good to be buried with her. Something to do with maybe some kind of Christian symbolism and fertilisation.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyGeneticsHistoryChannel 4EstonianewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump’s administrationwithdrew from the Paris climate agreementon the first day of his second term in office and has reversed many policies designed to tackle sexism, racism and homophobia.The White House spokesperson Anna Kelly accused Ramaphosa of “refusing to facilitate a smooth transition of the G20 presidency”.“This, coupled with South Africa’s push to issue a G20 leaders’ declaration, despite consistent and robust US objections, underscores the fact that they have weaponised their G20 presidency to undermine the G20’s founding principles,” she said.South Africa had offered to arrange for an equivalent “junior” diplomat to formally hand the G20 presidency to the US at the foreign ministry. Officials had stated it would breach protocol for Ramaphosa to give it to the US acting ambassador.South Africa’s foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, told reporters: “From us, the ball has moved. We are done. It’s up to them. If they want to come, we are available.”The 2026 summit is scheduled to take place at the Trump National Doral Miami golf resort, which is owned by the Trump Organization.Argentina, whose president, Javier Milei, skipped the summit, also refused to endorse the declaration. Its foreign minister, Pablo Quirno, said: “Specifically it addresses the longstanding Middle East conflict in a manner that fails to capture its full complexity.”The G20 communique stated: “We will work for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Ukraine, as well as ending other conflicts and wars around the globe.”The G20 was founded in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1999, with 19 nations and the European Union. The African Union wasadded in 2023.Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum were also absent from the summit. Putin is wanted by the international criminal court, to which South Africa is a signatory. Xi has delegated attending many international gatherings this year to China’s premier, Li Qiang.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsG20Cyril RamaphosaSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Users will be presented with a prompt stating “verify your age” in the app to begin the process.Age can be verified by ConnectID via an Australian bank account, by checking a government ID such as passport or driver licence, or through facial age estimation. The latter will require users to take a selfie that is analysed using technology provided by age-assurance company k-ID.Australia’s under-16s social media ban is weeks away. How will it work – and how can I appeal if I’m wrongly banned?Read moreUsers under 16 will be given the option before 10 December to download data such as chats, memories and videos. Their accounts will be locked from 10 December until the user turns 16 and chooses to reactivate their account by verifying their age.Accounts that are locked for more than three years and not verified will be deleted.Snapchat disagrees that it should be covered by the ban – it has argued the primary purpose of Snapchat is for messaging, which is otherwise exempt – but it will comply with the ban.“Snapchat is and has always been a visual messaging app, primarily used for connection with your closest friends and family,” a spokesperson said.“We know that for teens, maintaining friendships is a key contributor to happiness and well-being and are deeply saddened that young Aussies can no longer connect with their nearest and dearest via Snapchat.“However, even though we strongly disagree with the government’s assessment … we will disable accounts for users under 16 from December 10.”Snap is the second of the platforms to announce how the ban will be implemented, after Facebook and Instagram parent companyMeta last weekstarted alerting affected users.TikTok and Kick have said they will comply with the ban but have yet to outline what steps they will take to implement it.Reddit, Twitch, X, and YouTube have yet to state their position on the ban, and whether they will comply.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsSnapchatSocial mediaChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Europe’s largest deposits of lithium are in Cornwall, and the EU singled out the county’s tungsten mine for potential financial support this summer.The strategy follows a six-week standoff between China and the EU over the supply of chips used in the car industry, underlining how Beijing is willing to use trade in critical materials for political purposes.The UK and the US are now battling to reduce their dependence on China, but the production of rare earths and critical minerals can take years and hundreds of millions of pounds in investment.Lithium supplies exist all over Europe, but the raw material needs to be refined into lithium hydroxide, a crystal-like ingredient used to create the charge in car batteries.Europe’s only lithium hydroxide refinery, in Germany, hastaken five years to buildand £150m in investment, showing the scale of the funding needed.Last week the EU’s industry commissioner, Stéphane Séjourné, conceded that the bloc was far behind the US, which he said had “a business department that buys stocks of critical materials” before everyone else. “They often buy them from under our noses,” he said.Earlier this year, Britain struck a minerals cooperation deal with Saudi Arabia aimed at bolstering supply chains, opening doors for British firms and drawing fresh investment into the UK. Rare-earth minerals are essential for smartphones and electric vehicles and increasingly crucial for building datacentres that power artificial intelligence.The UK’s strategy seeks to ensure no more than 60% of any one critical mineral comes from a single partner country by 2035, according to a statement.Starmer described critical minerals as “the backbone of modern life and our national security” and argued that boosting domestic production and recycling would help shield the economy and support efforts to lower living costs.The government said the UK currently produced 6% of its critical mineral needs domestically. Under the plan, it wants to expand domestic extraction and processing, with a particular focus on lithium, nickel, tungsten and rare earths. It aims to produce at least 50,000 tonnes of lithium in the UK by 2035.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCritical mineralsMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

As you traipse from one commissioning meeting to the next, pitching your passion project on the history of mime or the secret life of snails, you can almost hear the words before they’re spoken: “Got any other ideas?” Preferably something with a body count.I had just begun making documentaries in 2015, when the double whammy of HBO’sThe Jinxand Netflix’sMaking a Murdererbrought true crime back to the dead centre of popular culture. Positioned as social justice projects as much as murder mysteries, those shows seemed to herald a new beginning for the genre. Soon enough, though, they gave way to a steady stream of interchangeable offerings, many of them organised into reproducible formats such as Netflix’sConversations With a Killerfranchise, each season of which is built round a long-lost interview with a notorious serial killer, unearthed to order.Nonetheless, I wasn’t entirely hostile to the trend. Having long been a voracious consumer of true-crime films and TV shows, I was drawn to the puzzle-solving aspect of the genre: the way clues slot together over the course of the running time and make a neat resolution feel tantalisingly close at hand, even when we know the case in question remains unsolved.View image in fullscreenA Wanted bulletin and letters sent to the San Francisco Chronicle by the man who called himself Zodiac.Photograph: Eric RisbergAPI still remember my first viewing of the French true-crime series The Staircase, broadcast by the BBC in 2005. (Later, with the true-crime boom in full swing, it was acquired and extended by Netflix, then adapted into a dramatic miniseries by HBO.) As revelation after revelation seemed to point towards the innocence of novelist Michael Peterson, accused of killing his wife Kathleen, I became convinced he would be acquitted in the finale – despite having already looked him up online and found him to be imprisoned in North Carolina. Such is the power of the puzzle.Of course, I had misgivings about a puzzle forged from the lives – and horrific deaths – of real people, but I reasoned that making something entertaining might be a good way to put something meaningful in front of a large audience; that true crime’s familiar tropes and rigid formulas could perhaps be put in the service of something more ambitious. The possibilities swirled in my head as I allowed myself to imagine a true-crime documentary of my own.I had stumbled upon a memoir called The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up, written by a recently deceased California highway patrol officer named Lyndon Lafferty. In the book, Lafferty details his decades-long quest to bring the infamous Bay Area serial killer to justice, following a serendipitous encounter with his suspect at a highway rest stop.The stock reply to any ethical complaint is a simple one: that all of this is in the service of the victimsIt wasn’t the first book I’d read about the Zodiac Killer, who murdered at least five people during a killing spree in the late 1960s, and guaranteed his place in the annals of 20th-century crime by sending a series of enigmatic letters and cryptograms. That was cartoonist-turned-investigator Robert Graysmith’s 1986 best-seller Zodiac, which I’d discovered via David Fincher’s acclaimed 2007 film adaptation. But Lafferty’s version was by far the most idiosyncratic, filled with outlandish twists and dramatic cliffhangers alongside the core components of a true-crime yarn: a dogged investigator who refuses to be swayed from his mission; a trail of clues unearthed across decades; and a killer still at large.View image in fullscreenThe book that inspired Shackleton’s film.As I pursued the rights to adapt The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up for the screen, the film began to make itself in my head. I pictured a mysterious cold open, re-enacting Lafferty’s fateful rest stop encounter in a series of tense closeups. From there, the title sequence would thrum into life, offering a patchwork of sepia-toned images foreshadowing the sinister tale to come. I envisioned the faded diner where I’d interview former cops, veteran reporters and anyone else who was still knocking around after 50 years.I was determined to resist the confirmation bias that pervades so many theories of the case, and include evidence that pointed away from Lafferty’s subject as well as towards him. But after half a century of investigation by law enforcement and amateur sleuths alike, there was vastly more evidence than I could ever hope to fit in a feature film, and it soon became hard to tell on what basis I was making my selections. There are half a dozen different accounts of the killer’s height alone, and the one that matched Lafferty’s suspect was as good as any other. This mountain of investigative paperwork renders almost any crime a candidate for the true-crime treatment.Are we all simply captive to an insatiable, voyeuristic appetite for the macabre?As long as there have been criminal codes, people have told stories about their violation, and the relatively brief history of cinema has been littered with morbid tales from the start. Motion picture pioneer Siegmund Lubin dramatised the sensational 1906 murder of architect Stanford White at Madison Square Garden in his film The Unwritten Law, and had the film on screens within a year of the killing.The modern true-crime film, however, has a shorter lineage, taking most of its aesthetic and narrative cues from Errol Morris’s 1988 classic documentary The Thin Blue Line. That film, which re-examined the shooting of a Dallas police officer a decade prior, set the mould for the foggy re-enactments and speculative timelines that have become de rigueur in both the genre’s lowliest daytime TV offerings and its Emmy-winning prestige dramas (and helped collapse the distance between the two). It also boasts the honour to which all true crime aspires, having successfully affected the outcome of the case at its centre.That it did so while upholding consistent ethical standards is perhaps its least imitated quality. Even those few true-crime works that have likewise changed the course of judicial history have done so within a far looser moral framework: The Jinx managed to elicit a confession from suspected serial killer Robert Durst, but rearranged his words in post-production for fear they weren’t damning enough.The stock reply to any ethical complaint about true crime’s methods is a simple one: that all of this is in the service of the victims, and that occasional moral transgressions are a small price to pay to deliver closure to them and their families. The queasy tone of so much modern true crime lies in the jarring contrast between the self-righteousness of that claim and the lurid creative choices it’s used to justify.View image in fullscreenThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst.Photograph: HBOIn the CBS miniseries The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey, criminal behavioural analyst (and self-proclaimed victim advocate) Laura Richards advances the theory that six-year-old JonBenét may have been killed by her preteen brother, who has always denied this claim and was never charged with the killing. To prove the viability of this scenario, she has a child actor slam a flashlight down on a skull wrapped in pig skin and a blond wig. As the resulting fracture is held up for comparison with a photo from Ramsey’s autopsy, Richards assures us that this macabre endeavour is a necessary one: “This is quite hard to do, but we do need to do this, to see what it looks like.”Those for whom all of this is supposedly being done may or may not appreciate it. Netflix’s glossy 2022 miniseriesMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Storyjustified its gruesome re-enactment of Dahmer’s crimes on the basis that its sympathies lay ultimately with his victims’ families, but the producers didn’t manage to contact any of them. Several subsequently spoke out against the show, including Eric Perry, a relative of Dahmer victim Errol Lindsey, who told the Los Angeles Times: “We’re all one traumatic event away from the worst day of your life being reduced to your neighbour’s favourite binge show.” Two further Monster series, on the Menendez brothers and Ed Gein, would follow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Dark clouds hang over the communities where terrible crimes took place, we’re told, and it’s our duty to confront these latent collective traumas, however painful the task may be. I could already hear my future interviewees darkly intoning about the sinister aura of Vallejo, California – the centre of the Zodiac Killer’s crime spree – as I arrived there in August 2022 to scout locations.I found myself describing shots, lengthy scenes and the entire narrative arc of my unrealised (and now unrealisable) filmThe reality was more mundane. Not only did daily life in Vallejo seem largely indifferent to events that took place half a century earlier, but most people I encountered weren’t even aware of the city’s morbid claim to fame. In a cab from the airport, my driver was far more interested in telling me about Vallejo’s notable rappers Mac Dre, E-40, Nef the Pharaoh)than its notorious killers. Gazing out of the window, I imagined the moody lens filter I’d need to sell the place as indelibly marked by its gruesome past.I would soon discover it to be a moot point. Two days later, while eating lunch in a diner that I thought might make a suitable filming location, I got an email informing me that negotiations for the rights to Lafferty’s book had fallen through. No specific reason was given, but I immediately wondered if someone with deeper pockets, or a more impressive CV, had discovered the book’s obvious cinematic potential and made a better offer.I wandered out into the street and paused to consider where that left me. Without the Sturm und Drang of Lafferty’s five-decade crusade for justice, the Zodiac Killer case was just a set of facts available to anyone with an internet connection. Without Lafferty’s suspect to loom large over its inhabitants, Vallejo was just a sleepy city with a Six Flags amusement park. I looked around at my surroundings. The sun was high in the sky and there wasn’t a dark cloud in sight.It wasn’t the first time I’d had a project fall through, and I assumed I’d simply lick my wounds for a few weeks before moving on to new ideas. Back in London, however, I was unable to get Lafferty’s story off my mind, and soon found myself describing individual shots, lengthy scenes and the entire narrative arc of the unrealised (and now unrealisable) film to anyone who would listen. If the uncanny familiarity of true crime had made the project easy to conceptualise, it now made it impossible to forget. Eventually, that frustration started to seem like an equally worthy subject.In the film I ultimately made, unimaginatively titled Zodiac Killer Project, I describe the doomed film beat by beat, in real time, over footage of the everyday Vallejo scenes that met me when I first arrived in the Bay Area. Although I allow myself a few fleeting recreations of true crime’s reflexive visual cliches – shell casings clattering to the ground, crime-scene tape stretching out into the distance – the film is shaped largely by what’s not on screen. As I fill in the blanks of each scene, and explain the thinking behind the project, I repeatedly hit up against the unresolved ethical questions and narrative contrivances at the heart of the project, and the genre at large.The film is both an elegy for my unmade true-crime entry and an attempt to grapple with true crime itself, as it continues its seemingly intractable takeover of the documentary industry. If those goals sound contradictory, they reflect the mixed feelings I’ve observed in so many of my peers, who have endeavoured to make meaningful, ethical true-crime films even as they’ve wondered aloud whether true crime might be beyond redemption.Zodiac Killer Project review – true crime critique rescues aborted documentaryRead morePerhaps that ambivalence explains why the genre has become so keen to indict its own viewers. Everything from queasy high-budget drama serial Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story to mischievous docuseriesDon’t F**k With Catscomes complete with a sequence questioning the appeal of true crime itself. Are viewers indulging their worst fears as a kind of exposure therapy, they ask with sober concern, or wallowing in the misery of others to feel better about themselves? Or are we all simply captive to an insatiable, voyeuristic appetite for the macabre?Whatever the case, the documentary industry itself is off the hook. The countless true-crime films, TV shows, books and podcasts released week after week are merely an attempt to keep up with demand. Or so we keep insisting. But every meeting in which I find myself lured back into the murky waters of true crime, having very publicly laid those ambitions to rest, suggests another possibility: that the legions of true-crime fans are just desperately trying to keep up with our supply.Zodiac Killer Project is released in cinemas on28November.

As Booker winner George Saunders puts it, “Chekhov – shall I be blunt? – is the greatest short story writer who ever lived.” Novelists from Ann Patchett to Zadie Smith cite him as an inspiration. His plays The Seagull, Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and The Cherry Orchard still pack out theatres internationally. In the past year alone, Andrew Scott wowed audiences in his one-man Vanya for London’s National Theatre and Cate Blanchett took on the role of Arkadina in The Seagull at the Barbican. But how much did you know about his silly side?Anton Chekhov: Earliest Stories offers the first comprehensive translation in English of the stories, novellas and humoresques that the Russian author wrote in the early 1880s. And it is supremely juvenile in the best way. The reason many of these stories are now appearing in translation for the first time is because, explains editor Rosamund Bartlett, they have never been regarded by commercial publishers as “worthy” of Chekhov’s reputation. They are too childishly comical. During the translation process, she says, “we would just collapse in fits of giggles”.Bartlett, the author of acclaimed biographies of Chekhov and Tolstoy, and her co-editor Elena Michajlowska, a UK-based Russian film-maker, run the Anton Chekhov Foundation, a charity whose starry patrons include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Stoppard and Kenneth Branagh. The foundation was originally set up to preserve Chekhov’s White Dacha in Yalta. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 this work was no longer possible, so instead they came up with the “crazy, idealistic idea” of sourcing 80 volunteer translators across the globe – from school students to retired academics – to translate these previously unseen stories.He told his editor that he doubted any of his stories would ‘survive in people’s memory for even a decadeWritten by Chekhov between the ages of 20 and 22, they are full of experimental wordplay, nonsense names and onomatopoeiac idiocy, from the village of Eaten-Pancakes (“Bliny-S’edeny”) in the opening story, Letter to a Learned Neighbour, to railway stations called Crash, Bang, Wallop, Run for Your Life and Swindler Town in On the Train, and a character called Second Lieutenant Zyumbumbunchikov in Before the Wedding (it means nothing, but say it aloud and it’s genius).These 58 stories, written under numerous pseudonyms, are little known, even among experts, says Bartlett. “Chekhov is better known as a writer of stories in Russia than of plays, and these stories remind us that he began as a humorist,” she says. “Not all of them are funny, or even intended to make us laugh, but a great many are totally frivolous – as one would expect from a 20-year-old medical student just trying to earn a few kopecks writing for comic journals.”Chekhov’s father had recently been declared bankrupt, so he was paying for his own education while also supporting the rest of his family. He wanted to conserve his real name for publication in respected scientific journals. Within a few years, however, it had become evident that – whether he liked it or not – he was a writer and his writing was worth taking seriously. By the mid 1880s, he had formulated the now legendary idea that medicine would be his “lawful wedded wife” and writing his mistress. (“When I’ve had enough of one, I can go and spend the night with the other.”)Chekhov was never a fan of his own work, whether prose or plays. He was modest about even his most famous and beloved short stories The Lady With the Dog (about a love affair in Yalta), Ward No 6 (about a doctor who is sick of his profession) and The Darling (about a woman who is ludicrously co-dependent, long before the term was invented). After a disastrous first outing of The Seagull in 1896 he was so mortified that he fled the theatre: “I shallnevereither write plays or have them acted.” (The play was staged by Konstantin Stanislavski in 1898 to great acclaim.) In 1888, he wrote to his editor that he doubted any of his stories would “survive in people’s memory for even a decade”. His doubts never made him less prolific. In 1884 alone – the year he graduated as a doctor – he published more than 100 stories. By the time he died in 1904 of tuberculosis at the age of 44, that number had climbed to more than 500.This collection is published at a fragile cultural moment. Ukrainian writers including Oksana Zabuzhko, Olesya Khromeychuk and Oleksandr Mykhed have argued for a critical re-evaluation of Russian literature – and for more space for Ukrainian voices and culture. “The revulsion many Ukrainians feel now for Russian literature due to the war is understandable,” says Bartlett. “But even those who repudiate it often make an exception for Chekhov, for good reason.”The young Chekhov and his brothers would stage amateur productions of plays in Ukrainian – the language was part of his birthrightCrucially, Chekhov does not belong to Putin’s Russia, she says. “He was never an imperialist, he couldn’t stand the jingoism of a writer like Dostoevsky, and the country is not littered with statues of him. Chekhov was a quarter Ukrainian himself, and grew up in Taganrog, a town historically part of Ukraine. During his childhood he and his brothers used to stage amateur productions of plays in Ukrainian – the language was part of his birthright. Chekhov occasionally used Ukrainian sayings, and we have highlighted them and explained their meaning in the annotations.”Bartlett suggests that it shouldn’t be a case of reading “either/or”: “Increasing our familiarity with Ukrainian writers should not have to exclude the possibility of discovering new works by Chekhov. We need to keep reading, and read more.” Zyumbumbunchikov can’t be a bad place to start.Anton Chekhov: Earliest Stories: Stories, Novellas, Humoresques, 1880–1882, edited by Rosamund Bartlett and Elena Michajlowska, is published by Cherry Orchard.Explore more on these topicsAnton ChekhovFictionPublishingShort storiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yes,Lewis Carroll’s children’s classic is rich in novelty, wit and delight. But yes, too, its structure is episodic and its protagonist lacks agency. Stuff just happens to Alice, one thing after another: colourful but not dramatic.Carroll purists would surely disagree, but in Gallus in Weegieland, Johnny McKnight makes a better fist of it than most. His version might divert from the original with a story about a girl travelling from Glasgow’s bougie West End to working-class Dennistoun, where she falls in love with a boy-rabbit, but it also gives this Alice Pleasance Liddell a motivation and an adversary.Being a millennial, she is on a journey; in this case, to find bravery, imagination and love (and ideally a dance certificate). This she will achieve only by winning a good-versus-evil battle with Queenie of Hearts (an ebullient Louise McCarthy, the closest this panto has to a dame).Newcomer Jorgey Scott-Learmonth makes a radiant Alice. With the relentless positivity of Ellie Kemper inUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, she is blind to the threat of the execution-happy Queenie and winningly deserving of the affections of Star Penders’s immature boy-rabbit. Their inevitable kiss is hilariously delayed for most of the show.View image in fullscreenGags … Catriona Faint, centre, as Hatter.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicMcKnight, who is currently playing the dame at theMacrobert, Stirling, has spruced up his 2017 script to include gags about Ozempic medication, new Pitlochry Festival theatre directorAlan Cumming(himself a former Tron panto writer) and Celia Imrie farting onCelebrity Traitors. It’s not big, it’s not clever, but it is funny.So too are director Sally Reid’s company, completed not only by Catriona Faint, on superbly deadpan form as Hatter, and Marc Mackinnon, as a laughably lugubrious Honey the Caterpillar, but also understudies Jessica Donnelly and Aidan MacColl giving extra power to Ross Brown’s upbeat songs. It is all played out on a set by Kenny Miller that, with its clashing black-and-white stripes and checks, is somewhere between a liquorice mint and adazzle ship. It adds to the disorientation of a deliriously daft show.At the Tron theatre, Glasgow, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatrePanto seasonTron theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Allen does a capable impression, nailing the voice and looking every bit as socially awkward as May but the preternatural aspects are taken further to make her seem like a Tory politician of the zombie apocalypse, walking stiffly with arms dangling in front.She takes Nikhil through her 10 steps to Britishness – Erin Guan’s stage set makes these steps literal along with dangling props and a towering screen on which dates are flashed. Its central idea of a phantom May is an original one, perkily staged with bursts of music and good sparring dialogue between Nikhil and his bestie, Jyoti (Tanya Katyal), a trainee lawyer and activist with a keen sense of social injustice. Their repartee brings the humour and sting rather than the saggy jokes on Britishness and assimilation which are all about keeping calm and carrying on, a love of queuing and talking about the weather. Nikhil sounds like a malfunctioning Richard Curtis character as he apes British banter. It is all way too familiar in its stiff upper lipness to cut deeply and you just don’t believe in his conversion.Under the direction of Natasha Kathi-Chandra, its staging brings clunky dreamlike interludes. Characters come on in smiley-face masks to enact them and they are not as sinister as they ought to be.The drama begins in 2013, a significant date for India when the legality of homosexuality was overturned. An adjunct to the main story is the rejection of Nikhil’s homosexuality by his parents, a serious issue that seems nothing more than a useful way of leaving him isolated rather than being explored more fully.View image in fullscreenIsolated … Taraash Mehrotra as Nikhil in I Dream of Theresa May.Photograph: Adam Razvi/Tara theatreIf the nation had a home secretary of Indian origin things would be so different, Nikhil says at one point, and it gets a laugh for its ironies. It seems as if Nikhil might turn towards politics himself by the end. That would make an interesting play (The Estate, at the National Theatre’s Dorfman trod just this ground) and May here makes the point that Nikhil is a natural conservative – wealthy, well-educated, un-unionised.May’s citizens of the world speech – made after her elevation to prime minister – was, in fact, all about globetrotting elites rather than those subject to today’s anti-immigrant moral panic. So the drama seems rather historic, given all that has come to pass since. Her speech seems positively tame compared to Nigel Farage, Reform and the mainstreaming of anti-immigrant fervour today.At Tara theatre, Earlsfield, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatrePolitical theatreImmigration and asylumTheresa MayreviewsShareReuse this content"

I arrived to find the Pennines under a thick blanket of cloud and the temperature hovering around zero. So it’s just as well that music is a largely indoor pursuit: since 1978, autumn here has meant the annual influx of big names in experimental and avant garde music for theHuddersfield Contemporary Music festival. Once a draw for postwar heavyweights includingKarlheinz Stockhausen,Olivier MessiaenandJohn Cage, the HCMF remains the UK’s largest international festival dedicated to new music, with more than 30 world and UK premieres on this year’s programme.The opening night featured three. In Huddersfield Town Hall, London-based Explore Ensemble sat in a pool of spotlights, the magnificent Victorian space made intimate. A new version of Canon Mensurabilis by Lithuanian composer Rytis Mažulis saw repetitive shimmers of microtonal dissonance interrupted by sparse octaves and fifths. The performance’s astonishing precision blurred the line between acoustic sound and an electronic track that gradually took over. Bryn Harrison’s The Spectre … Is Always Already a Figure of That Which is to Come worked a still more persuasive magic. Opening with what sounded like a creaking seesaw scored for chamber ensemble, shards of acoustic material were followed by ghostly echoes on a prerecorded electronic track. There were beautiful details – rough shivers of violin tremolo, flutters of bass clarinet, pedal-washed piano circling – but the work’s ultimate payoff came in its longer arc. The feedback loop gradually reversed so that the musicians responded to their electronic counterparts – the process of haunting complete and utterly compelling.View image in fullscreenBlurring lines … the spotlit Explore Ensemble.Photograph: Point Of ViewThe late-night concert saw venerable French outfit Dedalus Ensemble present the UK premiere of Motor Tapes by this year’s HCMF composer in residence Sarah Hennies. A subtly weighted drum roll launched an hour-long exploration of rhythm and timbre inspired by a study of human brain activity. An array of individual effects – knuckle-knocks, mouthy squelches and chinks of metal-on-metal – phased gently across the ensemble. A lengthy sequence in which the musicians applied milk frothers to various surfaces sounded like being in a room full of miniature jackhammers. By the time the piece ended with rapid switches between hushed plastic scrunching, key shaking and twig rattling – a dead ringer for an audience member digging in their bag – several people around me had nodded off.Sampling the range of what counts as “new music” is, of course, one of the pleasures of HCMF. Ninety this year, with albums of his music lodged permanently in the classical charts, Estonian composerArvo Pärtis hardly avant garde. But the Carice Singers’ performance of his Sarah Was Ninety Years Old in their lunchtime programme was a welcome reminder of Pärt’s daring. Using only four pitches, three voices, a percussionist and an organ, the piece lapses repeatedly into silence – managed with absolute calm by conductor George Parris. Where the Pärt demanded fearless solo singing, the UK premiere of Žibuoklė Martinaitytė’s Aletheia showcased the lucid, full-bodied sound and fine-grained blend of what has become one of the UK’s most adventurous and accomplished choirs.Huddersfield Contemporary Music festival continues until 30 NovemberExplore more on these topicsClassical musicHuddersfield contemporary music festivalExperimental musicYorkshireChoral musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Staged at theBethlem Museum of the Mind, in the world’s oldest psychiatric hospital, in south-east London, Kindredwill explore the power of communities to make people feel comforted as well as isolated.Morning Group by the artistCharlotte Johnson Wahl,the late mother of Boris Johnson, painted when she was a patient at the Maudsley hospital, shows her horror of group therapy sessions.

It’s important people find what works for them,” she said.Johnson Wahl’s work “is very clearly a negative experience of group therapy”, Raybone said. “She was quite horrified by it and found it very intrusive. She has painted herself as the lady with the red hair. And has this look of horror and almost kind of ghostliness.”View image in fullscreenGareth McConnell, The Forth Universalist Society, New York, 2005, from a series of photographs of community meeting rooms.Photograph: Gareth McConnell/SorikaMcConnell’s photographs show rooms before community filled them. He said: “I sat in my first ever Narcotics Anonymous meeting in Wickham Park House [the now defunct detox unit at Bethlem Maudsley] in 1999 while undergoing a 28-day treatment plan for chronic intravenous poly-drug use. It was a room not dissimilar to the ones I later photographed – broken plastic chairs, lino floor, strip lighting – but, as I later came to realise, it was temporarily pervaded by the power of love, induced by the ritual/ceremony/meeting that took place.”Mud, who has lived experience of borderline personality disorder and psychosis, said: “I firmly believe in the healing benefits of support from a community that understands and has been through similar things. I don’t think I’d be on my recovery journey today if it weren’t for other people helping me along the way.”Other works on display include a large oil painting, The Group, by the late artist and art therapist Charles Lutyens; David Chick’s intricate People Trying to Reach Me (1986); Holding on to Daddy (2016) by the photographer Benji Reid, an image that won the Wellcome Trust photography prize 2020 in the mental health single image category; and the vibrant ceramics of the Chilean artist and former prisoner of conscience Bibi Herrera, who spent time in treatment at Bethlem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a child I was a fussy eater, with meat and carbs being the mainstays, but as I got older I found it harder to justify eating meat. A lifelong animal lover and one of those annoying people who jokes about their “connection to animals”, I never missed an opportunity to pet a neighbourhood dog or say hello to a group of cows in a field.So, going into my teenage years, I knew that eating meat was not really compatible with my way of thinking. But like most I found it easy enough to put those concerns to one side when I was scoffing a Greggs steak bake. Until at 15 I got the nudge I needed to take the leap into vegetarianism.It came in the unlikely form of an animated film aimed at five- to 10-year-olds: Chicken Run. I have always had a special attachment to theAardmananimation, centred on a group of chickens’ desperate attempt to escape the farm where the evil owner Mrs Tweedy is planning to turn them all into pies. The film was released the year I was born and is regularly quoted in my family home thanks to its wholesome humour and charming characters: Ginger, the savvy political strategist; Bunty, the strong-willed mother hen; and my personal favourite, Babs, the salt-of-the-earth hen who is always knitting. “I don’t want to be a pie,” she cries at one point, “I don’t even like gravy.”But at the age of 15 my attitude towards what I had previously viewed as an endearingly silly comedy suddenly changed. When I sat down to rewatch the childhood classic, my niggling doubts about my meat-eating habits became impossible to ignore. Suddenly I saw Chicken Run for what it really was: a battle between the workers (chickens) and the business owner (Mrs Tweedy). The hardworking hens lay eggs day and night and see no rewards from the profit of their work, only to be degraded even further when Mrs Tweedy sees that they could be more profitable in their death by feeding the people of Britain’s insatiable appetite for pies.It’s strange to view your childhood favourite film and realise you’ve become the villainIt was Mrs Tweedy’s husband who inspired my actual moral reckoning. Despite his main role as a dim-witted sidekick, Mr Tweedy recognises the chickens are intelligent and organised enough to plan a revolt. Rewatching the film, I saw myself in his shoes: someone with the knowledge of animals’ value and intelligence but without the guts to do anything about it.It is strange to view your childhood favourite film and realise you’ve become the villain. For all that I was supportive of these fictional claymation chickens in their escape from a cruel gravy-filled fate, in real life I was feeding into the values of the Tweedys in my guilty consumption of pies. Watching such clearcut hero/villain films, you usually want to identify with the hero and their struggle, and Aardman did such a good job depicting the lead hen Ginger that I knew I would never eat a chicken – or any animal – again.A vegan morality tale? Chicken Run sequel puts factory farming in spotlightRead moreI can’t pretend that it was the only factor in my dietary decision. I had been learning about battery-farmed hens at school and feeling increasingly aware that my animal-loving tendencies were not compatible with my meat-eating habits. But it was Chicken Run that was the final straw.I cut out all meat immediately, a shock to my entirely carnivorous family. Although we shared a love for Chicken Run, no one followed my lead. It was hard to explain to people at the time: even just 10 years ago vegetarian alternatives were limited, and I was lucky that my parents were supportive. I never really confessed the role of these fictional chickens in my decision, prioritising environmental concerns and a love for real-life animals in my explanations. To this day, when people ask me why I don’t eat meat, I feel people are willing me to say it’s a healthy lifestyle choice rather than a question of morality.Last year, the film was revived in the Netflix sequel Dawn of the Nugget, a film so powerful that its director, Sam Fell, stopped eating chicken nuggets. Despite my initial wariness after key voice characters were recast, the sequel won me over and validated my dietary decision. Highlighting the horrors of meat production, Mrs Tweedy tries to turn all the chickens on her farm into chicken nuggets, revealing the heartlessness that comes from viewing living beings solely as sources for human consumption.This year marks my 10th anniversary of becoming a vegetarian and 25 years since Chicken Run’s release. I have seen the film every year since, watching with pride knowing that I’m on the side of the hens, plasticine or otherwise.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

I’d just broken up with my boyfriend and to boost my ego, I decided to put on a skirt that was probably a bit too short and a pair of heels that were definitely too high. The stiletto heel was about 13cm tall – crazy! – but oh, how I loved those shoes.I really shouldn’t have been wearing those shoes on public transport, especially not on a train. I remember how difficult it was to walk across the platform and how worried I was that I was going to go hurtling on to the tracks. I was already regretting my life choices at this point, but I successfully managed to totter my way off the train at Oxford station and start walking down what were then very steep stairs, holding on to the handrail for dear life with every step.The kindness of strangers: a surfer whose face I never saw saved me from drowning in a ripRead moreI was doing a good job of staying upright and dignified, until a surge of people came up the steps and rushed towards me. I kept clutching the handrail until I saw an elderly woman coming up the same side as me.I let go so that she would be able to pass, then stepped to the side and immediately lost my footing. In an instant I knew I was going to go down and take everyone on the stairs out with me, like a bowling ball claiming a strike.But I didn’t fall. Someone grabbed my arm and held me steady, catching me before the disaster. They held me upright and helped me walk down to the bottom of the stairs.At the bottom, I turned to thank them, but they were already gone – swept away by the crowd. They hadn’t waited around for a thank you or an apology, they’d just done a purely good deed and got on with their day. My mysterious hero saved not just me, but everyone else on the stairs at Oxford station that day.I never wore stupid high heels like that on public transport again. I learned my lesson and thanks to that good samaritan, only my pride was damaged.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Is this really true?Jamila, via emailSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyThe original quote is from the Robert Frost poem Mending Wall and profoundly misunderstood. Instead of an argument for strong barriers and isolation from those nearby, it describes the bonds that neighbours forge and strengthen while working in tandem to repair a stone fence in the woods. The sweat and toil they share nurtures their relationship and ties to each other and their place. The quote is about the opposite of barriers. It is about sharing and engaging with your community.WarOnSantaFrost meant the opposite. He was being Ironic.Pip Strachan, Nova Scotia, by emailMore about the importance of acknowledging boundaries. Obviously, a fence is a clear boundary, but we have other boundaries as well which need to be respected. The poem, which meditates on the axiom, is about rebuilding a failing wall as a joint effort with his neighbour, musing on the necessity of the wall, which requires effort to maintain it, and suggesting that the repeated axiom inhibits discussion about the need for the wall. Which I guess, since this is a US citizen writing, might be asking whether the values of modern America were inferior to those of its original inhabitants?NotTheProfessorFrost’s poem Mending Wall critiques the facade of community. Fences are typically used to divide rather than to include, and thus to be a “good neighbour” is more pejorative than prescriptive.DorkaliciousThe cost of solar panels has fallen so dramatically in mainland Europe that building fences out of solar panels is now as cost effective as buying fence panels. So good fences make cheap electricity!Randomusername222The fence has nothing to do with it. If you have reasonable people as neighbours, you’ll find a way no matter the fence. If one neighbour is impossible, they’ll find a way no matter the fence.NoahDeereI used to deal with neighbour disputes. There were some where boundaries had been removed and they were nearly impossible to resolve.As in relationships, physical boundaries are very important and if not held, they can be extremely difficult to re-establish.hutchmeupMy memory of 60 years ago, in Moordown, Bournemouth, was that every garden in our long road was more than adequately separated by a hedge, full length, both sides. Animals crept underneath, and birds nested within. Enough said.DinnerthiefHa, an interesting one for a naturist … we have neighbours on either side who can, with very slight effort, see into our garden. I’ve asked over the years if they want more screening because of the summertime nudity and they both said independently they couldn’t care less.NickEMI have a fully enclosed backyard, so when I get workpersons in I have to ask my neighbours’ permission to take down a section of the fence (that I’ve erected) so they can access my garden. They always agree without hesitation. So good fences don’t necessarilymakegood neighbours but they don’t damage good relations.jno50In the US, we have a term for fences that are a response to neighbours that tend towards the latter – a “spite fence”.PorkRollReaders reply: Why do we feel nostalgia?Read moreA good high hedge is even better.

Old boozers are reclaimed, reloved and restored, and the great tradition of going down the pub is celebrated.The Devonshire in nearby Piccadillyis, of course, the daddy, the Darth Vader of this trend, winning plaudits, TikTok adoration and celebrity fans aplenty. So it’s no wonder that myriad other hospitality operators have cast an eye over their local neglected fleapit and thought: “Let’s buy some Mr Sheen, give that old hovel a polish and start serving duck à l’orange and flourless chocolate tart. It’s all the rage! Gen Z loves it!”View image in fullscreen‘Very delicate’: the Shaston Arms’ scallop-topped mash with curry leaves.Whether Gen Z really does love anything about the pub experience as it was in the 20th century is debatable, however, because inside these poshed-up spit-and-sawdust boozers, all the phlegm and fag ash has gone – as have the dartboards, pool tables, punch-ups, topless women on KP peanut pub cards and the ever-present bar-fly alcoholic drinking himself yellow while droning on about his marital problems. “It’s a pub just like pubs used to be,” proclaim many of these places, of which the Shaston near Carnaby Street is a great example. But those old pubs had jukeboxes blaring problematic ballads by Tom Jones, and a snug bar with a shag tartan carpet where the womenfolk could nestle with their glass ofDubonnetbecause we weren’t quite welcome in the saloon bar, and especially not if we asked for a pint.The Shaston is a pleasantly sterile, heavily Gen Z-friendly experience: a polished room with some strategically placed rock’n’roll art, a few beers with weird names on tap and, of course, a menu offering fennel and escarole caponata with hazelnuts and caramel flan withmiyagawa. The menu is imaginative and, in its bowls of beef-fat onion rings with smoked cod’s roe, merguez baguettes and mashed potato topped with scallop, makes the odd wry nod towards old-school pub comfort food. But there are also flights of finesse with the likes of delica squash with fontina and walnut salsa rosso, and some very saltybigoliwith chanterelles and pecorino.View image in fullscreen‘A wry nod to old-school pub comfort food’: the Shaston Arms’ merguez baguette.Some of the cooking is very delicate, too – that creamy mash with a lightly spiced scallop and curry leaves, for example – but elsewhere it is simply heavy-handed. Do whopping great and not particularly crunchy onion rings really need heavily smoked fish roe as an accompaniment? In fairness, the plate was whisked away before I’d finished them, so they saved me the trouble of solving that particular conundrum. And does a caramel tart need an overdose of salted almonds and some very bitter citrus fruit? Just because you can do these things doesn’t mean you should do them.The biggest issue with the cooking here, though, is that the Shaston Arms is very keen to be an old-school boozer at the same time as being a cool restaurant that serves food at premium prices. Service-wise, however, in the restaurant at least, there was little or no hospitality at all, because they’ve seemingly not employed a single member of staff who is able to provide any of the standard niceties of a restaurant’s front of house, such as checking if a customer wants another drink, changing cutlery or side plates between courses, asking if everything is OK, making eye contact, explaining what the dishes are or even noticing when a passing bartender says loudly, “God, it’s cold in the restaurant bit, isn’t it?” Meanwhile, the diners – ie, me – sit with chattering teeth next to a ringing reservations telephone and someone cutting bread, which incidentally is £4.50 a pop for a minuscule amount of baguette with nondescript, fridge-cold butter.View image in fullscreenThe Shaston Arms’ red mullet with squid and black rice: ‘Does Gen Z really love anything about the 20th-century pub experience?’And all this cost £144 – of which, laughably, £16 was added on for service – that I could have better spent on several visits to Wagamama. The reason the Devonshire is so celebrated for doing an apparently “easy” thing is because the dance between spit-and-sawdust and “We’re actually recreatingthe Sportsman at Seasalter” is a precarious one that requires a thousand tricky pirouettes, as well as plenty of well-trained staff and a dining room away from the actual pub rabble. It takes a lot of effort and expense to look that thrown together. Without it, you’re just charging £4.50 for unsalted chips in an unheated lean-to and not checking if anyone wants salt, sauce or vinegar, or even noticing when your customers get up to leave. They sell crisps at Wetherspoons, so I think I’ll try there.The Shaston Arms4-6 Ganton Street, London W1, 020-3757 5774.

His fellow chefSanjeev Kapoordescribes it as “one of the bestselling dishes in restaurants” there, but here in the UK, though it’s no doubt widely enjoyed, it seems to fly somewhat under the radar on menus, where even the chicken original plays second fiddle to our beloved chicken tikka masala.If you haven’t yet fallen for the crowdpleasing charms of fresh cheese in a mild tomato sauce, consider this a strong suggestion to give it a whirl.Paneer makhni(makhni being the Hindi word for butter, hence alsodal makhni), tastes incredibly fancy, but it’s relatively simple and quick to make. Just add bread and a vegetable side to turn it into a full feast.The paneerView image in fullscreenNisha Katona marinates her paneer first. Inset photographs by Felicity Cloake.For me, this unsalted, cottage-style cheese occupies much the same culinary niche as pressed tofu, being a texturally satisfying source of protein with a blandly creamy flavour that flatters, rather than competes with whatever sauce or seasoning it’s paired with. You can make your own at home with milk and lemon juice (Maunika Gowardhan has a good guide), but it’s also usually available to buy at south Asian specialists and in larger supermarkets.Mowgli’sNisha Katona’s recipe is the only one I try that marinates the cheese before use. Her tandoori masala (spice blend) gives it an appetising red colour, but the firm commercial paneer I’m working with is too dense to absorb much in the way of flavour, so perhaps Katona’s approach would work better with a crumblier, homemade version.Two recipes pre-cook the cheese before adding it to the gravy.Meera Sodhacoats it in garlic, ginger, chilli powder, lemon juice, salt, turmeric and yoghurt, in much the same way as one might if making this with chicken, then bakes it for 25 minutes, while chef and restaurateur Kaushy Patel inher book Prashad, deep-fries the cheese before use.Singh and Kapoor both add the cheese at the end of the cooking, which is the approach I’ve also adopted, not because it’s less work (though, of course, it has that incidental benefit), but because it maintains the contrast between the squidgy, blank canvas of the cheese and the richness of the sauce. (That said, if you’re cooking for those, particularly meat-eaters, who might struggle with the idea of a protein without much by way of flavour, I’d recommend Sodha’s approach, which gives the cubes a crunchy coating of baked-on spice.)The sauceView image in fullscreenVivek Singh adds the cheese right at the end of the cooking.Katona, Patel and Singh (who credits the recipe inhis book Curryto the contract banquet cooks from Orissa who cooked at his sister’s wedding) all start their sauces with onion as well as ginger and garlic, while Sodha sticks to ginger and garlic, and Kapoor to garlic alone. The dairy in paneer makhni gives it a sweetness that I’ve chosen to emphasise with well-softened onion (Patel goes as far as to caramelise it) and root ginger. For much the same reason, the heat in mine comes from red chilli powder instead of Patel’s fresher, more herbaceous fresh green peppers.None of the recipes I try contains a long list of spices; turmeric, chilli, cardamom (Singh uses black and green) and garam masala are all common, with Katona, Singh and Patel adding extra cumin. Patel and Katona also pop in coriander, while Kapoor includes mace and Singh a bay leaf. The zestiness of green cardamom is a good pairing with the richness of dairy, while the sweet spices in garam masala make sense with the flavour profile of the dish as a whole.Dried fenugreek leaves, ormethi, which are often stirred in later, also feel like a must; though I can’t quite describe their bitter, slightly woody, oddly fruity flavour, I clearly remember it being the thing that made the difference when I was exploringchicken tikka masalaover a decade ago, and it’s come up trumps again here. (NB: this has reminded me of the fascinating fact that fenugreek seeds are usedto flavourartificial maple syrup substitutes.)View image in fullscreenMeera Sodha’s butter paneer is ‘extremely hands-off and also ridiculously delicious’.Tomato-wise, a smooth, velvety sauce feels the most luxuriant. If you’re using chopped tomatoes, be they fresh or tinned, you might wish to deploy a hand blender to help with this, as Katona does, or push them through a sieve, as Kapoor does with his fresh ones, but finely chopped tomatoes or even passata will save you that job.Unless you live somewhere with great, full-flavoured fresh tomatoes, I wouldn’t recommend using them here, though, because substandard fruit will give your sauce a thin, almost salsa-like tanginess. Indeed, I also like to add a spoonful of tomato puree, a tip picked up from Katona to supercharge the depth of flavour. This may mean you don’t want to add any sweetness, but, if you do, you’ll be in good company; Sodha and Kapoor suggest honey, and Singh and Katona sugar.The dairyOr, at least, the richness: while almost every recipe I try adds butter (the clue’s in the name), the version in Katona’s bookMeat-Free Mowglialso includes Greek yoghurt. Kapoor uses double cream, Singh single cream, milk powder and boiled cashew paste, which also puts in an appearance inChetna Makan’s recipe, whileZainab Shah advisesstirring in cashew butter in the New York Times). Sodha, meanwhile, leaves out butter entirely in favour of double cream.View image in fullscreenSanjeev Kapoor’s butter paneer uses a ‘jaw-dropping’ four tablespoons  of butter per person.I see her logic: chucking in butter in the quantity that Kapoor recommends in How to Cook Indian – a jaw-dropping four tablespoons per person – makes for a sickly result. (Even I, a person who loves the stuff so much I made anentire radio programmeabout it, find that a little excessive). Double cream gives some of the same mouthfeel, but with just over half the fat. There’s no satisfactory substitute for the flavour of butter, however, so I’ve suggested including a couple of judicious spoonfuls as well.I’ve left Singh and Makan’s pleasingly sweet cashews out of my recipe for simplicity’s sake, but their popularity with my testers does make the case that this admittedly unlikely candidate for veganisation might not be as difficult as it sounds. Substitute firm tofu for the paneer, boiled cashew paste loosened with water for the cream andplant-based butteror your favourite oil for that lingering fullness of flavour. If you try it out, do let me know how you get on.Any other businessView image in fullscreenKaushy Patel deep-fries the paneer before adding it to the pot.Though perhaps not canonical, we’re all big fans of the pops of sweetness provided by Katona’s addition of peas, but you may instead prefer to finish the dish with a sprinkle of chopped coriander, as Singh and Shah recommend. I also must commendSodha’s recipefrom her book Dinner to you simply because it’s made entirely in one baking dish, rather than on the hob, and is consequently extremely hands-off and also ridiculously delicious. If you want to make an easy recipe even easier, this is the one for you.Note: you could make this to the point when you blitz the sauce up to a day or so in advance, and reheat gently. I like this with flatbreads – naan or roti for preference – and saag or akhachumber salad.Perfect butter paneerPrep10 minCook30 minServes41 tbsp neutral oil, or ghee1 onion, peeled and finely chopped4 cardamom pods, lightly crushedSalt4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tbsp grated root ginger1-2 tsp mild chilli powder1 tsp garam masala1 tbsp tomato puree700g tomato passata, or finely chopped tinned tomatoes125ml double cream25g butter2 tsp fenugreek leaves(methi)1 tsp sugar, or honey (optional)500g paneer, cut into bite-size chunks100g frozen peas(optional; no need to defrost)Lemon juice, to finishPut the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, then add the onion, cardamom pods and a pinch of salt, and fry, stirring regularly, until the onion is very soft and beginning to turn golden brown.View image in fullscreenStir in the garlic and ginger, then fry for another couple of minutes, until the garlic begins to smell cooked.

Luckily, you bought a cheap Amazon Fire Stick online that gives you access to all the sports you want as well asTV streamingservices.While the quality of the picture is not brilliant, you are saving on monthly subscriptions and the one-off fees to watch big sporting events. The stick was a bargain – or so you think.In fact, using a “modded”AmazonFire Stick with your laptop or TV can give criminals an open door to your bank details and passwords, putting you at risk of losing thousands and having your identity traded over the web.‘Black Fraud Day’: shoppers warned over Black Friday scamsRead moreA recent survey fromBeStreamWise, a UK initiative established to counter the problem, found two out of every five people who used illegal streaming were defrauded. They lost an average of almost £1,700 each as a result.“Illegal streaming might look like a quick way to save money, but … it’s a false economy that can end up costing people thousands,” says DCI Emma Warbey of the police intellectual property crime unit (PIPCU) at City of London police.“This is a crime that diverts funds away from the entertainment industries – money that supports thousands of technical and support staff. At the same time, it exposes end-users to the risks of data theft, cybercrime and fraud.”The modded or “jailbroken” devices are Amazon Fire Sticks with extra software added that can be bought for about £20 on the internet.The growing use of themhas led to a crackdown by the Federation Against Property Theft (Fact), which has been carrying out raids across the UK to stop supply.View image in fullscreenThe genuine article: a legitimate ad for the Amazon Fire TV Stick.Photograph: PR ImageIn one case, according toBeStreamWise, a man who was streaming illegally had his bank details stolen twice and someone tried to buy a boat in his name.What the scam looks likeThe sticks are sold through social media and illegal streaming sites, often advertised as being jailbroken with promises of free TV shows, sports and films.The potential for fraud happens the minute you connect the “dodgy stick” with a laptop or TV, according to Rob Shapland of Cyonic Cyber, an ethical hacker who shows companies where there are gaps in their security systems.“Alongside the stream [of TV or sports] it will also install some malware on to your computer and give the criminal direct access to your computer so [they] could use it as if they were sitting there,” he says.“Or they can install keyloggers which will record any password you are typing. So when you are accessing online banking, it will record your banking passwords.

They want to wear it.For Nicola Deane, 33, and her sister Chloe, 27, that instinct comes naturally. The pair travelled from Ireland for what they describe as “a full weekend of dressing up”, part of a long-running tradition between them.Wicked: For Good review – Cynthia Erivo sweeps the field in explosive second chunk of Oz prequelRead moreDressed in matching green and pink coordinated sets today, the pair wanted to channel the Wicked characters. “Elphaba’s a bit of a badass, and I think I am too,” says Nicola, while Chloe, the “more girlie” sister, opted for pink.For them, themed dressing is a shortcut to community. “We have the same feelings for the film, we’re all in it together,” Nicola says. Chloe smiles: “It’s magical.”Elsewhere, another group has gathered in matching Wicked T-shirts. Coralie, her best friend, Atlanta, her mother, Sarah, and family friend Alison have come from Leicester for the weekend to mark the occasion.Coralie and Atlanta bonded over the musical last year and each have three tattoos referencing it, with plans for more. “I felt like we needed to express how much I love it,” Coralie says.View image in fullscreen‘Elphaba’s a bit of a badass, and I think I am too,’ says Nicola, while Chloe, the ‘more girlie’ sister, opted for pink.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianFor her mother, Sarah, Wicked is part of a longer history. “My mum first introduced me to The Wizard of Oz,” she says. “It resonated because it’s a different story that you don’t see very often. It’s really important for women to connect.”“We’re sparkly girls,” Alison nods in agreement. “Any excuse to get a bit of glitter out.” Atlanta admits she would have “worn a pink ball gown” if she didn’t also need to go shopping afterwards. Even so, she says, “today needed something fun”.It is a sentiment shared by many in the Wicked crowd. For Courtney Harrington, 38, dressing up offers permission to bring “a bit of whimsy” back into the everyday. She has come in pink trousers, in what she calls “a Glinda moment”, but laughs that her green jacket has accidentally channelled Elphaba. “With the state of the world, it’s just really nice to add some whimsy to your life,” she says.Recent sales data analysed by SumUp shows just how much that whimsy has spread: a 375% jump in Wicked-related costume searches at Smiffy’s, a 20- to 25% surge in themed nail bookings reported by Cynthia Erivo’s nail artist Shea Osei after the viral“holding space” moment, and a 32% rise in karaoke renditions of Defying Gravity at Lucky Voice.While many pre-planned their costumes, others prefer to improvise. “When else do you get the sequins out?” says Zoe Dobell, who arrived in a mix of green and a pink hair bow pulled from her wardrobe.“Part of the fun is finding clothes I thought I never had.” For her, Wicked’s colour story is something emotional. “There’s a kind of yin and yang, isn’t there? We have moments where we feel defiant, like Elphaba, and times where you just want to wake up and be Glinda.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tamar sees it as an extension of the film’s “magic beyond the screen.” “It makes our friendship stronger,” she says. “It reminds us that we have been changed for good by seeing each other.”According to trend analyst J’Nae Phillips, this shift toward event dressing isn’t coincidental. “Films have become powerful fashion catalysts because they now function as shared cultural touchpoints,” she says. Their aesthetics spread quickly, being “easy to adopt, easy to remix,” and give people “an emotional palette they can wear.”Phillips says there’s also a post-pandemic desire for communal experiences. “Dressing up for films creates a hybrid experience – part ritual, part fandom, part community gathering. It signals a desire for collective joy in an era where much of life feels solitary,” she says. People want to be part of the worlds they watch on screen and “Dressing up is one of the simplest, most accessible ways to do that”.Later in the evening, fans in shades of pink and green cluster eagerly outside, Leicester Square buzzing as the sold-out screenings draw near.Explore more on these topicsFancy dress and costumeWickedMusicalsnewsShareReuse this content"

But with impenetrable cloud and heavy rain forecast, it was hard not to feel deflated.Then again, this was Italy, where it’s easy to make the best of things whatever the weather. And the 3 Zinnen Dolomites ski resort and nature park – right on Italy’s border with Austria, about two-and-a-half hours north of Venice, is always charming, with the usual jumble of cultures you see in South Tyrol. Part Italian, it’s more Austrian thanks to the legacy of the Habsburgs, who ruled this part of Italy until 1918. Hence most places have an Austrian and an Italian name, 3 Zinnen or Tre Cime (meaning three peaks) being a case in point. It’s the home of Ladin, an ancient Romance language, too.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian GraphicsOf the five villages that make up 3 Zinnen Dolomites, I was staying in the largest, San Candido (or Innichen), which looked as Austrian as could be – onion-domed church and pastel-coloured, richly detailed houses you would see in Salzburg. Even under leaden skies, it was a pretty place, its pedestrianised centre filled with classy shops selling cashmere and leather goods and, happily, an impressive number of delis stocking high-quality (but not necessarily high-priced) regional food. The sort that makes you want to move to Italy.View image in fullscreenSan Candido is in the shadow of some of the Dolomites’ most dramatic peaks.Photograph: Matteo Martinazzoli/AlamyKeeping an eye on the weather was simple from my balcony atHotel Leitlhofoverlooking San Candido, with a view of the village’s ski slope and snippets of the Dolomites between the clouds. All five villages are connected by bus and some by train, with links to 3 Zinnen’s various ski areas, cross-country ski trails and high-altitude walking trails that don’t even require snowshoes.Occasionally, the clouds would swirl and a rugged peak would poke into view before being obscured againOne of those buses took me to Signaue, where I caught glimpses of faintly blue sky as the cable car whizzed me up to Stiergarten at 2,100m. Turning my back on the skiers at the top, I followed a signposted walking trail that took me slowly back down the mountain. The only other prints in the fresh snow were of a four-legged creature, possibly a hare or a fox. Occasionally, the clouds would swirl and a rugged peak would poke into view before being obscured again. But in this winter wonderland, those atmospheric clouds were playing as much of a starring role as the mountains they were shrouding.The only sound was my boots in the snow as I descended into pine woods. Light snow was falling again and it whetted my appetite for lunch atSkihütte Henn-Stoll(or Baita Pollaio) at the foot of the cable car. I fell on a plate ofKnödel/canederli– dumplings packed with cheese and melted butter served with a cabbage salad flavoured with caraway seeds. This was classic Ladin mountain comfort food.View image in fullscreenThe writer on the path down from Stiegarten.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeMarch’s longer days meant the sun hadn’t quite set on San Candido when it was time for the early-evening passeggiata and aperitivo. Thrillingly, it actually made an appearance, bringing a warm glow to the mountains rising behind those beautiful Austrian-style houses before dusk exposed the full moon to midnight-blue skies. Pure magic.The next morning I took the bus to the cable car in the neighbouring village of Versciaco (Vierschach), another 3 Zinnen ski area. At Helm (or Monte Elmo), I stumbled into Narnia: a trail through pine woods. It was soothing to shuffle gently through the snow and think about lunch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The robust flavours were a perfect match for the misty mountains.Opening the curtains on my last morning was like waking up on Christmas Day. Snow had covered everything. I was on the bus to Val Fiscalina to follow a trail through larch forests. As it was Saturday, I seemed to have been joined by half the population, all apparently with the same destination –Talschlusshütte, a charmingly rustic restaurant in the woods (open Christmas to Easter). I had been warned not to be late and lose my table; since San Candido local boy Jannik Sinner became the world No 1 tennis player and word went out that his father had been the chef at Talschlusshütte, the restaurant’s popularity has soared, even if Sinner Senior is no longer in the kitchen.View image in fullscreenSpinach dumplings (knödel)with cream cheese and speck are a local speciality.Photograph: Fabrizio Troiani/AlamyWhoever was in the kitchen knew how to make a mean baconknödelandthe clear herby broth it was served in.

The clouds were on the move. I turned round to catch a glimpse of a mountain, then another, then another. Finally, just hours before I was to go home, the 3 Zinnen – or Tre Cime, three peaks – revealed themselves in all their jagged glory. I whooped in joy, then turned round again and they were gone.This trip was provided by3 Zinnen Dolomites.

It would be the first such project in England since the purpose-built new town of Milton Keynes in the 1960s.Shiv Malik, author, investor and former Guardian journalist, came up with the audacious scheme. He spent recent years writing about the rough deal millennials have in terms of housing and debt, and the fact it is incredibly difficult to build a life as previous generations did. Now he is trying to turn his ideas into reality.View image in fullscreenShiv Malik says building in this way would provide a huge net gain for nature.Photograph: ACDC“No one’s done this before – building in this way which would create a huge net gain for nature. We are trying to build in natural infrastructure,” he said.He is in discussions with the housing department, and shortly after the proposal for the forest city was made public, the government announced its ambitions to build anetwork of “forest towns”in a similar area.The Labour government has been accused of pitting nature against housebuilding in its attempt to construct 1.5m homes across the country and address the housing crisis. Ministers are in the process of passingcontroversiallegislation, which environment groups say puts 5,000 nature sitesat risk.Malik’s almost 800 supporters span the political spectrum, including Green party campaigners and leaders of rightwing thinktanks. He’s also enlisted Paul Powlesland, a nature campaigner and barrister, to join the board of the Albion City Development Corporation, which is overseeing the proposal.The city would be east of Cambridge, with new rail links, schools and hospitals. It would be under a community land trust – run by a community-led non-profit organisation for the benefit of those who live there rather than for corporate profits. This would help to keep the houses affordable.The homes would be built to eco-friendly standards, out of modular wooden designs, in communities which are “pedestrianised, human-scale environments where children can run free because the world was designed with them in mind; safe, walkable neighbourhoods”. Rather than being car-dependent, they hope to build trams throughout the town so people can use high-quality public transport instead. It would have 12,000 acres of native forest, which would be mostly new planting to link up existing pockets of woodland.Giving the builders development corporation powers – such as those granted to build Milton Keynes, Canary Wharf and the Olympics infrastructure – would help make the houses cheaper because they would be built at scale, and the special legislation would save the costs associated with going through the usual planning system.There are many other issues to surmount, not least that East Anglia is one of the most water-depleted areas in the country. Malik says alongside building the city, the developers would “replenish the chalk streams” and “build water infrastructure”, such as much-needed reservoirs. “There’s enough money in this scheme to resolve these water issues for East Anglia and for the people around the city, not just in it,” he said.They also plan to build on farmland. Malik said: “[Guardian columnist] George Monbiotconverted me to thisages ago – it’s just green industrial land, it’s terrible for nature.”The proposal is to build on mostly industrial agricultural land, which, Malik says, is often sterile, after being routinely sprayed with fertiliser and pesticides, and bereft of nature.These fields could instead be replaced by desperately needed homes, as well as habitat for wildlife, allowing people to live closer to nature.Numerous studieshave found that many people in urban areas are in “nature deserts”, with green spaces inaccessible, while the physical and mental health benefits of time spent in parks, woods or the beach arewell known.Powlesland said: “I think the question is, can we build what is necessary for humans to have a healthy, happy society while either not degrading nature or ideally restoring nature? That is the question of the 21st century, and it feels like nobody is answering that question.”There are areas on the proposed site that have already been designated as places for rare wildlife or habitats – sites of special scientific interest – but Malik’s idea is to build around them, and keep the existing ancient woodland as “corridors” within the city, while planting more trees to link it all up. “People assume we want to cut down all those trees but no, it’s a forest city … Rather than having parks, we will just say we would rather have woods,” Malik said. “You can’t call yourself a forest city just because it sounds cute.”Powlesland also wants to see if building can be done differently, for example by going around rivers and keeping existing trees: “If it is going to be a kind of normal volume development of plonking down a concrete city surrounded by nature reserve, I wouldn’t support it.”Another way is possible, he said: “I do think there is a capacity to do things differently and using technology and imagination and clever design to actually have a city that is where there is more nature and there’s humans, and therefore there’s also not only more nature, but more beauty as well. I think it could be amazing … Imagine a city that is, in effect, a nature reserve, where people are living in a nature reserve.”View image in fullscreenArtist’s impression of the forest city.Illustration: ACDCSome farmers would have to sell their land to build this city, but Malik said the value uplift would mean they were all well compensated.Some nature campaigners have questioned why a nature advocate such as Powlesland is involved. He said it is important for someone to represent nature on such a scheme: “My job is to effectively speak for nature’s interests as best as I can. There is a great need to have nature’s voice represented in the planning system. Because at the moment, nature isn’t represented, and the only ones doing it, usually, are people categorised as nimbys. And sometimes they’re really caring for nature, and sometimes they’re using concerns about nature to avoid any kind of change.”It may be the case that once costs come into play, some of these ambitious nature plans could be dropped. If that happens, the barrister will turn from advocate to opponent: “I believe there is a way to build a city that enriches nature. And it’s going to be difficult. It will take imagination and courage and some difficulty I imagine, but it is possible, and if they don’t do it, then I will speak out against it.”The Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsGreen buildingHousingReal estateCommunitiesPlanning policynewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump’s administrationwithdrew from the Paris climate agreementon the first day of his second term in office and has reversed many policies designed to tackle sexism, racism and homophobia.The White House spokesperson Anna Kelly accused Ramaphosa of “refusing to facilitate a smooth transition of the G20 presidency”.“This, coupled with South Africa’s push to issue a G20 leaders’ declaration, despite consistent and robust US objections, underscores the fact that they have weaponised their G20 presidency to undermine the G20’s founding principles,” she said.South Africa had offered to arrange for an equivalent “junior” diplomat to formally hand the G20 presidency to the US at the foreign ministry. Officials had stated it would breach protocol for Ramaphosa to give it to the US acting ambassador.South Africa’s foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, told reporters: “From us, the ball has moved. We are done. It’s up to them. If they want to come, we are available.”The 2026 summit is scheduled to take place at the Trump National Doral Miami golf resort, which is owned by the Trump Organization.Argentina, whose president, Javier Milei, skipped the summit, also refused to endorse the declaration. Its foreign minister, Pablo Quirno, said: “Specifically it addresses the longstanding Middle East conflict in a manner that fails to capture its full complexity.”The G20 communique stated: “We will work for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Ukraine, as well as ending other conflicts and wars around the globe.”The G20 was founded in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1999, with 19 nations and the European Union. The African Union wasadded in 2023.Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum were also absent from the summit. Putin is wanted by the international criminal court, to which South Africa is a signatory. Xi has delegated attending many international gatherings this year to China’s premier, Li Qiang.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsG20Cyril RamaphosaSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Bolsonaro was found guilty by the supreme court in September of engineering a coup attempt and had been expected to be sent to prison in the coming days after a series of appeals.However, at just after midnight on Friday, security officials detected that the ankle tag being used to track Bolsonaro’s movements had been tampered with. In the early hours of Saturday, a supreme court judge ordered the ex-president’s arrest based on suspicions he was about to make a break for one of Brasília’s foreign embassies. In 2024, Bolsonaro spent two nights sleeping in the Hungarian embassy for reasons that remain obscure.Federal police officers came to Bolsonaro’s house to execute an arrest warrant at about 6am on Saturday and he was driven to a federal police base where he is now being held.At Sunday’s hearing, Bolsonaro claimed he could not recall having such a psychotic episode before and attributed the outbreak of “paranoia” to two medications he said he had started taking a few days earlier: a powerful analgesic and an antidepressant. Bolsonaro told the judge he had become convinced his electronic tag contained a covert listening device.After using the hand tool to damage the monitoring equipment, Bolsonaro said, he eventually gave up after “snapping out of it”.Political observers and Bolsonaro’s political foes reacted to the claims with scepticism, noting how in a video shot early on Saturday the former president had offered a different version of events. In that footage, Bolsonaro can be heard admitting to a security official that he interfered with the equipment “out of curiosity”.In the months before his coup trial, Bolsonaro and his supporters had been banking on the support of his most powerful foreign ally, Donald Trump, to help him avoid punishment.Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods in response to what he called a “witch-hunt” against the former president, and imposed sanctions on several senior Brazilian officials. However, after meeting Brazil’s current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, at the UN in September, Trump’s support for Bolsonaro began to wane, with the US president calling Lula “a very nice man”. Last Thursday, Trump rolled back tariffs on products such as beef and coffee in what was seen as a big victory for Lula.After being informed of Bolsonaro’s arrest on Saturday, Trump gave a lukewarm response. “That’s too bad,” he told reporters.The US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, criticised “the provocative and unnecessary incarceration” of Bolsonaro but there was no immediate sign of more severe retaliation from Washington.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Multilateralism held – just.“We knew this Cop would take place in stormy political waters,” said Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, after a long and occasionally angry final plenary at the climate summit. “Denial, division and geopolitics has dealt international cooperation some heavy blows this year.”Trump, war, absent media: five threats to climate progress that dogged Cop30Read moreButCop30showed that “climate cooperation is alive and kicking”, Stiell added, making an oblique reference to the US, which under Donald Trump opted not to send anyone to Belém. Trump, who has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and a “con job” has come to embody the opposition to progress on dealing with dangerous global heating.Stiell said: “I’m not saying we’re winning the climate fight. But we are undeniably still in it, and we are fighting back. Here in Belém, nations chose unity, science and economic common sense. This year there has been a lot of attention on one country stepping back. But amid the gale-force political headwinds, 194 countries stood firm in solidarity – rock solid in support of climate cooperation.”He pointed to one section of the Cop30 agreement: “The global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.” He argued: “This is a political and market signal that cannot be ignored.”The summit began more than a fortnight ago with the leaders’ summit. The Brazilian hosts promised with early sunny optimism that it would finish on time, but as the negotiations went on the confusion and obvious divisions between parties grew, and the process looked close to collapse on Friday.Overnight negotiations and compromise on all sides meant a deal could be agreed on Saturday. The summit produced decisions on dozens of issues, including a promise to triple adaptation funding to protect communities against climate impacts, an agreement for a just transition mechanism (JTM) and recognition of the rights of Indigenous people.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Ethiopian delegation celebrate their selection to host Cop32.Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, proposals to start planning roadmaps to transition away from fossil fuels and end deforestation were not agreed and were hived off to processes outside the UN to be pushed forward by coalitions of willing nations. The impacts of the food system – such as cattle in cleared tracts in the Amazon – were largely ignored.The overall package was largely seen as incremental at best and far less than is needed to tackle the accelerating climate crisis. Jasper Inventor, a deputy programme director at Greenpeace International, said: “Cop30 started with a bang of ambition but ended with a whimper of disappointment. This was the moment to move from negotiations to implementation – and it slipped.”The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said progress was made but warned it was becoming more difficult to secure agreements. “Cops are consensus-based – and in a period of geopolitical divides, consensus is ever harder to reach,” he said. “I cannot pretend that Cop30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”The EU commissioner for the environment, Wopke Hoekstra, echoed the sense of relief. “It is not perfect, but it is a huge step in the right direction. The EU stood united, fighting for ambition on climate action,” heposted on X, even though that unity was sorely tested.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Mamadou Ndong Toure, the thematic lead for climate and resilience at Practical Action in Senegal, said: “Adaptation cannot be built on shrinking commitments; people on the frontline need predictable, accountable support and a clear path to act.”View image in fullscreenActivists from the Make Polluters Pay coalition protest during Cop30.Photograph: Anderson Coelho/ReutersSimilarly, although Brazil styled Cop30 as the “Indigenous Cop” and the deal recognised for the first time Indigenous people’s land rights and knowledge as a fundamental climate solution, there were still concerns that participation was limited. “Despite being referred to as an Indigenous Cop … it became clear that Indigenous peoples continue to be excluded from the negotiations,” said Emil Gualinga, of the Kichwa Peoples of Sarayaku, Ecuador.And there was frustration that the final text did not refer directly to fossil fuels. James Dyke, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter, said: “Despite the host’s best efforts, Cop30 will not even be able to get nations to agree to fossil fuel phase-out. This shameful outcome is the result of narrow self-interest and cynical politicking.”After several years of these annual UN climate gatherings being held in authoritarian-led countries, there were bursts of colourful protest in Belém as civil society returned in force. A march with tens of thousands of protesters lit up the middle Saturday of the summit and activists made their voices heard in an otherwise, grey, sterile conference centre.“From Indigenous-led demonstrations at the venue to the more than 70,000 people who marched in the streets, there was a palpable sense of momentum that I haven’t felt for years,” said Jamie Henn, the director of Fossil Free Media.At least a path ahead remains, watchers concluded. Prof Michael Grubb, of University College London, said: “The damp squib of an outcome from Cop30 has underlined that a focus on the negative – phasing out of fossil fuels – is fraught with political obstacles. For the road to Cop31, the focus must be balanced by equal attention to the positive – the huge economic potential of accelerating the energy transition, and ways to help countries around the world benefit from renewables and electrification.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisFossil fuelsGlobal climate talksUnited NationsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The verdict must take account of the geopolitical minefield they took place inSun 23 Nov 2025 05.21 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 07.58 ESTShareCop30 in Belém wrapped up on Saturday night more than 24 hours later than planned, and with an Amazonian rainstorm thundering down on the conference centre. The UN structure just about held, as it has done these past three weeks despitefire, savage tropical heat and blistering political attacks on the multilateral system of global environmental governance.Dozens of agreements were gavelled through on the final day, as the most collective form of humanity worked to resolve the most complex and dangerous challenge that our species has ever faced. It was chaotic. The process very nearly collapsed and had to be rescued by last-ditch talks that went on into the early morning. Veteran observers told me the Paris agreement was on life-support.But it survived. For now at least. The outcome was not nearly enough to limit global heating to 1.5C. There was a considerable shortfall in the finance needed for adaptation by the countries worst affected by extreme weather. The importance of rainforest protection barely got a mention even though this was the first climate summit in the Amazon. And the power balance in the world is still so skewed towards gas, oil and coal interests that there was not even a single mention of “fossil fuels” in the main agreement.Yet, for all these flaws, Belém opened up new avenues of discussion on how to reduce dependency on petrochemicals, and it increased the scope of participation by Indigenous groups and scientists. It made strides towards stronger policies on a just transition to a clean energy future, and crowbarred the wallets of wealthy nations a little further open. A debate is now raging as to whetherCop30was a success, a failure or a fudge. But any judgment needs to take into account the geopolitical minefield in which these talks took place. Here are five threats that will have to be avoided at next year’s climate summit in Turkey.1. Global leadership vacuumThe US walked out. China failed to step up. Many of the problems that beset the talks could have been avoided if these two climate superpowers – the world’s biggest historical emitter and the world’s biggest current emitter – had been able to coordinate a shared approach as they used to do before Donald Trump came to power.Instead, Trump has attacked climate science, cursed the UN and staged a summit in Washington with the Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Little wonder Riyadh felt emboldened at Cop30 to stymie any mention of fossil fuels, even though language on this was agreed at Cop28 in Dubai.China, by contrast, was present in Belém and geared towards helping its Brics partner,Brazil, to stage a successful conference. But its advisers made clear that Beijing did not want to fill US shoes when it came to finance, nor to lead alone on any issue beyond the manufacture and sale of renewable energy products.2. Divided Brazil, divided worldAmong the key fractures in global politics today is that of the relationship between extraction and conservation interests. One wants to endlessly expand agricultural frontiers, dig ever deeper for minerals and ignore the toll on forests and oceans. The other says such activities are breaking planetary boundaries with ever more catastrophic consequences for the climate, nature and human health. This division is evident across the world.It was also apparent at Cop30, where the Brazilian hosts sometimes seemed to send mixed messages, according to observers from Asia, Europe and Latin America. While the environment secretary, Marina Silva, was the driving force in pushing for a roadmap away from fossil fuels and deforestation, the foreign ministry – which has spent decades promoting agribusiness and oil exports – was far more hesitant and needed prompting by thepresident, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.The Amazon rainforest appeared to have been a victim of this, getting only one brief and vague mention in the main negotiating text.3. European parsimony and the rise of the far rightEurope has often presented itself as a leader on climate action, but it was heavily criticised at Cop30 for lagging on promises of climate finance for developing countries. It too was woefully divided, partly due to the rise of the far right in many countries. As a result, the EU had to delay its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) climate plan and only decided halfway through the Belém conference that it would make a fossil fuel transition roadmap one of its negotiating “red lines”.This was incompetent at best, because such major issues need far more advance coordination. Little surprise that many global south participants were suspicious that this sudden conversion to the roadmap was a ruse or a bargaining chip to delay action on adaptation finance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

European politicians said their budgets had shifted towards re-arming in response to the rising threat posed by Russia. As a result, they have slashed overseas development aid and it becomes an ever more difficult challenge to allocate funds for climate finance.At one time, that might have provoked an outcry, given polls showing the vast majority of people in the worldwant their governments to do moreto address the climate crisis. But it is increasingly hard for the public in many countries to know what is happening in climate talks.None of the fourmajor US news networks sent a team to Belém. Reporters from British and European broadcasters were present, but many said it was hard for them to get space in news programmes for their stories.This feels defeatist and contrasts with the incredible positive energy on thestreetsandriversof Belém.5. Rusty, cranky global decision makingThe UN, which turns 80 next year, is showing its age. Consensus decision making at Cop means any country has a veto. That might have made sense when cold war politics were a global priority, but it is inadequate now humanity faces an existential threat to its planetary home.As at previous Cop gatherings, frustrations about this – particularly among small island states – were glaringly apparent at Cop30. Dozens of high-ambition nations led by Colombia issued their own Belém declaration and announced plans to hold a parallel process on phasing out fossil fuels, which will have a first conference in Santa Marta, Colombia next April. The organisers say it is intended to complement rather than replace the UN process, but it could also widen the gap between major fossil fuel producers and those who champion renewables.On the political level, that might be an inevitable break, but the global economy is increasingly moving towards renewable power, which is now cheaper than fossil fuels, and demographic trends are shifting power to the global south. Meanwhile, underpinning everything are the unrelenting physics of the climate crisis, for which there can be no veto. These realities needs to be recognised by a revamped and more dynamic system of global governance. Or the Paris agreement may not make it unscathed from future Cops.Explore more on these topicsCop30View from the AmazonBrazilClimate crisisAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

He told fans at Fukuoka Kokusai Center that he was glad that he was able to compete to the best of his abilities.“I am happy that I am able to achieve a goal of mine,” he said of his victory, which was also televised.Yavhusishyn, who arrived in Japan three years ago after fleeing Ukraine, has climbed the sumo ranks at record speed. The Japan Sumo Association will soon hold a special meeting to promote him to “ozeki”, the second highest ranking under “yokozuna”, or grand champion, national broadcaster NHK said.He competed in the world junior sumo championships as a teenager but left Ukraine after Russia’s February 2022 invasion. Yavhusishyn, who is listed at 6ft tall and 310lbs, arrived in Japan two months later and made a blistering start to his career, reaching sumo’s upper divisions in only a year and winning promotion to the fourth-highest rank.Yavhusishyn was born in Vinnytsia in central Ukraine and took up sumo at the age of seven, becoming a national champion when he was 17. His age meant he narrowly avoided Ukraine’s military draft for men aged 18 and older when war broke out and he sought refuge in Germany before moving to Japan. His parents stayed in Germany and he arrived in Japan knowing nothing of the language. He initially lived and trained with a Japanese sumo wrestler, Arata Yamanaka, who he made friends with at the world junior sumo championships.View image in fullscreenDanylo Yavhusishyn poses with his trophy after his victory.Photograph: JIJI PRESS/AFP/Getty Images“I only met him once in person and he welcomed me, even though I couldn’t speak a word of Japanese,”Yavhusishyn said in 2024. “I was surprised when he said OK.

The US has not – by choiceEduardo PorterDespite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But this is no glitch – it’s the systemSun 23 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTShareThe Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, thenumber was brought down to zero. Unfortunately, the United States wasnot as successful. More than 4 million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that much further ahead.Graph of China and the US poverty ratesBut this story ignores how the US chooses to spend its riches. It seems reasonable that the success of a society and its system of government, the morality of its political compromises and agreements, would be determined to an important degree by how it chooses to deploy the fruits of its accomplishments and how it apportions the costs of its failures.Unlike China, the US did not offer much to the people eking out a living around the poverty line. Per head, the US’s economic output is six times China’s, and yet, inexplicably, there seem to be more abjectly poor Americans than Chinese.The story of US inequality is known by now. It is nonetheless breathtaking how its lopsideddistribution of incomekeeps getting worse. In 1980, the income of Americans in the middle of the income distribution added up to a bit more than 52.5% of the income of those perched at the top 90th percentile. At the turn of the century, it was 48%. By 2023, it had slipped further, to 42.5%.The poor’s share of the US economic pie is shrinking to developing-world levels. The income of Americans in the top 90th percentile of wealth grew more than twice as fast between 2000 and 2023 as that of Americans in the bottom 10th percentile. These days, Americans in the poorest 10th of the population draw about1.8% of the nation’s income, about the same as poor Bolivians. In Nigeria, they reap 3%, in China 3.1%, in Bangladesh 3.7%.It would be comfortable to blame market forces. They have played a critical role in shaping the US’s distribution of success. Globalization and technology have not only contributed to reduce the share of national income that is spent on labor. They have also exacerbated inequalities among the working class, rewarding the most educated workers while replacing the less skilled with robots.And yet, a summary glance at the Trump administration’s main initiatives – the president’s Big Beautiful Bill Act and his indiscriminate tariffs, which will raise the price of many staples and produce a drag on business spending and employment – underscores how the US’s dismal performance at sharing the fruits of its success with the less well-to-do in its society is not some bug in American capitalism. It is a feature.The legislation will take health coverage from millions of people and dramatically raise healthcare costs for millions more through massive cuts to Medicaid and the health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. It will trim hundreds of billions from the Snap nutrition assistance program for the poor. Altogether, the latest estimate by theBudget Lab at Yalefinds that the impact of Trump’s tariffs and his big, beautiful bill will trim household income for all except the richest fifth of American families. The bottom 10% would suffer a 7% cut.Sure, America’s indifference towards its poor did not appear suddenly during the Trump administration. It’s been a feature of Democratic and Republican governments over the last 50 years, letting appeals to market efficiency trump calls to address the US’s growing inequalities. Since Jimmy Carter left office, the income of the rich has grown more than that of the poor in every administration except that of Bill Clinton and, yep, Donald Trump’s first, when subsidies to respond to the Covid pandemic raised incomes across the poorer half of the population.What’s telling is that despite Trump’s claims to represent the common American worker trodden upon by indifferent economic forces, he is out to exacerbate the ills of American capitalism. The millions of angry Maga followers applauding Trump’s swipes at an unfair global order will eventually come to find that the rhetoric may have changed, but the US is not about to change the way it shares its riches.This is not to congratulateChinafor its authoritarian government, for its repression of minorities or for the iron fist it deploys against any form of dissent. But it merits pondering how this undemocratic government could successfully slash its poverty rate when the richest and oldest democracy in the world wouldn’t.Explore more on these topicsUS income inequalityEconomicsInequalityChinaDonald TrumpTrump administrationAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

The region is a major coffee production belt and home to popular beaches, but it is also prone to storms and floods.More than 60 of the deathssince 16 November were recorded in mountainous central Dak Lak province, where tens of thousands of homes were flooded, the ministry said in a statement.Vietnam floods: streets of Hoi An submerged like canals of Venice – in picturesRead moreLast week, rescuers using boats in central Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces pried open windows and broke through roofs to assist residents stranded by high water, according to state media, with the army, police and other security forces mobilised to relocate and evacuate people to safe areas.Rescuers brought food and water to flooded hospitals in the coastal city of Quy Nhon in Binh Dinh province, state-run Thanh Niên newspaper said, after doctors and patients at one facility survived on instant noodles and water for three days.Map of area in VietnamWater levels in the Ba River in Dak Lak province surpassed a 1993 record in two places early on Thursday, while the Cai River in Khánh Hòa province also surged to a new high, the weather bureau said.More than 235,000 houses had been flooded and nearly 80,000 hectares of crops damaged, Vietnam’s disaster agency said earlier.The government estimates the flooding has so far cost the economy around 8.98tn dong ($341m).Between January and October, extreme weather has left 279 people dead or missing in Vietnam and caused more than $2bn in damage, according to the national statistics office.The south-east Asian nation is prone to heavy rain between June and September, but scientific evidence has identified a pattern of human-driven climate change making extreme weather more frequent and destructive.Explore more on these topicsVietnamExtreme weatherAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Users will be presented with a prompt stating “verify your age” in the app to begin the process.Age can be verified by ConnectID via an Australian bank account, by checking a government ID such as passport or driver licence, or through facial age estimation. The latter will require users to take a selfie that is analysed using technology provided by age-assurance company k-ID.Australia’s under-16s social media ban is weeks away. How will it work – and how can I appeal if I’m wrongly banned?Read moreUsers under 16 will be given the option before 10 December to download data such as chats, memories and videos. Their accounts will be locked from 10 December until the user turns 16 and chooses to reactivate their account by verifying their age.Accounts that are locked for more than three years and not verified will be deleted.Snapchat disagrees that it should be covered by the ban – it has argued the primary purpose of Snapchat is for messaging, which is otherwise exempt – but it will comply with the ban.“Snapchat is and has always been a visual messaging app, primarily used for connection with your closest friends and family,” a spokesperson said.“We know that for teens, maintaining friendships is a key contributor to happiness and well-being and are deeply saddened that young Aussies can no longer connect with their nearest and dearest via Snapchat.“However, even though we strongly disagree with the government’s assessment … we will disable accounts for users under 16 from December 10.”Snap is the second of the platforms to announce how the ban will be implemented, after Facebook and Instagram parent companyMeta last weekstarted alerting affected users.TikTok and Kick have said they will comply with the ban but have yet to outline what steps they will take to implement it.Reddit, Twitch, X, and YouTube have yet to state their position on the ban, and whether they will comply.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsSnapchatSocial mediaChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

The family requests privacy at this time.”Jeremy Lee, chef at London restaurant Quo Vadis, praised the chef for her “extraordinary life and career … how this lovely lass lit up the world”.The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver wrote: “Terrible sad news. She was an amazing woman and incredible cook and kindhearted. She will be very, very, very missed. Thank you for all you did to inspire young cooks.”Cookery writer and television host Nigella Lawson said she was “heartbroken”.“However ill you know someone to be, their death is always a shock. It’s just awful that Skye is no longer in the world. It’s a tremendous loss, and I’m heartbroken for Holly and Evie and all those who loved her and learned from her,” Lawson wrote.Cyrus Todiwala, a chef who runs Cafe Spice Namaste in east London, said: “A great culinary leader has passed away. May her inspiration carry on with her teams and drive them to achieve all the goals she must have planned.”Australian chef Kylie Kwong wrote that “Skye was one of the greatest cooks of all time”, while Sydney Opera House culinary director Danielle Alvarez called Gyngell “an inspiration to us all”.Gyngell was born in Sydney on 6 September 1963. Her father was the broadcaster Bruce Gyngell, who in 1956 was the first person to appear on Australian television and in the 1980s succeeded Greg Dyke as managing director of the breakfast television franchise TV-am. Her mother, Ann Barr, was a well-known interior designer.While studying law at Sydney University, she took a job washing up at a delicatessen before moving to Paris to train under Anne Willan at the École de Cuisine La Varenne and then worked at the two Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant.The chef moved to London, where she worked at the Dorchester under Anton Mosimann before working at the French House in Soho under Fergus and Margot Henderson.She pioneered the “slow food movement”, a grassroots initiative founded in Italy in the 1980s to preserve traditional cooking and promote a “good, clean and fair” approach to eating.Gyngell transitioned to teaching and private catering to clientele that included Nigella Lawson, Charles Saatchi, Madonna and Guy Ritchie, and was later appointed food editor of Vogue.In 2004, she returned to the restaurant industry after visiting Petersham House, Lord Burlington’s 18th-century villa, and opened Petersham Nurseries Cafe.She also opened Spring at Somerset House in London and ran restaurants Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire.Marle was awarded a green Michelin star in 2022 and has retained it every year since.Last year, the chef and food author was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.The treatment blunted, for a time, her treasured sense of smell and taste. “Savoury foods tasted really salty,” she said. “Anything with chilli was like the spiciest curry in the world.“One teaspoon of sugar in my tea was more like 20 spoonfuls, and I couldn’t taste the tea.”In 1989, she married Thomas Gore; they divorced in 1996, and she is survived by their daughter, Holly, and by Evie, her daughter from a relationship with James Henderson.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

But the Minerals Council has joined other peak business groups in urging the Liberals and Nationals to back the changes, with the environment minister, Murray Watt, pledging to make a deal with whoever will come to the table first.Australia’s failed bid to host Cop31 looks like a mess – but it may actually be the best result possible | Adam MortonRead more“We will pass these reforms this week with whichever of the Coalition and the Greens is willing to work with us to deliver that balanced package,” Watt said on Sunday.Greens and Labor sources said they expected the two parties could come to an agreement later in the week, ahead of parliament rising on Thursday afternoon, but the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, wanted more limits on fossil fuel developments before signing up.“We also want to make sure we’re not seeing coal and gas fossil fuel projects accelerated,” she told the ABC’s Insiders.“I think it’s crazy in 2025, you’re talking about a new set of environment laws and it doesn’t even consider the climate pollution that a coal or gas mine makes.”Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterDespite the 1,500 pages of environmental law reform still being examined by a Senate committee, due to report in March 2026, the government says it wants to ram the bill through parliament by year’s end because it would improve approvals and build times for major parts of its agenda including housing construction, critical minerals sites and green energy projects.But the Greens and Coalition say they are not convinced of the bill’s urgency. Despite not ruling out a deal later in the week, Greens sources said they didn’t see the need for rushing, noting the ongoing Senate inquiry, and their concerns that the bill could help fast-track approval of coal and gas projects.Labor, in turn, is pressuring the Greens. Watt held a press conference on Sunday in the Brisbane electorate of Ryan, the last Greens-held seat in the country after the party lost three seats at the May election.“We saw at the last federal election that the Greens party paid a very big political price for being seen by the Australian people to be blocking progress on important things like housing and environmental law reform,” Watt said.“There’s a real opportunity for the Greens this week to demonstrate that they have heard the message from the Australian people, that they’re not going to keep blocking progress, that they’re not going to make the perfect the enemy of the good.”The Liberal party’s finance spokesperson, James Paterson, said on Sunday: “Where it stands today, we certainly couldn’t support the proposed legislation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Hanson-Young wanted more for their support, saying a three-year phase-in was not fast enough.“It’s 2025 and it’s time we ended native forest logging,” she said.Corporate groups such as the Business Council of Australia have urged the Coalition to back the EPBC changes. The Minerals Council CEO, Tania Constable, added her voice on Sunday, calling for a “sensible compromise by both sides”.“This will allow our industry to deliver investment, jobs and regional benefits faster,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsLabor partyLiberal partyAustralian GreensCoalitionFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

The findings in NSW matched thenationwide trends found in last year’s report.The survey examined “what it means to be a man in Australia”. It asked 1,200 men aged 18 to 30 a series of questions to shed light on how male attitudes towards masculinity influences domestic, family and sexual violence.Australia’s gen Z men more likely to hold sexist views, data shows, as ‘manosphere’ influences take holdRead moreThe survey, conducted by Jesuit Social Services, found that most men in NSW do not cling to damaging stereotypes around what it means to be a man. However, half of those surveyed reported feeling pressure to conform to those stereotypes.These stereotypes, referred to in the report as the “man box”, include appearing tough and in control, hyper-sexuality, homophobia, and a belief in rigid gender roles.The report found that men surveyed who did strongly agree with these stereotypes are more likely to commit acts of abuse. They were seven times likely to perpetrate intimate partner violence, and 10 times more likely to commit sexual violence. They also reported higher rates of drinking and gambling problems, and poorer mental health.Additionally, 18% of those surveyed admitted to “frequent” sexual harassing of women, and more than half had viewed violent pornography in the past six months.“The data released today is a reminder that exposure to violent and degrading content is shaping how too many young people, particularly young men, see relationships and sex,” said Jodie Harrison, the NSW minister for the prevention of domestic violence and sexual assault.“If we don’t step in early, those harmful attitudes can lead to behaviours that cause real harm.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rest will go to resources to help parents and caregivers on how to speak to their kids about pornography use.Michael Flood, a gender and sexuality expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said the number of men who adhere to stereotypical masculine attitudes had slightly decreased over the past five years. He said more funding is needed to help keep that progress on track, but what’s been promised will help.“Most men in Australia don’t ever use domestic or sexual violence against women,” he said.“But these are not the problems of a tiny minority of mad, bad men.

A joint statement between the two countries said that any eventual deal would “fully uphold” Ukraine’s sovereignty.The original 28-point US document leaked last week demands Ukraine hand over territory toRussia, limits the size of its army and agrees not to pursue the Kremlin for alleged war crimes.As discussions began in Geneva on Sunday, Donald Trump said Ukraine had shown “zero gratitude” for US efforts to end the conflict. In a conciliatory response, Zelenskyy said he was personally grateful to the US president for the military assistance Washington had given, beginning with Javelin missiles, which had saved Ukrainian lives.Trump’s hostile rhetoric came after a confusing weekend in which Rubio admitted the White House plan was conceived in Moscow, only to then insist the US was its author.Having been blindsided by Washington’s initiative, Ukraine’s European allies published their Kyiv-friendly plan on Sunday. It says negotiations over territory should take place after a ceasefire is agreed and should start from the line of contact – the existing frontline.It says both parties would agree how any truce would be monitored “under US supervision”. Unlike the White House text, the European alternative does not call for Kyiv to withdraw from cities it controls in eastern Donbas. Nor does it rule out Ukraine’s membership of Nato, but points out there is no consensus over its membership.There are further eye-catching proposals. They include that Russia give the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which would split power 50-50 between Moscow and Kyiv. Ukraine’s army would be capped during peacetime at 800,000 soldiers, 200,000 more than in the US draft.Frozen Russian assets would also be used to reconstruct Ukraine, rather than being partly given to US investors. If Moscow were to respect a “sustainable peace”, sanctions imposed since 2014 would be gradually eased and Russia would be brought back into the G8.Ukraine war briefing: Macron says without deterrence in Ukraine plan, ‘Russians will come back’Read moreEuropean leaders at the G20 summit in South Africa signalled on Saturday that the White House’s peace formulaneeded “additional work”. Poland’s president, Donald Tusk, expressed reservations on Sunday, saying: “It would be good to know for sure who is the author of the plan and where was it created.”The document was drawn up by Kirill Dmitriev, Vladimir Putin’s envoy, together with Trump’s special representative, Steve Witkoff. Speculationbased on the use of languagein the plan suggests it may have been written in Russian and later translated into English.A group of US senators said Rubio told them the text was not an American one. It was, they said, a Russian document deliberately leaked by Moscow which the US then passed on to Ukraine. Rubio later insisted the US did author the proposal, with input from Russia and Ukraine.Amid a backlash from some Republican senators, Trump rowed back from his earlier demand that Zelenskyy sign off on the deal by Thursday. Speaking in Washington, the US president said it was“not my final offer”, opening the door to significant changes.View image in fullscreenAndriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, heads to talks in Geneva on the US-led peace plan.Photograph: Elodie Le Maou/AFP/Getty ImagesRubio and Witkoff arrived in Geneva together on Sunday with the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, whoheld talks with Zelenskyy in Kyivlast week.After the talks, Rubio said good progress had been made in addressing unresolved questions in the draft US plan. “I think we made a tremendous amount of progress,” he told reporters at the US mission in Geneva, adding: “We’ve really moved forward, so I feel very optimistic that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”Yermak also said earlier that the sides had made “very good progress”, and were “moving forward to the just and lasting peace Ukrainian people deserve”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fifteen strikes were recorded in six areas of the city in north-eastern Ukraine.A Kyiv negotiating team had earlier spoken to officials from France, Germany and the UK, including Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell.Kirill Dmitriev: ‘ruthlessly ambitious’ Kremlin figure behind Ukraine planRead moreEuropean officials have been scathing about the US draft in private conversations. They say it undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and sets conditions for its EU accession. It would set a dangerous global precedent if accepted, they argue. It also rules out a French- and British-led peacekeeping force for Ukraine and limits where Nato aircraft could be based.One official said Putin was trying to turn back the clock 30 years on Europe’s security architecture and enforce demands made shortly before his all-out invasion. Russia’s president called for Nato’s military forces to withdraw to their 1997 borders, before the Baltic states and central Europe joined the transatlantic alliance.The European counter-proposal will be welcomed by Zelenskyy, who has come under enormous pressure to bend to US demands. He said last week that his countryfaced an impossible choicebetween betraying national interests and losing a major ally in the shape of Washington. “The bloodshed must be stopped, and we must ensure that the war is never reignited,” he wrote on Sunday.Olexiy Haran, a professor of comparative politics at the Kyiv-Mohyla academy, said Ukrainians overwhelmingly rejected the Trump document and would support the European one. “Freezing the frontline is a difficult compromise for us, but one a majority would back,” he said, but that there was no support for giving land to Russia.“Any peace deal isn’t about Zelenskyy. Ultimately it’s about the Ukrainian people and their understanding of Ukraine as a nation,” Haran said. “We definitely can’t allow all these crazy points in this Trump so-called peace plan.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Dire warnings about the state of the sector – one of the three pillars of the country’s economy – are a hardy perennial blamed on everything from geopolitics to a drop in the number of drinkers.Before a crisis meeting with the agriculture minister on Monday, vineyard owners say an unprecedented series of setbacks, including some of the worst harvests in 70 years, has left many of them on their last legs.Jean-Marie Fabre, the president of the independent winemakers’ syndicate, said urgent action was needed to save up to a fifth of the country’s winegrowers.“They are putting their final efforts into this battle for survival. The situation is dramatic and the government has to do something,” Fabre said.“We cannot imagine that this sector that is so important forFrancewill be abandoned, but if the government doesn’t act then it is saying the wine and spirits industry is no longer important, which would be hard to believe.“It would be like the German government saying it no longer cares about its car industry.”Several thousand winegrowers turned up to a protest last weekend in the southern city of Béziers, calling on the government to come up with a rescue package to compensate for harvests hit by bad weather, rising costs and falling sales.View image in fullscreenThe winegrowers’ demonstration in Béziers on 15 November.Photograph: Sylvain Thomas/AFP/Getty ImagesEarlier this month the ministry of agriculture predicted this year’s production would 3.6bn litres, the same as in 2024, which was also considered a disastrous year.Fabre said winemakers had been hit by a series of setbacks outside their control over the last five years that had weakened their businesses to the point of collapse. They were the Donald Trump’s 15% tariffs on imports of wine and spirits, the Covid crisis, harvests decimated by heatwaves and hail, Russia’s war in Ukraine increasing costs by a third and a dramatic slump in sales at home and abroad.Bordeaux’s grand cru wine exports to China fell to their lowest in a decade a year ago. According to a report by the Bordeaux wine council earlier this year, exports of the region’s wine to China have halved since 2017. Beijing also imposed a 32.2% customs tax on many imports of wine-based spirits from the EU in July. Only three major French companies, LVMH, Pernod Ricard and Rémy Cointreau were exempted from the duty.The president of the Aude winegrowers’ union, Damien Onorre, told Le Monde: “For three years, we have suffered droughts and heatwaves of over 40C. I have lost 50% of my production over this period. The Aude has seen its wine production almost halve to 2m hectolitres [200m litres] over the last three years.”Fabre met the agriculture minister, Annie Genevard, on 6 November to outline the industry’s demands and hopes these will result in measures at the crisis meeting on Monday.Among the winemakers’ demands is compensation for ripping up vines. Under a plan introduced last year, 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) of vines have been uprooted with compensation of €4,000 (£3,500) a hectare, and Fabre says another 35,000 hectares could go. In Bordeaux, 12,000 hectares of vines have been destroyed under a similar scheme.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The winegrowers also want to call on the European crisis reserve, which Portugal benefited from last year to fund a distillation programme, but French winegrowers say their appeal has gone unanswered.Le Monde reported a survey byFranceAgriMer, the national body overseeing food and drink production, that found 20% of French winegrowers were considering shutting their business, leading to the loss of as many as 100,000 jobs. France’s wine and spirits industry has an estimated€92bn turnover a yearand is one of the country’s three main industrial sectors, with aeronautics and luxury goods, directly or indirectly employing more than440,000 people.TheNational Association for Agriculture Employment and Trainingdescribed it as a “pillar of the economy and a source of jobs”.Monday’s meeting at the ministry comes on the eve of the International Exhibition of Equipment and Expertise forWineProduction to be held from Tuesday to Thursday in Montpellier.Fabre, a fourth-generation wine grower in the small southern village of Fitou near France’s border with Spain, produces 80,000 bottles a year at hisDomaine de la Rochelierre. As the president of the independent winemakers’ association, he represents 17,000 members.“This is the last chance. People are in a fighting mood but getting to the end of their tether. They either get support or they will have to shut,” he said.“We’ve never before had such a series of crisis as we’ve had over the last five years. It’s not because we’re not making good wine and it’s not due to one cause but our cash reserves are now depleted and without them we cannot survive.”Explore more on these topicsFranceWineEuropeFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

His newfound prominence also coincides with the sidelining of Trump’s officialUkraineenvoy, Keith Kellogg, who is seen as broadly sympathetic to Kyiv but is expected to step down in the coming weeks.It also contrasts with the declining political fortunes of Driscoll’s ostensible Pentagon boss, the defense secretary – or self-styled “secretary of war” – Pete Hegseth, who has apparently been deemed unsuitable for such a delicate task after a spate of controversies and negative headlines, including over his focus on troops’ grooming and physical fitness.“There’s not a lot of trust in Hegseth to deliver these messages to key leaders,” a person familiar with administration dynamicstold Politico. “There is more trust in Dan to do that right now.”Diplomatic neophyte that he may be, Driscoll’s advocates argue that his rise is due to more than just the default of others.Since being sworn in on 25 February, he is said to have impressed White House insiders as one of the administration’s most skillful performers.As army secretary, he is tasked with the unglamorous job of managing the budget and overseeing its 1 million-plus strong workforce of active duty personnel, national guard and reserve soldiers, as well as about 265,000 civilian employees.He has been involved in Trump’s controversial deployment of national guard units to US cities on law-and-order missions, a role that has taken him on regular visits to the White House.Also burnishing his internal reputation has been his assumption, since April, of an additional role of acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, taking over from the FBI director, Kash Patel, who had also held the post on a temporary basis.The son of a former soldier who served as an infantryman in Vietnam, Driscoll served in the US army more than three years, including a nine-month deployment to Iraq in 2009. Hisservicewas distinguished by several military awards, including an army commendation medal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It should’ve happened a long time ago … we’re trying to get it ended, one way or the other we have to get it ended.”Ukrainian and American officials will meet in Switzerland on Sunday for talks to discuss the plan. Security officials from France, Britain and Germany are expected to join them in Geneva.In the build-up to the talks, the US state department disputed claims by US senators from across the political spectrum that secretary of state Marco Rubio had told them the proposal “was not the administration’s plan” but a “wish list of the Russians”. The claim, made by figures including the independent senator Angus King, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, was “blatantly false”, said US state department deputy spokesman Tommy Piggott. Rubio latersaidin a post that the proposal was authored by the US “as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations” and was based on input from both sides.Trump’s Ukraine peace plan is a gift to Putin | Kenneth RothRead moreTrump has given Volodymyr Zelenskyy until Thursday to sign the28-point document. It calls on Kyiv to give up territory it currently controls to Russia, reduce the size of its army and relinquish long-range weapons. It also rules out a European peacekeeping force and sanctions for Russian war crimes.In a sombre address on Friday, Zelenskyy warned his country faces an impossible choice over the coming days between keeping its national dignity and losing a major partner in the shape of the US. It faces one of the most difficult moments in its history, he admitted.Speaking on Saturday, Zelenskyy said real or “dignified” peace was always based on “guaranteed security and justice”. He announced a negotiating team, appointed by presidential decree, that would soon meet its US counterparts in Geneva, led by his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.Another member of the Ukrainian delegation, former defence minister and national security council secretary Rustem Umerov, said there would be consultations with Washington “on the possible parameters of a future peace agreement”.Hinting at red lines, Umerov added: “Ukraine approaches this process with a clear understanding of its interests. This is another stage of the dialogue that has been ongoing in recent days and is primarily aimed at aligning our vision for the next steps.”Zelenskyy has sought to engage constructively with a White House seemingly determined to end the conflict on the Kremlin’s one-sided terms. He has made clear he cannot give up Ukraine’s sovereignty or abandon a constitution that enshrines the country’s current borders.At a meeting in South Africa, G20 leaders and the European Council issued a joint statement pushing back on Trump’s plan, saying it needs “additional work”. It said EU and Nato members would need to be consulted on some of its provisions, which rule out Kyiv’s Nato membership and put conditions on its future EU accession.US tells Nato if Zelenskyy does not sign peace deal Ukraine will face worse in futureRead moreUkrainian reaction to the text, drawn up by Putin’s envoyKirill Dmitrievand Trump’s representative, Steve Witkoff, has been overwhelmingly hostile. Commentators said it was a blueprint for another Russian invasion: not only of Ukraine but of other parts of Europe as well.Mustafa Nayyem, a journalist and politician who led Ukraine’s 2014 pro-democracy Maidan revolution, said it invited parallels with Chamberlain’s infamous Munich deal with Hitler. Trump’s peace plan came from the same “recognisable genre”, with the victim invited “to formulate his own defeat so everyone else can live easier”.In a Facebook post Nayyem said he was outraged by its “full” amnesty for Russian war crimes. It was an insult to people who had hidden in basements in Bucha or Mariupol – where Russian troops executed hundreds of civilians – and for those whose children had been forcibly deported toRussia, he said. “A rather cynical agreement,” he concluded.Speaking in Kyiv’s Golden Gate metro station, Dmytro Zarayskyi, 21, said Russia had been trying to control Ukraine politically and territorially “for years”. It conceded “barely anything” in the Trump agreement and continued to keep its forces on Ukrainian soil. “I think the deal is an attempt to break Ukraine and force unjust conditions on us,” he said.View image in fullscreenDmytro Zarayskyi at Zoloti Vorota metro station in Kyiv. ‘I think that this peace deal is a try to break Ukraine and force unjust conditions on Ukraine,’ he said.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianIf Zelenskyy signed off on the proposals Kyiv would be forced to give up its freedoms, he said.

Finland’s former prime minister Sanna Marin called it a catastrophe, not only for Ukraine and Ukrainians but for “all of the democratic world”. She said if the west showed weakness and ignorance – as it did in 2014 when Putin annexed Crimea – “more aggression and conflicts” would follow.The former prime minister of Belgium, Guy Verhofstadt, quoted Churchill’s definition of an appeaser as “one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last”. He added: “Trump now takes Putin’s side. Europe must choose again: appeasement or our values, imperialism or freedom.

The official national news agency said three missiles were fired at the building.Late on Sunday, Hezbollah confirmed “the great commander” Tabatabai had been killed in “a treacherous Israeli attack on the Haret Hreik area in the southern suburbs of Beirut”, without specifying his position within the group.Videos showed damaged buildings in the densely populated Haret Hreik area of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold.Israel has launched increasingly frequent airstrikes in southern Lebanon this month, which it says are intended to thwart a military revival by Hezbollah in the hills north of the de facto border.The campaign is also designed to increase pressure on the Lebanese authorities and army to move faster to disarm the organisation, a key requirement of last year’s ceasefire deal.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told his cabinet before the strike that Israel would continue to fight “terrorism” on several fronts. “We will continue to do whatever is necessary to prevent Hezbollah from reestablishing its ability to threaten us,” he said.After the strike, his office said in a statement: “In the heart of Beirut, the IDF attacked the Hezbollah chief of staff, who had been leading the terrorist organisation’s buildup and rearmament. Israel is determined to act to achieve its objectives everywhere and at all times.”The IDF insisted on Sunday evening that it “remains committed” to the ceasefire.A senior US official said Israel did not notify Washington in advance about the strike, according to an Axios reporter who posted on X.They cited the official as saying the Trump administration was informed immediately after the strike, and a second senior official as saying Washington had known for days that Israel was planning to escalate strikes in Lebanon.Israel used widely banned cluster munitions in Lebanon, photos of remnants suggestRead moreTabatabai, 58, who joined Hezbollah as a teenager soon after its foundation in the early 1980s, escaped an Israeli assassination attempt in 2015. The US imposed sanctions on him a year later, identifying him as the commander of the group’s special forces in Syria and Yemen, andoffering a rewardof as much as $5m (£3.8m) for information leading to his detention.Tabatabai led elite Hezbollah fighters in support of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and is thought to have tutored Houthi forces in Yemen. The Houthis and Hezbollah have close relationships with Iran.Tabatabai escaped Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah’s senior commanders during the 2023-24 war triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 incursion into southern Israel. An Israeli airstrike in Beirut in September 2024 killed the group’s veteran leader,Hassan Nasrallah, and by the time of the ceasefire some weeks later almost it entire military leadership had been killed.Hezbollah says it has abided by requirements for it to end its military presence in the border region near Israel, and for the Lebanese army to deploy there.The Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, called on the international community to intervene firmly to stop Israeli attacks on the country. Beirut “reiterates its call to the international community to assume its responsibility and intervene firmly and seriously to stop the attacks on Lebanon and its people”, he said in a statement.Israel’s Haaretz newspaper told readers last week that the“immediate flash point”was “now in Lebanon, not Gaza”, while Amit Segal, a journalist close to Netanyahu’s coalition government, said “a dramatic escalation against Hezbollah” was “more likely than not”.Explore more on these topicsLebanonHezbollahIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Then I stopped counting.”Majjar was one of the 18,500 married men in Gaza over the age of 25 who had permission from the Israeli authorities to enter the country, mostly to work in agriculture and construction. In the hours immediately after the Hamas attack, Israeli forces began rounding them up.Thousands of these workers were swept up in raidsacross Israel, imprisoned or deported back to Gaza with their work permits cancelled.Along with hundreds of other workers from Gaza, Majjar made his way to the West Bank, hoping to find refuge. He crossed the border at Barta’a, a town straddling Israel and the West Bank on the green line and long used by Palestinians to evade checks at official crossings. Eventually, he ended up at the stadium in Nablus where, in the first months of the war, nearly 1,000 Palestinians from Gaza were living.View image in fullscreenA stadium changing room converted into a dormitory where about 50 Palestinians from Gaza are living.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian“Slowly, some moved elsewhere in the West Bank,” says Majjar. “Others were arrested by Israeli forces during a raid here at the stadium. We haven’t heard from them since.”Today, about 50 Palestinians from Gaza remain, living in the crumbling rooms that once served as the stadium’s locker rooms. Most sleep on mattresses or battered sofas. A few electric fans offer the only relief from the suffocating summer heat, when temperatures in the West Bank can top 40C. Laundry hangs from the fences around the pitch.The Palestinian Authority’s labour ministry gives them about 700 shekels (£162) every one to three months– money they send to their families in Gaza, though only half makes it through, the rest eaten away by commissions. A handful have found short-term work for paltry pay.“My wife and two sons, aged four and six, live in a tent in the al-Mawasi camp, between Khan Younis and Rafah,” says Majjar. “Our house was destroyed […] And I’m here, unable to help them.”View image in fullscreenSamir Hajjaj Abu Salah looks out from his makeshift tent inside the Nablus municipal stadium.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian“I have seven children – two boys and five girls – the youngest is 11,” says Maher Qudeh, 53, who, before the war, worked south of Tel Aviv. “I knew a man who was here with us. He was from Gaza City. One day they told him his son had been killed. He had a heart attack from the shock and died that same day.”View image in fullscreenA group of people who live in a makeshift tent inside the Nablus municipal stadium.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian“There was a man who came to this stadium after the start of the war,” says Wajdi Yaeesh, director of the Human Supporters Association in Nablus, which provides food and aid to Palestinians from Gaza living in the city. “He had written the names of his eight children on the wall beside his bed. Before he left the stadium to move elsewhere, he had already crossed out four of those names – the ones who had been killed in Gaza.”In Nablus there are also at least seven women from Gaza who are either cancer patients themselves or mothers of children with cancer. Like many others, they had received authorisation before Hamas’s 7 October attack to leave the strip for medical treatment. After the outbreak of war, however, the Israeli authorities urged hospital officials to provide lists of patients deemed fit for discharge so they could be returned to Gaza. Although an Israeli court blocked the deportations, many of the women moved to the West Bank. In March 2024,the Guardian visited a Jerusalem hospitalwhere at least five children from Gaza were being treated for cancer. Today, all those children are dead. Their mothers, cut off from the rest of their families still in Gaza, have since relocated to towns in the West Bank.View image in fullscreenThe governor of Nablus, Ghassan Daghlas, in his office.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianAccording to figuresfrom the Qatar Red Crescent and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, more than 4,400 stranded Palestinian workers and patients from Gaza are currently in the West Bank.Khaled, 51, from Tuffah – one of the four quarters of Gaza’s Old City – still carries the pain of not being by the side of two of his five children, aged 10 and 19, when they were killed in an Israeli airstrike last year.“Now, with the truce, I only hope to hold my three surviving children and my wife again,” says Khaled, who has since become the cook for displaced Palestinians from Gaza sheltering in the stadium. “I just want to go back to Gaza as soon as possible.”Others, however, have lost faith in returning. Samir Hajjaj Abu Salah, 55, from Khan Younis, is convinced there is no longer a future among Gaza’s ruins.“I never want to set foot in my home again,” he says. “Once my family is evacuated, we’ll settle somewhere far from the Strip.”Explore more on these topicsPalestineGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We have daily crises, and the same shortages and deficiencies in supplies, and we are still exhausted as we are still receiving lots of casualties.“There isn’t much difference from the period before the ceasefire. Unfortunately, the bombing is still going on … We don’t feel there is a big change.”Humanitarian organisations have sent hundreds of tonnes of supplies intoGazasince the US-backed ceasefire came into effect last month but stocks of medicine and supplies remain insufficient.Shelter and food in desperately short supply as Gaza braces for harsh winterRead moreJoe Belliveau, the executive director of MedGlobal, a US-based NGO, speaking from al-Mawasi, in southern Gaza, said: “There are staff shortages, not enough ambulances … The whole health system is still on its knees, with critical shortages across the board.”Gaza’s health ministry has reported more than 300 deaths in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire, and medics say huge numbers of people are suffering the consequences of malnutrition, adverse weather conditions, alack of shelterand new outbreaks of disease.The first stage of the ceasefire agreement, which led to a part withdrawal by Israel from about half of Gaza and the return of all living hostages held by Hamas, is now close to completion.The next stage, which received a boost when the UN security councilendorsedDonald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza on Monday, calls for the creation of a committee of Palestinian technocrats to run the territory under the ultimate authority of the US president, and the deployment of an international stabilisation force.The continuing violence in Gaza has strained the ceasefire, though both sides say they are committed to the agreement.The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said five senior Hamas members were killed in Israeli strikes on Saturday, while health officials in Gaza reported at least 24 people killed and another 54 injured, including children.“We are continuing to strike terrorism on several fronts,” Netanyahu said on Sunday.Analysts said Israel appeared to be using any alleged violation of the ceasefire to continue its effort to degrade Hamas’s military capabilities through killing its leaders.One of the Israeli strikes in Gaza on Saturday targeted a vehicle, killing 11 people and injuring more than 20 in Gaza City’s Rimal neighbourhood, said Rami Mhanna, the managing director of al-Shifa hospital, where the casualties were taken.A strike targeting a house near al-Awda hospital in central Gaza killed at least three people and injured 11, while another strike on a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed three people, including a woman, medical officials said.“Suddenly, I heard a powerful explosion. I looked outside and saw smoke covering the entire area. I couldn’t see a thing. I covered my ears and started shouting to the others in the tent to run,” Khalil Abu Hatab in Deir al-Balah told the Associated Press.“When I looked again, I realised the upper floor of my neighbour’s house was gone,” Abu Hatab said. “It’s a fragile ceasefire. This is not a life we can live. There’s no safe place.”Many of the casualties were taken to Nasser hospital, the biggest of the 13 major health facilities that are still functioning in Gaza.Saqr said: “In the last attack we received 12 dead; among them were four children and two women. And among 24 injuries, 18 were women and children. We feel we are still in the war and no big difference. The situation is very hard.”The international medical NGOMédecins Sans Frontièressaid its teams in Gaza City and Khan Younis treated at least six patients, including a 15-year-old and a 71-year-old man, with injuries caused by Israeli airstrikes and bullets.Fundraisers warn of ‘catastrophic’ drop in donations to Gaza since ceasefireRead moreIsrael’s military said it launched attacks after an “extreme violation” of the ceasefire involving an “armed terrorist” who crossed into an Israeli-held area and shot at troops in southern Gaza. Soldiers also killed 11 militants who emerged from a tunnel in the Rafah area, a military spokesperson said, and two others in northern Gaza who advanced toward soldiers.More food supplies are getting into Gaza since the October ceasefire but the amount is still falling short of the huge humanitarian need for supplies.Belliveau said: “We have seen malnutrition stabilise and that has really improved. The World Health Organization have had modest success getting medicine and medical supplies in but [MedGlobal] have two lorry loads that are stuck since 10 October waiting for permission from Israel.”Israel denies accusations it is deliberately obstructing aid, and accuses Hamas of stealing humanitarian assistance.Cogat, the Israeli ministry of defence agency that administers entry to Gaza,said last week: “Aid is flowing … Hundreds of trucks daily carrying food, medical equipment and shelter supplies.”A contingent of US military officials is reportedly working with Israeli authorities on the entry and eventual distribution of aid in Gaza, though its influence is unclear.Egypt, Qatar and the US have been mediating between Hamas and Israel, securing the ceasefire that came into effect last month.A senior Hamas delegation met Egypt’s intelligence chief in Cairo on Sunday to discuss the ceasefire agreement and the situation in Gaza, the group said.The movement said it also discussed with Egypt ways to urgently resolve the issue of approximately 100 armed Hamas militants still in tunnels under the Israel-controlled part of Gaza, adding that communication with them had been cut off.The two-year war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 during a surprise attack into Israel in October 2023. The Islamist organisation is still holding the remains of three hostages.More than 69,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the ensuing Israeli offensive and in strikes since the ceasefire. The bodies of thousands moreremain under the rubble.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The president greeted the prince on the south lawn, the White House’s biggest stage. There were uniformed men on horses bearing flags and a flypast of fighter jets.Once inside the newly gilded Oval Office, Trump came across as a man besotted. He grabbed at the prince’s hand and declared more than once what an honour it was to lay claim to the royal friendship. When a journalist pierced this golden bubble by raising the 2018 murder and dismemberment of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi – the main reason Prince Mohammed had not visited for seven years –Trump lashed out, lambasting the reporter and her network, ABC.What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? Trump resurfaces memories of journalist’s brutal murderRead moreHe declared that Khashoggi was “extremely controversial” and not universally liked (as if those were grounds for being butchered) and insisted the prince had known nothing about themurder in Istanbulby Saudi state operatives, in direct contradiction of the conclusions drawn by US intelligence.Trump’s disregard for human rights and US intelligence agencies and his blatant fandom for autocrats are nothing new.US foreign policyhad already shifted decisively in that direction in January, as soon as he took office for the second time. If there was a real shift on show during Prince Mohammed’s visit on Tuesday, it was in the skies over Washington.The F-35 stealth fighter jets on show in the flypast for the visiting royal are up for sale toSaudi Arabia, Trump confirmed. The sale would not be conditional and the specifications of Saudi F-35s would be the same as Israel’s.If the deal goes forward, it will cut against one of the abiding principles of US-Israeli relations – thatIsraelalways gets to buy the best military hardware, giving it a prized “qualitative edge” over other US allies in the region. Appearing to dump that principle, Trump made clear that both countries would get the best as they are equally close to Washington.“[Saudi Arabia] is a great ally and Israel’s a great ally,” the president said. “As far as I’m concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line.”That is not language that Israel likes to hear out of Washington and it was the latest of several setbacks in the bilateral relationship in recent months.Potentially of equal importance to the F35 sale, the administration has announced it would lift the ban on selling advanced AI chips to Saudi Arabia and theUnited Arab Emirates(UAE). The decision significantly boosts Riyadh’s ambitions of becoming a global tech hub with vast energy-intensive datacentres that will be the foundations of the global AI economy in which Saudi Arabia and the US could take a lead together.Gregory Gause, a visiting scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, compared the ambitions of a US-Saudi partnership in the AI economy with the US corporate-led development of Saudi oilfields in the 1930s.“It could be a real solid link between the countries – a better guarantee of an American commitment to Saudi security than anything that could be written on a piece of paper,” Gause said.View image in fullscreenTrump came across as a man besotted when Mohammed bin Salman visted the White House on his state visit.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersThere were other recent events which suggested at least a temporary US move away from Israeli primacy in Middle East policy. On Monday, aUS-drafted UN security council resolutionincluded language about a possible pathway to an independent Palestine, despite desperate Israeli efforts to have the clause removed.A few months earlier, at the end of June, Trumplifted some sanctionson Syria, again in conflict with Israeli preferences. And in May he toured the Middle East to showcase his foreign policy, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, but not Israel.All this marks a drift in US Middle East policy from what was arguably the high point in the US-Israeli relationship, when Trump fulfilled Benjamin Netanyahu’s longstanding aim and joined Israel inairstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilitiesin June,triggering anxietyacross the Gulf.“Saudi leaders were alarmed at how quickly the conflict threatened to spill across the region,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of theMiddle East and north Africaprogramme at the Chatham House foreign policy thinktank.“Although a fragile ceasefire holds for now, Riyadh remains wary that another confrontation could erupt with little warning.”In the wake of the Iran strikes, Netanyahu seems to have taken Washington’s backing for granted and overreached,bombing a target in the Qatari capital, Doha, in a bid to kill Hamas officials. Trump reportedly had very little notice of the plan to bomb a close regional ally.Trump reacted by humiliating Netanyahu during his visit to the White House in late September, forcing him to call his Qatari counterpart from the Oval Office in order to apologise.Saudi Prince Mohammed is being lavished with praise by Trump. It’s clear why | Mohamad BazziRead moreIn Trump’s transactional White House, it is hard for Israel to compete against the Gulf. Prince Mohammed promised $1tn in Saudi investment in the US economy. Qatar has given Trump a$400m luxury planeto use as a new Air Force One.The flow of huge amounts of money occurs in both public and private spheres. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE have together invested near $5bn in a fund managed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.Trump has consistently shown he has a greater affinity with absolute rulers than elected leaders. Prince Mohammed faces none of the constraints that trouble Netanyahu as he struggles to keep his coalition together.Prince Mohammed also consistently makes clear if the US disappoints, his kingdom will go to China for the hardware and security guarantees it needs.The fear that Saudi Arabia might be “lost” to China dates back to the previous administration. It contributed to a reversal in former president Joe Biden’s position on Prince Mohammed, from “pariah” for the slaughter of Khashoggi, to a humiliating climbdown, a visit to Jeddah in July 2022, and a notoriousfist bumpwith the prince.Some observers argue that the wind-shifts of the past few months do not add up to a US “reset” in the Middle East policy. They point out that, beneath the razzle-dazzle of the Saudi visit, there are aspects of the discussion that are more superficial than they initially seemed.View image in fullscreenTrump humiliated Netanyahu when he forced him to call his Qatari counterpart from the Oval Office in order to apologise for bombing Doha.Photograph: Alex Wong/GettyAnnouncing the $1tn investment promise, Prince Mohammed did not mention a timescale. Nor is it clear how many F-35 the US will sell to Riyadh. Several items on the summit agenda do not look as if they are coming to fruition any time soon, like a bilateral defence pact and a civil nuclear power agreement, which can be blocked by Congress.The prospect of Saudi normalisation of relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords came up but was politely shelved by the crown prince. He made clear that normalisation would depend on a solid commitment to a Palestinian state, considerably more than the vague, conditional language inMonday’s security council resolution.When it comes to Gaza and Palestine as a whole, Daniel Levy, the president of the US/Middle East Project and an analyst of the region, sees very little prospect of change.“On the Palestinian file, there’s no joy at all, I would argue,” Levy said. “I think Israel has a very free hand. They’ve got the hostages out, and they’re still bombing Gaza.”But in the bigger picture, he argued that when it comes to US policy in the Middle East, the more it changes, the more it stays the same.“If you just strip away some of the particular stupidity of the Biden administration and add the familial self-interest of the Trump administration, and throw into the mix reactions to events and some of the excesses of Israeli overreach, I don’t think we’re seeing a fundamental reset,” Levy added.US policy over the years has not essentially changed, he argued. “It is policy primarily driven by people with a very shallow understanding of the region essentially taking their cues from Israel and a smattering of rulers in the region.”"

Graham said neither Reeves not Keir Starmer should stay in post ifthe budgetwas not Labour enough, by hitting either working people or those who are sick and cannot work rather than the richest in society.As she seeks to head off criticism, Reeves will say she plans to bring in an extra £1.2bn in savings by identifying incorrect universal credit payments up to 2031.A Treasury source said: “We will never tolerate fraud, error or waste in the welfare system – every pound of taxpayers’ money should be spent with the same care with which working people spend their own money.“That’s why the chancellor is doubling down on this next week – extending targeted case reviews to save taxpayers billions and ensure help goes to those who genuinely need it, and safeguard taxpayers’ money so it can be invested in the public services we all deserve.”The government is also freezing rail fares and prescription fees, as well as moving to take some levies off electricity bills, at the same time as bringing in billions in tax rises.Some of the tax rises Reeves is likely to opt for include:Freezing income tax thresholds for an extra two years to 2030, bringing more people into higher tax bands as wages rise.Making salary sacrifice schemes less generous, including those for pension contributions.Apay-per-mile schemeon electric cars to help fill the tax gap from petrol duty as more people opt for green vehicles.Bringing in higher tax on the most expensive properties, including a surcharge on the highest-value houses. The surcharge will reportedly be targeted at homes worth more than £2m, after worries that a lower £1.5m threshold would hit too many in the south-east.Whitehall sources said the chancellor was unlikely to attempt further big savings on the welfare bill in the budget, after scaling back cuts to disability benefits in the face of a huge Labour revolt earlier this year.Reeves has explored the possibility of cuts to theMotability scheme, which allows claimants to use their personal independence payment towards new cars, but disability groups have warned of severe consequences if she goes ahead with the scale of changes that have been floated.Reeves signalled in an article for the Sunday Times this weekend that she was still committed to “reform” of the welfare system. However, this is not likely to take place until after recommendations from the Labour minister Stephen Timms’s review of disability benefits, and the former cabinet minister Alan Milburn’s review of young people not in employment, both due later next year.Milburn said this weekend there should be “no no-go areas” when it came to reform of the benefits system, and he has previously said the UK cannot afford to back off from changes to welfare.Reeves said her budget, which must fill a £20bn fiscal hole, would focus on helping people with the cost of living and would target inflation.The Treasury said the budget would confirm a rise in state pensions worth more than £550 a year, an extra £120 compared with the amount they would have increased by if they had been uprated by inflation, because of Labour’s commitment to the triple lock. The government is seeking to rebuild trust with older voters after infuriating many by removing the winter fuel allowance and then making a partial U-turn.Reeves said: “Whether it’s our commitment to the triple lock or to rebuilding our NHS to cut waiting lists, we’re supporting pensioners to give them the security in retirement they deserve.”The chancellor had spoken out in the run-up to the budget, saying she is“sick of people mansplaining how to be chancellor”after weeks of criticism from the right and left.Starmer defended his chancellor, saying women in public life faced more abuse than men. The prime minister said he was proud to have appointed Britain’s first ever female chancellor, adding that she and other women in politics and the media get attacked more frequently than their male colleagues.“I’m really proud to have the first female chancellor ever. I’m really proud that we’ve got a female chancellor who’s doing a really good job,” he said. “I strongly believe that women in public life get much more criticism and abuse than men. That is in politics, but it’s also across a number of other areas – I’d also say the media, frankly – and I think we need to acknowledge that.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025WelfareRachel ReevesLabourTax and spendingEconomic policyBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

The result was high and he subsequently had a biopsy that revealed the cancer.Lord Cameron, 59, told the Times: “You always hope for the best. You have a high PSA score – that’s probably nothing.Experts consider ‘targeted’ prostate cancer screening to reduce UK deathsRead more“You have an MRI scan with a few black marks on it. You think, ‘Ah, that’s probably OK.’ But when the biopsy comes back, and it says you have got prostate cancer.“You always dread hearing those words. And then literally as they’re coming out of the doctor’s mouth you’re thinking, ‘Oh, no, he’s going to say it. He’s going to say it. Oh God, he said it.’”The former Conservative party leader was urged to get tested by his wife, Samantha, after the couple heard the founder of Soho House, Nick Jones, speaking about his diagnosis on the radio, the Times reported.Cameron received focal therapy for treatment, in which electrical pulses target and destroy cancer cells.He has called on the government to introduce screening to detect cases earlier, when treatment is more likely to succeed.The peer said: “I want to, as it were, come out. I want to add my name to the long list of people calling for a targeted screening programme.“I don’t particularly like discussing my personal intimate health issues, but I feel I ought to. Let’s be honest. Men are not very good at talking about their health. We tend to put things off.”Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the UK, with about 55,000 new cases every year.There is no screening programme for the form of the disease in the UK because of concerns about the accuracy of PSA tests.In October 2024, Chris Hoy, the six-time Olympic gold medallist,disclosed he has a terminal cancer diagnosis.He said a scan found the main cancer to be in his prostate that had metastasised to his shoulder, pelvis, hip, ribs and spine and was stage 4.Cameron resigned as prime minister and as an MP in his Oxfordshire seat of Witney in 2016. He was made foreign secretary by then-prime minister Rishi Sunak in 2023 and was also made a life peer and a member of the House of Lords.His announcement comes days after the first eligible men in the UK were invited to join a major trial testing the most promising screening techniques for the disease.The Transform project will compare screening methods to current NHS diagnostic processes – which can include blood tests and biopsies.It will be delivered in partnership with the NHS through the National Institute for Health and Care Research, which has committed £16m in funding, with the remainder coming from charity ProstateCancerUK.The launch comes as the UK National Screening Committee prepares to announce its decision on whether current evidence supports the introduction of screening for the disease.Chiara De Biase, director of health services, equity and improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “We’re glad to hear that David Cameron found his prostate cancer at an early stage and had successful treatment.“We thank him for sharing his story and in doing so raising vital awareness of this disease, which is completely curable if found early. But men’s lives should not be left to chance.“We lose 12,000 dads, brothers, sons and friends to this disease every year. We’ve reached a tipping point in the UK, with too many men dying from a curable disease and worse outcomes for men at higher risk like black men and men from working-class communities.“Prostate cancer is the last major cancer without a screening programme, and we need change now.”Explore more on these topicsDavid CameronProstate cancerCancernewsShareReuse this content"

People will have much less need to go to or stay in hospital if they can access diagnostic tests, outpatient appointments and treatment at home or in community settings, to reflect the changed nature of illness that an ageing population has brought, it says.Rosie Beacon, the author of the report, said: “It’s less about counting beds but about what hospitals do and how they do it. Hospitals can become smaller because you can give people the same standard – and often a better range – of care without them being physically present. That [would produce] lower long-term running costs and a system that’s financially sustainable.“Hospitals shouldn’t be made smaller just for the sake of it but because how and where we deliver secondary care no longer needs to be confined to a hospital bed.NHS failing to cut waiting times as promised in recovery plan, report warnsRead more“The natural consequence of a health service that succeeds in reducing hospital footfall, through better prevention and faster treatment, is that hospitals themselves will look smaller and different. Being honest about that isn’t radical; it’s simply facing up to what a modern, preventative NHS requires.”She added: “A smaller hospital footprint is simply the outcome of care becoming faster and more effective. It’s not about cutting services. It’s about delivering them in ways that are faster, more convenient and more financially sustainable.”The supply of general and acute beds in hospitals in England has fallen from 180,889 in 1987-88 to100,916 last month, NHS England figures show. Advances in treatment have given patients shorter stays, relieving pressure on beds. But hospitals have to create thousands of extra beds to help them cope with the usual “winter crisis”.Prof Joe Harrison, the chief executive of Milton Keynes university hospital NHS trust, said: “The only route to stabilising the service, improving access and quality of care, and relieving pressure on exhausted staff is radically rethinking what hospitals do and how they do it.”He said the scale of the crisis facing the NHS was so great that bosses “must be prepared to ask the difficult questions and take the difficult decisions” about how services are delivered.In a foreword to Re:State’s report, the chief executives of NHS Confederation and NHS Providers, which represent England’s 215 health trusts, endorse the case for radical reform of hospitals.While the NHS was “visionary” when it was created in 1948, “that founding vision feels increasingly fragile”, say Matthew Taylor and Daniel Elkeles. “Once revered globally, the NHS has become a service more characterised by waiting than by healing. A model designed in 1945 is not fit for 2025. As the most expensive part of the system, reimagining the hospital must be at the heart of service reforms.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said it was already shifting care out of hospitals as part of its “three big shifts” to revive the NHS.“Pioneering neighbourhood health centres will provide easier, more convenient access to a full range of healthcare services right on people’s doorsteps, stopping them from having to make lengthy trips to hospital,” the spokesperson said.“Community diagnostic centres – many of which are open 12 hours a day, seven days a week – let people get tests, checks and scans closer to home, again reducing strain on crowded hospitals.“The hospitals of the future are being built with more single-patient rooms and with careful consideration of demographics, as well as maximising the latest technology for greater efficiency and sustainability.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

She was sent to the psychiatric institute in 2018 after pleading guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in a deal with prosecutors to avoid prison.Geyser’s attorney, Tony Cotton, said on Sunday that he did not know what happened with his client and urged Geyser to turn herself in.“It’s in her best interest for her to turn herself in immediately and not continue with this course of action,” Cotton said in an Instagram video post where he addressed Geyser directly at times. “We don’t know any of the facts about what happened or who might have assisted her.”Authorities say Geyser and her friend, Anissa Weier, were 12 years old when they lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a suburbanMilwaukeepark after a sleepover. Geyser stabbed Leutner more than a dozen times while Weier egged her on. Leutner barely survived.The girls later told investigators that they attacked Leutner to earn the right to be Slender Man’s servants and they feared he would harm their families if they didn’t follow through.Slender Man was created online by Eric Knudsen in 2009 as a mysterious figure photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He grew into a popular bogeyman, appearing in video games, online stories and a2018 movie.Weier pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree intentional homicide. She was also sent to the psychiatric center and granted release in 2021.Explore more on these topicsWisconsinUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, it produced warm words, with Trump even saying, “I feel very confident that he can do a good job” and adding, “I think he’s going to surprise some conservative people, actually.”2:55Key moments from the Trump-Mamdani Oval Office news conference – video wrapThe pairagreedto work together on housing, food prices and cost-of-living concerns, and bonded over a mutual love for New York. “We agreed a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump said in the Oval Office, sometimes jumping in to shield Mamdani from aggressive questioning from the press.“It was a conversation where we spoke about the need to deliver on this agenda,” Mamdani told NBC on Sunday, saying that he appreciated how the president took the time to tour him around the cabinet and point out the portraits of previous presidents. “We were not shy about the places of disagreement about the politics that has brought us to this moment and we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on.”Mamdani also addressed questions about his decision to retain police commissioner Jessica Tisch, initially hired by former mayor Eric Adams. “She has driven down crime across the five boroughs while starting to uproot corruption that was endemic in the top echelons of that department under Mayor Adams,” Mamdani said.Kevin Hasset, director of the National Economic Council, which works with the treasury secretary to push forward Trump’s economic agenda,praisedthe move on Sunday and said the White House was pleased with it.“We are really reassured that [Mamdani has] kept the police commissioner. In previous administrations in New York, we have seen law and order really go south,” Hassett told hostJake Tapperon CNN’s State of the Union.“Do the mayor-elect and I agree on everything? No, we don’t,” wrote Tisch in an email to rank-and-file officers, according to the New York Times. She has supported Adams’s plan to hire 5,000 more uniformed officers, whereas Mamdani has said he wants to keep the head count the same.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpZohran MamdaniTrump administrationUS politicsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

In a video shared to the outlet by Cesar Jimenez, Christian can reportedly be heard asserting his citizenship while an officer responds “get out of the car” and “I don’t care.”Christian Jimenez was taken to the ICE facility in southPortlandand released shortly before 7pm the same day, his brother said. Cesar Jimenez added that authorities are now attempting to charge Christian with “interference or obstruction of investigation”.McMinnville high school’s superintendent, Kourtney Ferrua, addressed the situation in amessageto families, confirming that the student, who had been off campus for lunch, was detained by immigration agents but later identified as a US citizen and reunited with his family.Ferrua emphasized that the school district does not allow anyone who does not have business in the school to enter during the day. She added that students are only released to adults who are approved to pick them up.“The experience of an emotional event such as this one can have an impact on all of our students,” Ferrua wrote, adding: “Our goal is to keep our schools running as a safe and predictable routine, which is in the best interests of all of our students.”An immigrant advocacy organization told Oregon Live that ICEdetained fourUS citizens near Portland this week, including Jimenez and two people recording officers.Miriam Vargas Corona, the executive director of Unidos Bridging Community, toldKGWthat six individuals were detained on Friday: four in McMinnville, one in Dundee, and one in Newberg.

A fancy cheese or apple roll felt like a family treat. But not any more. “We can’t afford to do those little luxuries any more because they’re just too expensive to feed five with,” says Cat Hill. “There’s not any wiggle room.”The 43-year-old from Hornby, New York, has been hit by both higher grocery prices and rising costs for her small business running a horse stable. UnderDonald Trump, she worries it may get even harder. “With this administration, it doesn’t appear to be stabilising,” she adds. “It’s hard to think about how exactly we are going to ride this out.”Hill is among millions of people feeling the pain of the US’s affordability crisis. The costs of groceries, housing, childcare, education and healthcare have become intolerable to many, who in turn put the blame on politicians. As Thanksgiving approaches, it appears that the US president is belatedly waking up to the problem andscrambling for answers.During last year’s election campaign, Trump was all too conscious of the political utility of the high cost of living. He promised voters that he would bring downprices “starting on day one”. But two days after winning, he changed course by remarking: “Our groceries are way down.Everything is way down … So I don’t want to hear about the affordability.”Much of the first year of Trump’s second term was then dominated by his trade wars, his draconian crackdown on illegal immigration, his decision to send national guard troops into American cities and the longest government shutdown in history.But voters had other concerns. Prices rose in five of the six main grocery groups tracked in the consumer price index from January to September. These includemeats, poultry and fish(up 4.5%),non-alcoholic beverages(up 2.8%) andfruits and vegetables(up 1.3%).Officials at the Federal Reserve have long been clear that Trump’s tariffs caused inflation, though it is uncertain how long the effects will last. Consumer prices had been increasing at an annual rate of 2.3% in April when Trump launched the import taxes and that rate accelerated to 3% in September.Adding insult to injury, even as the shutdown deepened the financial woes of many, Trumplaunched remodeling projectsincluding a gilded ballroom attached to the White House and threw a Great Gatsby-themed party at his luxurious Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.Tara Setmayer, co-founder and chief executive of the Seneca Project, a women-led Super Pac, said:“The ads write themselves [for the midterm elections] in 2026 when you have a president who promised to make the American people’s lives better – and who was supposed to be a champion of the working class and not of the elite – bragging repeatedly from his gilded Oval Office while military families are on food bank lines.“It’s so tone-deaf and so ‘let them eat cake’ it’s hard to believe that he’s serious about this but he is and keeps constantly doing this.It screams: ‘I don’t give a damn about everyday people,’ and his base is beginning to wake up to the fact that perhaps he doesn’t care about us.”The shutdown froze the collection of the most recent data but it is clear that peoplefeellike prices are too high. Consumer sentiment dropped to a near record low in November, going from 71.8 out of 100 in November 2024 to 51, according to the University of Michigan’sSurveys of Consumers.View image in fullscreenA grocery store in Los Angeles, California, on 12 August 2025.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPAJoanne Hsu, the director of the survey and an economist at the University of Michigan, said that even while concerns over tariffs have started to level off, consumers are still experiencing higher prices.Consumers “are continuing to be very frustrated by these high prices”, Hsu said. “They feel like those high prices are eroding their living standard, and they just don’t feel like they’re thriving at the end of the day.”It was against this backdrop that Republicans were blindsided by this month’s elections whenDemocrats swept the boardfrom New York to Virginia with a message laser-focused on affordability. Economic worries were the dominant concern for voters, according to the AP Voter Poll.Trump entered a period of denial. He posted on social media: “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems. It is a complete CON JOB. Thanksgiving costs are 25% lower this year than last, under Crooked Joe! We are the Party of Affordability!”But he was also stung into action. He conceded that some consumer costs are “a little bit higher” and floated some half-formed ideas to ease financial pressures. He said he may stretch the 30-year mortgage to 50 years to reduce the size of monthly payments.He partially backtracked on tariffs, a core part of his economic agenda, reducing levies on imports of products such as coffee, beef and tropical fruit, admitting they “may, in some cases” have contributed to higher prices.Adam Green, co-founder of theProgressive Change Campaign Committee, said:“The fact that Trump decided to lower tariffs on coffee and bananas is a complete admission that across the economy he is jacking up prices on millions of families. That was a big tell and Democrats should be exploiting that.“Every Democrat should be going to a supermarket pointing to bananas and coffee on social media and saying, if you see prices come down, that is Trump admitting that he’s jacking up prices everywhere: your car, your baby diapers, your other foods.”Trump also proposed a $2,000 dividend, funded by tariff revenue, for all Americans except the rich. This could take the form of a cheque bearing his signature, reminiscent of stimulus cheques he sent to millions of Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic.But Republicans on Capitol Hill weredistinctly scepticalabout the idea at a time when the federal government is burdened by debt, warning that the Trump cheques could fuel even further inflation.It might be too little too late. In a recent Fox News poll, 76% of respondents had a negative view of the state of the economy – down 9% since July. In a Marquette University survey, 72% disapproved of Trump’s handling of inflation and the cost of living. And in a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 65% of respondents, including a third of Republicans, disapproved of Trump’s handling of the cost of living.On Monday, Trump used a summit sponsored by McDonald’s to insist the economy was moving in the right direction and cast blame on his predecessor, Joe Biden. “We had the highest, think of it, the highest inflation in the history of our country,” he said.“Now we have normal inflation. We’re going to get it a little bit lower, frankly, but we have normal, we’ve normalized it, we have it down to a low level, but we’re going to get it a little bit lower. We want perfection.”But Trump’s troubles might be giving voters a feeling of déjà vu. Biden tried to convince Americans that the economy was strong. “Bidenomics is working,” he said in a 2023 speech. “Today, the US has had the highest economic growth rate, leading the world economies since the pandemic.”His arguments did little to sway voters as only 36% of adults in August 2023 approved of his handling of the economy, according to a poll at the time by the Associated Press-Norc Center for Public Affairs Research.Now Trump is leaning on a message that echoes Biden’s claims in 2021 that elevated inflation is simply a “transitory” problem that will soon disappear. “We’re going to be hitting 1.5% pretty soon,” he told reporters earlier this month. ”It’s all coming down.”ButJared Bernstein, a former chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under Biden, disputes the notion that Biden and Trump were equally guilty of downplaying inflation. He said:“We were talking past people. They’re telling people things that are false. In terms of ineffective messaging, those are equivalent. In terms of truthfulness, one is is honest and the other is false.”Bernstein, now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress thinktank, added: “They’re making a very consequential mistake, which is strongly, loudly asserting that people are better off than they know they are. What’s fascinating about all this to me is thatDonald Trumpbelieves, correctly, that he has a superpower. He can get his followers to believe whatever reality he puts out there, and that’s worked for him for a very long time but it won’t work on this. Affordability is kryptonite to his superpower because his followers know which way is up when it comes to prices.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump tariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The US has not – by choiceEduardo PorterDespite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But this is no glitch – it’s the systemSun 23 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTShareThe Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, thenumber was brought down to zero. Unfortunately, the United States wasnot as successful. More than 4 million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that much further ahead.Graph of China and the US poverty ratesBut this story ignores how the US chooses to spend its riches. It seems reasonable that the success of a society and its system of government, the morality of its political compromises and agreements, would be determined to an important degree by how it chooses to deploy the fruits of its accomplishments and how it apportions the costs of its failures.Unlike China, the US did not offer much to the people eking out a living around the poverty line. Per head, the US’s economic output is six times China’s, and yet, inexplicably, there seem to be more abjectly poor Americans than Chinese.The story of US inequality is known by now. It is nonetheless breathtaking how its lopsideddistribution of incomekeeps getting worse. In 1980, the income of Americans in the middle of the income distribution added up to a bit more than 52.5% of the income of those perched at the top 90th percentile. At the turn of the century, it was 48%. By 2023, it had slipped further, to 42.5%.The poor’s share of the US economic pie is shrinking to developing-world levels. The income of Americans in the top 90th percentile of wealth grew more than twice as fast between 2000 and 2023 as that of Americans in the bottom 10th percentile. These days, Americans in the poorest 10th of the population draw about1.8% of the nation’s income, about the same as poor Bolivians. In Nigeria, they reap 3%, in China 3.1%, in Bangladesh 3.7%.It would be comfortable to blame market forces. They have played a critical role in shaping the US’s distribution of success. Globalization and technology have not only contributed to reduce the share of national income that is spent on labor. They have also exacerbated inequalities among the working class, rewarding the most educated workers while replacing the less skilled with robots.And yet, a summary glance at the Trump administration’s main initiatives – the president’s Big Beautiful Bill Act and his indiscriminate tariffs, which will raise the price of many staples and produce a drag on business spending and employment – underscores how the US’s dismal performance at sharing the fruits of its success with the less well-to-do in its society is not some bug in American capitalism. It is a feature.The legislation will take health coverage from millions of people and dramatically raise healthcare costs for millions more through massive cuts to Medicaid and the health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. It will trim hundreds of billions from the Snap nutrition assistance program for the poor. Altogether, the latest estimate by theBudget Lab at Yalefinds that the impact of Trump’s tariffs and his big, beautiful bill will trim household income for all except the richest fifth of American families. The bottom 10% would suffer a 7% cut.Sure, America’s indifference towards its poor did not appear suddenly during the Trump administration. It’s been a feature of Democratic and Republican governments over the last 50 years, letting appeals to market efficiency trump calls to address the US’s growing inequalities. Since Jimmy Carter left office, the income of the rich has grown more than that of the poor in every administration except that of Bill Clinton and, yep, Donald Trump’s first, when subsidies to respond to the Covid pandemic raised incomes across the poorer half of the population.What’s telling is that despite Trump’s claims to represent the common American worker trodden upon by indifferent economic forces, he is out to exacerbate the ills of American capitalism. The millions of angry Maga followers applauding Trump’s swipes at an unfair global order will eventually come to find that the rhetoric may have changed, but the US is not about to change the way it shares its riches.This is not to congratulateChinafor its authoritarian government, for its repression of minorities or for the iron fist it deploys against any form of dissent. But it merits pondering how this undemocratic government could successfully slash its poverty rate when the richest and oldest democracy in the world wouldn’t.Explore more on these topicsUS income inequalityEconomicsInequalityChinaDonald TrumpTrump administrationAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

He told fans at Fukuoka Kokusai Center that he was glad that he was able to compete to the best of his abilities.“I am happy that I am able to achieve a goal of mine,” he said of his victory, which was also televised.Yavhusishyn, who arrived in Japan three years ago after fleeing Ukraine, has climbed the sumo ranks at record speed. The Japan Sumo Association will soon hold a special meeting to promote him to “ozeki”, the second highest ranking under “yokozuna”, or grand champion, national broadcaster NHK said.He competed in the world junior sumo championships as a teenager but left Ukraine after Russia’s February 2022 invasion. Yavhusishyn, who is listed at 6ft tall and 310lbs, arrived in Japan two months later and made a blistering start to his career, reaching sumo’s upper divisions in only a year and winning promotion to the fourth-highest rank.Yavhusishyn was born in Vinnytsia in central Ukraine and took up sumo at the age of seven, becoming a national champion when he was 17. His age meant he narrowly avoided Ukraine’s military draft for men aged 18 and older when war broke out and he sought refuge in Germany before moving to Japan. His parents stayed in Germany and he arrived in Japan knowing nothing of the language. He initially lived and trained with a Japanese sumo wrestler, Arata Yamanaka, who he made friends with at the world junior sumo championships.View image in fullscreenDanylo Yavhusishyn poses with his trophy after his victory.Photograph: JIJI PRESS/AFP/Getty Images“I only met him once in person and he welcomed me, even though I couldn’t speak a word of Japanese,”Yavhusishyn said in 2024. “I was surprised when he said OK.

However, four hours after the race and following an investigation by the FIA, both were disqualified after the skid blocks on the floor of their cars were found to have been worn down below the 9mm limit defined in the rules.Max Verstappen dominates F1 Las Vegas GP to keep championship hopes aliveRead more“We apologise to Lando and Oscar for the loss of points today, at a critical time in their championship campaigns after two strong performances from them all weekend,” said McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella. “As a team, we also apologise to our partners and fans, whose support means so much. While this outcome is extremely disappointing, we remain fully focused on the last two races of the season.”The adjusted result means Verstappen has closed from 49 points behind Norris to only 24, level with Piastri, with two meetings remaining, in Qatar and Abu Dhabi, and 58 points on the table. Norris must outscore both his rivals by at least two points in Doha across the sprint and grand prix to be 26 points in front and claim the title there, but with the fight so tight it looks increasingly as if it will go down to the season finale in Abu Dhabi.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri was also disqualified from the Las Vegas Grand Prix.Photograph: Joao Filipe/DPPI/ShutterstockNorris was disappointed that his efforts in Las Vegas had proved to be in vain. “It’s frustrating to lose so many points,” he said. “As a team, we’re always pushing to find as much performance as we can and we clearly didn’t get that balance right today. Nothing I can do will change that now, instead full focus switches to Qatar, where we’ll aim to go out and deliver the best possible performance in every session.”Piastri said: “[It is] disappointing to come away from this weekend with no points after an unfortunate disqualification due to skid wear. With how close the grid is, we’re always looking at where we can gain performance, and we didn’t get it right this time.

The FIA said in its decision: “The team argued that mitigating circumstances existed in that there was additional and unexpected porpoising at this event, limited opportunity to test due to the weather on day one, and shortened practice sessions.” The governing body added that, as has been the case in previous breaches of this rule, there was no grey area, but accepted that McLaren had not attempted to deliberately break the regulations.“The FIA argued that unfortunately there was no provision in the regulations or in precedent for any penalty other than the usual penalty [ie disqualification],” it stated. “The FIA noted that it strongly held the view that the breach was unintentional and that there was not deliberate attempt to circumvent the regulations.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The planks were once made of wood but are now made of permaglass, a glass-reinforced laminate composition. The titanium plates are what cause the sparks to fly from beneath the car when the downforce pushes them into contact with the track and wears them down. The thickness of the plank assembly is required to be 10mm, plus or minus 0.2mm when new, and is allowed some wear during running but cannot fall below 9mm.Teams are expected to take this restriction in hand when setting up the ride height of their cars for races but will often try to sail as close to the wind as possible as a lower ride height can confer a performance advantage.Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

She also won the final slalom of last season, giving her three World Cup victories in a row.Lara Colturi, the 19-year-old who skis for Albania but is the Italian-born daughter of Italy’s 2002 Olympic Super-G gold medallist Daniela Ceccarelli, finished second with Switzerland’s reigning world champion Camille Rast third.The top two were the same as in the season’sopening slalom in Levi, Finland, with Shiffrin 0.31 seconds faster than Colturi in the first leg and extending her advantage to 1.23 at the finish after also going quickest in the second run. The podium was also exactly the same as last year’s top three in the slalom at Gurgl, with Shiffrin celebrating her 99th win that time.“I had to push so hard but it was really nice with the sun on the second run,” said Shiffrin, whose total tally now features a record 66 World Cup slalom victories. “Last year I remember it was so dark so this was a really nice surprise. It was pretty much exactly how I expected. Not easy but I knew the others were pushing so there’s no choice, you have to go.”The race was Colturi’s 60th in the World Cup and she was surprised by her first back-to-back podium.“The snow was really soft and when I saw it, I had a first inspection and I thought ‘ah, it’s probably not my day,” she said.Croatia’s Zrinka Ljutic, who won last season’s slalom crystal globe, straddled a gate on the second run while Austria’s Katharina Liensberger, the Beijing 2022 Olympic silver medallist, failed to finish the first run.The next races on the women’s technical circuit are in Copper Mountain, Colorado, at the end of the month and Shiffrin was looking forward to some time at home.“I have to get some [giant slalom] training again and I’m really excited to go to Copper. I stay in my own bed for the first time during the season,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He rounded off the scoring following Richarlison’s fine consolation strike for a Tottenham side that showed little ambition throughout and recorded 0.07 expected goals.Brilliant Eze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thump Spurs to extend lead in title raceRead more“Things happen for a reason,” said theArsenalmanager, whose side recorded three successive runners-up finishes before Eze’s signing for £67.5m in the summer. “After the international duty, he had two days off, and after one day he wanted to train, and he wanted to improve, and he wanted to do extra practice and he was asking me questions about this and that.“When a player has such a talent, and his desire is at that level, then these things happen. And he fully deserves it. I’m so happy for him, because since the day that he came, he brought something else to the team.“So it’s a joy, it’s an aurathat this teamneeded and hopefully it will give him a lot of confidence, to him and the team, that at any moment he can win us a game. And that’s the ability that he has and he certainly needs to fulfil that talent.”Eze, who had scored only twice in 15 previous appearances since his move to Arsenal having been rejected by them as a teenager, said: “It is special. Words can’t explain this one today. That’s what I prayed for: a hat-trick and I got it. I’m grateful to God. God gave it to me, that’s faith. All my family is here and that makes it even more special for me. ”Tottenham lined up with a five-man defence but that was abandoned at half-time by Thomas Frank and his side ended up having only four touches in Arsenal’s penalty area.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The two teams reached the final despite the absence of their respective star players Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz in Bologna this week.And it was Italy who retained their title after Matteo Berrettini and Flavio Cobolli won their singles matches on Sunday. Berrettini beat Pablo Carreño Busta 6-3, 6-4 in the opening contest and an entertaining tussle between Cobolli and Jaume Munar followed in which the Italian charged back to win 1-6, 7-6 (5), 7-5.Berrettini served 13 aces as he raced through his match in one hour and 18 minutes.The 2021 Wimbledon finalist clinched the only break in the eighth game and went on to serve out the set. Little could separate the pair in the second, but Berrettini again found a break deep into the set to inch the Italians closer to victory.View image in fullscreenFlavio Cobolli recovered from a set down to beat Jaume Munar and seal the title.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images for ITFMunar, needing to win the second singles match to force a doubles decider, stormed through the opening set with two breaks of serve. The Spaniard also broke Cobolli in the opening game of the second, but the Italian immediately responded with a break of his own in the next and went on to win the tie-break. And Cobolli found the crucial break of serve in the 11th game of the deciding set before serving out the match to love to secure Italy’s success.Both teams were missing their key men, with Spain deprived of the injured world No 1, Alcaraz, and Italy without the world No 2, Sinner, who skipped the final to focus on preparing for next season.Explore more on these topicsDavis CupTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

However, despite inheriting a title-winning squad from Ferguson, Moyes said United’s wait for a 21st league title has come as no great surprise.“I always thought when I took the job that it wouldn’t be able to be fixed quickly,” he said. “I saw not long after I went in that it was going to take a bit of time. I think also you have to remember that it was not just to do with the strength of United. It was to do with the strength of other teams; Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal were all incredibly strong. They were all rebuilding and bringing in more all the time. So I think those clubs played as big a part in it as anyone else, that their quality had risen or was rising all the time.”Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreRuben Amorim is United’s sixth permanent manager since Ferguson retired and was under intense pressure before the team’s recent improvement in form. Moyes believes the managerial churn is symptomatic of a change in culture at Old Trafford. “The history of Manchester United was not that [one of change],” he said. “Manchester United had a great culture. They stuck with their managers, they brought through their own academy boys. They actually had some of the best characteristics of what you would want your club to have; good values.“Sir Alex had great values at Manchester United and, over the years, those values he established needed some time to come through as well. It was always a club with brilliant values with an understanding about bringing their young players through and developing them in the right way.”Meanwhile, Amorim has insisted “the storm is not over” for United despite his team’s five-game unbeaten run in the top flight.United have defeated Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton and drawn with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham sincelosing 3-1 at Brentfordon 27 September. It is an encouraging sequence but Amorim is refusing to get carried away. Eleven months ago, two days after United beat Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford, the Portuguese warned “a storm will come” and was proved to be prescient as United went on to win only seven more league matches last season and finished 15th.View image in fullscreenBryan Mbeumo has scored four goals in the last four matches to put Manchester United in touch with the top four.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty Images“If you see the bottom [of the division], they have a lot of points, so everything can change in one moment. So I don’t like to say the storm is over,” said Amorim. “But we are more prepared for any storm in this moment. So let’s take this sense of urgency to every game.“It’s my job, especially in our club, to always have that feeling, that gives me the sense of urgency in every training [session]. And playing every game in the Premier League you can sense that everything can change so fast because all the teams can win any game.”Asked if United could stretch their unbeaten run to 10 games, which would involve them not losing to Everton, Crystal Palace, West Ham, Wolves and Bournemouth, Amorim replied: “We need to think to be six games unbeaten, but then unbeaten is not enough.“I came from these last two [drawn] games, but especially the last one, very frustrated. So for us it’s not enough to be unbeaten. Unbeaten is not everything, we didn’t win the last two games, so I don’t think we are unbeaten five games ago. In my mind, we don’t win a game, we are going to the third game, and the last two we didn’t win, so that is my feeling.”With Benjamin Sesko out for a number of weeks due to a knee injury he sustained in the 2-2 draw with Spurs before the international break, Amorim was asked if he regretted allowing Rasmus Højlund to join Napoli on loan for the remainder of the season. “Sometimes in these clubs it’s hard to make everyone happy – imagine that Rasmus is here, and you say if Ben has an injury, you have more time to play,” said Amorim. “It’s impossible to manage a dressing room like that, so that’s why we need to improve the kids from the academy [so] if you have an injury it is an opportunity for them.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedEvertonDavid MoyesRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

For the second game in a row they took an early lead through Lukas Nmecha but ended up with nothing, Morgan Rogers producing a pair of remarkable finishes to liftAston Villainto the Champions League qualification slots. Leeds remain in the relegation zone.“Performance-wise we’ve turned back to what we want to be,” said Daniel Farke. “We should’ve taken some points from this game. We are not back to our best. We can still improve, but at the end we are just disappointed we did not get any points.” Given the way Leeds faded in the second half and their lack of guile throughout, that was perhaps an overly sanguine reading.‘No miracles’: Philippe Clement gets instant view of size of task at NorwichRead moreVilla began the season apparently still feeling the hangover from missing out on Champions League football. But they have won nine of their past 11 in all competitions and the depth of their squad is beginning to tell. Donyell Malen began on the bench and, while he may not have scored in his third successive game, his arrival at half-time shifted the momentum as Villa became only the second away side in 26 to win in the league at Elland Road.“We started poorly but we’ve found a bit of rhythm and stuck together as a group,” said Matty Cash. “You have to be resilient in places like this. In the second half we played really well.”Last season, the then Southampton manager Ivan Juric observed that he had expected his side to be technically and tactically inferior to otherPremier Leagueopponents but had been surprised by how physically inferior they had been. The Premier League is a step up from the Championship in every way.The promoted sides seem to have absorbed that lesson. One of the reasons that, as a trio, they have started the season relatively encouragingly is that they have all reinforced with physically imposing players. For three-quarters of the first half at Elland Road, Villa struggled to live with Leeds’s aggression. Had Leeds’s ferocity been allied to slightly more finesse or guile, they could have, in effect, had the game won before Villa at last began to settle in the final minutes before the break.View image in fullscreenLukas Nmecha scores in the eighth minute to give Leeds an early lead against Aston Villa.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesAs it was, their main threat was set plays, particularly those delivered by the right boot of Sean Longstaff. It was his free-kick that brought the opener after eight minutes. The goal was ugly, and Villa protested, but Emi Martínez was far too easily distracted as Nmecha challenged him, allowing Anton Stach to divert the ball goalwards with his back. Ezri Konsa’s hack off the line then hit Nmecha and rebounded over the line.Martínez may have been at fault for the opener, but he did get down sharply to keep out a Brendan Aaronson snapshot after a corner had been half cleared. He made another fine save late on to keep out a Pascal Struijk header for another free-kick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe problem is sustaining that level of intensity. Leeds tired visibly towards the end of the first half and struggled to pick it up in the second, when Nmecha was left far more isolated than he had been in the first, the midfield no longer able to get forward to support him. That in turn allowed Villa more of the ball and, under less pressure, they began to use it rather better, in part because of the introduction of the Dutch duo of Malen and Ian Maatsen for the second half.Within two minutes of the restart, the change had paid off, Malen finding space in the right side of the penalty area, taking a cutback from Lucas Digne and drilling over a low cross that Rogers converted with a deft flick. His second, 15 minutes from time, was even better, a strange dipping free-kick from the edge of the box whose startlingly sharp parabola confounded Lucas Perri as it got up and down over the wall. Rogers ran straight to the set-piece coach, Austin MacPhee, to celebrate Villa’s second goal from a direct free-kick in successive games after Emi Buendía’s against Bournemouth. “It wasn’t bad,” Rogers said. “Emi’s been practising, I’ve tried to practise with him. I’m not as good as him. We’ve been practising that technique. I’m happy it worked out today.”Leeds seemed to have equalised almost immediately, only for replays to show that Dan James’s cross-shot had been diverted in by the left hand of Dominic Calvert-Lewin. They applied pressure after that, but that incapacity to create chances from open play cost them. With Manchester City and Chelsea next up, the anxiety is only likely to get worse.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Tom Werner, the club’s American chair, was at Anfield to witness Liverpool’s sixth defeat in seven Premier League games, their eighth loss in 11 matches in all competitions, and a performance that unravelled against a Forest side that started the day in the relegation zone.Van Dijk described Liverpool’s start to the second half as “unacceptable” and admitted “panic kicked in” as soon as Murillo gave Sean Dyche’s team the lead. Forest’s opener was the ninth goal Liverpool have conceded from a set piece in the Premier League this season.“We had a great three or four days’ preparation but in a game you are dealing with facts and the facts are we conceded a set piece in the first half and a terrible goal at the start of the second half,” said Van Dijk. “We are definitely letting him [Slot] down, but we’ve let ourselves down as well. You look at yourself first and then you help each other, you help each other get out of this mess because at the moment it is a mess – that’s just a fact.“As the champions we can’t be in the situation we are in right now. What are we going to do about it? We’re going to try to turn it around and that’s the mentality everyone should have.”View image in fullscreenArne Slot (right) cuts a frustrated figure during the loss to Nottingham Forest.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockVan Dijk usually speaks with the media after a game as part of his duties as Liverpool captain. Saturday was different, however. His voice was much louder – so loud that any teammate in the Anfield tunnel could hear him – and he shook with anger while challenging the dressing room to respond. “You should be angry,” he insisted. “The main thing for me is that everyone has to take responsibility.” Asked whether that is happening, Van Dijk replied: “I don’t know. But you have to do that. It’s the main thing I want the boys to do. It’s not easy during difficult times but we have to do it if we want to get out of this.”Liverpool spent almost £450m to replenish a title-winning squad in the summer but have gone backwards, with Alexander Isak, the £125m British-record signing, Florian Wirtz, who was absent against Forest but whose fee could reach £116m, the £40m Milos Kerkez and the £29.5m Jeremie Frimpong all failing to make an impact so far. Van Dijk insisted Liverpool’s problems go beyond the new recruits. “It’s tough for everyone,” he said. “What I want is for everyone to take responsibility on the pitch. We have to do that in order to push each other, to make each other better. When someone is pressing, you have to follow the press. It’s basic things but it’s not happening enough.”The Dutchman added: “This season we don’t have any consistency, we concede far too many goals, we are losing battles and everyone is responsible for it and I hope everyone sees that. We have to take responsibility to turn this around and it is easy to point fingers but you have to do it together. We have been through it together and won the league and everyone was part of it and happy, and when you go through a tough time you have to stick together and not point fingers.“You have to be a man and face the toughness and go again, again and again because if you want to give up then you are at the wrong place in my eyes, because this club has been going through many adversities over those years and we’ve always come out of it. But it doesn’t mean it is easy, it’s tiring but there is no other way.”Next up in the Premier League is a trip to West Ham next Sunday, after the midweek visit of PSV in the Champions League. Van Dijk said: “Wednesday is another game so what am I going to do, go home and cry? No, I’m going to go home and try to think how we can turn this around and hopefully that is what everyone is doing as well.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Tom Cannon’s stoppage-time third gave the scoreline the sheen the Blades’ performance probably warranted, and meant the result was the first three-goal away victory in the 131-year league history between these teams.Championship: Coventry battle back to beat Baggies; Daka strike eases heat on CifuentesRead moreBut Wilder, now unbeaten in seven of these occasions as United manager and so often a lightning rod for antipathy between the sides, was keen to emphasise the bigger picture post-match, with Wednesday still picking their way through the challenging financial fallout ofDejphon Chansiri’s apocalyptic regime.“I’m not going to be greedy. It’s not a time to unbelievably shout about our performance, our result,” he said. “It’s no wind-up, it’s no spin regarding the situation the opposition players and the management have been in. I’ve been there. So we got a result, we should be picking up more results, but I thought it was a really competitive Sheffield derby.”View image in fullscreenTyrese Campbell (left) puts Sheffield United 1-0 up by beating Ethan Horvath in the 11th minute.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesFor Wednesday the wait for a victory against their neighbours goes on – February 2012 was their last – but, more immediately, it leaves them rooted to the foot of the table with escape looking unlikely. The club’s administrators are hopeful of having a buyer lined up by 5 December and the pre-match optimism was palpable, but the road to recovery looks a long one, and surely goes via League One. Thanks to their 12-point deduction – and there are fears there could be another before the season is out – they remain on minus four points, 18 adrift of Oxford in the last safe spot.“We have this feeling that we didn’t play all-out today,” said Henrik Pedersen, theSheffield Wednesdaymanager, whose side are without a home win since April. “We didn’t come all-out with who Sheffield Wednesday is, and we have to learn to play big games and to think big in big games.”Wednesday’s threadbare squad deserve no blame for the club’s travails this season but the players did have to take their share of responsibility for United’s opener. Yan Valery was pickpocketed on the edge of his own box by Jaïro Riedewald, who shuttled the ball on to Callum O’Hare. The midfielder cleverly ferried it on to Campbell, who fired home across goal.United’s frustration at half-time was that they had not made more of their dominance and the home side’s defensive fragility. Danny Ings was brilliantly denied by Ethan Horvath in Wednesday’s goal after Dominic Iorfa’s awful pass across his own box had let the former England striker in.Iorfa then came to his own rescue after misjudging a long punt from the United goalkeeper, Michael Cooper – a fine recovering tackle denied Campbell another run at goal.

Another poor Wednesday clearance was met by Sydie Peck, and the England Under-21 midfielder’s first-time pass sent Campbell scurrying away once more. This time he calmly finished past Horvath.That was the cue for a stop-start second half, with the Owls dominating possession and territory without creating anything by way of threat, Max Lowe’s rather forlorn effort from distance the sole moment of note. “We lost to a better team today,” said Pedersen.Indeed the Blades should have added emphasis – “It could have been a lot more,” said Campbell slightly ruefully – before Cannon’s drive from the edge of the box with the seconds ticking down. It was only the striker’s second goal since his £10m move from Leicester in January, the 22-year-old having struggled with injuries and form since his move. Indeed he missed a one-v-one chance moments earlier. “Hopefully that will lighten the load on him,” said Wilder.For Wednesday the focus remains on the forthcoming takeover and the vision of the future that will bring. “It’s everything,” said Pedersen. “We need clarity here before we can take the next step.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield WednesdaySheffield Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Germán Valera’s exquisite backheel assist found Aleix Febas inside the box, and the midfielder took one touch before delicately slotting the ball past the goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.Barcelona’s new chapter begins in familiar surroundings as life returns to Camp NouRead moreReal levelled in the 81st minute through Dean Huijsen. The centre-back reacted quickest to a loose ball after a corner, slotting home from close range to bring the visitors back into the contest.Elche, however, were undeterred and regained the lead three minutes later. Álvaro Rodríguez controlled a well-timed pass on the edge of the box with his first touch before drilling a precise shot into the bottom left corner, leaving Courtois no chance.Madrid battled back though, and in the 87th minute Bellingham converted a crucial equaliser. Kylian Mbappé showed determination to keep a ball in play, delivering a clever cutback into the box that Bellingham calmly struck into the net to secure a point.Fourth-placedAtlético Madridclinched a scrappy 1-0 victory atGetafecourtesy of an 82nd-minute own goal by Domingos Duarte to extend their unbeaten run in La Liga to 12 matches. Diego Simeone’s side dominated possession throughout the encounter at Getafe’s Coliseum stadium but struggled to break down their deep-lying five-man defence.With time running out, the substitute Giacomo Raspadori, a lively presence after his introduction, sent in a low cross from the left that theGetafecentre-back Duarte, under pressure as he attempted to clear the ball, inadvertently backheeled into his own net.The narrow victory extended Atlético’s winning streak in La Liga to five matches.

Youssouf Fofana played Alexis Saelemaekers through on goal and, after his low shot was palmed away by Yann Sommer, Pulisic pounced on the rebound to score from close range.View image in fullscreenChristian Pulisic scores Milan’s winner.Photograph: Daniele Mascolo/ReutersMilan had found their attacking groove. The Inter defender Manuel Akanji made a decisive headed clearance with Rafael Leão ready to connect with a Saelemaekers cross and Sommer saved a Fofana shot. The penalty came just when Inter appeared to be running out of ideas, but Maignan’s mind games did the trick. The Milan keeper stood more to the right than in the centre, tempting Calhanoglu to hit the ball to the other side.Romatherefore finished the weekend top of Serie A after a 3-1 win atCremonese, where the Irish striker Evan Ferguson came off the bench and ended his almost 13-month goal drought at club level.In an action-packed first half, which included the ruling out of aRomagoal for offside and the overturning of a Cremonese penalty, the visitors took the lead through Matías Soulé in the 17th minute.Ferguson was introduced on the hour mark, and four minutes later netted his first goal for Roma. Wesley França wrapped up the win after another five minutes, with Francesco Folino heading in a stoppage-time consolation for the hosts.View image in fullscreenEvan Ferguson scores for Roma in their win against Cremonese.Photograph: Marco M Mantovani/Getty ImagesOn the stroke of half-time the referee awarded Cremonese a penalty for a handball by Gianluca Mancini but a check by the video assistant referee led to the decision being overturned.Ferguson had missed the previous three Roma games with an ankle injury that also kept him out of international duty with Ireland, but while Gian Piero Gasperini did not risk him from the start, he was given his chance from the bench. Cremonese failed to clear the ball from their area and when Neil El Aynaoui laid a pass off to Ferguson, the Irishman kept his cool and took a touch to control before bending his shot round Mile Svilar into the corner of the net.Ferguson’s previous club goal came in October 2024for Brighton against Wolvesin the Premier League, and the entire Roma team raced to celebrate with the 21-year-old.View image in fullscreenAssan Ouedraogo (fifth left) scores RB Leipzig’s opening goal against Werder Bremen.Photograph: Ronny Hartmann/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the Bundesliga, the 19-year-old Assan Ouédraogo scored with an unstoppable shot asRB Leipzigeased pastWerder Bremen2-0 to move back into second.

The Werder keeper was helpless, however, when Ouédraogo whipped a powerful left-footed shot into the top far corner in the 63rd minute for his third league goal of the season.The substitute Xaver Schlager then turned in the box to drill in Leipzig’s second goal in the 80th, sealing their victory and earning their fourth win in five league games. Leipzig, who bounced back from their loss to Hoffenheim on the previous matchday, moved up to 25 points in second place, with Bayern Munich in top spot on 31 after their6-2 demolition of Freiburgon Saturday.

Keskinen benefited from a significant ricochet before curling home a sweet shot.A pre-match downpour contributed to a first half contested at breakneck speed, often raging from end to end. Set pieces looked Hearts’ best route to goal, and Dimitar Mitov was on hand to grasp a close-range Frankie Kent header from a corner, before diving at the feet of Pierre Landry Kaboré as the striker took a loose touch.On the half-hour Cláudio Braga appeared to go over the outstretched foot of Mats Knoester, but David Dickinson was swift to spot a dive and instead booked the Hearts man.The Dons then broke the deadlock. Dante Polvara lifted a smart ball over the top for Keskinen, who got a hefty break of the ball before curling low across Alexander Schwolow and into the far corner of the net.View image in fullscreenHearts’ Claudio Braga (second right) misses a chance to score.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PAThe hectic pace continued after the break, and Mitov again had to be alert to block a close-range header, this time from Tomas Magnusson after more penalty-box pinball. At the other end, Armstrong’s half-cleared free-kick saw Polvara take a touch before sending an 18-yard effort narrowly over.With 15 minutes to go, Hearts should have been level as Kaboré got in behind and squared for Braga. Mitov was once again the hero, before Jack Milne cleared for a corner, and Aberdeen held on.On Saturday, a below-parCelticfailed to muster a shot on target for much of the match and almost fell behind when Declan John shot straight at Kasper Schmeichel with six minutes remaining. But McGregor, the Celtic captain, came to the rescue deep into added time when he lashed in the winner from 25 yards to claim the points for Martin O’Neill’s side.O’Neill, the interim manager, described his captain’s contribution as “absolutely massive” and added: “It was a great goal from a great player. The game was obviously heading for a draw. I’m not so sure that we deserved any more than that.“He scores a fabulous goal. Strangely enough, he moved it out of his feet just at the edge of the box and I thought: ‘He could hit this’. So it was a great goal. Maybe it didn’t belong with the game, but it was just great to win.”View image in fullscreenCeltic’s interim manager, Martin O’Neill, watches on as his side struggled to create chances against St Mirren.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PASt Mirren had come closer to a breakthrough on several occasions before added time. Conor McMenamin was close to converting from close range and then hit the post from 20 yards, before being penalised for offside after Liam Scales scooped the ball past Kasper Schmeichel into his own net.The St Mirren manager, Stephen Robinson, felt the referee, Kevin Clancy, should have been asked to look at the decision again. Robinson, whose side have had a string of disallowed goals in recent games, said: “We lost to an incredible goal. I thought we were very good.“I don’t think Shamal [George] had a save to make. We created numerous chances against Celtic. The fine margins of football at this moment in time are going against us.”Mohamed Diomandé’s late goal gaveRangersa hard-fought 2-1 win overLivingstonas the home side struggled badly on their return from a costly international break.John Souttar, Derek Cornelius, Mikey Moore and Youssef Chermiti were all ruled out through injuries sustained with their countries. That allowed Emmanuel Fernandez to make his third start since signing from Peterborough in the summer and the 24-year-old centre-back headed his side in front after nine minutes.Livi’s Australian striker Tete Yengi levelled after 18 minutes when he took advantage of awful defending and the home side’s overall play deteriorated, lacking urgency and guile. However, in the 78th minute Diomandé tapped into an empty net after Bojan Miovski had stretched to set him up for his first goal of the season.Danny Röhl admitted that improvement was needed from hisRangersside, though praised their battling qualities. “Yesterday in the press conference I spoke about a dirty win, maybe today it was exactly this. I said to my team it was a hard-working victory but more than this, it’s three points. I wasn’t here a few weeks ago, but maybe a few weeks ago we wouldn’t win this game.”View image in fullscreenMohammed Diomandé (right) prepares to score Rangers’ winner against Livingston from Bojan Miovski’s assist.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAKieron Bowie provided a goal and assist asHibernianswatted asideDundeein a comfortable 2-0 victory. The striker broke the deadlock on the half-hour mark with a well-taken effort before then setting up Jamie McGrath for the second. Bowie had failed to score in his previous nine outings and it looked like his frustration would continue after he missed a gilt-edged chance just moments before scoring. But the Hibs head coach, David Gray, insisted he was never overly worried about Bowie’s struggles in front of goal.“Strikers get confidence from scoring goals clearly, but I’ve had a lot of conversations with Kieron recently about what he actually does for the team. It’s not just scoring goals, I know that’s what they get judged on but the rest of the players certainly benefit from unselfish work he does for the team.

This time however, in stark contrast toTuesday’s heroics at Hampden Park, the self-proclaimed Mayor of Norwich was dispossessed by a hungry opponent and the home team’s fourth goal confirmed victory.McLean may have returned to Norfolk slightly the worse for wear, understandably, after scoring against Denmark from the centre circle to clinch Scotland’s place in the World Cup finals. But while his concession of possession to Demarai Gray on Saturday, leading to the perfect through ball for Jay Stansfield to round off this 4-1 win for Birmingham, epitomised Norwich’s back-foot performance at St Andrew’s, he is far from the main culprit of their extended plight near the foot of theChampionship.Championship: Coventry battle back to beat Baggies; Daka strike eases heat on CifuentesRead moreWith no victory, and only three points, in 12 games, the numbers do not make for happy reading. And fears that the club’s strategy is based on a ‘Moneyball’ approach to recruitment have placed Ben Knapper, the club’s sporting director, front and centre of the Norwich fans’ rage.The former performance and football analyst at Arsenal has already dismissed three managers since he arrived at Norwich two years ago this week, succeeding Stuart Webber. Philippe Clement, the former Rangers manager,took charge for the first timehere, having pre-empted his first defeat with a claim that the players are not fit enough.Knapper also stated this publicly, while taking accountability, admitting that the summer’s pre-season, planned mainly by last season’s manager Johannes Hoff Thorup,who was then dismissed, and implemented by Liam Manning, the club’s first ever Norwich-born manager, had led to the recruitment of external performance analysts. Fans agree. Before the game one of them – Denise, from Norwich – said: “Hopefully they’ll hit the ground running and run for 90 minutes rather than stopping at 45. The previous manager tried to get the players onside by making training fun. Liam was a nice guy, did alright, but it was wrong place, wrong time, with a young team.”Keith Cocksedge, from Northampton, said: “We’ve been rubbish at home. We’ve had a few injuries but that might also be down to the training regime, or maybe the players themselves.”View image in fullscreenNorwich captain Kenny McLean came down to earth after his Scotland heroics in midweek as his side were beaten 4-1 at Birmingham.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PAThedismissal of Manning, after only 17 games in charge, may have lanced the boil of vitriol for those supporters who were becoming so angry before the previous defeat by Leicester that players who normally travel to home games in their own cars arrived in a team bus for their own safety. They were still booed – and that was before kick-off. At least for this game, they focused more on actually supporting the team, only resorting to ‘we want Knapper out’ in the last minute.Norwich’s policy seems to have been to buy young and continental with a view to following the path lit up by Brentford, Brighton and Bournemouth. But this is easier said than done. There have been five permanent managers since Daniel Farke left four years ago with relegation from the Premier League pending.Clement vowed after this defeat to help make his new charges “the fittest team in the league” but like Jack Stacey, the right-back who delivered the cross from which Mathias Kvistgaarden, the £6.9m signing from Brøndby, scored his third goal in successive games to make it 2-1, fitness can come down to individual professionalism.“My opinion is, as a player, your body and your fitness should be 100% your responsibility,” Stacey said. “The guys at the club are there to help you if they can but everyone should look at themselves and ask if they’re fit or not. It probably shouldn’t be coming from outside sources.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t like to make the comparison, but look at Manchester City last season, when they miss a few players.”His new team, winless at Carrow Road this season, now face Oxford United, five points above them in the 21st place that currently looks like nirvana to Norwich fans, and QPR at home. Clement was linked with glamorous clubs such as Ajax but was convinced by Knapper and Mark Attanasio, the majority shareholder who lifted Milwaukee Brewers baseball team’s horizons in America, that this long-term plan can be more gratifying. “It’s not because I’m a masochist or something,” he said. “It’s because of talks with people in the club and the owners, who have proved in other sports how to take a team from lower region to the top, and to have responsibility with building the project.”If Norwich are challenging towards the top end of the Championship in 18 months’ time, Clement will be rivalling McLean for the right to be known as the city’s next mayor.Explore more on these topicsNorwich CityChampionshipBirmingham CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was like old times.Athletic Club, ideal guests, had not won here in 30 matches and after two years away they didn’t win this time either, the last of four goals conceded soon followed by fireworks on an afternoon of reunion.“Montjuic was the beginning; the Camp Nou is where history will be written,” Lamine Yamal had posted during the week as Barcelona prepared to return after two years as temporary tenants at the Olympic stadium. Now here he was, beaming in the north-east corner, where one of the stands was full and the other empty and still incomplete, as Ferran Torres polished his boot.The 18-year-old called to mark a new era at this stadium had just produced a second extraordinary assist for Torres to score his second and Barcelona’s fourth, Robert Lewandowski and Fermin López getting the others.View image in fullscreenFerran Torres celebrates scoring Barcelona’s fourth and final goal on their return to the Spotify Camp Nou by shining Lamine Yamal’s boot.Photograph: Pedro Salado/Getty Images“It was a good day for us,” said Hansi Flick when it had ended, not so much because of how Barcelona played as because of what it all meant: a new era and an old one too, symbolised by that moment and many others. Lamine has played here before – once, for seven minutes, when he was 15 – but five of Barcelona’s starters had not. As for the coach, the first time he came, he had just been sacked by a third division team but had looked at the home bench and thought that one day he would sit there. Here, on the first day of the rest of their lives, he had. “Anything is possible,” he said.European football: Olise inspires Bayern’s 6-2 comeback; Barça enjoy happy homecomingRead moreIt had been “historic”, Flick said, which is how it was supposed to be. Ferran’s finish for the fourth goal had been virtually the last touch of Barcelona’s first match here since May 2023; the first had been reserved for Juan Canela Salamero and Jordi Penas i Iberri, the oldest club members able to attend.Wheeled to the touchline by Penas and Carles Naval, Barcelona’s delegate for 39 years, Canela took the honorary kick-off. He had with him the ticket from the inauguration of this arena on the festival of La Mercè in September 1957.No one had the ticket from the re-inauguration half a century later; access here was digital. On the morning of the return, around a thousand remained, priced between €199 and €588. By kick-off, which, like the return home, was late, they had all been sold.That day in 1957, 1,500 people performed a giant Sardana and 10,000 doves were released; this time, the first phase of the Camp Nou rebuild finally complete a year behind schedule, there was a DJ, and the city choir belting out the club’s anthem, a lot of tourists, and a four-nil win.Above all, for most there was a kind of comfort, familiarity, the sense that this could be both a way back to where they were and a new beginning. The Camp Nou rebuild is not done: only three sides of the lower two tiers are open, allowing for a maximum 45,401 of the 105,000 it will eventually hold, and at times, in truth, the day of fiesta was a little flat, quiet and underwhelming, but Flick said “it’s a really good feeling to be back here”, and back is the word.View image in fullscreenA couple of construction workers watch on before kick-off in an uncompleted section of the ground.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersBarcelona had not been allowed to name this stadium after their founder, Joan Gamper, a foreigner and a protestant who had identified with the Catalan cause and whose 134th birthday it would have been today. And so it became known simply as the Camp Nou: the new ground. Here then, was the new new ground, which although it has Spotify for a surname still felt much like the old one.That will probably change when the third tiers are added and the roof is lifted on, but for now the stadium remains open and the architecture of the lower rings remain, like they were returning home rather than beginning again, a piece of their lives given back.Which came to define the day. The same bars, the same faces, the neighbourhood of Les Cortes full again. Between the maternity hospital and the cemetery, there was life again at the Camp Nou, so in they went. There is always something magical about that moment when you step out into the stands, seats surrounding you in many colours, green pitch glowing before you; here there was something familiar about it too, something they had missed, that wide bowl around the garden where Kubala, Cruyff and Messi once played and Lamine Yamal does now.Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaAthletic BilbaoLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mallía, the full-back, was forced off late on with what is thought to be an anterior cruciate ligament injury, which meant Argentina, who had used all their replacements, had to finish the match with 14 men.“How old is he?” said Contepomi of Curry. “Twenty-seven? And strong. And I am 48 and he comes and just [shoves me]. I was standing there. He was coming in to say hi to one of our coaches, but we said no because we were upset. I said: ‘Man, you broke his knee,’ and he said: ‘Fuck off,’ and pushed me like that.England edge over line for autumn clean sweep but Argentina fume over Curry scuffleRead more“Maybe that is the way he is, I don’t know him. I am not happy with the situation, after breaking someone’s knee I think you need to be at least humble and respectful enough to say: ‘Sorry, I did something wrong,’ but he did the opposite. Maybe it is his way of being a bully. If we want bullies in this game, good on them. It was a late, late tackle, or reckless.”Steve Borthwick was quick to defend Curry’s honour. “I’m aware there was an incident,” he said. “I didn’t see it. I was in the changing room. But anybody who has had any contact with Tom Curry knows his character is impeccable. He is a fantastic team man, a respectful guy. His character is unquestionable.”View image in fullscreenJuan Cruz Mallía is forced off the pitch after the tackle by Tom Curry.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesContepomi had already been involved in heated exchanges on the touchline over Curry’s tackle, which occurred in the 74th minute, as Argentina were trying to overturn an 11-point deficit. Mallía cleared the ball and was caught late by Curry, an offence for which the Englishman was penalised. No further action was taken. “I am not a good English speaker but I would call [it] reckless. We ended up playing with 14, they ended up with 15 and it was not even checked out. I cannot understand it.”The altercation came at the end of an ugly few minutes after the final whistle. Curry was embroiled in a quarrel with a number of Argentina’s players, joined quickly by Henry Pollock.Contepomi was also upset about the use of the instrumented mouthguards (IMGs), or the non-use of the technology by the officials. Twice his fly-half, Tomás Albornoz, was taken off for a head injury assessment, because he had clapped while holding his gumshield. But it was the lack of action after Pablo Matera’s withdrawal, triggered by the IMG, that worried Contepomi. He felt foul play had been involved and had not been checked by the television match official (TMO).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A first four-Test autumn clean sweep at Twickenham since 2016, a total of 17 tries scored and a winning run that now stretches to 11 Tests. By the time the 2026 Six Nations comes around those will be the primary facts when Steve Borthwick’s team regather with the aim of pushing further onwards and upwards.Their final game of the year, though, was a curate’s egg with a distinctly sour aftertaste. An angry Felipe Contepomi, the Pumas’ head coach, alleged afterwards he had been shoved and sworn at by Tom Curry in a post-match scuffle in the tunnel and complained the Sale flanker had been guilty of a “reckless” tackle that led to his full-back Juan Cruz Mallía suffering a serious knee injury and reduced Argentina to 14 men late on.Contepomi even used the word “bully” in his post-match press conference and his tirade ended up eclipsing many of the finer details of the contest itself. It is rare to hear a leading Test coach being as searingly forthright after a match these days, although England declined to throw further fuel on the intensifying diplomatic flames. Borthwick, instead, responded by describing his player’s character as “impeccable”.Max Ojomoh delivers champagne moment for England to signify arrival on big stage | Gerard MeagherRead moreOn the pitch, however, England could hardly have complained had the Pumas nicked victory in the closing moments. At 17-0 up in the first half there appeared to be only one winner but by the end the hosts were clinging on desperately and in danger of surrendering their dignity. They were ultimately indebted to 12 points from the boot of George Ford and a promising first home start by Max Ojomoh, who scored a sharp early try and also provided assists for further scores by the Exeter duo of Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and Henry lade.It completed England’s most successful autumn since they beat South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia on successive weekends in the first year of Eddie Jones’s tenure. If an outbreak of pushing and shoving at the final whistle, involving Curry and Henry Pollock, was not the obvious way to celebrate England are unquestionably getting better at finding different ways to win.To knock them over at home these days you certainly need to take a high proportion of your chances and, ideally, not give them a head start. Argentina could initially do neither but, as Scotland discoveredat Murrayfield a week earlier, they can be dangerous if allowed back into a contest. With 15 minutes left there was only one point in it until Slade’s try finally gave his side a decisive edge.It was certainly not England’s prettiest effort of the autumn, however. Without a number of injured squad members, their gameplan was clear from early on and did not include many, if any, frills. Between them the two sides kicked the ball 78 times, with England responsible for 40 of them.To be fair the tactics initially worked perfectly, with England going 10-0 ahead in as many minutes on a clear, cool afternoon. A Ford drop goal, rapidly becoming aspecialité de la maison, was followed by an opportunist try for Ojomoh, two Pumas succeeding only in knocking the ball back into the Bath centre’s path and giving him a free run to the line.Argentina, by contrast, were not at their sharpest: their first two lineout throws were called not straight and they were held up over the line with men lurking outside. When Santi Carreras, on temporarily for Tomás Albornoz, saw a penalty attempt crash back off a post it reflected their general inaccuracy.View image in fullscreenMax Ojomoh dives over the line for a try in England’s tense victory.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt felt even more costly when England nailed a second precisely-executed try. With nothing doing down the blindside Ford slipped the ball back inside to Ojomoh who sent a perfect cross kick straight into the arms of the unmarked Feyi-Waboso on the right. If ever there was a good advertisement for having a second playmaker at inside centre this was it.Albornoz did finally knock over a 45-metre penalty to make it 17-3 but the initiative was still very much with England. Their kicking game was definitely working, to the point where Ford could almost have been wearing a ringmaster’s top hat and tails at times.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionGiven Argentina’s ability to score a lot of points quickly, however, the onus was on England to keep pushing forward rather than sitting back. A third try before the interval would have helped but, from a commanding lineout maul, Luke Cowan-Dickie could not quite ground the ball to the French referee’s satisfaction.It was precisely the encouragement Argentina needed. The second half was only four minutes old when Juan Martín González broke clear in midfield and, with defenders back-pedalling, Justo Piccardo charged over beside the posts. A penalty awarded against Maro Itoje on the floor then made it a four-point ball game and England visibly needed fresh impetus.Quick GuideEngland 27-23 Argentina teams and scorersShowEnglandSteward; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Ojomoh, Daly; Ford, Spencer (Mitchell 59); Genge (Baxter 50), Cowan-Dickie (Dan 71, Opoku-Fordjour (Stuart 50), Itoje (capt; Ewels 73), Coles, Pepper (Pollock 50), Underhill (Curry 50), Earl.ReplacementM Smith.TriesOjomoh, Feyi-Waboso, Slade.ConsFord 3.PenFord.Drop goalFord.ArgentinaCruz Mallía; Isgró, Moroni, Piccardo, Delguy; Albornoz (S Carreras 8-21, 50), Benítez Cruz (Moyano 50); Gallo (Wenger 59), Montoya (Ruiz 66), Delgado (Rapetti 55), Petti (Molina 59), Rubiolo, González, Kremer (Matera 45-52, 63), S Grondona (Oviedo 45).TriesPiccardo, Isgro.ConsAlbornoz, S Carreras.PensAlbornoz 2, S Carreras.RefereePierre Brousset (Fr).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Pumas, though, had also stacked their bench and another Carreras penalty closed the gap to a single point. Ford tried to restore some order with another drop-goal but his effort drifted wide and left England to try to locate a different avenue of escape.This time it came in the form of a try from Slade with 14 minutes left, again courtesy of an Ojomoh offload with England already enjoying an advantage. Another Ford penalty gave his side further breathing space and, this time, the Pumas could not quite wriggle their way out of trouble despite a defiant late try for the Harlequins winger Rodrigo Isgró. The most contentious exchanges of the day, though, were still to come.Explore more on these topicsAutumn Nations SeriesEngland rugby union teamArgentina rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a community. In many schools, coaches are like parental figures who get young people through vulnerable times, into universities and sometimes even drafted to the National Football League.So when gun violence came for longtimeOaklandfootball coach John Beam, whose mentorship had changed the lives of generations of students, the devastation reverberated around the city.Beam, 66, was shot in the head at the Laney College athletics field house on 13 November, in what police officers called a “targeted incident”. He died of his injuries in hospital the following day.A 27-year-old man, Cedric Irving Jr, made his first court appearance Tuesday after being charged with Beam’s murder. Irving, who has no prior criminal record, is being held without bail and is scheduled to enter a plea on 16 December.He faces 50 years to life if convicted, along with enhancements alleging he personally fired the gun and that Beam was particularly vulnerable. Prosecutors have not disclosed a possible motive.Beam’s death has rocked the northern California port city. On Wednesday afternoon outside Laney College’s athletics complex, under a heavy grey sky, a makeshift shrine was filled with flickering candles, flowers, sneakers, a tripod, a football ball and outpouring of love scrawled on to hats and jerseys. Students and family friends came to pay their respects. The sports field, usually filled with players and games, was deserted, but for a flock of Canadian geese.Jack Nelson, a retired teacher, volunteer coach and 1972 alumnus of Skyline high school, where Beam had led the team to 15 Oakland Athletic League titles, said the killing felt like a major moment: “This is huge. It’s like killing the governor. He’s the governor of Oakland to me.”Since his death, students had been chanting Beam’s name, Nelson said. The other day, he was running past a middle school where students were playing football and after touchdown they all chanted “John Beam! John Beam! John Beam!” he recalled.View image in fullscreenJohn Beam, center, celebrates winning the Oakland Athletic League Silver Bowl in 2000.Photograph: John O’Hara/APGun violence remains a pervasive problem for Oakland, even though the city has seen homicides decline recently after pandemic highs. Skyline high school went into lockdown due to a shooting the day before Beam’s fatal shooting – itsthird school shootingin as many years. On 18 December, hundreds of Skylinestudents staged a walkoutto protest a lack of safety on campus and gun violence.Coaches in the city have long played a role in helping young people cope with the violence, and prevent it, saidFrankie Navarro, the commissioner of the Oakland Athletics League, Oakland unified school district. Beam, whom he worked closely with over the years, was no exception, he said.“They’re truly life coaches, and regardless of the students’ home situation, social economic status, they can become a resource for our youth to develop into kind human beings.”That’s exactly the role Beam played in the lives of so many Oakland students, said J’Sharlon Jones, 47, now a website developer in Denver.Growing up in West Oakland to a single mother, he went to Skyline High specifically for its sports program.“If you’re playing sports you’re protected, the drug dealers don’t hassle you,” said Jones, who used to get to school at 6.30am to lift weights and spent his afternoons training for track.Skyline High, under Coach Beam, took home the state championship which set Jones up to be recruited to Colorado State University on a full scholarship to play football.“I used to call Coach Beam on Father’s Day. I never had a father in my house. When you don’t have a dad you don’t have someone giving you guidance. He’s a person who cares. He gave a fuck,” said Jones. “You felt like what it was like to have a team, to be committed, to be celebrated.”“Heartaches, shock, denial, and the whole gamut of emotions – the last thing on the bingo card was that happening to Coach,” said Haran Jackson, another former student from Skyline who coach Beam helped get into college.Jackson will never forget the look on his mother’s face when Beam explained to her that her son was being recruited to go to college on scholarships and that they were going to “take care of his room and board, education, the whole deal”.Jackson was a late bloomer when it came to joining the football team and had never expected to get recruited, he said. His first encounter with Beam was one of getting told off for kicking a ball back to some female student athletes in a manner that Beam found disrespectful. But rather than feeling embarrassed, Jackson went and apologized and felt inspired to work hard to prove himself to Beam. And it worked.Growing up in a single-parent home in Oakland, Jackson never imagined he’d get to have a college experience, which changed his life trajectory, getting to see the country and the world. “Coach quarterbacked that whole situation for me,” said Jackson adding: “He really relished in finding the diamonds in the rough, like me.”Beam even set him on his current career, working in theatre and film, with a tip about an audition for runners to do a Nike commercial. Jackson got the job.The day before the fatal shooting, Beam texted Jackson an introduction to another former student, Daniel Cotroneo, who also lives in LA and works in the film industry. “I think the two of you should hook up. Let me know how it goes,” Beam said.On day one of joining the Skyline high school football team, Cotroneo, now a cinematographer and film-maker, dislocated his finger catching the football.“Coach Beam sort of chuckled at me and was like, “Well, hey, football might not work out for you, but we’re looking for a video guy,” Cotroneo recalled.From that point forward, he became the football team’s videographer, filming home games, road games and editing together highlight reels for players being recruited by colleges. The experience set Cotroneo on his trajectory to film school and on to working in the industry.“He was single-handedly responsible for submitting probably six or seven players for full scholarships in each of the years that I was working with the team. And probably most of these guys never had anybody in their family that went to college,” said Cotroneo, adding “he was giving kids a purpose and an outlet.”Cotroneo runs through the numbers of people whose lives were touched by Beam: 30-40 players on a team per year, multiplied that by over 45 years. “And then you factor in that a lot of these guys that end up on the football teams don’t necessarily have a strong male role model in their lives,” he adds.Beam struck that balance of somebody who “demanded authority in every room he walked into, but he was also personable and funny, he challenged you”.View image in fullscreenThe Laney College athletics complex, where John Beam was shot dead.Photograph: Jessica Christian/APCotoreno had discussed trying to collaborate on film projects with Beam. Likewise. Beam had read a script for a social horror film that Jackson wrote and wanted to be part of it, according to Jackson, hence the text intro.“I don’t think I’ve seen a network of other successful black men in Oakland like what I’ve seen with athletes, Skyline and John Beam,” said J’Sharlon Jones.Beam was always “creating a network”, said Navarro, the OAL commissioner: “He was that person that kind of bridged the connections” – creating opportunities for people in his vast multi-generational network to help each other.Nelson is raising funds to organize an alumni basketball game in Beam’s honor, and said there’s a 25 foot long sign in the works for Skyline’s sports field saying: “John Beam/Anthony Fardella Athletic Complex.”Navarro and Beam collaborated this year on creating thefirst annual Oakland football classicin October to kick off the league season. The classic will be named after Beam, Navarro said.Jones wants to build a website where all the stories about Coach can live for ever.Cotoreno is scouting a feature film in the Bay and is committed to bringing aboard local youth as his way of giving back and honouring Beam’s legacy.“I don’t believe in heaven, but when I get to heaven, I’m going to be looking for John Beam with a flashlight, making sure I don’t miss him,” he said.Explore more on these topicsOaklandCaliforniaWest CoastCollege footballUS sportsCollege sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Today, the tables have turned: it is Great Britain that finds itself at the mercy of major US tech firms – so huge and dominant that they constitute monopolies in their fields – as well as the whims of an erratic president. Yet, to the outside observer, Britain seems curiously at ease with this arrangement – at times even eager to subsidise its own economic dependence. Britain is hardly alone in submitting to the power of American firms, but it offers a clear case study in why nations need to develop a coordinated response to the rise of these hegemonic companies.The current age of American tech monopoly began in the 2000s, when the UK, like many other countries, became almost entirely dependent on a small number of US platforms – Google, Facebook, Amazon and a handful of others. It was a time of optimism about the internet as a democratising force, characterised by the belief that these platforms would make everyone rich. The dream of the 1990s – naive but appealing – was that anyone with a hobby or talent could go online and make a living from it.US tech dominance wasn’t the result of a single policy decision. Yet it was still a choice that countries made – as is highlighted by China’s decision to block foreign sites and build its own. While that move was far easier under an authoritarian system, it also amounted to an industrial policy – one that left China as the only other major economy with its own full digital ecosystem.The pattern was sustained through the 2000s and 2010s. Cloud computing was quickly cornered by Amazon and Microsoft. No serious European or UK competitor emerged to challenge platforms such as Uber or Airbnb. These companies have undoubtedly brought us convenience and entertainment, but the wealth of the internet has not spread as widely as many hoped; instead, US firms took the lion’s share, becoming the most valuable corporations in history. Now the same thing is happening with artificial intelligence. Once more, the big profits look destined for Silicon Valley.How did all this meet with such little resistance? In short, the UK and Europe followed the logic of free trade and globalisation. Nations, according to this theory, should focus only on what they do best. So just as it made sense for the UK to import French burgundies and Spanish hams, it also seemed logical to rely on American technology rather than trying to do it locally. Better to specialise instead in the UK’s own strengths, such as finance, the creative industries – or making great whisky.Datacentres are the bottom rung of the AI economy, private infrastructure that simply channels profits back to US headquartersBut when it comes to these new platforms, the analogy with regular trade breaks down. There is a vast difference between fine wines and the technologies that underpin the entire online economy. Burgundies can be pricey, but they don’t extract value from every commercial transaction or collect lucrative data. The trade theories of the 1990s masked the distinction between ordinary goods and what are, in effect, pieces of market infrastructure – systems essential to buying and selling. That’s what Google and Amazon represent. A better analogy might be letting a foreign firm build toll roads across the country, charging whatever it likes to use them.We’re seeing this again with the build-out of artificial intelligence. During President Trump’s state visit in September, the UK proudly celebratedGoogleandMicrosoft’s investments in “datacentres” – vast warehouses of computer servers that power AI systems. Yet datacentres are the bottom rung of the AI economy, private infrastructure that simply channels profits back to US headquarters.Could urban farming feed the world?Read moreIn another timeline, the UK could have been a true leader in AI. US researchers were once far behind their British and French counterparts. Yet, in a move neither Washington nor Beijing would have permitted, the UK cheerfully allowed the sale of most of its key AI assets and talent over the last decade or so –DeepMind’s purchaseby Google being the most famous example. What remains is an AI strategy consisting of the supply of electricity and land for datacentres. It’s like being invited to a party only to discover you’re there to serve the drinks.If tech platforms are indeed like toll roads, the logical step would be to limit their take – perhaps by capping fees or charging for data extraction. Yet no country has done so: we accept the platforms but fail to regulate their power as we do with other utilities. The European Union has come closest, with itsDigital Markets Act, which regulates how dominant platforms treat dependent businesses. The US government, for its part, is also at the mercy of its homegrown tech giants, yet Congress remains paralysed.If the UK wanted to take a different path, to resist this economic colonisation and extraction, it could partner with the European Union and perhaps Japan in order to develop a joint strategy – one that forces platforms to support local businesses and nurtures alternatives to mature US technologies. So far, though, alongside other nations disadvantaged by American dominance, it has been slow to adapt, instead hoping that the 90s playbook will still work, despite evidence to the contrary.The truth is that we now live in a more cynical and strategic era. One way or another, the world needs an anti-monopoly framework with far greater force than anything seen so far. Wherever you live, it’s clear the world would be better off with more firms from different countries. The alternative is not only costly but politically dangerous, feeding resentment and dependence. We can do better than a future where what counts as economic freedom is merely a choice between relying on the United States, or relying on China.Tim Wu is a former special assistant to President Biden and author ofThe Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity(Bodley Head).Further readingThe Tech Coupby Marietje Schaake (Princeton, £13.99)Supremacyby Parmy Olson (Pan Macmillan, £10.99)Chip Warby Chris Miller (Simon & Schuster, £10.99)Explore more on these topicsTechnologyThe big ideaEconomicsArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

Initial media coverage largely portrayed the deals as compromises that allowed the universities to preserve institutional autonomy and resolve outstanding federal investigations. But subsequentrevelationsabout the coercive ouster of UVA’s former president underscore how, in fact, “deals” like these represent a dangerous new front in the Trump administration’s war on higher education.UVA’s settlement,announced on 22 October, appeared to focus narrowly on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, to safeguard academic freedom, and to avoid external monitoring or monetary penalties. Cornell paid $60m and made various promises related to admissions, DEI, antisemitism, and foreign financial ties in exchange for a restoration of federal funding. UVA’s leaders hailed “a constructive outcome” that “uphold[s] the university’s principles and independence”, while Cornell’sdeclaredthat federal funding would be restored without sacrificing academic freedom. But the reality is very different.UVA’s deal is not a deal at all. It provides that if UVA makes unspecified changes on “DEI” to thefederal government’s satisfactionand provides it with data through 2028, the administration will close currently open investigations into the university. The federal government can open new inquiries at any time.What the agreementdoesdo is contractually bind UVA to the Trump administration’s definition of discrimination. That definition outstrips anything the law requires and, in fact, may force UVA to violate statutory and constitutional law. Far from extricating the university from government oversight, the agreement subjects UVA to federal monitoring and the risk of draconian financial penalties if the federal government decides, at its sole discretion, that the university has not complied.UVApledged to adhereto the drastically over- and under-inclusive definition of discrimination contained in non-binding July Department of Justiceguidance. That guidance goes far beyond the supreme court’s 2023 decision in SFFA v Harvard, which prohibited certain uses of race in college admissions. SFFA explicitly allows schools to consider, for example, how an individual’s race – “through hardship, inspiration, or otherwise” – has affected their lives, and acknowledges diversity as a laudable goal. The government guidance, by contrast, prohibits the use of race, sex, or other protected characteristics “no matter the program’s labels, objectives, or intentions.”UVA’s student body has never looked like Virginia; in particular, Black students have been severely underrepresented. Under UVA’s recently deposed president, the university made important strides toward greater inclusion. But the agreement forecloses all efforts to pursue the perfectly constitutional goal of increasing racial diversity in a state with a long history of discrimination and exclusion. The DoJ guidance alsobans race-neutral “proxies”– including indicia of socioeconomic status as well as “cultural competence”, “lived experience”, “first generation” status, or “underserved geographic areas” – if they are used to increase the representation of racial or other minorities.The administration’s guidance is riddled withambiguities and internal contradictions. For example, its broad definitions of unlawful discrimination could be read to prohibit reliance on virtually any criteria other than those that tend to decrease diversity, such as standardized test scores. Practically speaking, if UVA gives an admissions boost–or even a scholarship–to students who have experienced economic hardship, or to first-generation college students, would that violate its agreement?Moreover, the agreement places the university in grave financial jeopardy. It purports to pause pending investigations of UVA, while still allowing new ones, but the federal government reserves the right – at any time and for any reason – to terminate the agreement and to “pursue enforcement actions, monetary fines, or grant or funding terminations”. It requires UVA’s president to certify quarterly, under penalty of perjury, that the university has complied with the agreement, and it allows the government to investigate whether the university has in fact complied to its satisfaction. The federal governmentalready has warnedthat certifications it determines to be untrue risk civil and criminal liability for “civil rights fraud” under the False Claims Act, including through actions brought by private citizens.As a practical matter, this means that UVA has signed up formorepotential investigations and penalties than if it had done nothing at all. And that may have been the point: to tie the hands of the next UVA administration in anticipation of Democrats’ imminent electoral victories. Whatever the reasons, we should see the agreement for what it is: the subjection of a great public state university to federal government control.Cornell’s agreement, announced on 7 November, is less lopsided, perhaps thanks in part to the university’sresponsivenessto community input. But it is still dangerous. The governmentdemands $60mdespite never having found that Cornell violated civil rights laws. The agreement requires that Cornell provide the government with admissions data, presumably to accuse the university of race discrimination if its student body is too diverse. It closes certain pending investigations but permits employment discrimination claims based on past conduct and future compliance reviews or investigations. The university has further agreed to use the DoJ’s extralegal discrimination guidance as a “training resource” for faculty and staff, which invites university employees to engage in potentially unlawful discrimination.The agreement’s fine print contains additional perils. For example, Cornell agrees to disclose a range of student information and recognizes the government’s prerogative to share that data with law enforcement, an ominous nod to potential immigration consequences. A reference to the “prevention of terrorist financing” may relate to foreign funding – but in light of Trump’s recentexecutiveorderstargeting those the federal government considers to promote “extremist” views about race, gender, and migration as “domestic terrorists”, this provision may prove more menacing to free expression.Both agreements affirm “academic freedom” and promise no interference with curricula or the free expression of ideas. But if universities can be subject to drastic financial penalties anytime the federal government decides “in its sole discretion” that the university is not complying, it is difficult to believe there will not be strong incentives for administrators, faculty, and students to avoid any speech or conduct that might attract negative attention from the Trump administration. Whether explicit or implicit, such federal control cuts to the heart of the freedom of inquiry that allows universities to contribute to the innovations, economic prosperity, and creation of knowledge that have made American higher education the envy of the world.University leaders are under enormous pressure, and their refusal to sign Trump’s compact is courageous and important. But bespoke deals that more quietly exert federal control over public and private institutions set a dangerous precedent that should alarm all Americans.Serena Mayeri and Amanda Shanor teach law at the University of PennsylvaniaExplore more on these topicsUS universitiesOpinionUS educationDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But used fairly, it can be a boon for good governmentSun 23 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 09.24 ESTShareDemocracy is colliding with the technologies of artificial intelligence. Judging from the audience reaction at the recentWorld Forum on Democracyin Strasbourg, the general expectation is that democracy will be the worse for it. We have another narrative. Yes, there are risks to democracy from AI, but there are also opportunities.We have just published the bookRewiring Democracy: How AI will Transform Politics, Government, and Citizenship.In it, we take a clear-eyed view of how AI is undermining confidence in our information ecosystem, how the use of biased AI can harm constituents of democracies and how elected officials with authoritarian tendencies can use it to consolidate power. But we also give positive examples of how AI is transforming democratic governance and politics for the better.Here are four such stories unfolding right now around the world, showing how AI is being used by some to make democracy better, stronger, and more responsive to people.The US government is facing a crisis of legitimacy | Daniel MendiolaRead moreJapanLast year, then 33-year-old engineer Takahiro Anno was a fringe candidate for governor of Tokyo. Running as an independent candidate, he ended up coming in fifth in a crowdedfield of 56, largely thanks to the unprecedented use of an authorized AI avatar. That avatar answered8,600 questions from voterson a 17-day continuous YouTube livestream and garnered the attention of campaign innovators worldwide.Two months ago, Anno-san waselectedto Japan’s upper legislative chamber, again leveraging the power of AI to engage constituents–this time answeringmore than 20,000 questions. His new party, Team Mirai, is also an AI-enabled civic technology shop, producing software aimed at making governance better and more participatory. The party is leveraging its share of Japan’s public funding for political parties to build theMirai Assemblyapp, enabling constituents to express opinions on and ask questions about bills in the legislature, and to organize those expressions using AI. The party promises that its members willdirect their questioningin committee hearings based on public input.BrazilBrazil isnotoriously litigious, with even more lawyers per capita than the US. The courts are chronically overwhelmed with cases and the resultant backlog costs the government billions to process. Estimates are that the Brazilian federal government spends about 1.6% of GDP per yearoperating the courtsand another 2.5% to 3% of GDP issuingcourt-ordered paymentsfrom lawsuits the government has lost.Since at least 2019, the Brazilian government hasaggressively adoptedAI to automate procedures throughout its judiciary. AI is not making judicial decisions, but aiding in distributing caseloads, performing legal research, transcribing hearings, identifying duplicative filings, preparing initial orders for signature and clustering similar cases for joint consideration: all things to make the judiciary system work more efficiently. And the results are significant; Brazil’s federal supreme court backlog, for example, dropped in 2025 to itslowest levels in 33 years.While it seems clear that the courts are realizing efficiency benefits from leveraging AI, there is a postscript to the courts’ AI implementation project over the past five-plus years: the litigators are using these tools, too. Lawyers are using AI assistance to file cases in Brazilian courts at anunprecedented rate, with new cases growing by nearly 40% in volume over the past five years.It’s not necessarily a bad thing for Brazilian litigators to regain the upper hand in this arms race. It has been argued that litigation, particularly against the government, is a vital form ofcivic participation, essential to theself-governance functionof democracy. Other democracies’ court systems should study and learn from Brazil’s experience and seek to use technology to maximize the bandwidth and liquidity of the courts to process litigation.GermanyNow, we move to Europe and innovations in informing voters. Since 2002, the German Federal Agency for Civic Education has operated a non-partisan voting guide calledWahl-o-Mat. Officials convene an editorial team of 24 young voters (under 26 and selected for diversity) with experts from science and education to develop a slate of 80 questions. The questions are put to all registered German political parties. The responses are narrowed down to 38 key topics and then published online in a quiz format that voters can use to identify the party whose platform they most identify with.In the past two years, outside groups have been innovating alternatives to the official Wahl-o-Mat guide that leverage AI. First cameWahlweise, a product of the German AI company AIUI. Second, students at the Technical University of Munich deployed an interactive AI system calledWahl.chat. This tool was used by more than150,000 peoplewithin the first four months. In both cases, instead of having to read static webpages about the positions of various political parties, citizens can engage in an interactive conversation with an AI system to more easily get the same information contextualized to their individual interests and questions.However, German researchers studying the reliability of such AI tools ahead of the 2025 German federal election raised significantconcernsabout bias and “hallucinations” – AI tools making up false information. Acknowledging the potential of the technology to increase voter informedness and party transparency, the researchers recommended adopting scientific evaluations comparable to those used in the Agency for Civic Education’s official tool to improve and institutionalize the technology.United StatesFinally, the US – in particular, California, home toCalMatters, a non-profit, nonpartisan news organization. Since 2023, itsDigital Democracyproject has been collecting every public utterance of California elected officials – every floor speech, comment made in committee and social media post, along with their voting records, legislation, and campaign contributions – and making all that information available in a free online platform.CalMatters this year launched a new feature that takes this kind of civic watchdog function a big step further. ItsAI Tip Sheetsfeature uses AI to search through all of this data, looking for anomalies, such as a change in voting position tied to a large campaign contribution. These anomalies appear on a webpage that journalists can access to give them story ideas and a source of data and analysis to drive further reporting.This is not AI replacing human journalists; it is a civic watchdog organization using technology to feed evidence-based insights to human reporters. And it’s no coincidence that this innovation arose from a new kind of media institution – a non-profit news agency. As the watchdog function of the fourth estate continues to be degraded by the decline of newspapers’ business models, this kind of technological support is a valuable contribution to help a reduced number of human journalists retain something of the scope of action and impact our democracy relies on them for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

The common thread is that the technology is distributing rather than concentrating power. In all four cases, it is being used to assist people performing their democratic tasks – politics in Japan, litigation in Brazil, voting inGermanyand watchdog journalism in California – rather than replacing them.In none of these cases is the AI doing something that humans can’t perfectly competently do. But in all of these cases, we don’t have enough available humans to do the jobs on their own. A sufficiently trustworthy AI can fill in gaps: amplify the power of civil servants and citizens, improve efficiency, and facilitate engagement between government and the public.One of the barriers towards realizing this vision more broadly is the AI market itself. The core technologies are largely being created and marketed by US tech giants. We don’t know the details of their development: on what material they were trained, what guardrails are designed to shape their behavior, what biases and values are encoded into their systems. And, even worse, we don’t get a say in the choices associated with those details or how they should change over time. In many cases, it’s an unacceptable risk to use these for-profit, proprietary AI systems in democratic contexts.To address that, we have longadvocatedfor the development of “public AI”: models and AI systems that are developed under democratic control and deployed for public benefit, not sold by corporations to benefit their shareholders. The movement for this is growing worldwide.Switzerland has recently released the world’s most powerful and fully realized public AI model. It’s calledApertus, and it was developed jointly by the Swiss government and the university ETH Zurich. The government has made it entirely open source –open data, open code, open weights – and free for anyone to use. No illegally acquired copyrighted works were used in its training. It doesn’t exploit poorly paid human laborers from the global south. Itsperformanceis about where the large corporate giants were a year ago, which is more than good enough for many applications. And it demonstrates that it’s not necessary to spendtrillionsof dollars creating these models. Apertus takes a huge step forward to realizing the vision of an alternative to big tech–controlled corporate AI.AI technology is not without its costs and risks, and we are not here to minimize them. But the technology has significant benefits as well.AI is inherently power-enhancing, and it can magnify what the humans behind it want to do. It can enhance authoritarianism as easily as it can enhance democracy. It’s up to us to steer the technology in that better direction. If more citizen watchdogs and litigators use AI to amplify their power to oversee government and hold it accountable, if more political parties and election administrators use it to engage meaningfully with and inform voters and if more governments provide democratic alternatives to big tech’s AI offerings, society will be better off.What’s giving me hope nowNathan:I am excited to see examples of people taking the technology into their own hands to fight for what they believe in. In addition to the above, we see US politicalcampaignersusing AI to make door-to-door canvassing more effective, Braziliancivic technologistsusing data to generate oversight of local government, and countless other examples around the world.Bruce:There is a real chance that AI technology will distribute power. Right now it’s concentrating power, because the cost to build these frontier models is enormous. But that cost isdropping dramatically, and the need for smaller and more nimble models is growing. One of the most important things we can do is to break the tech monopolies, and a more distributed AI ecosystem might just help with that.Nathan E Sanders is a data scientist affiliated with the Berkman Klein Center of Harvard University and co-author, with Bruce Schneier, of the book Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship.

So, what exactly is the problem?Ellie Violet BramleyThe outrage a J Crew jumper has provoked shows that the US right’s sense of masculinity is far more fragile than it would care to admitSun 23 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 03.01 ESTShareAmen’s jumper by the all-American preppy labelJ Crewhas sent thousands of Maga Americans into meltdown. From a fashion point of view, it couldn’t be more innocuous. It’s got a crew neck. It’s made from wool. It has a Fair Isle pattern at the upper yoke. There’s nothing asymmetric about it, no fringing or tassels, no slogan blasted across the front; no “Make America Kind Again”. So what’s the big deal? Reader, the jumper ispink.The main storm broke underneath a tweet by conservativesocial media commentator Juanita Broaddrick, in which she asked: “Are you kidding me?? Men, would you wear this $168 sweater?” The consensus among her followers was a resounding no, and not because of its price. “No man in my family would wear it!” wrote “MOMof DataRepublican”. “My husband wouldn’t use a pink bathroom towel,” assured another. Another X user was even more passionate: “HELL NO. I’m a man, not gay and won’t be dressing up as a Golden Girl anytime soon.” Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican congressman,called the sweater“something a sorority girl would wear in the 80s”. I think he meant it witheringly; I read that and think it sounds quite fun.For others, it was a case of pointing out who would wear such an enfeebling jumper as this. “I’m sure you’ll be seeing these at the anti-Ice protests,” wrote one X user, with another saying he would wear it “if I was going undercover in dudes for Kamala”. One person went so far as toPhotoshop Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom’s, headon to the J Crew model’s body.That some quarters of the right have taken such umbrage at a J Crew jumper is interesting. It’s a label which is traditionally more aesthetically aligned with the old-school conservative right. It’s preppy and, inThe Kingdom of Prep: The Inside Story of the Rise and (Near) Fall of J Crew, author Maggie Bullock describes prep as “the bedrock of straightforward, unfettered, ‘American’ style” – the “leisure uniform of the establishment”. In the Trump era, however, even this can become the source of conflict: an aesthetic clash between traditional conservatives and the Maga neo-right.Camouflage clothing may be having a moment – but in our violent world, is that wise? | Ellie Violet BramleyRead moreNot to deny thatpink has had a complicated history, but you’d be forgiven for thinking we were past this kind of uproar about the idea of men wearing it. We live, after all, in a post-millennial pink world, where not only have the likes ofHarry StylesandTyler, The Creatorworn pink – and looked great doing it – but also those who aren’t known for being quite so fashion-forward, such asJake GyllenhaalandDaniel Craig, before his association with fashion brand Loewe. Even rightwing men like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump himself have seen fit to take themselves seriously as the Billy Big Bollockses they think they are while wearing pink ties.Yet the hand-wringing this jumper has provoked about the state of American masculinity seems to be keenly felt. The contradiction of course is that any masculinity that feels shaken by a spot of pink on some knitwear is more fragile than it would care to admit.And what is it about pink? Yes, pink is now all about Barbie and cotton candy, but there was a time, over a century ago, when blue was considered more feminine and pink was associated with boys. As a trade publication called theInfant’s Departmentreported in 1918, “pink, being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl”. The lines seem to have been drawn in relation to kids’ clothes and expanded and evolved from there.Ultimately, J Crew will probably be enjoying this free publicity. But, unlike that other recent example of a clothing brand shamelessly stirring the culture war pot (ahem,American Eagle) – this doesn’t feel like a deliberate play for airtime. (Interestingly, shortly after American Eagle’s campaign launched, itsstock rose by almost 18%. At the time of writing, the jumper isstill availablein most sizes.) J Crew is unlikely to be weaponising pink as a way to cause a stir over the perceived emasculation of American men. More likely is that they didn’t honestly see that it would be a big deal. Because, honestly, it’s not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Congress won’t do it – Republicans slavishly follow his orders, Democrats are ill-led and divided. For today’s White House, the concept of constitutional limits on executive power is a quaint relic. The news media, or sections of it, does its best amid constant legal threats. But, too often,they pay him off. Brave reporters who insist on asking awkward questions are insulted or silenced: “Quiet, piggy.”So who will tame Donald Trump? Who will halt his rolling constitutional coup – his ongoingevisceration of US democracy, civil rights, living standards, global reputation and moral integrity? Voters may try to indirectly rein him back in next November’s midterms (as they didrecently in New Yorkand elsewhere). But those elections are a year away. The emergency is today.What the US urgently needs now, metaphorically speaking, is a national champion, a sort of modern-day Saint George to slay the dragon, save the people and ensure the triumph of good over evil. Who, in reality, might fill this role of moral saviour?Step forward Leo XIV, the “American pope”, backed by the US conference of Catholic bishops and the clergy and grassroots activists of the Catholic church – unexpected, newly emerging standard-bearers for country-wide resistance to the Trumpist scourge. The bishops threw down thegauntlet in a “special message”this month. Inequality, immigration and civil rights are the battlegrounds on which the church, and some other Christian denominations, have begun to fight.The US is now a rogue state - look at its extrajudicial killings off Venezuela’s coast | Simon TisdallRead more“We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanising rhetoric and violence,” the statement said. Citing the brutal tactics of immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents, the bishops deplored the “climate of fear” created by Trump’s policies, the profiling of vulnerable citizens, shocking conditions in detention centres and lack of access to pastoral care.Expressing a view, rooted in scripture, that Britain’s Labour government and other western countries would do well to heed, they went on: “We recognise that nations have a responsibility to regulate their borders and establish a just and orderly immigration system for the sake of the common good.” But creating safe and legal pathways for migrants was the preferable, ethical solution. Human dignity and national security were not in conflict, they said.Chicago-born Leo, increasingly outspoken inopposing Trump’s “inhuman” policiessince his election in May, now stands at the head ofthis clerical revolt. Earlier this month, he demanded ICE rethink its demonisation of migrants – more than 2 million “illegal aliens” have been involuntarily removed this year and record numbers detained,official figures indicate. Hecriticised lethal US strikeson suspected drug smugglers off Venezuela, warning violence would fail. And he has challenged Trump’s climate-crisis denial, telling Cop30 that God’s creationis “crying out” for action.Organised opposition to Trumpamong Catholic and other faith groupson the “Christian left” is spreading at grassroots level. From New Jersey to California, parish priests and pastors have led local protests, boycotts and initiatives to counter ICE’s depredations. “Catholics are particularly well positioned to lead such a movement,”wrote Maria J Stephan, a specialist in non-violent civil resistance.About22% of US adults identify as Catholicand more than four in 10are immigrants or children of immigrants. “Many Catholics are likely among those now living in fear of masked agents abducting them in unmarked cars to detention centres … Meanwhile, close to three million black Catholics are experiencing attacks on the voting rights act and the weakening of civil rights protections,” Stephan wrote.The church has also launched assaults on Trump’s signature fiscal legislation, accusing him of “unconscionable” cuts in healthcare and food assistance, and unjustifiable tax breaks for the better-off. “Catholic teaching compels the faithful to uphold human dignity. It is hard to conceive of the law as promoting the sanctity of every life when it cuts key programs for the needy and expands tax cuts to the wealthy,” wroteWheaton College professor of public theology Esau McCaulley.Catholics, like other US religious groups, are far from united in opposing Trump.He won 55% of Catholic voteslast year, although support has since dropped sharply. Conservative critics have lampooned Leo asthe “woke pope”– a reminder that on abortion and other issues, the Catholic hierarchyoften takes an anti-progressive, reactionary stance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As in the secular sphere, the divide is stark. “Christian nationalism is particular rather than universal. It is about protecting ‘us’ against ‘them’ – the native versus the immigrant. It is about power more than love. It is about threat more than hope,”wrote commentator David Brooks. He could have been talking about Maga – or Reform UK.Increasingly erratic dictatorial behaviour, violent nihilism, exploitative religious hypocrisy and blatant corruption: this is the challenge facing the US and the world. Is Leo, speaking up for human dignity, decency and faith, the leader whose hour has come? He’s 70. He has the job for life. Trump has three years left in office. If he chooses to use it, Leo has the moral authority, political savvy and international standingto confront Trump, to positive effect, on poverty, inequality, migrants, civil rights, Russia, Palestine and other pressing issues.The American pope could do what others manifestly cannot: shame and tame the monster. To do so, he needs what Trump’s nemesis, the latePope Francis, prayed for: the support not only of Catholics, but of “all men and women of good will”. That, and maybe a small miracle, too. After all, brave Saint George was martyred.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorThis article was amended on 23 November 2025.

That’s what it was like to be part of Cop30 in Brazil. And yet more than 190 countries came together in the rainforest of the Amazon and reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism, the Paris agreement and the need toredouble our effortsto keep global warming to 1.5C.We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life. We know the UK produces just1% of emissions, which is why, as the prime minister said in Belém, our government is “all-in” on working with others to reduce the remaining 99%.We also know there are huge opportunities from driving the transition forward, which is why in Britain we are making historic investments in renewables and nuclear, upgrading millions of homes, and acting to protect nature.It is true that Britain wanted more from this Cop, including details of how we would speed up the global energy transition through an agreement that explicitlypledged a roadmapfor the transition away from fossil fuels. This didn’t happen because some countries would not agree.Yet on this issue, we have seen the emergence of an impressivecoalition of 83 countriesfrom the global north and global south, backed by more than 140global businesses and civil society groups. And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.This offers such an important lesson: that detailed negotiations matter, but the movements we build around them profoundly influence what can be delivered. The roadmap to achieve our goal tohalt and reverse deforestationby 2030 offers the same opportunity to drive forward our global efforts to tackle the nature and climate crises together.There is also a larger picture here. This year’s summit was a test of whether, at a time of political challenge, countries would keep working together on the greatest collective threat we face or, with the USstepping out of the Paris agreement, there might be a domino effect of others departing. For all the challenges, countries chose the path of cooperation.Cop30 therefore forms part of the long history of these negotiations that have seen the world change its trajectory from 4C of warming around a decade ago to 2.3- 2.5C. Despite that progress, our goalis 1.5C for a reason– because the science is clear that every fraction of a degree matters in limiting the impacts people will face here and around the world. That is why it is important that the world has pledged to enhance efforts to meet it through theBelém Mission to 1.5and Global Implementation Accelerator.Ambition on emissions reduction goes hand-in-hand with finance to make that possible, including for developing countries. Last year,countries agreedthat, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries. This year, as a core part of our fight against climate change, we agreed that this finance needs to be targeted at aiming to treble the support to building resilience to climate impacts.Our Brazilian hosts were determined to make this the implementation Cop – and much progress was made outside the negotiating halls. This was, of course, the first Cop in the Amazon, and the UK was proud to work with Brazil in the two years running up to the summit to help it develop the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which offers anincredibly inspiring solutionto global deforestation.We also worked alongside Brazil and many others on the Global Climate Action Agenda, which is about building the coalitions spanning governments, businesses, cities and civil society needed to accelerate action on the ground – on issues from reducing methane emissions and phasing out coal, to unlocking investment in clean energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our researchers, universities, mayors and others were also deeply engaged on climate issues at this Cop. And the UK was key to delivering the final outcomes of this summit, because of our record of climate leadership at home and abroad, as well as the extraordinary skill and determination of our civil service.The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt. We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action. In the face of this opposition, multilateralism is our best hope.

While the farewells are always hard, Suzanne usually settles back home after a few weeks, staying connected with video calls and regular messaging even when time differences made it difficult.This time, though, something felt different.Suzanne was struggling with an overwhelming sense of dislocation and disconnection. “I thought a longer visit and more time with everyone would make it easier to come back, but it’s actually made it harder,” she said. “The goodbyes just don’t get any easier, and I feel that my heart is there, even though I live here.”I took my daughter on a holiday to Hong Kong to visit family. I didn’t realise how hard it would be to leave | Lucille WongRead moreSuzanne was particularly upset that the timing of her return meant she had missed her favourite aunt’s birthday celebration by a few weeks. “The family met up for tea and cake, and I felt so sad not to be there. I so wanted to be with her for her birthday and more than anything to just be physically there, not calling in from halfway around the world on a phone.“Then today I felt sad again because I baked a really special cake that turned out perfectly and I wanted to share it with family, but of course they are there not here, and that sadness took away some of the joy of creating it.”As she spoke, it was clear this wasn’t simply nostalgia: Suzanne has spent her adult life navigating two worlds. An extended visit and more time, rather than healing the ache, seems to have sharpened it.The loss of the ordinaryIn trying to understand why this most recent re-entry has been the most difficult so far, Suzanne wondered if “the ordinary parts of life” are the aspects she grieves the most. “I miss the birthdays, popping around to see them for tea, or planning to meet up next week, or linking up for a weekend.”Paradoxically, the longer visits exacerbate her feelings of loss: “Because we don’t get to see each other very often the visits end up feeling pressured and almost too intense, because we are trying to pack everything into the time we have together.”Suzanne described the ache of her realisation that perhaps the visits can’t ever compensate for the everyday presence she grieves for. “Actually, I think it’s impossible, no visit can make up for the fact that I’m not there most of the time, and that means I’m missing out on the ordinary things.”When homesickness doesn’t fadeResearchers often describehomesickness as a distresscaused by being away from home, with an expectation that it eases with time. But for many, the longing never fully recedes. It becomes a form of ambiguous loss – a term coined byfamily therapist Pauline Bossto describe grief that lacks closure or clear resolution.Ambiguous loss occurs when something or someone is absent, yet still profoundly present in our minds and hearts. Suzanne’s family are present for her and she can talk to them, even see their faces – but they remain physically out of reach.Boss’s research shows that this kind of loss can be as enduring and painful as bereavement, precisely because it cannot be completed.Suzanne read about ongoing homesickness and this ambiguous loss in alovely piece in the Guardian. Lucille Wong’s reflections resonated deeply with Suzanne: “When you have two worlds, you always have to say goodbye to one” and carrying with you “the heaviness of having to leave”.Wong also describes some hope and acceptance: “I think how wonderful it is to have two worlds, and despite having to leave one (for now), we hold the experiences, memories and connections. We learn to make room for the best of both worlds.”Making room for the best of both worldsSuzanne had engaged in therapy a few different times earlier in her life and found it helpful for making sense of her experiences and crafting a full life. “I know [from this therapy] that when the homesickness hits I’m grieving, and that grieving comes in waves and layers. And I do know there’s no fix or resolution to it.”In coping with this most recent bout, Suzanne is grappling with the challenge to acknowledge her homesickness and grief, while making room for the best of both worlds. This process of making room has led Suzanne to the puzzle of how to make sense of seemingly contradictory and conflicting emotions.If you’re feeling anxious, take a moment to pause before pouring that glass of wine | Diane YoungRead more“Howdo I make room for gratitude, joy and relationship connection[s] with people in my life here, without being overwhelmed by sadness and loss and longing for people over there?” she asked.Psychological research suggests that mixed emotions – like sadness and gratitude – are not contradictory but coexistent and in factneurologically integrated. This paradox validates Suzanne’s experience and, as Wong identified, appreciating the wonder of two worlds and perhaps a heart in two places may enable Suzanne to find comfort in the transitions, rather than distress.To help with the “how” and find some comfort, Suzanne has been experimenting with recent advice from the grief expertDr Lucy Hone. Hone recommends approaching grief in “manageable chunks”, oscillating between facing and avoiding it, using activities that are distracting to create breaks from grief.In these breaks, Suzanne gets glimmers of feeling more at peace. “I’m trying to feel grateful for what I have here without letting the sadness for what I don’t have take over,” she said. “Maybe that’s the only way to live with it – to make space for both.”Living with it will probably be lifelong for her. In this, Suzanne is not alone. Her story reflects experiences many migrants, expatriates and long-distance families know well: that while longing, love and loss are deeply interconnected, our hearts are flexible enough to hold them all both here and there.*Suzanne is an amalgam of a few different people, all of whom have given permission for their experiences to be shared here.

Who will offer them hope?Sun 23 Nov 2025 08.02 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 14.42 ESTShareAnother week, another set of sobering economic numbers. Last Thursday, the Office for National Statistics published itslatest quarterly estimateof the number of 16- to 24-year-olds who are so-calledNeets– people not in education, employment or training. As usual, experts have warned that figures extracted from the UK’s flawedlabour force surveyshould be taken with a pinch of salt. But there was still universal agreement about the huge issues the figures highlighted, and the hundreds of thousands of young people,946,000, if the stats are to be believed, who are living on the UK’s social and economic edge.The government has announced itslatest reviewof all this, led by the New Labour veteran Alan Milburn, who will apparently focus on the relevance of disability and mental health. This week, moreover, Rachel Reeves is reportedly going to make the predicament of Neets one of the big themes of her budget. As ever, mood music is being provided by parts of the media that tend to specialise in the kind of condescension and generational loathing recently crystallised by aDaily Mail headlinethat might easily have been coughed out by ChatGPT: “Sicknote youths to dodge clampdown: Pledge to stop benefits for the workshy won’t include those with anxiety”.The day the Neet figures came out, I had a half-hour conversation with Roman Dibden, the Manchester-based chief executive of a brilliant employment charity calledRise Up, which works with people aged between 16 and 30. What he talked about was filled with a sense of raw humanity. It began with his own life – he dropped out of school when he was 14, then spent the eight months that followed his 16th birthday unemployed, experiences that echo those of the young people he and his colleagues help. This year, the charity has assisted 120 people into work.He often sees young people who have been unemployed for a lengthy period pivoting into what officialdom calls “economic inactivity” – moving on to sickness and disability benefits as either poor mental or physical health begin to dominate their lives – or withdrawing from the reach of the state altogether, a way of living that now defines about44% of Neets. Inevitably, he talked about the long shadow of the Covid lockdowns, and the sense that their consequences for millions of young lives amount to a generational debt that has yet to be settled. “We’re talking about the Covid generation,” he told me. “A lot of it’s about anxiety, and confidence. And things that other people take for granted: the way that you walk into a room, the eye contact – they’ve not developed those things. And that’s a huge barrier.”But so too, he said, is the sheer impossibility of navigating a benefits system and job market that are both full of trapdoors and dead ends. “Our young people have often just faced endless rejections,” he told me. “They’re disillusioned. And at the jobcentre it feels more like a monitoring exercise, so they feel under pressure. They’ll be applying for 150 or 200 jobs, to absolutely no avail – and they feel shit, frankly.” When they get to engage with employers, he said, the experience can be awful: “We get people telling us that with, say, certain parts of the banking industry, they’re doing interviews with an AI bot.”Even if young people manage to make it into employment, they seem to run an ever-increasing chance of being tipped back out. About 170,000 jobs have beenlost from UK company payrollssince last summer, and recently published analysis by the Guardian suggests that nearly half of those losses hit people under 25, presumably because of the age-old thinking summed up in the dreaded phrase, “last in, first out”. In that context, Reeves’s decision last year toincrease employers’ national insurance contributionsand thereby discourage hiring was an epic mistake.Afterlast year’s planfor a “youth guarantee” – which promises 18- to 21-year-olds in England access to an apprenticeship, training, education opportunities, or help to find a job – the idea is obligatory “work placements” for young people who have been on universal credit for 18 months or more without “earning or learning”. Outwardly, these should be undeniable steps in the right direction, but the latter comes with a grimly familiar bit of Whitehall boilerplate: “Those who do not take up the offer could face being stripped of their benefits.” Much the same logic ran through some of the abandoned welfare reforms that Reeves now says will be re-attempted – and clearly, the whip-crack of benefits “conditionality” will only make young lives more precarious and insecure, while barely scratching the surface of an issue that touches almost every area of policy.When I spoke to Xiaowei Xu and Louise Murphy, Neets experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation, they both talked about problems that are systemic. Answers to the Neets emergency, for instance, are usually the responsibility of the Department for Work and Pensions. But by the time someone collides with the benefits system, it may be too late. Many of the problem’s roots lie in the schools and colleges overseen by education ministers who need to think much more radically: though the government hasplans to boost vocational qualifications, our education system still operates on the basis that high-flying academic success is the only sure route to a secure career and a good life. Worse still, there are no clear ways back into education for young people who drop out, mostly because the further education colleges that ought to be at the heart of the modern economy are still feeling the effects of long years of insaneunderfunding and neglect.And all the time, the job market becomes more and more impossible. New York magazine – along with other outlets –recently published anexhaustive pieceabout how AI seems to be drastically reducing companies’ dependence on the kind of entry-leveljobs that have always given people a means of starting their working lives. It quoted the founder of a data sharing platform who has stopped hiring junior coders: “There’s just no reason to deal with young employees”. And there was more evidence of what seems to be afoot: the online retail service Shopify, for instance, has told its managers that they must now justify hiring a human by first explaining why AI can’t do the relevant job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even the big theatrical nostalgia screenings are starting to creep into the 21st century, as movies that, to the older among us, don’t seem ready for a multi-decade anniversary. (Did Batman Begins really justturn 20?! Is Mean Girls seriouslyold enough to drink?) So it’s all the more impressive that one of the hottest properties of the past few years has been ...The Wizard of Oz, a movie far closer to its 100th anniversary than its 25th.Of course, The Wizard of Oz as (shudder) intellectual property dates well before the 1939 release of the beloved MGM musical. L Frank Baum published The Wonderful Wizard of Oz at the turn of the previous century, in 1900. It spawned 13 increasingly eccentric sequels, which Baum wrote with what seemed like some reluctance right up until his death in 1919. His final Oz book was published posthumously, and the series continued on without him.Wicked: For Good review – Cynthia Erivo sweeps the field in explosive second chunk of Oz prequelRead moreBut no one is ever talking about the Oz book series when they refer to The Wizard of Oz. In fact, apart from a few oddball borrowings and the half-terrifying, half-tedious Disney adaptationReturn to Oz, most of this material has gone ignored by film and TV. The 1939Victor Fleming-directed movie starringJudy Garland, however, seems bigger than ever – literally, in the case of its engagement at the Sphere in Las Vegas. For this immersive venue used largely for mind-melting concerns, the movie has been both shortened (by 25 minutes, down to a skeletal 75) and extended (by AI technology, expanding the frame to fill the cavernous digital screen). Despite controversy about the changes, the attraction (let’s not call it a film, per se) is a smash, by some estimates making around$2m a day. It boasts higher ticket prices than a normal movie, but still: grosses at that level for just a few months would make it bigger than most traditional films from 2025. If it plays for a year, it could hit James Cameron territory.That would also put it in striking distance of global grosses for aWickedmovie. Wicked isn’t a straight Oz adaptation; it’s a movie version of a Broadway version of a revisionist novel retelling the story from the Wicked Witch of the West’s point of view. But it still takes place in the wonderful land of Oz, and the new movieWicked: For Good(adapting the second act of the musical) more explicitly ties into the events of the original film (moreso than the original book). Naturally, with the sorta-sequel’s success assured, there has been talk about how to extend this version of Oz into a third installment of some sort. (Maybe they can finally start incorporating characters like Tik-Tok and the Patchwork Girl!)The Wizard of Oz at 80: how the world fell under its dark spellRead moreEven if Wicked: For Gooder doesn’t come to pass, there are plenty of other Oz projects in the works. Another musical version,The Wiz, is embarking on a national tour following a Broadway revival. The actual characters are in the public domain, which means acheap and presumably cheeky horror movieis inevitably on the way. A modern-day YA TV series calledDorothyis in the works at Amazon (with Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton producing). Or, if you prefer to stay within the 1939 film, you can always try to gather some cash to bid on yet anotherauctionthat includes the Wicked Witch’s actual hat. This type of Oz memorabilia has a history ofoutdoing expectations.Some of the 1939 movie’s enduring popularity can be chalked up to its pure image-making craft. The moment where Dorothy’s sepia-toned Kansas surroundings give way to the full, super-saturated Technicolor landscapes of Oz is one of the most indelible moments in all of cinema. (Oh, is that all?) At the same time, plenty of iconic works of cinema don’t go this distance nearly a century later. Even the beloved Gone with the Wind, another 1939 release worked on by Fleming and based on a popular novel, doesn’t have this level of staying power. (I’d like to say that’s the inherent racism at work, but for some folks that might be a feature, not a bug.)View image in fullscreenCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in Wicked: For Good.Photograph: Universal Pictures/APWhatWickedseems to build upon – again, more from the movie than the original Baum book – is the allegorical power of Dorothy’s trip from stifling, vaguely repressive Kansas to an imaginative, strange, eye-popping world. Yet there’s plenty to please the more conservative members of the audience too, with Dorothy deciding, despite the close friends she makes in Oz, that she’s simply desperate to return home – with the audience perhaps newly aware that the normies she knew in Kansas are played by the same actors as the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion. So you have some escapism chased with reassurance that farm life in Kansas is more or less the same thing as a vast kingdom of magic and talking animals. It’s easy to imagine, say, a gay kid and their less-than-understanding parents watching the movie and both feeling like it validates their feelings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Melting isn’t fun’: Jon M Chu on Wicked: For Good, Ariana Grande – and living the American dreamRead moreThe books are not so simple: Dorothy eventually relocates to Oz permanently. (Her trips there also become hilariously less elaborate than a tornado carrying her house or falling overboard on a ship.) And the feature Return to Oz, inspired by some of the sequel novels, opens with Dorothy threatened with shock treatments over her incessant nostalgia for her Oz trip, in a frightening scene that evokes conversion therapy. Wicked, too, has barely concealed allegory for racism, homophobia or any other social prejudice, as Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) is ostracized and scapegoated by the duplicitous Wizard, who projects the image of power despite being something of a con artist. (Sound familiar?)Much of the allegorical material in Wicked is clumsy stuff, especially in the distended For Good, which more than doubles the length of the play’s weaker second act. But its lineage connecting back to the old movie’s legacy of providing solace for viewers who feel ill at lease in their regular lives is obviously powerful. That continued with the Broadway and film versions of The Wiz, where the Oz concept is reimagined with an all-Black cast, underlining the story’s resonance with marginalized groups.It’s particularly notable that works focusing more on the Wizard himself – the Sam Raimiprequel film from 2013, or some of Baum’s sequels – don’t seem to have as much impact as explorations of the story’s female characters. Even the wild fantastical stuff often feels secondary to that emotional grounding. Maybe that’s why there hasn’t (yet) been a major, big-budget Oz theme park (though doubtless that will pop up at some point). It’s the rare fantasy-world franchise that doesn’t necessarily ask for your full buy-in. Instead, it constantly leaves you hovering between bizarre fantasy and heartbreaking reality.Explore more on these topicsThe Wizard Of OzWicked: For GoodWickedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Allen does a capable impression, nailing the voice and looking every bit as socially awkward as May but the preternatural aspects are taken further to make her seem like a Tory politician of the zombie apocalypse, walking stiffly with arms dangling in front.She takes Nikhil through her 10 steps to Britishness – Erin Guan’s stage set makes these steps literal along with dangling props and a towering screen on which dates are flashed. Its central idea of a phantom May is an original one, perkily staged with bursts of music and good sparring dialogue between Nikhil and his bestie, Jyoti (Tanya Katyal), a trainee lawyer and activist with a keen sense of social injustice. Their repartee brings the humour and sting rather than the saggy jokes on Britishness and assimilation which are all about keeping calm and carrying on, a love of queuing and talking about the weather. Nikhil sounds like a malfunctioning Richard Curtis character as he apes British banter. It is all way too familiar in its stiff upper lipness to cut deeply and you just don’t believe in his conversion.Under the direction of Natasha Kathi-Chandra, its staging brings clunky dreamlike interludes. Characters come on in smiley-face masks to enact them and they are not as sinister as they ought to be.The drama begins in 2013, a significant date for India when the legality of homosexuality was overturned. An adjunct to the main story is the rejection of Nikhil’s homosexuality by his parents, a serious issue that seems nothing more than a useful way of leaving him isolated rather than being explored more fully.View image in fullscreenIsolated … Taraash Mehrotra as Nikhil in I Dream of Theresa May.Photograph: Adam Razvi/Tara theatreIf the nation had a home secretary of Indian origin things would be so different, Nikhil says at one point, and it gets a laugh for its ironies. It seems as if Nikhil might turn towards politics himself by the end. That would make an interesting play (The Estate, at the National Theatre’s Dorfman trod just this ground) and May here makes the point that Nikhil is a natural conservative – wealthy, well-educated, un-unionised.May’s citizens of the world speech – made after her elevation to prime minister – was, in fact, all about globetrotting elites rather than those subject to today’s anti-immigrant moral panic. So the drama seems rather historic, given all that has come to pass since. Her speech seems positively tame compared to Nigel Farage, Reform and the mainstreaming of anti-immigrant fervour today.At Tara theatre, Earlsfield, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatrePolitical theatreImmigration and asylumTheresa MayreviewsShareReuse this content"

Staged at theBethlem Museum of the Mind, in the world’s oldest psychiatric hospital, in south-east London, Kindredwill explore the power of communities to make people feel comforted as well as isolated.Morning Group by the artistCharlotte Johnson Wahl,the late mother of Boris Johnson, painted when she was a patient at the Maudsley hospital, shows her horror of group therapy sessions.

It’s important people find what works for them,” she said.Johnson Wahl’s work “is very clearly a negative experience of group therapy”, Raybone said. “She was quite horrified by it and found it very intrusive. She has painted herself as the lady with the red hair. And has this look of horror and almost kind of ghostliness.”View image in fullscreenGareth McConnell, The Forth Universalist Society, New York, 2005, from a series of photographs of community meeting rooms.Photograph: Gareth McConnell/SorikaMcConnell’s photographs show rooms before community filled them. He said: “I sat in my first ever Narcotics Anonymous meeting in Wickham Park House [the now defunct detox unit at Bethlem Maudsley] in 1999 while undergoing a 28-day treatment plan for chronic intravenous poly-drug use. It was a room not dissimilar to the ones I later photographed – broken plastic chairs, lino floor, strip lighting – but, as I later came to realise, it was temporarily pervaded by the power of love, induced by the ritual/ceremony/meeting that took place.”Mud, who has lived experience of borderline personality disorder and psychosis, said: “I firmly believe in the healing benefits of support from a community that understands and has been through similar things. I don’t think I’d be on my recovery journey today if it weren’t for other people helping me along the way.”Other works on display include a large oil painting, The Group, by the late artist and art therapist Charles Lutyens; David Chick’s intricate People Trying to Reach Me (1986); Holding on to Daddy (2016) by the photographer Benji Reid, an image that won the Wellcome Trust photography prize 2020 in the mental health single image category; and the vibrant ceramics of the Chilean artist and former prisoner of conscience Bibi Herrera, who spent time in treatment at Bethlem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Today, the tables have turned: it is Great Britain that finds itself at the mercy of major US tech firms – so huge and dominant that they constitute monopolies in their fields – as well as the whims of an erratic president. Yet, to the outside observer, Britain seems curiously at ease with this arrangement – at times even eager to subsidise its own economic dependence. Britain is hardly alone in submitting to the power of American firms, but it offers a clear case study in why nations need to develop a coordinated response to the rise of these hegemonic companies.The current age of American tech monopoly began in the 2000s, when the UK, like many other countries, became almost entirely dependent on a small number of US platforms – Google, Facebook, Amazon and a handful of others. It was a time of optimism about the internet as a democratising force, characterised by the belief that these platforms would make everyone rich. The dream of the 1990s – naive but appealing – was that anyone with a hobby or talent could go online and make a living from it.US tech dominance wasn’t the result of a single policy decision. Yet it was still a choice that countries made – as is highlighted by China’s decision to block foreign sites and build its own. While that move was far easier under an authoritarian system, it also amounted to an industrial policy – one that left China as the only other major economy with its own full digital ecosystem.The pattern was sustained through the 2000s and 2010s. Cloud computing was quickly cornered by Amazon and Microsoft. No serious European or UK competitor emerged to challenge platforms such as Uber or Airbnb. These companies have undoubtedly brought us convenience and entertainment, but the wealth of the internet has not spread as widely as many hoped; instead, US firms took the lion’s share, becoming the most valuable corporations in history. Now the same thing is happening with artificial intelligence. Once more, the big profits look destined for Silicon Valley.How did all this meet with such little resistance? In short, the UK and Europe followed the logic of free trade and globalisation. Nations, according to this theory, should focus only on what they do best. So just as it made sense for the UK to import French burgundies and Spanish hams, it also seemed logical to rely on American technology rather than trying to do it locally. Better to specialise instead in the UK’s own strengths, such as finance, the creative industries – or making great whisky.Datacentres are the bottom rung of the AI economy, private infrastructure that simply channels profits back to US headquartersBut when it comes to these new platforms, the analogy with regular trade breaks down. There is a vast difference between fine wines and the technologies that underpin the entire online economy. Burgundies can be pricey, but they don’t extract value from every commercial transaction or collect lucrative data. The trade theories of the 1990s masked the distinction between ordinary goods and what are, in effect, pieces of market infrastructure – systems essential to buying and selling. That’s what Google and Amazon represent. A better analogy might be letting a foreign firm build toll roads across the country, charging whatever it likes to use them.We’re seeing this again with the build-out of artificial intelligence. During President Trump’s state visit in September, the UK proudly celebratedGoogleandMicrosoft’s investments in “datacentres” – vast warehouses of computer servers that power AI systems. Yet datacentres are the bottom rung of the AI economy, private infrastructure that simply channels profits back to US headquarters.Could urban farming feed the world?Read moreIn another timeline, the UK could have been a true leader in AI. US researchers were once far behind their British and French counterparts. Yet, in a move neither Washington nor Beijing would have permitted, the UK cheerfully allowed the sale of most of its key AI assets and talent over the last decade or so –DeepMind’s purchaseby Google being the most famous example. What remains is an AI strategy consisting of the supply of electricity and land for datacentres. It’s like being invited to a party only to discover you’re there to serve the drinks.If tech platforms are indeed like toll roads, the logical step would be to limit their take – perhaps by capping fees or charging for data extraction. Yet no country has done so: we accept the platforms but fail to regulate their power as we do with other utilities. The European Union has come closest, with itsDigital Markets Act, which regulates how dominant platforms treat dependent businesses. The US government, for its part, is also at the mercy of its homegrown tech giants, yet Congress remains paralysed.If the UK wanted to take a different path, to resist this economic colonisation and extraction, it could partner with the European Union and perhaps Japan in order to develop a joint strategy – one that forces platforms to support local businesses and nurtures alternatives to mature US technologies. So far, though, alongside other nations disadvantaged by American dominance, it has been slow to adapt, instead hoping that the 90s playbook will still work, despite evidence to the contrary.The truth is that we now live in a more cynical and strategic era. One way or another, the world needs an anti-monopoly framework with far greater force than anything seen so far. Wherever you live, it’s clear the world would be better off with more firms from different countries. The alternative is not only costly but politically dangerous, feeding resentment and dependence. We can do better than a future where what counts as economic freedom is merely a choice between relying on the United States, or relying on China.Tim Wu is a former special assistant to President Biden and author ofThe Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity(Bodley Head).Further readingThe Tech Coupby Marietje Schaake (Princeton, £13.99)Supremacyby Parmy Olson (Pan Macmillan, £10.99)Chip Warby Chris Miller (Simon & Schuster, £10.99)Explore more on these topicsTechnologyThe big ideaEconomicsArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

As Booker winner George Saunders puts it, “Chekhov – shall I be blunt? – is the greatest short story writer who ever lived.” Novelists from Ann Patchett to Zadie Smith cite him as an inspiration. His plays The Seagull, Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and The Cherry Orchard still pack out theatres internationally. In the past year alone, Andrew Scott wowed audiences in his one-man Vanya for London’s National Theatre and Cate Blanchett took on the role of Arkadina in The Seagull at the Barbican. But how much did you know about his silly side?Anton Chekhov: Earliest Stories offers the first comprehensive translation in English of the stories, novellas and humoresques that the Russian author wrote in the early 1880s. And it is supremely juvenile in the best way. The reason many of these stories are now appearing in translation for the first time is because, explains editor Rosamund Bartlett, they have never been regarded by commercial publishers as “worthy” of Chekhov’s reputation. They are too childishly comical. During the translation process, she says, “we would just collapse in fits of giggles”.Bartlett, the author of acclaimed biographies of Chekhov and Tolstoy, and her co-editor Elena Michajlowska, a UK-based Russian film-maker, run the Anton Chekhov Foundation, a charity whose starry patrons include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Stoppard and Kenneth Branagh. The foundation was originally set up to preserve Chekhov’s White Dacha in Yalta. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 this work was no longer possible, so instead they came up with the “crazy, idealistic idea” of sourcing 80 volunteer translators across the globe – from school students to retired academics – to translate these previously unseen stories.He told his editor that he doubted any of his stories would ‘survive in people’s memory for even a decadeWritten by Chekhov between the ages of 20 and 22, they are full of experimental wordplay, nonsense names and onomatopoeiac idiocy, from the village of Eaten-Pancakes (“Bliny-S’edeny”) in the opening story, Letter to a Learned Neighbour, to railway stations called Crash, Bang, Wallop, Run for Your Life and Swindler Town in On the Train, and a character called Second Lieutenant Zyumbumbunchikov in Before the Wedding (it means nothing, but say it aloud and it’s genius).These 58 stories, written under numerous pseudonyms, are little known, even among experts, says Bartlett. “Chekhov is better known as a writer of stories in Russia than of plays, and these stories remind us that he began as a humorist,” she says. “Not all of them are funny, or even intended to make us laugh, but a great many are totally frivolous – as one would expect from a 20-year-old medical student just trying to earn a few kopecks writing for comic journals.”Chekhov’s father had recently been declared bankrupt, so he was paying for his own education while also supporting the rest of his family. He wanted to conserve his real name for publication in respected scientific journals. Within a few years, however, it had become evident that – whether he liked it or not – he was a writer and his writing was worth taking seriously. By the mid 1880s, he had formulated the now legendary idea that medicine would be his “lawful wedded wife” and writing his mistress. (“When I’ve had enough of one, I can go and spend the night with the other.”)Chekhov was never a fan of his own work, whether prose or plays. He was modest about even his most famous and beloved short stories The Lady With the Dog (about a love affair in Yalta), Ward No 6 (about a doctor who is sick of his profession) and The Darling (about a woman who is ludicrously co-dependent, long before the term was invented). After a disastrous first outing of The Seagull in 1896 he was so mortified that he fled the theatre: “I shallnevereither write plays or have them acted.” (The play was staged by Konstantin Stanislavski in 1898 to great acclaim.) In 1888, he wrote to his editor that he doubted any of his stories would “survive in people’s memory for even a decade”. His doubts never made him less prolific. In 1884 alone – the year he graduated as a doctor – he published more than 100 stories. By the time he died in 1904 of tuberculosis at the age of 44, that number had climbed to more than 500.This collection is published at a fragile cultural moment. Ukrainian writers including Oksana Zabuzhko, Olesya Khromeychuk and Oleksandr Mykhed have argued for a critical re-evaluation of Russian literature – and for more space for Ukrainian voices and culture. “The revulsion many Ukrainians feel now for Russian literature due to the war is understandable,” says Bartlett. “But even those who repudiate it often make an exception for Chekhov, for good reason.”The young Chekhov and his brothers would stage amateur productions of plays in Ukrainian – the language was part of his birthrightCrucially, Chekhov does not belong to Putin’s Russia, she says. “He was never an imperialist, he couldn’t stand the jingoism of a writer like Dostoevsky, and the country is not littered with statues of him. Chekhov was a quarter Ukrainian himself, and grew up in Taganrog, a town historically part of Ukraine. During his childhood he and his brothers used to stage amateur productions of plays in Ukrainian – the language was part of his birthright. Chekhov occasionally used Ukrainian sayings, and we have highlighted them and explained their meaning in the annotations.”Bartlett suggests that it shouldn’t be a case of reading “either/or”: “Increasing our familiarity with Ukrainian writers should not have to exclude the possibility of discovering new works by Chekhov. We need to keep reading, and read more.” Zyumbumbunchikov can’t be a bad place to start.Anton Chekhov: Earliest Stories: Stories, Novellas, Humoresques, 1880–1882, edited by Rosamund Bartlett and Elena Michajlowska, is published by Cherry Orchard.Explore more on these topicsAnton ChekhovFictionPublishingShort storiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As you traipse from one commissioning meeting to the next, pitching your passion project on the history of mime or the secret life of snails, you can almost hear the words before they’re spoken: “Got any other ideas?” Preferably something with a body count.I had just begun making documentaries in 2015, when the double whammy of HBO’sThe Jinxand Netflix’sMaking a Murdererbrought true crime back to the dead centre of popular culture. Positioned as social justice projects as much as murder mysteries, those shows seemed to herald a new beginning for the genre. Soon enough, though, they gave way to a steady stream of interchangeable offerings, many of them organised into reproducible formats such as Netflix’sConversations With a Killerfranchise, each season of which is built round a long-lost interview with a notorious serial killer, unearthed to order.Nonetheless, I wasn’t entirely hostile to the trend. Having long been a voracious consumer of true-crime films and TV shows, I was drawn to the puzzle-solving aspect of the genre: the way clues slot together over the course of the running time and make a neat resolution feel tantalisingly close at hand, even when we know the case in question remains unsolved.View image in fullscreenA Wanted bulletin and letters sent to the San Francisco Chronicle by the man who called himself Zodiac.Photograph: Eric RisbergAPI still remember my first viewing of the French true-crime series The Staircase, broadcast by the BBC in 2005. (Later, with the true-crime boom in full swing, it was acquired and extended by Netflix, then adapted into a dramatic miniseries by HBO.) As revelation after revelation seemed to point towards the innocence of novelist Michael Peterson, accused of killing his wife Kathleen, I became convinced he would be acquitted in the finale – despite having already looked him up online and found him to be imprisoned in North Carolina. Such is the power of the puzzle.Of course, I had misgivings about a puzzle forged from the lives – and horrific deaths – of real people, but I reasoned that making something entertaining might be a good way to put something meaningful in front of a large audience; that true crime’s familiar tropes and rigid formulas could perhaps be put in the service of something more ambitious. The possibilities swirled in my head as I allowed myself to imagine a true-crime documentary of my own.I had stumbled upon a memoir called The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up, written by a recently deceased California highway patrol officer named Lyndon Lafferty. In the book, Lafferty details his decades-long quest to bring the infamous Bay Area serial killer to justice, following a serendipitous encounter with his suspect at a highway rest stop.The stock reply to any ethical complaint is a simple one: that all of this is in the service of the victimsIt wasn’t the first book I’d read about the Zodiac Killer, who murdered at least five people during a killing spree in the late 1960s, and guaranteed his place in the annals of 20th-century crime by sending a series of enigmatic letters and cryptograms. That was cartoonist-turned-investigator Robert Graysmith’s 1986 best-seller Zodiac, which I’d discovered via David Fincher’s acclaimed 2007 film adaptation. But Lafferty’s version was by far the most idiosyncratic, filled with outlandish twists and dramatic cliffhangers alongside the core components of a true-crime yarn: a dogged investigator who refuses to be swayed from his mission; a trail of clues unearthed across decades; and a killer still at large.View image in fullscreenThe book that inspired Shackleton’s film.As I pursued the rights to adapt The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up for the screen, the film began to make itself in my head. I pictured a mysterious cold open, re-enacting Lafferty’s fateful rest stop encounter in a series of tense closeups. From there, the title sequence would thrum into life, offering a patchwork of sepia-toned images foreshadowing the sinister tale to come. I envisioned the faded diner where I’d interview former cops, veteran reporters and anyone else who was still knocking around after 50 years.I was determined to resist the confirmation bias that pervades so many theories of the case, and include evidence that pointed away from Lafferty’s subject as well as towards him. But after half a century of investigation by law enforcement and amateur sleuths alike, there was vastly more evidence than I could ever hope to fit in a feature film, and it soon became hard to tell on what basis I was making my selections. There are half a dozen different accounts of the killer’s height alone, and the one that matched Lafferty’s suspect was as good as any other. This mountain of investigative paperwork renders almost any crime a candidate for the true-crime treatment.Are we all simply captive to an insatiable, voyeuristic appetite for the macabre?As long as there have been criminal codes, people have told stories about their violation, and the relatively brief history of cinema has been littered with morbid tales from the start. Motion picture pioneer Siegmund Lubin dramatised the sensational 1906 murder of architect Stanford White at Madison Square Garden in his film The Unwritten Law, and had the film on screens within a year of the killing.The modern true-crime film, however, has a shorter lineage, taking most of its aesthetic and narrative cues from Errol Morris’s 1988 classic documentary The Thin Blue Line. That film, which re-examined the shooting of a Dallas police officer a decade prior, set the mould for the foggy re-enactments and speculative timelines that have become de rigueur in both the genre’s lowliest daytime TV offerings and its Emmy-winning prestige dramas (and helped collapse the distance between the two). It also boasts the honour to which all true crime aspires, having successfully affected the outcome of the case at its centre.That it did so while upholding consistent ethical standards is perhaps its least imitated quality. Even those few true-crime works that have likewise changed the course of judicial history have done so within a far looser moral framework: The Jinx managed to elicit a confession from suspected serial killer Robert Durst, but rearranged his words in post-production for fear they weren’t damning enough.The stock reply to any ethical complaint about true crime’s methods is a simple one: that all of this is in the service of the victims, and that occasional moral transgressions are a small price to pay to deliver closure to them and their families. The queasy tone of so much modern true crime lies in the jarring contrast between the self-righteousness of that claim and the lurid creative choices it’s used to justify.View image in fullscreenThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst.Photograph: HBOIn the CBS miniseries The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey, criminal behavioural analyst (and self-proclaimed victim advocate) Laura Richards advances the theory that six-year-old JonBenét may have been killed by her preteen brother, who has always denied this claim and was never charged with the killing. To prove the viability of this scenario, she has a child actor slam a flashlight down on a skull wrapped in pig skin and a blond wig. As the resulting fracture is held up for comparison with a photo from Ramsey’s autopsy, Richards assures us that this macabre endeavour is a necessary one: “This is quite hard to do, but we do need to do this, to see what it looks like.”Those for whom all of this is supposedly being done may or may not appreciate it. Netflix’s glossy 2022 miniseriesMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Storyjustified its gruesome re-enactment of Dahmer’s crimes on the basis that its sympathies lay ultimately with his victims’ families, but the producers didn’t manage to contact any of them. Several subsequently spoke out against the show, including Eric Perry, a relative of Dahmer victim Errol Lindsey, who told the Los Angeles Times: “We’re all one traumatic event away from the worst day of your life being reduced to your neighbour’s favourite binge show.” Two further Monster series, on the Menendez brothers and Ed Gein, would follow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Dark clouds hang over the communities where terrible crimes took place, we’re told, and it’s our duty to confront these latent collective traumas, however painful the task may be. I could already hear my future interviewees darkly intoning about the sinister aura of Vallejo, California – the centre of the Zodiac Killer’s crime spree – as I arrived there in August 2022 to scout locations.I found myself describing shots, lengthy scenes and the entire narrative arc of my unrealised (and now unrealisable) filmThe reality was more mundane. Not only did daily life in Vallejo seem largely indifferent to events that took place half a century earlier, but most people I encountered weren’t even aware of the city’s morbid claim to fame. In a cab from the airport, my driver was far more interested in telling me about Vallejo’s notable rappers Mac Dre, E-40, Nef the Pharaoh)than its notorious killers. Gazing out of the window, I imagined the moody lens filter I’d need to sell the place as indelibly marked by its gruesome past.I would soon discover it to be a moot point. Two days later, while eating lunch in a diner that I thought might make a suitable filming location, I got an email informing me that negotiations for the rights to Lafferty’s book had fallen through. No specific reason was given, but I immediately wondered if someone with deeper pockets, or a more impressive CV, had discovered the book’s obvious cinematic potential and made a better offer.I wandered out into the street and paused to consider where that left me. Without the Sturm und Drang of Lafferty’s five-decade crusade for justice, the Zodiac Killer case was just a set of facts available to anyone with an internet connection. Without Lafferty’s suspect to loom large over its inhabitants, Vallejo was just a sleepy city with a Six Flags amusement park. I looked around at my surroundings. The sun was high in the sky and there wasn’t a dark cloud in sight.It wasn’t the first time I’d had a project fall through, and I assumed I’d simply lick my wounds for a few weeks before moving on to new ideas. Back in London, however, I was unable to get Lafferty’s story off my mind, and soon found myself describing individual shots, lengthy scenes and the entire narrative arc of the unrealised (and now unrealisable) film to anyone who would listen. If the uncanny familiarity of true crime had made the project easy to conceptualise, it now made it impossible to forget. Eventually, that frustration started to seem like an equally worthy subject.In the film I ultimately made, unimaginatively titled Zodiac Killer Project, I describe the doomed film beat by beat, in real time, over footage of the everyday Vallejo scenes that met me when I first arrived in the Bay Area. Although I allow myself a few fleeting recreations of true crime’s reflexive visual cliches – shell casings clattering to the ground, crime-scene tape stretching out into the distance – the film is shaped largely by what’s not on screen. As I fill in the blanks of each scene, and explain the thinking behind the project, I repeatedly hit up against the unresolved ethical questions and narrative contrivances at the heart of the project, and the genre at large.The film is both an elegy for my unmade true-crime entry and an attempt to grapple with true crime itself, as it continues its seemingly intractable takeover of the documentary industry. If those goals sound contradictory, they reflect the mixed feelings I’ve observed in so many of my peers, who have endeavoured to make meaningful, ethical true-crime films even as they’ve wondered aloud whether true crime might be beyond redemption.Zodiac Killer Project review – true crime critique rescues aborted documentaryRead morePerhaps that ambivalence explains why the genre has become so keen to indict its own viewers. Everything from queasy high-budget drama serial Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story to mischievous docuseriesDon’t F**k With Catscomes complete with a sequence questioning the appeal of true crime itself. Are viewers indulging their worst fears as a kind of exposure therapy, they ask with sober concern, or wallowing in the misery of others to feel better about themselves? Or are we all simply captive to an insatiable, voyeuristic appetite for the macabre?Whatever the case, the documentary industry itself is off the hook. The countless true-crime films, TV shows, books and podcasts released week after week are merely an attempt to keep up with demand. Or so we keep insisting. But every meeting in which I find myself lured back into the murky waters of true crime, having very publicly laid those ambitions to rest, suggests another possibility: that the legions of true-crime fans are just desperately trying to keep up with our supply.Zodiac Killer Project is released in cinemas on28November.

Yes,Lewis Carroll’s children’s classic is rich in novelty, wit and delight. But yes, too, its structure is episodic and its protagonist lacks agency. Stuff just happens to Alice, one thing after another: colourful but not dramatic.Carroll purists would surely disagree, but in Gallus in Weegieland, Johnny McKnight makes a better fist of it than most. His version might divert from the original with a story about a girl travelling from Glasgow’s bougie West End to working-class Dennistoun, where she falls in love with a boy-rabbit, but it also gives this Alice Pleasance Liddell a motivation and an adversary.Being a millennial, she is on a journey; in this case, to find bravery, imagination and love (and ideally a dance certificate). This she will achieve only by winning a good-versus-evil battle with Queenie of Hearts (an ebullient Louise McCarthy, the closest this panto has to a dame).Newcomer Jorgey Scott-Learmonth makes a radiant Alice. With the relentless positivity of Ellie Kemper inUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, she is blind to the threat of the execution-happy Queenie and winningly deserving of the affections of Star Penders’s immature boy-rabbit. Their inevitable kiss is hilariously delayed for most of the show.View image in fullscreenGags … Catriona Faint, centre, as Hatter.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicMcKnight, who is currently playing the dame at theMacrobert, Stirling, has spruced up his 2017 script to include gags about Ozempic medication, new Pitlochry Festival theatre directorAlan Cumming(himself a former Tron panto writer) and Celia Imrie farting onCelebrity Traitors. It’s not big, it’s not clever, but it is funny.So too are director Sally Reid’s company, completed not only by Catriona Faint, on superbly deadpan form as Hatter, and Marc Mackinnon, as a laughably lugubrious Honey the Caterpillar, but also understudies Jessica Donnelly and Aidan MacColl giving extra power to Ross Brown’s upbeat songs. It is all played out on a set by Kenny Miller that, with its clashing black-and-white stripes and checks, is somewhere between a liquorice mint and adazzle ship. It adds to the disorientation of a deliriously daft show.At the Tron theatre, Glasgow, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatrePanto seasonTron theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

I arrived to find the Pennines under a thick blanket of cloud and the temperature hovering around zero. So it’s just as well that music is a largely indoor pursuit: since 1978, autumn here has meant the annual influx of big names in experimental and avant garde music for theHuddersfield Contemporary Music festival. Once a draw for postwar heavyweights includingKarlheinz Stockhausen,Olivier MessiaenandJohn Cage, the HCMF remains the UK’s largest international festival dedicated to new music, with more than 30 world and UK premieres on this year’s programme.The opening night featured three. In Huddersfield Town Hall, London-based Explore Ensemble sat in a pool of spotlights, the magnificent Victorian space made intimate. A new version of Canon Mensurabilis by Lithuanian composer Rytis Mažulis saw repetitive shimmers of microtonal dissonance interrupted by sparse octaves and fifths. The performance’s astonishing precision blurred the line between acoustic sound and an electronic track that gradually took over. Bryn Harrison’s The Spectre … Is Always Already a Figure of That Which is to Come worked a still more persuasive magic. Opening with what sounded like a creaking seesaw scored for chamber ensemble, shards of acoustic material were followed by ghostly echoes on a prerecorded electronic track. There were beautiful details – rough shivers of violin tremolo, flutters of bass clarinet, pedal-washed piano circling – but the work’s ultimate payoff came in its longer arc. The feedback loop gradually reversed so that the musicians responded to their electronic counterparts – the process of haunting complete and utterly compelling.View image in fullscreenBlurring lines … the spotlit Explore Ensemble.Photograph: Point Of ViewThe late-night concert saw venerable French outfit Dedalus Ensemble present the UK premiere of Motor Tapes by this year’s HCMF composer in residence Sarah Hennies. A subtly weighted drum roll launched an hour-long exploration of rhythm and timbre inspired by a study of human brain activity. An array of individual effects – knuckle-knocks, mouthy squelches and chinks of metal-on-metal – phased gently across the ensemble. A lengthy sequence in which the musicians applied milk frothers to various surfaces sounded like being in a room full of miniature jackhammers. By the time the piece ended with rapid switches between hushed plastic scrunching, key shaking and twig rattling – a dead ringer for an audience member digging in their bag – several people around me had nodded off.Sampling the range of what counts as “new music” is, of course, one of the pleasures of HCMF. Ninety this year, with albums of his music lodged permanently in the classical charts, Estonian composerArvo Pärtis hardly avant garde. But the Carice Singers’ performance of his Sarah Was Ninety Years Old in their lunchtime programme was a welcome reminder of Pärt’s daring. Using only four pitches, three voices, a percussionist and an organ, the piece lapses repeatedly into silence – managed with absolute calm by conductor George Parris. Where the Pärt demanded fearless solo singing, the UK premiere of Žibuoklė Martinaitytė’s Aletheia showcased the lucid, full-bodied sound and fine-grained blend of what has become one of the UK’s most adventurous and accomplished choirs.Huddersfield Contemporary Music festival continues until 30 NovemberExplore more on these topicsClassical musicHuddersfield contemporary music festivalExperimental musicYorkshireChoral musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

But with impenetrable cloud and heavy rain forecast, it was hard not to feel deflated.Then again, this was Italy, where it’s easy to make the best of things whatever the weather. And the 3 Zinnen Dolomites ski resort and nature park – right on Italy’s border with Austria, about two-and-a-half hours north of Venice, is always charming, with the usual jumble of cultures you see in South Tyrol. Part Italian, it’s more Austrian thanks to the legacy of the Habsburgs, who ruled this part of Italy until 1918. Hence most places have an Austrian and an Italian name, 3 Zinnen or Tre Cime (meaning three peaks) being a case in point. It’s the home of Ladin, an ancient Romance language, too.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian GraphicsOf the five villages that make up 3 Zinnen Dolomites, I was staying in the largest, San Candido (or Innichen), which looked as Austrian as could be – onion-domed church and pastel-coloured, richly detailed houses you would see in Salzburg. Even under leaden skies, it was a pretty place, its pedestrianised centre filled with classy shops selling cashmere and leather goods and, happily, an impressive number of delis stocking high-quality (but not necessarily high-priced) regional food. The sort that makes you want to move to Italy.View image in fullscreenSan Candido is in the shadow of some of the Dolomites’ most dramatic peaks.Photograph: Matteo Martinazzoli/AlamyKeeping an eye on the weather was simple from my balcony atHotel Leitlhofoverlooking San Candido, with a view of the village’s ski slope and snippets of the Dolomites between the clouds. All five villages are connected by bus and some by train, with links to 3 Zinnen’s various ski areas, cross-country ski trails and high-altitude walking trails that don’t even require snowshoes.Occasionally, the clouds would swirl and a rugged peak would poke into view before being obscured againOne of those buses took me to Signaue, where I caught glimpses of faintly blue sky as the cable car whizzed me up to Stiergarten at 2,100m. Turning my back on the skiers at the top, I followed a signposted walking trail that took me slowly back down the mountain. The only other prints in the fresh snow were of a four-legged creature, possibly a hare or a fox. Occasionally, the clouds would swirl and a rugged peak would poke into view before being obscured again. But in this winter wonderland, those atmospheric clouds were playing as much of a starring role as the mountains they were shrouding.The only sound was my boots in the snow as I descended into pine woods. Light snow was falling again and it whetted my appetite for lunch atSkihütte Henn-Stoll(or Baita Pollaio) at the foot of the cable car. I fell on a plate ofKnödel/canederli– dumplings packed with cheese and melted butter served with a cabbage salad flavoured with caraway seeds. This was classic Ladin mountain comfort food.View image in fullscreenThe writer on the path down from Stiegarten.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeMarch’s longer days meant the sun hadn’t quite set on San Candido when it was time for the early-evening passeggiata and aperitivo. Thrillingly, it actually made an appearance, bringing a warm glow to the mountains rising behind those beautiful Austrian-style houses before dusk exposed the full moon to midnight-blue skies. Pure magic.The next morning I took the bus to the cable car in the neighbouring village of Versciaco (Vierschach), another 3 Zinnen ski area. At Helm (or Monte Elmo), I stumbled into Narnia: a trail through pine woods. It was soothing to shuffle gently through the snow and think about lunch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The robust flavours were a perfect match for the misty mountains.Opening the curtains on my last morning was like waking up on Christmas Day. Snow had covered everything. I was on the bus to Val Fiscalina to follow a trail through larch forests. As it was Saturday, I seemed to have been joined by half the population, all apparently with the same destination –Talschlusshütte, a charmingly rustic restaurant in the woods (open Christmas to Easter). I had been warned not to be late and lose my table; since San Candido local boy Jannik Sinner became the world No 1 tennis player and word went out that his father had been the chef at Talschlusshütte, the restaurant’s popularity has soared, even if Sinner Senior is no longer in the kitchen.View image in fullscreenSpinach dumplings (knödel)with cream cheese and speck are a local speciality.Photograph: Fabrizio Troiani/AlamyWhoever was in the kitchen knew how to make a mean baconknödelandthe clear herby broth it was served in.

The clouds were on the move. I turned round to catch a glimpse of a mountain, then another, then another. Finally, just hours before I was to go home, the 3 Zinnen – or Tre Cime, three peaks – revealed themselves in all their jagged glory. I whooped in joy, then turned round again and they were gone.This trip was provided by3 Zinnen Dolomites.

Old boozers are reclaimed, reloved and restored, and the great tradition of going down the pub is celebrated.The Devonshire in nearby Piccadillyis, of course, the daddy, the Darth Vader of this trend, winning plaudits, TikTok adoration and celebrity fans aplenty. So it’s no wonder that myriad other hospitality operators have cast an eye over their local neglected fleapit and thought: “Let’s buy some Mr Sheen, give that old hovel a polish and start serving duck à l’orange and flourless chocolate tart. It’s all the rage! Gen Z loves it!”View image in fullscreen‘Very delicate’: the Shaston Arms’ scallop-topped mash with curry leaves.Whether Gen Z really does love anything about the pub experience as it was in the 20th century is debatable, however, because inside these poshed-up spit-and-sawdust boozers, all the phlegm and fag ash has gone – as have the dartboards, pool tables, punch-ups, topless women on KP peanut pub cards and the ever-present bar-fly alcoholic drinking himself yellow while droning on about his marital problems. “It’s a pub just like pubs used to be,” proclaim many of these places, of which the Shaston near Carnaby Street is a great example. But those old pubs had jukeboxes blaring problematic ballads by Tom Jones, and a snug bar with a shag tartan carpet where the womenfolk could nestle with their glass ofDubonnetbecause we weren’t quite welcome in the saloon bar, and especially not if we asked for a pint.The Shaston is a pleasantly sterile, heavily Gen Z-friendly experience: a polished room with some strategically placed rock’n’roll art, a few beers with weird names on tap and, of course, a menu offering fennel and escarole caponata with hazelnuts and caramel flan withmiyagawa. The menu is imaginative and, in its bowls of beef-fat onion rings with smoked cod’s roe, merguez baguettes and mashed potato topped with scallop, makes the odd wry nod towards old-school pub comfort food. But there are also flights of finesse with the likes of delica squash with fontina and walnut salsa rosso, and some very saltybigoliwith chanterelles and pecorino.View image in fullscreen‘A wry nod to old-school pub comfort food’: the Shaston Arms’ merguez baguette.Some of the cooking is very delicate, too – that creamy mash with a lightly spiced scallop and curry leaves, for example – but elsewhere it is simply heavy-handed. Do whopping great and not particularly crunchy onion rings really need heavily smoked fish roe as an accompaniment? In fairness, the plate was whisked away before I’d finished them, so they saved me the trouble of solving that particular conundrum. And does a caramel tart need an overdose of salted almonds and some very bitter citrus fruit? Just because you can do these things doesn’t mean you should do them.The biggest issue with the cooking here, though, is that the Shaston Arms is very keen to be an old-school boozer at the same time as being a cool restaurant that serves food at premium prices. Service-wise, however, in the restaurant at least, there was little or no hospitality at all, because they’ve seemingly not employed a single member of staff who is able to provide any of the standard niceties of a restaurant’s front of house, such as checking if a customer wants another drink, changing cutlery or side plates between courses, asking if everything is OK, making eye contact, explaining what the dishes are or even noticing when a passing bartender says loudly, “God, it’s cold in the restaurant bit, isn’t it?” Meanwhile, the diners – ie, me – sit with chattering teeth next to a ringing reservations telephone and someone cutting bread, which incidentally is £4.50 a pop for a minuscule amount of baguette with nondescript, fridge-cold butter.View image in fullscreenThe Shaston Arms’ red mullet with squid and black rice: ‘Does Gen Z really love anything about the 20th-century pub experience?’And all this cost £144 – of which, laughably, £16 was added on for service – that I could have better spent on several visits to Wagamama. The reason the Devonshire is so celebrated for doing an apparently “easy” thing is because the dance between spit-and-sawdust and “We’re actually recreatingthe Sportsman at Seasalter” is a precarious one that requires a thousand tricky pirouettes, as well as plenty of well-trained staff and a dining room away from the actual pub rabble. It takes a lot of effort and expense to look that thrown together.

His fellow chefSanjeev Kapoordescribes it as “one of the bestselling dishes in restaurants” there, but here in the UK, though it’s no doubt widely enjoyed, it seems to fly somewhat under the radar on menus, where even the chicken original plays second fiddle to our beloved chicken tikka masala.If you haven’t yet fallen for the crowdpleasing charms of fresh cheese in a mild tomato sauce, consider this a strong suggestion to give it a whirl.Paneer makhni(makhni being the Hindi word for butter, hence alsodal makhni), tastes incredibly fancy, but it’s relatively simple and quick to make. Just add bread and a vegetable side to turn it into a full feast.The paneerView image in fullscreenNisha Katona marinates her paneer first. Inset photographs by Felicity Cloake.For me, this unsalted, cottage-style cheese occupies much the same culinary niche as pressed tofu, being a texturally satisfying source of protein with a blandly creamy flavour that flatters, rather than competes with whatever sauce or seasoning it’s paired with. You can make your own at home with milk and lemon juice (Maunika Gowardhan has a good guide), but it’s also usually available to buy at south Asian specialists and in larger supermarkets.Mowgli’sNisha Katona’s recipe is the only one I try that marinates the cheese before use. Her tandoori masala (spice blend) gives it an appetising red colour, but the firm commercial paneer I’m working with is too dense to absorb much in the way of flavour, so perhaps Katona’s approach would work better with a crumblier, homemade version.Two recipes pre-cook the cheese before adding it to the gravy.Meera Sodhacoats it in garlic, ginger, chilli powder, lemon juice, salt, turmeric and yoghurt, in much the same way as one might if making this with chicken, then bakes it for 25 minutes, while chef and restaurateur Kaushy Patel inher book Prashad, deep-fries the cheese before use.Singh and Kapoor both add the cheese at the end of the cooking, which is the approach I’ve also adopted, not because it’s less work (though, of course, it has that incidental benefit), but because it maintains the contrast between the squidgy, blank canvas of the cheese and the richness of the sauce. (That said, if you’re cooking for those, particularly meat-eaters, who might struggle with the idea of a protein without much by way of flavour, I’d recommend Sodha’s approach, which gives the cubes a crunchy coating of baked-on spice.)The sauceView image in fullscreenVivek Singh adds the cheese right at the end of the cooking.Katona, Patel and Singh (who credits the recipe inhis book Curryto the contract banquet cooks from Orissa who cooked at his sister’s wedding) all start their sauces with onion as well as ginger and garlic, while Sodha sticks to ginger and garlic, and Kapoor to garlic alone. The dairy in paneer makhni gives it a sweetness that I’ve chosen to emphasise with well-softened onion (Patel goes as far as to caramelise it) and root ginger. For much the same reason, the heat in mine comes from red chilli powder instead of Patel’s fresher, more herbaceous fresh green peppers.None of the recipes I try contains a long list of spices; turmeric, chilli, cardamom (Singh uses black and green) and garam masala are all common, with Katona, Singh and Patel adding extra cumin. Patel and Katona also pop in coriander, while Kapoor includes mace and Singh a bay leaf. The zestiness of green cardamom is a good pairing with the richness of dairy, while the sweet spices in garam masala make sense with the flavour profile of the dish as a whole.Dried fenugreek leaves, ormethi, which are often stirred in later, also feel like a must; though I can’t quite describe their bitter, slightly woody, oddly fruity flavour, I clearly remember it being the thing that made the difference when I was exploringchicken tikka masalaover a decade ago, and it’s come up trumps again here. (NB: this has reminded me of the fascinating fact that fenugreek seeds are usedto flavourartificial maple syrup substitutes.)View image in fullscreenMeera Sodha’s butter paneer is ‘extremely hands-off and also ridiculously delicious’.Tomato-wise, a smooth, velvety sauce feels the most luxuriant. If you’re using chopped tomatoes, be they fresh or tinned, you might wish to deploy a hand blender to help with this, as Katona does, or push them through a sieve, as Kapoor does with his fresh ones, but finely chopped tomatoes or even passata will save you that job.Unless you live somewhere with great, full-flavoured fresh tomatoes, I wouldn’t recommend using them here, though, because substandard fruit will give your sauce a thin, almost salsa-like tanginess. Indeed, I also like to add a spoonful of tomato puree, a tip picked up from Katona to supercharge the depth of flavour. This may mean you don’t want to add any sweetness, but, if you do, you’ll be in good company; Sodha and Kapoor suggest honey, and Singh and Katona sugar.The dairyOr, at least, the richness: while almost every recipe I try adds butter (the clue’s in the name), the version in Katona’s bookMeat-Free Mowglialso includes Greek yoghurt. Kapoor uses double cream, Singh single cream, milk powder and boiled cashew paste, which also puts in an appearance inChetna Makan’s recipe, whileZainab Shah advisesstirring in cashew butter in the New York Times). Sodha, meanwhile, leaves out butter entirely in favour of double cream.View image in fullscreenSanjeev Kapoor’s butter paneer uses a ‘jaw-dropping’ four tablespoons  of butter per person.I see her logic: chucking in butter in the quantity that Kapoor recommends in How to Cook Indian – a jaw-dropping four tablespoons per person – makes for a sickly result. (Even I, a person who loves the stuff so much I made anentire radio programmeabout it, find that a little excessive). Double cream gives some of the same mouthfeel, but with just over half the fat. There’s no satisfactory substitute for the flavour of butter, however, so I’ve suggested including a couple of judicious spoonfuls as well.I’ve left Singh and Makan’s pleasingly sweet cashews out of my recipe for simplicity’s sake, but their popularity with my testers does make the case that this admittedly unlikely candidate for veganisation might not be as difficult as it sounds. Substitute firm tofu for the paneer, boiled cashew paste loosened with water for the cream andplant-based butteror your favourite oil for that lingering fullness of flavour. If you try it out, do let me know how you get on.Any other businessView image in fullscreenKaushy Patel deep-fries the paneer before adding it to the pot.Though perhaps not canonical, we’re all big fans of the pops of sweetness provided by Katona’s addition of peas, but you may instead prefer to finish the dish with a sprinkle of chopped coriander, as Singh and Shah recommend. I also must commendSodha’s recipefrom her book Dinner to you simply because it’s made entirely in one baking dish, rather than on the hob, and is consequently extremely hands-off and also ridiculously delicious. If you want to make an easy recipe even easier, this is the one for you.Note: you could make this to the point when you blitz the sauce up to a day or so in advance, and reheat gently. I like this with flatbreads – naan or roti for preference – and saag or akhachumber salad.Perfect butter paneerPrep10 minCook30 minServes41 tbsp neutral oil, or ghee1 onion, peeled and finely chopped4 cardamom pods, lightly crushedSalt4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tbsp grated root ginger1-2 tsp mild chilli powder1 tsp garam masala1 tbsp tomato puree700g tomato passata, or finely chopped tinned tomatoes125ml double cream25g butter2 tsp fenugreek leaves(methi)1 tsp sugar, or honey (optional)500g paneer, cut into bite-size chunks100g frozen peas(optional; no need to defrost)Lemon juice, to finishPut the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, then add the onion, cardamom pods and a pinch of salt, and fry, stirring regularly, until the onion is very soft and beginning to turn golden brown.View image in fullscreenStir in the garlic and ginger, then fry for another couple of minutes, until the garlic begins to smell cooked.

Now is the time to try them with sweet potatoes, in a strawberry mousse, or even with soupTim DowlingSun 23 Nov 2025 07.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 07.32 ESTShareThe connection between marsh mallow the herbaceous perennial, also known asalthaea officinalis, and marshmallow the puffy cylindrical sweet, is historic. In the 19th century, the sap of the plant was still a key ingredient of its confectionary namesake, along with sugar and egg whites. But that connection has long been severed: the modern industrial marshmallow is derived from a mixture of sugar, water and gelatine. Its main ingredient is air.But there’s a lot you can do with the humble marshmallow – here are 17 examples.By all accounts, a homemade marshmallow is infinitely preferable to the store-bought version, although it’s also a necessary compromise – you can’t hope to replicate the exact texture of the machine-made product.Most recipes call for egg whites and gelatine, althoughFelicity Cloake’s perfect marshmallowsdispense with the egg. Fancy variations on this basic theme includeTamal Ray’s lime marshmallowsandJamie Oliver ’s chocolate ale marshmallows.Helen Goh’s redcurrant and marshmallow wreathsare a festive combination of homemade marshmallow, lime biscuits, redcurrant jelly and desiccated coconut.View image in fullscreenSweet potato casserole with mini marshmallows.Photograph: StephanieFrey/Getty ImagesFor the most part, marshmallow recipes – ie where marshmallow is an ingredient, rather than the desired result – call for the shop-bought kind. You could probably substitute your own homemade efforts, but that would be missing the point twice over. You don’t necessarily want your delicate, fussed-over creations to become mere ingredients, and anyway, there is something about a cheap industrial marshmallow – a certain quality, or lack thereof – that’s important here.Mary Berry’s toffee marshmallow squaresare a slightly elevated take on the classic Rice Krispies recipe, which was always on the side of the cereal box, and probably counts as the first thing I ever learned to cook.Tom Kerridge’s popcorn barsprovide a similar mix of sticky and crunchy. Thesechocolate marshmallow wheels, which sandwich layers of commercial marshmallow “fluff” (spread) and jam between two chocolate covered biscuits (akin to the classic Wagon Wheel biscuit), have a particularly decadent appeal.View image in fullscreenPerfect for s’mores … melting marshmallows over a campfire to place between two biscuits.Photograph: Addictive Stock Creatives/AlamyThe similar American s’more is a standard summer barbecue assembly of toasted marshmallow, chocolate and Graham biscuit (a plain digestive is a good substitute), squashed together on site. But even if your barbecue has been stowed for the winter, you can still makeBenjamin Ebuehi’s ginger biscuit s’moreswith a blow torch or under the grill.Liam Charles’s recipe for mini-s’more sconesis another take on the classic.Thanksgiving is upon us, and ambrosia salad offers up a sort of dividing line in American holiday dining. It’s either an annual fixture on your Thanksgiving table, or something you have never seen or tasted, though you are probably aware that some people – many people, in fact – routinely serve a salad with marshmallows in it not as a pudding, but as part of the main meal. I was raised in the latter camp, and I am as perplexed by the recipe as anyone in the UK.Steel yourself: alongside the marshmallows, ambrosia salad normally contains tinned mandarin oranges, maraschino cherries, diced tinned pineapple, grapes, shredded coconut and possibly some nuts. The white gloop that holds it together is most often sweetened whipped cream or a proprietary non-dairy whipped topping (Cool Whip, if you’ve never had the pleasure), but other recipes use sour cream, mayonnaise, evaporated milk or some unholy combination of the above.View image in fullscreenCreamy ambrosia salad with marshmallows, pineapple and mandarin orange.Photograph: EzumeImages/Getty Images/iStockphotoThis one, as an example, uses a mixture of whipped and sour cream, which sounds oddly palatable.This one, from the Food Wine Sunshine blog, uses cottage cheese and orange jelly, which sounds less like something to be thankful for. And, yes, you are meant to put this on your plate next to the turkey and gravy.The other divisive Thanksgiving dish is mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallow topping. Here’sa recipe from Nigella Lawsonthat’s grimly authentic but still somehow enticing.View image in fullscreenA toasted marshmallow martini.Photograph: sveta_zarzamora/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe list of savoury dishes with marshmallow in them is mercifully brief, but here’s one more:courgette soup with parmesan and burnt chilli marshmallow. We’re back to homemade marshmallows, although these are spiked with chilli flakes and scorched to blackness before they become soup topping.Sometimes the consistency of a melted and then cooled marshmallow makes it a key textural element in, say,a version of strawberry mousse, or inRichard Bainbridge’s marshmallow cheesecake. Thiscoffee ice-cream fudge cakerequires both marshmallows and marshmallow fluff, along with corn syrup, sugar and ice-cream. My teeth ache just reading the recipe, but in a good way.Finally, a marshmallow cocktail, and not one that just uses a few mini-marshmallows on a skewer as a garnish. Thetoasted marshmallow espresso martinicalls for a burnt marshmallow syrup and, if you can find it, a marshmallow-flavoured vodka. If you can’t find it, you are frankly probably better off.Explore more on these topicsFoodBiscuitsDessertVegetablesCheeseFruitCocktailsfeaturesShareReuse this content"
