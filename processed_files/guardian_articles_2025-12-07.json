Yet it was testament to the resolution he has shown all season that while down he was far from out, as he proved in going on to claim the title that he felt had slipped away.When Norris took the world championship with histhird‑place finish in Abu Dhabion Sunday he became the first British champion since Lewis Hamilton took his last title in 2020 and, similar to Hamilton for his first win in 2008, he had to show his absolute determination to close it out after a rollercoaster ride for the 26-year-old.Lando Norris wins F1 world title in Abu Dhabi despite Verstappen’s GP winRead moreQuite apart from what has been a gruelling test of his driving ability across a season marked by intense competition, the level of emotional and psychological control that Norris has had to demonstrate must not be underestimated.He had gone in as favourite back in Melbourne for the opening race but for great swathes of this season he has been under the cosh. He was on the back foot first to his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri, who had for so long been leading with a calm consistency that gave him the air of a world champion in waiting, and then in the late stages toan intimidating chargefrom that most threatening of beasts, Max Verstappen, with the bit between his teeth and nothing to lose.A season of twists and turns had opened well for Norris, as with great verve he weathered a storm towin the Australian Grand Prixin treacherous conditions. He held his nerve like a champion and the McLaren was so quick that this writer considered their biggest headache might be how they managed their two charges. This would, in turn, come to dominate the discourse.View image in fullscreenLando Norris of McLaren after securing third place at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi – and the world title.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty ImagesWhat followed, however, was not the narrative Norris would have liked. He was, it became clear, not as at ease with the performance characteristics of theMcLarenas Piastri. Notably there was his feel for the front grip, a key part of his driving style, and it was proving particularly costly in qualifying as he attempted to adapt.Piastri won from polein China, Verstappen then in Japan and, in Bahrain, Norris was found wanting in what was to be a real indicator of how hard he was trying to push his car and the knife-edge it represented. He qualified poorly in a race Piastri went on to win and at the next round in Saudi Arabia worse followed: Norris crashed out in qualifying, and Piastri won again to take the championship lead for the first time.As Norris battled, the young Australian was demonstrating all the hallmarks of a prospective champion. There was something of Alain Prost about the smooth ease and precision of his performance. He followed it with no little battling spirit to take victory from fourth onthe grid in Miami.It was not until Monaco, round eight, that Norristook his second victory, a win he enjoyed like no other. Yet what was most notable was that the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, was spot-on in describing it as cold‑blooded in how clinically he delivered under pressure and an indication that he had lost none of his resolve to stay in the fight as he closed to within three points of Piastri.View image in fullscreenLando Norris (right) began the season with victory at the Australian Grand Prix.Photograph: James Ross/EPAThey were in touching distance. The McLaren chief executive, Zak Brown, had conceded early in the season that with two evenly matched drivers in a championship-winning car, on-track contact between them was more a question of when than if – and at the next round, in Canada, clash they did and Norris was at fault. Three laps from the end as they battled over fourth place, Norris hit the back of Piastri’s car attempting to pass the Australian. Norris held his hands up. “All my bad, all my fault, stupid from me,” he said.However, what stood out at this point in conversation with Norris was how impressively he was handling the highs and lows of such a challenging season. Assessing these blows and the storm around him, he maintained a rock-like equilibrium with striking good humour. He would reiterate confidence in his own ability, a determination to eliminate errors, a belief that he could and he would. Observing at the time, it might have been possible to surmise that this was the wishful thinking so beloved of sport psychologists – but for the fact he did indeed deliver on it all.At thenext round in Austriathere was a turning point. McLaren brought a major upgrade, a front‑suspension development they were hoping would give Norris the feel he required. It worked, as with a nerveless run he closed out a tightly fought battle against his teammate with superb control. Stella had praised Norris’s resilience as “typical of a champion” and he demonstrated it at the Red Bull Ring.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri and Lando Norris crash out during the sprint race at the United States Grand Prix.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/ReutersHe and Piastri then exchanged blows, Norris taking the home victory at Silverstone he craved so much, Piastri being on top at Spa, and then Norris pulling off something of a coup with a one-stop strategy to claim victory in Hungary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By its close, after his car gave out with seven laps to go, he was left, head bowed, alone in the dunes beside the North Sea. With Piastri winning, he was 34 points back with only nine races to go. It appeared a mountain to climb with so little between them in their cars.Yet the next round at Monza was another gamechanger. Verstappen, who had long since declared he had abandoned any title ambitions and who was 104 points back from Piastri after the race in the Netherlands, launched his own fightback, as Red Bull finally found the balance for their car that had eluded them all season. He duly won in a race that would come to loom over Norris and McLaren.The team’s laudable efforts to be scrupulously fair to both drivers, allowing them to race freely and according to the team’s agreed arrangements, reached a somewhat tortuous conclusion as Piastri was told to cede back to Norris the second place he had gained because of a slow pit stop for the British driver. The team had made arrangements for this scenario. Norris had nothing to do with it, but the optics were terrible and he was booed repeatedly in races that followed because of a perceived bias in his favour.Far more significant was the next round in Azerbaijan where Piastri, still aggrieved at the Monza orders, endured his first major wobble. Dropping to last from a botched start, he went into a corner too hot in an effort to make up places, locked up and put his McLaren in the wall. The touch that was so assured for so long had deserted him just as Norris found a purple patch of form.View image in fullscreenLando Norris showed confidence in his own ability and a determination to eliminate errors on his way to world title glory.Photograph: DPPI/ShutterstockNorris was blunt in barging past him at the start in Singapore and, while Verstappen won again in Texas, it was Norris who claimed second before taking dominant, assured victories in Mexico, where he retook the title lead, and Brazil. In this series of four races, Piastri could manage no better than fourth.It had been no little turnaround, unexpected perhaps by everyone except Norris himself, whose belief had not wavered. Heading into the Las Vegas GP with a 24‑point lead on Piastri and 49 on Verstappen, there was more to come. Both McLarens were disqualified in Nevada for excessive wear to the skid block and Verstappen’s win brought him to within 24 points of the lead, looming larger than ever.With the nerves jangling and only two races remaining after their miscalculations in Vegas, closing it out was an impossibly tense affair, exacerbated as the team dropped the ball again at the penultimate round in Qatar. There McLaren were found wanting with a decision not to pit their drivers under an early safety car while the rest of the field did so, costing them the lead and then ceding the win to Verstappen. Piastri took second but Norris was only fourth and Verstappen was within 12 points, a lurking threat for an all‑or‑nothing finale.Yet Norris was as unperturbed in the decider at Abu Dhabi as he had been in the throes of the early season travails. Confident in the abilities that had brought him so far, he was solid and nerveless, clinching it with the necessary third place to ensure he controlled his own destiny – as he had all season. He beat Verstappen to the title by just two points, but that is all that matters. He weathered the eye of the storm with a burger of solace and emerged a deserved champion.Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisMcLarenFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wes Streeting should not be on itJohn HarrisThankfully, we now know more about conditions such as autism and ADHD. The health secretary must not be part of this attempt to turn back the clockSun 7 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 15.12 ESTShareWes Streeting is a politician whose keen interest in the zeitgeist is only matched by his seeming drive to be as close to the heart of it as possible. It is, therefore, not much of a surprise that the secretary of state for health and social care should end the year by announcing whatthe official blurbcalls an “independent review into mental health conditions, ADHD and autism”. Many of the resulting headlines put it more pithily: in keeping with an increasingly deafening media din, this will seemingly be an investigation into “overdiagnosis”.Candidates for 2025’s word of the year have so far included “rage bait” and “parasocial”, but overdiagnosis is surely the term that perfectly captures the intellectual and political fashions of the past 12 months. The mess of ideas it crystallises now has a set text,published back in March: The Age Of Diagnosis by the neurologist and epilepsy expertDr Suzanne O’Sullivan. Having been pronounced on, with his usual belligerent ignorance,by Nigel Farage, overdiagnosis hasbecome an obsessionof the Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice, who now holds forth about why some children with special educational needs shouldn’t be entitled to dedicated school transport, and claims that the sight of kids with sensory issues wearing ear defenders at school is “insane”.News of an official reviewfirst broke in October, and its terms of reference seem comparatively reasonable. In the Guardian, Streeting wrote last week about a focus on “support for mental health conditions, autism and ADHD”, and “how the NHS can meet the needs of all”. The review’s launch document makes mention of “prevalence, drivers, early intervention and treatment”.But clearly, its work has been commissioned partly for political reasons. There is a queasy whiff about its basic remit that – with strong echoes of what we hear from “overdiagnosis” merchants – clumsily mixes questions about mental illness (anxiety, depression) with autism and ADHD, which are neurodevelopmental. As mentions of “economic inactivity” prove, there is a clear sense of pitch-rolling for the return of so-calledwelfare reform. There are also telling uses of the word “medicalisation”, a term usually favoured by people who think that many conditions do not need any diagnosis at all.And as is becoming its habit, the government has decided to speak to different audiences in contrasting tones of voice. In the front-page splash that first announced the review,the Times saidthe health secretary was “concerned” about rising rates of diagnosis of both mental illness and what we now understand as neurodivergence, and there was also mention of ordinary feelings and stresses being “overpathologised”. All this sounds worryingly like a polite manifestation of a very familiar kind of thinking, reflective of a country in which questioning other people’s needs is almost becoming a national sport.View image in fullscreenWes Streeting in London, 12 November 2025.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersAnswers to questions the new inquiry asks might be less complicated than they seem. There are more peoplebeing diagnosedwith anxiety and depression because of an education system and model of work that are so harshly competitive and inherently precarious, and the still-overlooked effects of the pandemic. ADHD – which, just to reiterate a very important point, isnot a mental illness, but a matter of neural wiring – is something we are only just starting to understand, but it is worth recalling official reports thatput the number of children and adultsin England who are affected at 2.5 million, though only 800,000 currently havea formal diagnosis. Those numbers, moreover, are evidence of something that is not going to go away: our ever-growing understanding of the sheer complexity of our minds and brains, and how much our institutions still lag behind.That is also true ofrising autism diagnoses. We live in the long aftermath of diagnostic changes that happened in the 1980s and 1990s, when the definition of autism was widened to include people without an intellectual or learning disability, reflecting the basic – and incontestably correct – idea of a spectrum. The next stage of those shifts arrived only a relatively short time ago, when the different and often complex ways autism presents among women and girls finally began to be discussed. A new level of autism awareness fostered by the internet, meanwhile, had alerted people to the fact that they need not put up with constant misunderstanding and bullying; these days, they can find out who they – or their children –really are, what help they may need, and how to thereby live a life that is more settled and fulfilling,That prospect ought to be exciting and liberating. Unfortunately, oureconomy is flatlining, and public spending is constantly squeezed. So, amid lengthening waiting lists, how do we deal with all that increased need? Overdiagnosis offers a simple answer: you tell people – not least those who can be classified as “mild” or “moderate” cases – to be more resilient, and wave them away.There is one very convenient article of faith that seems to be increasingly fashionable in Westminster: the idea that diagnoses can do more harm than good, which is the key contentionthat definesO’Sullivan’s book. “The stigma of autism has been associated with low self-esteem among children,” she writes, while blithely feeding those same negative perceptions byreferring to autismas a “brain disorder” and an “illness”. An autism diagnosis, she claims, runs the risk of being “a self-fulfilling prophecy, as some will take the diagnosis to mean they can’t do certain things, so won’t even try”. But unless we can specify who people are and what broad psychological category they fit into, how do we know how to help them: what educational methodologies to use, how to adjust their learning environment and what aptitudes and talents can be developed?Over the past eight months, I have had hundreds of conversations about all this, at events put on to promote Maybe I’m Amazed,the memoir I’ve writtenabout my autistic son James, and how, ever since he was a toddler, music has been a massive part of how we connect. From Jersey to the Yorkshire Dales, one insight has come up countless times: the fact that the autistic spectrum is not nearly as linear as some people think, and that the relevant traits occur with such wildly different intensities that crudely labelling people as “mild”, “moderate” and “severe” is sometimes all but impossible. That blurs into another regularly voiced point: how the plain fact that human beings’ brains work in completely varied ways rather makes a mockery of a basic method of education – standing in front of 30 kids and shouting at them for an hour – that is now decades out of date.There is another thing that people always talk about. Autism often reflects traits that run through people’s family trees – something they tend to become aware of in retrospect. Past flickers and flashes of eccentricity, obsessiveness or social awkwardness will suddenly take on new meanings. More painfully, people suddenly become aware of relativeswho had frustrating andbroken lives, because so little was known about things that many of us now take as a given – not least the fact that autistic minds are as complex and sophisticated as any other kind, and in most cases, they need careful support and nurturing. And in that context, theories and pronouncements about overdiagnosis sound to many people like a nightmarish turning-back of the clock.They are not wrong. Human psychology is complicated. Politics and power, by contrast, tend to be crass, cruel and prone to coming up with completely the wrong questions. Which brings me to one question I’d like to ask the health secretary: however much he prettifies it, why is he picking over the number of diagnoses, when he could be focusing on why our systems of work, education and care are still so closed off to the people who get them?John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

With Christmas deliveries arriving thick and fast, here are practical steps to takeLucy KnightSun 7 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTShareAcouple of years ago, 31-year-old charity worker Nicki Wedgwood had ordered Christmas presents online for friends and family. When the packages were delivered to her in Hackney, east London, the driver left them in the lobby of her building rather than taking them directly to her flat. She spotted them as she popped out to a nearby shop and decided to pick them up when she came back. When she returned 10 minutes later, the boxes had been ripped open and their contents were gone.Wedgwood thinks she passed the thief in the hallway as she was leaving for the shop. “There was some random dude just inside the doorway, who had a Boris bike with him,” she says. She had assumed he was a guest of one of her neighbours. “I said hello to him … I think he even said Merry Christmas.”Wedgwood and her flatmates have had “so much stuff stolen over the years”, she says. The external door to their block of flats is glass, so thieves can peer in and see packages that have been dropped off in the lobby. She believes there are thieves in her local area who follow delivery drivers on bikes “and immediately push on the door after the driver has driven off. If that’s been left open, they can just get the parcel – and a lot quicker than the person it’s for, who is maybe 15 floors up.”Parcel theft has become a growing issue, with parcels worth a record-breaking£666.5m reported as stolenacross the UK in the last year, according to data obtained by the technology company Quadient, nearly £290m more than in 2024. And those figures are just reported thefts, while many more go unreported. Wedgwood was able to get a refund from the retailer, and says she didn’t see any point in telling the police about the incident, given that when she has reported other crimes to them: “They just take a picture and you never hear anything again.” (A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police advises victims to “always report thefts to the police”, and said it is “carrying out intelligence-led operations to catch the criminal gangs who prey on delivery vans, which has already resulted in a number of arrests”.)Why has this crime become so common? We know that people are buying more online than ever before but, according to Gary Winter, the vice-president of global strategic initiatives at Quadient, the increase in parcel thefts isn’t just proportional to the rise of online shopping – it’s bigger than that. Winter doesn’t believe that the rise is because people are getting better at reporting it. “I genuinely think it’s becoming more frequent,” he says. “People see it as a low-level crime opportunity and are taking advantage of it.”View image in fullscreenA rise in parcels that don’t need to be signed for makes deliveries less secure.Photograph: Posed by model; Drazen Zigic/Getty ImagesLeicestershire is the UK’s hotspot for parcel thefts, according to Quadient’s data (which doesn’t include figures from every British police force, as not all of them responded to the company’s freedom of information request), but city and town centres in general are where the greatest risk is. “It’s more likely that you haven’t got a safe place, that you’re living in an apartment or a multi-occupied building,” says Winter. In peak delivery season – unsurprisingly, parcel thefts are highest in December – piles of parcels can build up in lobbies and on doorsteps, and in busy areas where people don’t necessarily know their neighbours, and thieves can help themselves without too much difficulty.Darren Walmsley, the vice chair of the National Courier and Despatch Association, thinks part of the reason parcel thefts are becoming so common is a change in the way deliveries are made. In the past, far more deliveries had to be signed for. With a signed-for delivery, he says: “Generally, you’re physically handing it over to someone, and therefore it’s a secure delivery.” In his personal view, it was when Amazon came on the scene that things started to change. It popularised delivering items without requiring proof of delivery, having worked out that it was more cost-efficient to risk having to refund losses than for drivers to take the extra time to get a signature. Then, during the Covid pandemic, contactless delivery became more common.Independent courier companies that offer a same-day service are “the only guaranteed service there is”, says Walmsley. Multi-job couriers tend to have much less time for each delivery: “They’ll be asked to do 100-plus deliveries a day, whereas a same-day delivery driver might do 10 deliveries a day, so they can afford to take a lot more time. For example, if someone elderly ordered something quite large, the courier would be more able to assist them to get the package inside.”Overstretched delivery drivers leaving parcels outside, or not closing doors properly as they leave a building, “is a large part of the problem”, says Wedgwood, though she admits she wouldn’t want to do their job.The trouble is that retailers and customers tend to look for the cheapest delivery options, which usually means a lower-quality service. Walmsley advocates opting for same-day delivery when you can. “The perception is that same-day is always significantly more expensive than overnight deliveries,” he says. “However, that’s not always strictly true. The bigger an item or the higher its value, and the closer the collection and delivery locations are to each other, the more cost-effective same-day deliveries become.”Though the value of Wedgwood’s parcels came to about £100 in total – they contained trinket gifts and books for her family – the most expensive item was only worth £30. “I definitely don’t feel like you’d get a good price for them [in the secondhand market],” she says. What can be sold on more easily, however, is branded sportswear – and Winter’s research has shown that more of these items go missing, suggesting that thieves target parcels with sports brand packaging. “We know that they end up at places like car boot sales,” he says. “They end up on eBay or Facebook Marketplace or various other platforms to be resold.”View image in fullscreenNot on your doorstep … getting deliveries sent to a locker is a safer option if you are not going to be home.Photograph: arcady_31/Getty ImagesIt is not only organised criminals who are taking advantage of parcels being left outside – opportunistic neighbours are another culprit. Asif, who lives in Derbyshire, had a parcel stolen from behind his bin, where it had been left by the courier, and he suspects his neighbour was responsible. “He denied it,” says the 53-year-old. But “I could tell from his face”.Maddie from Bristol has a little more evidence to suggest that her neighbours were the culprits when her weekly box from the meal kit service Gousto went missing. She went downstairs to her building’s basement flat to ask its student occupiers if they had seen it. “They were in the process of moving out, and the cleaner, who was conducting the end-of-tenancy clean, answered,” she says. The cleaner claimed not to have seen the box, but as Maddie turned to leave, she saw “a pile of black sacks by the door in the alleyway, and poking out of one was the patterned cold box you get as part of a Gousto. We are 99% sure it was our box as no one else in the past has had a Gousto delivery to our building.” Though it was obviously disappointing to miss out on that week’s meals, Maddie was able to get a full refund from Gousto.Pranksters have devised ‘bait packages’ that, if picked up, will set off anything from paint bombs to glitter explosionsEven with police involvement, it can be difficult to catch parcel thieves, although it is sometimes possible with the help of video doorbell footage – as in the case ofPeter Storer, who was caught on camera stealing from a woman’s doorstep in Leicester. Even if victims don’t have any evidence, Winter says it is important to report it. “You’ve got to report it to the police because you want to be in the statistics. You want to try to make sure that the police are paying attention to this.”Some people, of course, have taken justice into their own hands. It is testament to how widespread the frustration about this issue is that videos of doorstep thieves, or “porch pirates” as they have become known, being tricked have gone viral on social media. Pranksters have left out “bait packages” that, when picked up, will set off everything frompaint bombstoglitter explosions, with front-door cameras ready to capture the thief’s comeuppance. Arizona-based software engineer Alec Armbruster, who has had a number of parcels stolen, says he enjoys watching such videos because laughing at the thieves’ plans backfiring is “the only way I can take back control”.Several years ago, Armbrustermade a prank video of his own, filling a bait package with used cat litter. “I think it took a week and a half for the box to get picked up,” he says. “I came home one day and it was gone and I was like, ‘Yes!’ I ran inside to watch the footage. It was very exciting.” He had become used to having his parcels stolen, and says he would report every one. “Typically, they would send out an officer and I would never hear about it again.” So he decided to take matters into his own hands via the prank, “which helped because it turned from something extremely frustrating to something exciting and entertaining”.View image in fullscreenIt’s a steal … a man takes parcels from outside a house in Moreno Valley, California.Photograph: Posed by model; AvailableLight/Getty ImagesHe thinks the video was popular on social media because “it’s just extremely satisfying. We’ve all had things stolen from us and it’s very invading. And we all want to see justice for things like this. If someone thinks they are stealing something expensive, like an iPhone, but what they actually get is just dust, it’s quite funny.” That said, Armbruster admits that his prank “didn’t really bring justice”, in terms of stopping parcels getting stolen. “I thought or hoped it would, which sucks.”There are more effective steps that can be taken to prevent parcel thefts. “The brands could do more to anonymise parcels or make it less attractive or less obvious to thieves that there might be something interesting inside,” Winter says. “Carriers can re-emphasise to their delivery agents: ‘Do not put things in a stupid place, if it’s visible from the road or visible to everybody.’” Instead, they should tell them to try “knocking the door a bit harder and waiting a few seconds”, though he says he is loth to criticise the carriers because, “they’re under massive pressure to deliver such high volumes, particularly at this time of year”.Consumers need to play their part in preventing these thefts, too, by making sure they are ordering a delivery for a day they will be in, and providing the correct address. “It’s amazing how many times we see addresses given incorrectly,” Walmsley says. He also recommends buyers consider the different delivery methods on offer. “See if they’ve got signed-for options or carriers that you’ve used before, who you know you’ve received good delivery service from.” It could also be worth getting packages delivered to your work address, he says. “Business deliveries are a lot more successful.”Winter agrees. “If you live in an apartment with no front garden or you’re on a street with a lot of visibility then, when you order, don’t have it delivered to home, select an out-of-home option.” He recommends corner shop and locker deliveries. He admits he has a vested interest in lockers because Quadient provides smart parcel locker solutions, but says he genuinely believes that “it’s a very convenient way to reduce that risk”.Since Wedgwood’s parcels were stolen, she has become “quite paranoid” when she makes online orders. If she is out and receives a message to say something has been delivered, she texts her housemates to ask them to fetch it straight away. “When the buzzer goes now, we try to ask: ‘What’s the name on the parcel?’” before letting the courier in, to weed out impostors. She is not taking any chances, especially since she believes her parcel thief came back last year. “My flatmate said: ‘So weird, I’ve just come in and downstairs there was a random Boris bike left in the hallway.’ Alarm bells immediately went off,” she says.Since Wedgwood has not had any luck asking her landlord to make her building more secure, she doesn’t expect the thieves to back down anytime soon. Unlike Armbruster, who managed to stop his parcels being stolen by moving to a more rural area, Wedgwood is not willing to find a new home because of this. “The rent is really low. I love the area. Also, I just don’t want to let the thieves win,” she says. “Why should I let them?”Explore more on these topicsOnline shoppingCrimeConsumer affairsCouriers/delivery industryShoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sarah Gibbons had just received a shipment of baubles at her Glasgow homeware shop, Modern Love Store, and some crucial ornaments were missing. She hopped on a long-distance phone call to her suppliers in the US – she needed to sort this out. After all, her customers were clamouring for them. “People aren’t just buying one,” the 39-year-old shopkeeper told me after discovering the missing decorations, “they’re buying three or four at a time.” Three what? Turtle doves? Nutcrackers? Or perhaps some classic candy canes? Of course not. This year’s must-have bauble is in the shape of alightly glittered syringe of Ozempic.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Growing up, my favourite Christmas ornament was a little pink plastic baby Jesus resting in a manger. He was bought by my great-aunt in Oberammergau, Germany, in 1990 – and although his battery hasn’t been changed since, you can still press his belly to hear Silent Night play. Today, decorations are a little different. Ozempic isn’t the only needle hanging from our needles: Britons can also purchase Christmas tree ornaments shaped like syringes ofBotoxandfiller. Meanwhile, Selfridges is selling adirty martini bauble, M&S is peddling a hangingprawn cocktailand Aldi is offering an ornament shaped like anair fryer. Move over, baby Jesus; glass has now been blown into the likeness ofHarry Styles,Taylor SwiftandThe Bear’s Jeremy Allen White.Goodbye, angels, shepherds and stars. When it comes to decorations, we’re really branching out. Should you want to – and people do – you can buy baubles shaped likecoffee machines,puffer jackets,hair dryers,credit cards,oat milk,orange wine,“happy pills”,wrinkle cream,pasta,matcha,Doritos,sriracha,Perelló olivesand a bottleof Heinz tomato ketchup.O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, how lovely are your brand deals.Why do people want to bedeck their trees with crisps, pints and lattes?What’s going on? Is this a straightforward story of sacrilege, or is something else at play? It’s hard to deny tastes have shifted dramatically. A1990 photographof an in-store John Lewis Christmas tree features beads, bells, bows and carousels – the most unusual ornament is a masquerade mask. Today, the department store sells baubles shaped likesardines,snooker balls,espresso martinis,kitchen scales,hot dogs,caviar, and miniatureQuality Streettins. “Boxed baubles have been in decline,” says Lisa Cherry, the enviably titled head of Christmas at John Lewis. “Over the last 10 years, our box bauble sales have declined by about 60%.” It seems that customers no longer want a generic set of matching balls, but, Cherry adds, sales have been made up in the rise of loose baubles. “People are just changing what they’re looking for on the tree.”When Cherry and her team start to consider a new Christmas decoration collection, they don’t think about the festive season at all. Instead, they use sales data from across the department store – and its stablemate Waitrose – to track purchasing trends. They then try to reflect them in their ornaments, which is how you end up with a blueberry matcha bauble, as well as apint of stout. “When you were young, who put chillies on their tree?” Cherry laughs. “But for the last few years, that has been one of our most popular food baubles.”After chewing over the trends, the John Lewis team come up with a macro theme for their decorations – this year’s was “wisdom”, to reflect the fact that customers seem to be appreciating craftsmanship and nostalgia. This is why the department store is selling retro baking equipment baubles, as well as a miniature of therecord playerseen in itslatest Christmas ad. Plus, for £8 you can also get a bauble shaped like astack of books, with the titles on the spines reading “Happiness”, “Healthy Food,” “Mindfulness” and “Let’s Go to the Gym”.View image in fullscreenFrom left:happy pills, £18, rockettstgeorge.co.uk;truffle mayo,£14, vondels.com;Meet Me In My Roomkey, £13.20, vondels.com;water bottle, £18, rockettstgeorge.co.uk;Sabrina Carpenter,£25, rockettstgeorge.co.uk.At a time wheneight in 10 Britonsthink Christmas is more secular than religious, perhaps this all makes sense – but, then again, why not stick to the cute little woodland animals that John Lewis also sells? Why do people want to bedeck their trees with crisps, pints and lattes? Is this a case of a selfish generation, obsessed with identity, forcefully trying to put the “I” in “tree”?As always, it’s a little more complicated than that. Cherry says that quirky, themed ornaments reflect a huge rise in people gifting baubles. More and more, people are turning up at dinner parties with a thoughtful little trinket that says they know their host. This means that unusual ornaments sell best at the start of the season, and “as you get nearer toChristmas, you’re selling more traditional”. It also explains why Gibbons can sell four Ozempic ornaments at a time.Another trend driving the bauble bonanza is the rise in two-tree households. In 2023, John Lewis’s festive traditions tracker report found that27% of Britons had two Christmas trees. “It could be easily up to half of customers now,” Cherry says. She has also noticed a rise in people using ornaments elsewhere around the house – on wreaths, in garlands, up banisters and on walls.And we simply love to spend. This year, sales in Selfridges’ Christmas Shop have risen 47%, with ornaments alone up 15%. The four most popular baubles the brand offers are ones emblazoned with its logo, but a Taylor Swift-inspired ornament comes in fifth place. In total, Selfridges is selling more than 1,200 different baubles this year – the Ozempic one was so popular it has already sold out.Just how far have we strayed from tradition? The Illustrated London News printed a picture ofQueen Victoria’s tree in 1848. Accompanying it was a description of its ornamentation: wax tapers and ribbons were overshadowed by real “fancy cakes”, gilt gingerbread, and little baskets and miniature boxes carrying sweetmeats. Foodie trees, then, are nothing new, even if things used to be a lot more edible. And if we look at Charles Dickens’s description of a Christmas tree from 1850, we find that our taste for novelty isn’t that new, either. “There were rosy-cheeked dolls, hiding behind the green leaves; and there were real watches … dangling from innumerable twigs,” Dickens wrote. Then there were the miniature items of furniture “perched among the boughs, as if in preparation for some fairy housekeeping” – plus guns, swords, drums, and even witches. “In short, as a pretty child before me delightedly whispered to another pretty child,” Dickens wrote. “There was everything, and more.”Still, there’s no denying we often used to bake and make our own decorations, and by 1990, a writer in the BBC magazine the Listener was bemoaning that, “The postwar mentality of never throwing anything away has succumbed to the modern consumer’s need to be seen to be in tune with the style of the times.” Dickens might have appreciated a miniature fortune-telling witch, but it’s easy to imagine him balking at a weight-loss injecti-bauble.Gibbons, though, is happy to sell the bejewelled jab. “They’re very zeitgeisty,” she says. “Some people will think they’re the tackiest, most disgusting things ever … but it’s just a bit of a joke.” She also sells ornaments shaped likecigarettes,iced coffee,spaghettiandmayo– not to mention aweed-smoking Jesus(“If my granny was still alive, she would be absolutely furious”).How does Gibbons explain this niche level of decoration? “People want to collect ornaments that mean something to them. A plain red-and-white striped bauble might have no meaning to you.” She says, too, that customers “want to buy new stuff every year” and switch their trees up annually. It’s now a tradition in her own home that she, her husband and her children each buy a new bauble every Christmas – “and then I cheat and buy one on behalf of the cat”.View image in fullscreenFrom left:Heinz ketchup, £16, studiothie.com;black egg barbecue, £15.80, vondels.com;Botox syringe, £18, rockettstgeorge.co.uk;blueberry matcha, £8, johnlewis.com;clog, £14, studiothie.com.One of Gibbons’s suppliers is the US wholesaler Cody Foster, which has been creating novelty baubles for more than 25 years. Foster produced the Ozempic bauble, but the Dutch brand Vondels created the filler jab ornaments seen on British shelves. The company’s baubles are stocked in high-end stores such as Fortnum & Mason, Selfridges, Liberty and Harrods and also available in more than 50 countries worldwide.“We constantly are absorbing what is hot and what is not, and what is happening around us,” says Loesje Donner-Raedts, who founded Vondels a decade ago. At the time, she was a buyer in a department store and was tired of the “traditional, predictable and uninspiring” baubles on offer. She wanted to create “ornaments that are connected to you instead of connected to everyone”. She believes that a Christmas tree should be “personal” and “tell a story about you or your friends”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Throughout the year, the team look at concept stores, restaurants, cocktail menus and holiday destinations to figure out what’s trending. Other current Vondels ornaments include wrinkle remover,false lashes,truffle mayonnaiseand a gold glass key emblazoned with the words “Meet me in my room”.“Of course, we don’t want to offend anyone,” says Donner-Raedts. “We want to give this playful nod to modern beauty culture, but we don’t want it to be … how do you say? Like, the bad part of sassy?” As a result, Vondels avoids the overtly sexual and anything that might shock.But there are also other limitations on what can be bauble-ified. Vondels has a collaboration with the Dutch children’s characterMiffyand this year the company wanted an ornament of the rabbit riding a bike. “But for glass-blowing you cannot make it too thin, so actually it looked more like a motorcycle,” Donner-Raedts laughs. “We had to stop the process.”How do licensed ornaments like these actually work behind the scenes? Look closely at some of the branded baubles on offer in various shops and you’ll see they’re not actually branded at all – they’re just cleverly coloured to imitate recognisable products. Celebrity baubles are also often unofficial, and thus tactfully titled – when it comes to Swift, they might be called “Taylor inspired” or “Miss Americana”. But sometimes an imitation bauble can lead to an official collaboration. In 2024, design brand Studio Thie created ornaments that looked like cans of Perelló olives – then founder Simon Thie contacted the brand and orchestrated an official partnership.“You just start picking up on things that everyone has or is using,” Thie says, explaining that the brand capitalised on the “designer larder” trend, by creating a “Real Housewives of Clapton” set featuring clogs, greyhounds and bougie bottles of wine and crisps. At the other end of the spectrum, they’ve also collaborated withHeinz, which means they sell ketchup sachets, cans of beans and even salad cream bottles as ornaments.View image in fullscreenFrom left:pint of stout, £8, johnlewis.com;Heinz Hoops, £14,studiothie.com;boots, £11.95, rockettstgeorge.co.uk;block of butter, £6, johnlewis.com;Yorkshire pudding, £14, studiothie.com.“Some people have ketchup on their Christmas lunch – my brother included,” Thie says. OK, sure, but was it difficult to get Heinz on board? “I think maybe they saw it more as a marketing idea – not that they’re going to sell or make loads of money from some Christmas decorations,” Thie explains. “I guess maybe, for them, it’s keeping that conversation going.”It’s hard to imagine what couldn’t be baubled next – I’ve just Googled the most ridiculous items I can think of but they already existA decade ago, Vondels shook up the bauble industry – but, nowadays, more and more stores are selling unusual novelty ornaments. It’s now a battle to stand out, and while Vondels might avoid sexing things up, other brands are happy to fill that particular hole in the market.“I said we should call them Christmas dick-olations,” says Lucy St George, one of the founders of Rockett St George. The online homeware store sells ornaments shaped likebikinisand antidepressants, but St George is referring to the brand’s pinksex toyornaments – complete with veins. “I thought we might have gone too far,” says co-founder Jane Rockett, but then the dick-olations promptly sold out.Where could all of this possibly end up? (Apart from in a landfill, of course.) It’s hard to imagine whatcouldn’tbe baubled next – I’ve just Googled the most ridiculous items I can think of but they already exist. Waitrose is selling atoilet paperbauble; Cody Foster has atin-foiled baked potatocomplete with chives. Perhaps we will eventually tire of novelty or something will jolt us back towards tradition. Until then, why not hang acheese toastieon your Christmas tree? It will look lovely next to the hot sauce.Explore more on these topicsChristmasInteriorsHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both are highly devout Christians who came to religion in adulthood and have trenchant views on social issues such as abortion and the family.Kruger, an MPwho defectedfrom the Conservatives in September, and Orr, who is a Cambridge academic, also sit onthe advisory boardof a rightwing thinktank called the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship, led by Philippa Stroud, a Conservative peer who is strongly religious.Another member is Paul Marshall, the hedge fund millionaire who owns GB Newsand the rightwing Spectator magazine. Marshall is a devout Christian.Religion, specifically Protestant evangelism, has in recent decades been one of the defining elements of rightwing politics in the US. Its adherents form the bedrock of Donald Trump’s support. Is the UK starting to head down the same path?There are some links. Orr is sufficiently close to JD Vance that he has hosted the US vice-president at his family home. He is also involved in the National Conservatism movement, which has connections to the US religious-populism world.But any closer parallels falter on a simple matter of numbers. Polling shows that close to a quarter of US adults are evangelicals, but the proportion for the UK is about a tenth of that at most.There is another important factor to consider. While US evangelicals lean firmly to the right, with nearly three-quartersapproving ofTrump’s presidency, new polling by the UK’s Evangelical Alliance (EA) suggests that, for all the prominence of people such as Kruger and Marshall, the wider picture here is quite different.A poll of nearly 1,500 evangelicals shared with the Guardian shows Labour in the lead with 26% support. Reform and the Liberal Democrats are level on 20%, with the Conservatives on 18% and the Greens 12%.Other questions demonstrate support among evangelicals for more generous welfare payments, but concerted alarm about plans to legalise assisted dying.Danny Webster, the head of advocacy at the EA, says that the UK’s evangelicals tend to have conservative views on social issues, but they are also realistic about how these are often a minority view.“Sometimes with evangelicals there can be a dissonance between opinions, especially on social issues, and how people vote,” he said. “For example, someone might have a strong opinion on abortion, but they don’t see voting as likely to lead to change. So the opinions on economic issues like poverty can win as social issues don’t have an outlet.”Evangelism does exist in parliament, including cross-party prayer group meetings. But it is a phenomenon also of the left, with the likes of Kruger balanced out by Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat former leader, and the Labour MP Rachael Maskell.Maskell is very open about how faith shapes her politics, notably on issues such as poverty. Shelost the party whipfor a period due after rebelling on welfare and other issues.Moral justice was “a big part” of Labour politics, she said: “It’s part of our roots, how we think about inequality in society, making sure we have a just system that serves the people, as well as a just immigration system that keeps our border safe but recognises the dignity of people coming to the UK.”There is, however, a different and newer side to religion in UK politics, one more closely modelled on US ideas of religious nationalism.The far-right agitator Tommy Robinson has begun to present himself as explicitly Christian, although much of this is done as a contrast to Islam, the main religion he targets.Similarly, Nick Tenconi, who leads the UK outpost of Turning Point, the rightwing student group set up by the killed US activist Charlie Kirk, includes social media messaging about the country needing to “return to Christ” alongside anti-Islam and anti-migrant content.In a dramatic manifestation of this, in October a Turning Point-allied Christian nationalist group called King’s Army marched in formation wearing branded black tracksuits through Soho, a location seemingly chosen as it is the centre of London’s LGBT community.All this remains, however, fairly niche in UK politics. Critics sometimes portray Marshall as the wealthy incubator of US-style evangelism, but friends insist he is little more than a devout Anglican who, as one put it, “is strongly opposed to Christian nationalism and any kind of politicisation of faith”.Kruger is not averse to occasional off-piste rhetoric, for exampleusing a speechto the National Conservatism conference in London to condemn what he said was a younger generation indoctrinated by “a mix of Marxism and narcissism and paganism, self-worship and nature-worship”.But he still feels some way from the US culture. Webster from the EA said: “In the UK you do have some Christian nationalists, but when it comes to politics it tends to more often be a sort of Christian nostalgia, linked to our historic identity with the church that people feel may have been lost.”One Christian MP on the right of politics noted that while the issue of assisted dying had helped bring together MPs with faith, any links beyond that felt limited.“I certainly don’t get the sense of much of an evangelical lobby,” they said. “For me, my faith is more a foundation for what I already believe. And here, religion is not really a vote winner.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKChristianityReligionanalysisShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There was a time when playing aChristmasboard game meant dusting off an old favourite selected from a narrow range of options. Maybe Trivial Pursuit, if you wanted to show off your pub quiz chops. Or Scrabble, if you felt like flexing your wordsmith muscles. Or Monopoly, if you hoped to roll around in wads of fake cash. But these days the choice is far, far wider. Almost overwhelmingly so.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.During the past decade, the modern board game scene hasexploded like a cartoon kitten. As screens have come to dominate our eyelines and erode our mental health, more of us are seeking recreational solace in the more social, less toxic worlds of cardboard, cubes and wooden pawns – or “meeples”, to use the hobby parlance. Each tabletop experience has been finely crafted to yield maximum enjoyment in an often gorgeously presented way. Taking their cue from such indefatigable “Eurogame” classics as Catan and Codenames, these modern games have so grown in popularity they’ve encouraged the spread of high-street board game cafes, fuelled a boom in tabletop-related influencer activity, filled convention halls at ever-growing expos worldwide and raised millions on crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter.They also inspired me to co-create a magazine devoted to the artfulness of board games. It takes its name from one of the world’s most ancient games, the 5,000-year-oldSenet. Our tagline is “board games are beautiful”, so unsurprisingly we believe there are few better things you can buy anyone for Christmas than a board game.When considering your options, you could default to a new edition or variant of one of those old reliables (there now seems to be a Monopoly for every fandom). Or you could look at any of those aforementioned modern classics; Catan, after all, is still going strong 30 years after publication with its recently released sixth edition. But when my crack team of Senet writers and I put our heads together for this Christmas list of recommendations, we wanted to lean into the sheer joy of discovery that this hobby offers.You may not be familiar with many of the games that follow, but we promise you’ll enjoy every last one. Of course, we realise that not everybody has the time (or table space) to devote some of the more in-depth “heavy” titles that delight and challenge serious gamers. So we’ve categorised our choices based on the flavour of play experience they offer. Party games for those who prefer fun crowdpleasers. Card games for those who like things pacy and swift to set up. Two-player games if you prefer a streamlined duel. Light strategy games if big, thick rulebooks scare you. And heavy if you enjoy a bit of “crunch”, as we say.Most of them are competitive, though some follow a popular modern trend by inviting you to play as a team against the game itself. Plus, there is an intentional diversity of themes, from medieval intrigue to cosmic empire-building, via cheesemaking, political scandals and even the underworld of 18th-century queer London. We’ve tried to mix it up and show that there’s a board game for everybody. Let’s play.Dan JolinThe best board games for 2025View image in fullscreenLive and let dice … card games or strategy? You decide.Illustration: Jason Ford/The GuardianParty gamesView image in fullscreenHot Streak£49.89 at Board Gamist£33.70 at AmazonAges6+Only one game lets you cheer on as a figurine of a person in a hotdog suit tramples over their biggest rival. Set in the seedy world of sports mascot racing, Hot Streak is a betting game that is 90% hilarity and 10% cautionary tale. Mascots race down a track one move at a time, but rather than taking direct control of any given racer, players are provided glimpses of their upcoming moves – sprinting along, spinning in a blind panic, or falling flat on their face – and then allowed to tweak the odds in their favour before any bets are placed. For kids and adults alike, this is one of the funniest games in years.Dan ThurotView image in fullscreenThat’s Not a Hat£7.99 at John Lewis£7.99 at RavensburgerAges8+A quick, easy-to-learn memory game for three to eight players, That’s Not a Hat involves passing face-down cards showing pictures of gifts to your neighbours while trying to remember which gift is which. As you give a card, you announce what it is. What appears, at first glance, insultingly simple – remember the single object in your custody – rapidly induces a kind of dry-mouthed existential panic as players’ minds go blank. A confident bluff sometimes pays off, but overall there’s a wonderful, albeit unnerving, equality in how rubbish everyone, young and old, is at remembering a handful of objects.Tim ClareView image in fullscreenWavelength£29.99 at John LewisAges14+Wavelength belongs to a family of games where one player gives a clue and their team tries to guess the answer. But it has a brilliant twist: rather than questions with a concrete response, it offers a scale, ie from “hot” to “cold”, or “introvert” to “extrovert”. The clue guides guessers to where on that scale a randomly dialled arrow lies. Not only is this much more exciting and exacting than quizzes, it creates fascinating, revealing and hilarious conversations around the scale itself. It also plays both competitively and cooperatively. What more could you want from a party game?Matt ThrowerView image in fullscreenWilmot’s Warehouse£36.99 at Zatu Games£37.65 at HiveAges8+Loosely based on a videogame, this colourful cooperative title offers a great way to bring a group of people together without the competitive fractiousness that sometimes impairs party games. Everyone works as a single team, tasked with remembering the positions of 35 face-down tiles, each decorated with a bright abstract image. The joy of this seemingly impossible task comes in the way you collaborate to establish connections between the tiles, even creating entertaining little narratives based on their artwork, then marvel at how effective – almost mind-meldingly magical – creative teamwork can be.DJView image in fullscreenCockroach Poker£7.98 at Zatu Games£10.99 at WaterstonesAges8+This cheeky game of bluffing will appeal even to those who can’t keep a poker face. Players try to get rid of cards containing critters, such as stink bugs, flies or rats, from their hand. This can be done by deceit – pretend that a rat in your hand is just a fly – and if you are believed, the fooled party gets the card. Or you can be completely honest and watch your opponent second-guess themselves. Either way, mistrust spreads quickly and hilarity ensues. A game of quick turns, simple gameplay and many laughs, it is a perfect ice-breaker.Alexandra SonechkinaView image in fullscreenPhantom Ink£17 at Magic MadhouseAges13+An uproarious party game of ghostly word-guessing. Players divide into two teams made of up to three mediums and a spirit, who are tasked with picking a word their teams need to guess. When it’s your team’s turn, mediums take a card to give their spirit a question to answer about the word. Clues unfold one letter at a time, and while opponents may not know what is being answered, they can maybe figure out what’s being spelled – which can help solve the word. You’re trying to beat the other team, yet somehow working together at the same time. An otherworldly experience.Meeple LadyTwo-player gamesView image in fullscreenSplendor Duel£16.98 at Zatu Games£25.05 at AmazonAges 10+The original Splendor is a simple yet compelling engine-building game about Renaissance jewel merchants. You take tokens to buy cards which then, in turn, work as permanent tokens for future purchases. This two-player version uses the same concept but ups the ante at every level. Cards now have a variety of special effects, there are devious new ways to steal a win and, best of all, you select tokens from a grid. This adds a constant temptation to pick whatever messes up your opponent’s strategy. It’s a wonderful, seamless genre-blend that tops the two-player world.MTView image in fullscreenIliad£19.98 at Zatu Games£21.20 at Magic MadhouseAges10+German designer Reiner Knizia is the most prolific inventor of board games alive with more than 500 to his name, and Iliad is proof he’s still bursting with new ideas. In this pitched melee from ancient myth, players draw and place hoplites that will hopefully out-sum their opposition soldiers once the row or column is filled. Like many of the best two-player games, the result is a tightly strategic affair, one where every move balances on a spear’s edge between triumph and infamy.DTView image in fullscreen7 Wonders Duel£18.19 at Zatu Games£24.99 at WaterstonesAges 10+It is no small feat to maintain the epic gameplay of the civilisation-building game 7 Wonders in a compact package and for only two players, but Duels does just that. Players still get to draft cards that represent resources and infrastructure of their civilisation. They still research sciences, trade, go to war with each other and, of course, build their unique wonders. However, with two players, the gameplay is heightened: any confrontation is direct, and every decision has higher stakes. So, although it may be physically small, its ambitious scope and gameplay make a gigantic impact.ASView image in fullscreenHouse of cards … Watergate.Photograph: Alex Singh PhotoWatergate£26.94 at Zatu Games£37.33 at AmazonAges 12+It is 1972 America, and the Watergate scandal that will eventually doom President Nixon dominates headlines. In Watergate the board game, one player represents a Washington Post editor trying to connect Nixon to his informers, while the other plays Nixon, trying to hang on to his presidency and not resign. Each player has their own set of action cards that can be played for events or action points, which are spent to gain momentum or initiative, or getting evidence on the conspiracy board. Even if American history is not your thing, it’s still a very tense cat-and-mouse game.MLView image in fullscreenTag Team£17.58 at Zatu Games£18 at Thirsty MeeplesAges 10+This quirky, beat ’em up-inspired card battler sees you and your opponent pick two fighters each from a varied, Street Fighter-style roster. Each turn, you add a card to your deck of attacks, blocks and special moves, then the two teams trade blows. The twist is that, between rounds, your moves stay locked in the same order, save for the one new card you slide somewhere into the deck. The result is half Enter the Dragon, half Groundhog Day, where you both know what moves are coming and try to adjust your deck to counter them.TCView image in fullscreenUndaunted: Stalingrad£60.25 at Zatu Games£64.35 at Magic MadhouseAges 14+One of the most immersive, affecting and easy-to-learn wargames ever published. Each player picks a side (Germany or the Soviet Union), then embarks on a campaign with a narrative that evolves – and transforms the tile-based battlefield – depending on the outcomes of its 15 branching scenarios. Both sides have their own deck of cards (each representing a soldier) which also changes as the game progresses. A lost card is a permanent casualty, which brings home the human cost of tactical decisions. Deeply engaging, and thrilling to play.DJLight strategyView image in fullscreenHarmonies£23.79 at Zatu Games£28.96 at AmazonAges 10+The best games don’t just end with a victor. They also leave every player feeling as if they’ve achieved something. So it proves with Harmonies, which gives each of its participants a mini board to fill with pleasingly chunky environment tiles (rocks, foliage, grass) that are drafted and arranged, sometimes stacked, to represent landscape features (mountains, forests, savannahs). How you arrange them depends on which animals you want to attract. What follows is a gently competitive puzzle where you score for animals and landscaping achievements, and each game leaves you with your own little hand-built nature haven.DJView image in fullscreenJoraku£25.99 at Zatu Games£34.09 at AmazonAges 12+This gem delivers everything Risk promises – and largely fails – to, but in half the time: a rich, tactical war game that’s easy to learn, with twists and shifting priorities that keep things tense to the very end. Lead your warlord and samurai in a march on the capital in Sengoku-era Japan, playing cards each round to place or move troops, or attack your rivals. Unlike most war games, it rarely feels mean: you can’t get eliminated; you don’t have to spend ages calculating intricate, multi-turn strategies; and you can be done in under an hour. Perfection.TCView image in fullscreenVantage£52.98 at Zatu Games£60 at Magic MadhouseAges 14+Crash-landing on a distant planet doesn’t have to be such a bad thing. In fact, it might be the beginning of something wonderful. What starts as a mission to survive an alien ecosystem soon becomes more transformative. Your crew could decide on something customary such as pilfering an ancient treasure, but you’re just as likely to pursue a new career, forge a few friendships or settle down to run your own shop. The world of Vantage is shockingly open-ended, always revealing new corners to poke into. It’s the board game equivalent of a holiday visit to a foreign culture.DTView image in fullscreenSay cheese … Fromage.Photograph: Courtesy of FromageFromage£39.99 at Zatu Games£48.22 at AmazonAges 14+Fromage serves up an appetising game of cheesemaking. The board is a circular cheese plate, separated into quadrants, where players take their turn only in the quadrant facing them. They do this by placing their cheesemonger onto a cheese-shaped hole on the board to gather resources or make cheese. When everyone has taken their turn, the plate turns one quarter. Everyone knows the art of making cheese takes time – and you may not get your worker back until a turn or two later. Timing is everything in this delicious and strategic game.MLView image in fullscreenDorfromantik£33.28 at Tesco£33.02 at AmazonAges 8+Based on the videogame of the same name, Dorfromantik offers a meditative experience as players work together to build a landscape of hexagonal tiles of lush forests, cute villages and picturesque wheat fields. The challenge is to place tiles in specific arrangements, made tricky by players drawing blindly from the stack and having to make decisions on the go. This is also a “legacy-style” game, meaning that after every playthrough new tiles, quests and features are unlocked to be used in a future game. What starts as a gentle puzzle matures in complexity as players get more into the game; there’s always something new and exciting to return to.ASView image in fullscreenCosmic Encounter£52.99 at Zatu Games£69.99 at WaterstonesAges 12+Imagine a war game like Risk, but take away the map, leaving everyone able to butt heads regardless of geography. What’s left is a game of high-stakes negotiation where you must plead with and cajole your fellow players to help either the attack or the defence in each encounter. But the real highlight is that every player gets a game-breaking alien power from an astonishingly diverse selection, making every play an extraordinary, thrilling and frequently funny boiling pot of cosmic chaos.MTHeavy strategyView image in fullscreenThe Old King’s Crown£65 at Zatu GamesAges 12+One of the hottest games of 2025, and a UK success story, this sublimely constructed, beautifully illustrated shelf-creaker casts each player as a different faction competing to fill the power vacuum left by a recently vanished monarch. This is essentially done by playing numbered cards face-down to different battleground locations, then revealing them and handing the spoils to the player who’s bid the highest value. But there are many delicious complications: from cards that can move once revealed to cards that assassinate their opponents in one fell swoop. Utterly engrossing.DJView image in fullscreenDune: Imperium Uprising£43.69 at Zatu Games£46.30 at Magic MadhouseAges 14+There are several games based on Frank Herbert’s famous sci-fi novel, but Dune: Imperium Uprising offers the best of all worlds. It has lots of moving parts to build a strategy around: competitive board placements, the ability to slowly build your own deck of cards, a variety of resources to juggle in a tight economy. It cleverly avoids the confines of a map, abstracting the military aspects away to a conflict phase while keeping the thrill of sudden card reveals and direct interaction. All that, and it still transports players to the distant deserts of Herbert’s imagination on every play.MTView image in fullscreenNaughty but nice … Molly House.Photograph: Courtesy of Molly HouseMolly House£48.95 at Zatu Games£50.80 at Magic MadhouseAges 14+Joy, acceptance and betrayal are the cornerstones of one of the smartest, warmest and at times most vicious board games ever designed. Set in the “molly houses” of Georgian London where gay men could discreetly meet, your molly cruises the arcades for companionship, throws wild parties and evades capture at the hands of moralising constables. In this unusually expressive title, there are nights out with new lovers and old friends, but the threat of public punishment, or even death, can spark bitter disputes with those selfsame companions. As both a strategy game and a slice of history, there’s nothing like it.DTView image in fullscreenCoffee Traders£83.95 at Zatu Games£71.78 at AmazonAges 12+You don’t need to know your Arabica from your Robusta to be captivated by the world of Coffee Traders, which hogs the tabletop with multiple boards brimming with tokens. It is 1970, and as a member of the Fair Trade organisation, your goal is both altruistic and entrepreneurial: to improve working conditions of family-run coffee plantations and establish trade routes to coffee shops all over the world. It is a game of deep strategy, where an early decision reverberates many turns later, delivering an experience as rich as a freshly brewed Americano.ASView image in fullscreenAge of Innovation£64.79 at Zatu Games£67.80 at Magic MadhouseAge 14+Age of Innovation is one of several reworkings of 2012’s Terra Mystica – a game that, given how quickly tabletop gaming has evolved, now counts as a classic from a bygone era. Players race to spread their empires across a shared map, reworking the terrain and building workshops, guild houses and universities, which earn you money, improved construction power, and even scholars who can discover powerful new technologies. Like its predecessor, Age of Innovation is deep and rewarding – there’s no direct conflict, and building next to your opponents has benefits – and almost infinitely replayable.TCView image in fullscreenArcs£45.79 at Magic Madhouse£43.99 at AmazonAges 14+A sci-fi strategy game of initiative and declaring ambitions. This battle for space dominance can play up to five chapters using a hand of cards for each chapter. The player with initiative takes their turn, and the card played contains a suit that allows access to actions such as building cities or moving ships across the gorgeous board. Subsequent players must surpass, copy or pivot in a form of trick-taking. It’s a game of action and reaction, and recognising that sometimes starting a fight might not always benefit you. An epic, card-driven space opera.MLCard GamesView image in fullscreenCourtisans£15.99 at Beanie Games£19.99 at WaterstonesAges 8+The setting for this slick title is a Game of Thrones-style banquet, where noble houses try to curry favour with the queen. On each turn you draw three cards representing various house agents (spies, assassins, guards, etc) and play all three: one to yourself, one to another player and one to the central banquet table, either above it (to encourage the queen’s favour) or below (to attract her displeasure). But whether the cards you collect will score or cost you points isn’t certain until the game is over and the queen’s opinion of each house is delivered, based on those table positions. Courtisans is tense and packed with triumphant “take that” moments, but in the best, most prone to backfiring sort of way.DJView image in fullscreenScout£15.60 at Magic Madhouse£15.99 at Beanie GamesAges 9+Coming from Oink Games, known for its eye-catching, minimalist design, Scout sees players aim to empty their hand of cards by discarding a set of the same value or consecutive value cards. Sounds easy, right? Only they must also be adjacent to each other, and once a player draws cards, they can’t rearrange them. When to discard, which new cards to pick up, and how to arrange them in your hand becomes a deliciously brain-scratching puzzle. A loosely applied circus theme with vibrant colours makes this game immediately stand out.ASView image in fullscreenThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring – Trick-Taking Game£20.10 at Magic Madhouse£24.99 at WaterstonesAges 10+Although you may not know it from playing Hearts or Bridge around the kitchen table, modern trick-taking games are a bottomless wellspring of innovation. For example, this sees players working together to retrace the steps of the classic fantasy novel, from the Shire to the banks of the River Anduin. Each chapter offers a new challenge, whether dodging Black Riders, spending time with the curious Tom Bombadil, or falling into shadow n he depths of Moria. Between the slowly unfurling narrative and the lovely stained-glass illustrations, this is one take on Tolkien that shouldn’t be missed.DTView image in fullscreenForest Shuffle£26.99 at Waterstones£26.97 at AmazonAges 10+On the face of it, Forest Shuffle is a charming card game about cultivating the perfect forest. Play tree cards on the table in front of you, then surround those trees with birds, butterflies, rabbits, strawberry plants and mushrooms. Each plant and creature scores you points at the end, and many give you something when you play them, drawing you extra cards or letting you take an extra turn. However, behind the cosy facade is a compelling race full of interlocking systems and scrambles for the perfect card as you rush to finish before the arrival of winter.TCView image in fullscreenRebel Princess£21.95 at Meeples Corner£19.23 at AmazonAges 8+Rebel Princess takes the age-old trope of a prince falling in love with a princess and turns it upside down. In this game, princesses could not care less about princes – they’re trying to avoid marriage proposals. This game mostly plays out like your standard trick-taker – where other players must follow suit if they can and the highest card played wins the trick – but new rules come into play. Once a prince enters the party, players must avoid them if they can, particularly the Frog Prince. The artwork is delightful and it’s fun to root for these ladies.MLView image in fullscreenRes Arcana£24.59 at Zatu Games£25.99 at 365 GamesAges 12+Res Arcana is a cardboard paradox, a game that should not work. Each player gets a random selection of card effects that represent magic spells. From these they must somehow cobble together a strategy to gain the resources required to buy victory-generating places of power faster than their opponents. With so much setup left to chance, this should be a crapshoot. Yet it’s astonishingly rich, conjuring card combinations from seemingly incompatible effects, offering unique challenges in each new game, while the card art evokes the sorcerous theme. It’s a magic trick in itself.MTExplore more on these topicsBoard gamesFamilyChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In some cases referrals that GPs have agreed to make do not even get sent from their surgery to the hospital,Healthwatch England’s findings show.The research found that 14% of all referrals are getting “stuck” betweenGPsand hospitals, leaving patients in the dark and anxious about when they will be seen and treated.GPs failing older people living with frailty, National Audit Office findsRead moreChris McCann, Healthwatch’s deputy chief executive, said: “Behind every delayed, lost or rejected referral is a human story of pain, stress and uncertainty.“While improvements have been made, too many people remain stuck in this referral ‘black hole’, telling us that they’re ‘existing not living’ due to delays.”Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said the findings were “deeply alarming” and that delays to referrals can leave some patients afraid to leave their home.“When seven out of 10 people only find out their referral failed because they chased it up themselves, something is badly wrong.“These are people already anxious about their health, already stressed waiting for treatment – and then they discover they weren’t even in the queue. While they wait, their conditions could be getting worse,” said Power.Healthwatch’s findings are based on a YouGov survey of a nationally representative sample of 2,622 adults in England whom a GP had referred for tests or treatment in the last year.They raise questions about how accurate theNHSwaiting list is as a true reflection of the number of people who need care – 6.24 million people are waiting for 7.39 million tests or treatments – and how good the service is at keeping patients informed about the progress of their referral.Just over half (53%) of people referred seek medical help or advice while they wait for the NHS to act, the survey found. While 7% go private, one in five (20%) asks for help from other parts of the NHS, such as a different GP or urgent care services. “These results suggest that referral delays may increase pressure on other NHS services”, the report noted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “When I rang they were nice on the phone but they couldn’t give me any good news. It could be as long as a year before I get an appointment, and that’s just to take the first step in a long process.”His pain has become so bad he struggles with daily tasks such as shopping, driving or even putting on his shoes. He does not know when he will be seen.“I feel like I’m stuck in limbo,” he added.The 14% of people whose referral gets lost, rejected or denied is an improvement on the 21% who experienced the same fate when the watchdog undertook similar research in 2023.Since then ministers and health service chiefs have tried to tackle the problem by making it easier for patients to track the progress of their referral via the NHS app and using pharmacies to help people with suspected cancer.“Yet, despite progress, many patients still report that poor communication, delays and uncertainty caused by long waits are affecting their health, wellbeing and ability to work,” Healthwatch said.One in four (23%) people are dissatisfied with the referrals process, it found. Public satisfaction with the NHS generally has fallen to just 21% – the lowest level – the most recent British Social Attitudes survey found.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said the situation revealed by the findings was “not acceptable”. But improvements have been made since the research was done in March, the spokesperson added.They include theintroduction in September of Jess’s rule, under which GPs are meant to seek a second opinion if they cannot diagnose a patient’s illness after three appointments.The DHSC is putting an extra £1.1bn into general practice, recruiting more family doctors and cutting red tape so GPs can spend more time with patients, the spokesperson added.Family doctors are also now encouraged to seek “advice and guidance” from specialist hospital doctors about referrals. Patient satisfaction with primary care has risen from 60% in July 2024 to 75%.The DHSC spokesperson said: “We have been clear that it will take time to turn around the NHS but we are starting to see improvements. There’s still a long way to go but we are beginning to see the green shoots of recovery.”Explore more on these topicsGPsHealthNHSEnglandDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

He welcomed signals that theTrump administrationwas “in favour of dialogue and building good relations”. He warned, however, that the supposed US “deep state” could try to sabotage Trump’s vision.It came as the White House’s efforts to push through a peace deal inUkraineenter a key phase. US officials claim they are in the final stage of reaching an agreement, but there is little sign that either Ukraine or Russia is willing to sign the framework deal drawn up by Trump’s negotiating team.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,will visit Downing Streeton Monday for a four-way meeting with with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz.Zelenskyy has previously called on European allies for support at times when the White House has tried to push Ukraine towards agreeing to give up territory. A key issue for Kyiv is what security guarantees it would receive if it does agree to renounce control of some territory.Zelenskyy has said he had a “substantive phone call” with US officials on Saturday evening after they finished three days of talks with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida. Those meetings followed a visit to Moscow by Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, earlier in the week. A sourcetoldAxios the call had lasted two hours and was “difficult”.“Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media. He said the two sides had discussed “key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full-scale invasion”.It is not clear that either the US or Europe are willing to offer the kind of security guarantees that would genuinely deter Russia from invading again. Nor is it likely that Vladimir Putin would agree to a deal that involved any western troops stationed in Ukraine.US officials have claimed to be close to a sustainable deal on numerous occasions since Trump began his second term in office, only for the claims to be exposed as wishful thinking.Trump’s outgoing Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said at a defence forum on Saturday that the administration’s efforts to end the war were in “the last 10 metres”. He said there were two outstanding issues: territory and the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.Kellogg is seen as among the US officials most sympathetic to Kyiv’s position, but is due to leave his role in January and was present at the Florida talks. Many others in Trump’s orbit, including Witkoff, have been much more open to adopting Russian positions. Trump’s son, Donald Jr, said at a forum in Doha on Sunday that Zelenskyy was deliberately continuing the conflict for fear of losing power if it ended. He said the US would not be “the idiot with the chequebook” any longer.Analysts in Kyiv say the situation is not yet so bad that Ukraine would be forced to sign any deal whatsoever simply to prevent a continuation of the war, but they say a difficult and potentially bleak winter lies ahead as Russia continues to target energy infrastructure, disrupting power and heating supplies for millions of Ukrainians.Exhaustion is setting in as Ukraine enters the fourth winter of full-scale war, and Zelenskyy has been weakened by a corruption scandal that has touched numerous associates and led tothe resignation of his powerful chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.One person was killed during a drone attack in the northern Chernihiv region late on Saturday, according to local officials, and a combined attack of drones and missiles targeted energy infrastructure in the central city of Kremenchuk. It left much of the city without power and water on Sunday. It was the second consecutive night of attacks targeting energy, after more than 600 drones and 50 missileswere used on Friday night.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUS foreign policyUkraineTrump administrationEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The move follows reports in the Guardian that have raised questions from MPs about the activities of Bloom, a billionaire who has made his money from gambling.The Guardian revealed last week that Bloom, the majority shareholder at Brighton,is being suedin a lawsuit that alleges “frontmen” were sometimes used when his gambling syndicate placed bets on sports events. The details were set out in a public document at the high court in London, which named George Cottrell, a close associate of the Reform party leader, Nigel Farage, as one person who acted as a front for the collective, known as the Starlizard Betting Syndicate. The case involves a dispute between Bloom and Ryan Dudfield, a former associate who claims he is owed a share of gambling profits.The syndicate makes about £600m each year in winnings, the document alleges.Bloom has yet to file a defence to the lawsuit. He did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the claim. Lawyers acting for Cottrell were approached for comment.On Friday,the Guardian published a second storywhich focused on allegations Bloom could be an anonymous gambler behind $70m (£52m) in winnings – which allegedly included bets on his football teams.Bloom declined to comment about this specific claim, but through a source made clear he denied betting on his own teams or competitions that involve them, describing any such allegations as “entirely false”.Following publication of the Guardian story, Bloom issued a public statement through Brighton FC in which he said: “I can categorically assure our supporters that I have not placed bets on any Brighton & Hove Albion matches since becoming the owner of the club in 2009.”MPs have said these matters need to be properly examined.Clive Betts, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on football, said on Friday that the Football Association needed to conduct “a thorough and comprehensive investigation”.Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservative party, said: “The FA must be much more transparent about their lax policy concerning the use of gambling money in the running of their clubs.”A spokesperson for the Guardian said: “It is a worrying development that Brighton has introduced this ban. The questions raised by our reporting are in the public interest and have been pursued in a responsible manner.”Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionGamblingThe GuardiannewsShareReuse this content"

He had been diagnosed with cancer in May 2021.A statement from the Martin Parr Foundation on Sunday said: “It is with great sadness that we announce that Martin Parr died yesterday at home in Bristol.“He is survived by his wife Susie, his daughter Ellen, his sister Vivien and his grandson George. The family asks for privacy at this time.“The Martin Parr Foundation and Magnum Photos will work together to preserve and share Martin’s legacy. More information on this will follow in due course. Martin will be greatly missed.”Known for his acute observations of the English class system, Parr’s images covered sunbathers and Conservative clubs, village fetes and coffee mornings, often in vivid colour and with more than a dash of humour. His iconic 1986 photobook The Last Resort: Photographs of New Brighton captured working-class holidaymakers in Wirral, Merseyside, and helped mark a sea change in British documentary photography, from the gritty, black and white style of the past towards a cheekier and more colourful style.View image in fullscreenNew Brighton, Merseyside. From The Last Resort, 1983-85.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos“I make serious photographs disguised as entertainment,” Parr once said by way of a mantra.He was born in Surrey in 1952, growing up in Epsom. Inspired by his grandfather, a keen amateur photographer, Parr had decided on his career path by the time he was a teenager. After training at Manchester Polytechnic he spent a couple of seasons shooting at Butlin’s, initially with his peer Daniel Meadows. It was there that he observed the highly saturated, nostalgic postcards taken by John Hinde that would shape his later work.After moving to Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, Parr spent time photographing chapel communities there before meeting his wife, Susan Mitchell, and moving to the west coast of Ireland where he published several works including 1982’s Bad Weather, taken using an underwater camera.View image in fullscreenO’Connell Bridge, Dublin. From Bad Weather.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosIt was when the couple moved to Wallasey in Merseyside, however, that Parr produced what he later claimed was his greatest work. Inspired by colour photographers from across the Atlantic such as Joel Meyerowitz and Stephen Shore, The Last Resort was the product of three summers spent on the beaches of New Brighton, photographing fish and chip wrappers, crying children and fairground rides.The director of Autograph, Mark Sealy, said: “Some people read the work as cruel, but you see the warts when you’re close to things. It wasn’t about ridicule, there was an intimate distance.“He treated people through his lens with a sense of equality, if you were about to shove a pie in your face, he was going to capture it regardless of who you were.”It made his name but The Last Resort was not entirely well received. Parr faced significant criticism for the way he depicted working-class families from his privileged vantage point, with some decrying an unflattering focus on his subject’s sunburnt flesh and cheap vices. But for his admirers, this was all part of Parr’s unflinching gaze: he wanted to capture normal life as it was for most Britons, not shy away from it.Besides, Parr could be even more biting when it came to documenting the middle class of which he was himself a member. As Margaret Thatcher reshaped the country during the 80s, Parr moved to Bristol with Susan and their new daughter, Ellen. There he turned his attention to the other end of society, a world of garden parties, shopping trips and public school open days that made up his 1989 photobook The Cost of Living.“No one contributed more to the rise of the photobook as a popular medium over the past 20 years than he did,” said the author and photographerJohny Pitts.Thanks to his sharp, anthropological eye, Parr’s work could provoke multiple reactions – humour, empathy, disgust – often within the same image. It mirrored his own love/hate relationship with his homeland; Parr was aself-confessed “remoaner”who nevertheless loved the nostalgic past of village greens and local fairs. His work was not overtly campaigning, althoughhe once told the Observerthat “all photojournalists are left wing, you can’t do this job unless you care about people”.Throughout the 90s Parr’s work became more international with his critiques of the tourist industry (Small World) and global consumerism (Common Sense). There was also more controversy when he joined the prestigious photography agency Magnum in 1994.View image in fullscreenThe Acropolis in Athens, 1991. From Small World.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosThe agency’s founder and guiding light, Henri Cartier-Bresson, had dismissed Parr’s work as being “from another planet” compared with the artists on the roster at the time. The Welsh Vietnam war photographer Philip Jones Griffiths campaigned against his admission, saying: “Anyone who was described as Margaret Thatcher’s favourite photographer certainly didn’t belong in Magnum.” In the end, Parr was admitted by one vote, a sign that the agency was slowly modernising: Parr would go on to serve as Magnum’s president between 2014 and 2017.In 2014 he launched the Martin Parr Foundation, which housed his own photo archive as well as his vast collection of British and Irish photography from other artists.Rene Matić,the Turner Prize nomineewho had a show at the Martin Parr Foundation in 2023, said Parr was “generous in every way — with his eye, his wisdom, his humour, his wit”. “He believed in me as an image-maker, and that belief stayed with me,” they said.The artist Jeremy Deller said Parr’s foundation was part of a “huge growing legacy” that supports British photography, describing it as “a very generous place with a great atmosphere”.Parr was not just a photographer but a collector too, of photobooks as well as postcards and strange items of memorabilia. His 2019 book Space Dogs: The Story of the Celebrated Canine Cosmonauts involved his array of paraphernalia devoted to the likes of Laika, Belka and Strelka. His collection of Saddam Hussein watches also became a book in 2004.But photography itself was always Parr’s greatest obsession. “You have to be fearless if you’re to be a photographer,” he once said. “There’s no time for being intimidated.”Explore more on these topicsMartin ParrPhotographynewsShareReuse this content"

Lt Col Pascal Tigri was appointed president of the military committee, the soldiers said.View image in fullscreenVideograb from Benin TV footage shows soldiers from the Military Committee for Refoundation announcing the government’s dissolution.Photograph: Benin TV/AFP/Getty ImagesThe rapid mobilisation of forces loyal to the government “allowed us to thwart these adventurers”, Talon said in remarks aired on state TV after the government regained control of the broadcaster.“This treachery will not go unpunished,” he added.The attempted coup was the latest threat to democratic rule in the region, where militaries have in recent years seized power in Benin’s neighbours Niger and Burkina Faso, as well as in Mali, Guinea and,only last month, Guinea-Bissau.But it was a surprising development in Benin, where the last successful coup took place in 1972.A government spokesperson, Wilfried LéandreHoungbedji, earlier said that 14 people had been arrested in connection with the coup attempt as of Sunday afternoon, without providing details.The attempt came as Benin was preparing for a presidential election in April that would mark the end of the tenure of Talon, 67, who has held power since 2016.In their televised statement, the coup plotters mentioned the deteriorating security situation in northern Benin “coupled with the disregard and neglect of our fallen brothers-in-arms”.Talon has been credited with reviving the economy, but the country has also seen an increase in attacks by jihadist militants that have wreaked havoc in Mali andBurkina Faso.Explore more on these topicsBeninAfricaGhanaNigeriaSierra LeoneGuineaGuinea-BissaunewsShareReuse this content"

Will he be returned to the US?Daniel Andreas San Diego, now 47, is fighting extradition from the UK amid accusations he set off three pipe bombs in 2003Ali WinstonSun 7 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 08.02 ESTShareTwenty-two years ago, a dark-haired, bespectacled young man vanished off the streets of San Francisco. Daniel Andreas San Diego, a 25-year-old information technology specialist, diehard vegan and animal rights activist, was the FBI’s main suspect in a series of pipe bombings that exploded in front of the headquarters of Chiron Corporation and Shaklee Corporation, two Bay Area companies, in August and September of 2003.Communiques attributed to the Revolutionary Cells – Animal Liberation Brigade wereposted to the website of an animal rights magazine, claiming the attacks were carried out to highlight both firms’ alleged work with Huntingdon Life Sciences, a British research company that conducted tests for pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other chemical companies and had drawn the ire of activists on both sides of the Atlantic opposing its tests on animals.In early September of this year, San Diego stood in a plexiglass dock at Westminster magistrate’s court in London, wearing a white button-down shirt and slacks, and guarded by several correctional officers. Now 47 years old, his hair is graying and his face has more wrinkles than the mugshots of a beaming, earringed young man the FBI disseminated during their 21-year search for him.San Diego is fighting extradition to the United States on federal charges for the three political bombings, which injured no one. If extradited and convicted in the US, he could face 90 years behind bars, a potential life sentence. Armed with some of the UK’s most formidable human rights barristers, he has turned his extradition fight into a courtroom referendum on the compromised state of American justice underDonald Trump. Per hiscase docketin the northern district of California, San Diego does not have an attorney of record and has not entered a plea in his case.The case also sheds a new light on an almost-forgotten chapter in American extremism - the post-9/11 “green scare”, when a growing federal law enforcement apparatus claimed “the No 1 domestic terrorism threat is the ecoterrorism, animal-rights movement”, as the FBI deputy director for counter-terrorism John Lewis stated in2005 Senate testimony. Dozens of militants involved in torching development projects in the wilderness, freeing animals in testing facilities and leading mainstream campaigns against companies involved in such practices were prosecuted and convicted in a massive crackdown on the social movement. Until his capture, San Diego was one of the last fugitives from this era.But it’s an important one in understanding federal law enforcement policies today, multiple experts say. The crackdown institutionalized law enforcement’s focus on social movements and activism, said Will Potter, a journalist and author of the 2011 bookGreen Is the New Red, at the price of the violent far-right militancy responsible for themajority of domestic terrorism incidents in the past decade.“People don’t know this history, and now we’re seeing attacks on social movements and anti-fascists ramping up quickly,” said Potter. “Now, the government’s powers of going after social movements as terrorists have been inherited by an authoritarian, and measures that were considered radical after 9/11 are now viewed as normal.”“The era in which this case arose almost seems quaint, looking back,” said Ben Rosenfeld, a civil rights attorney, who has represented clients involved in animal rights and environmental direct action. Since then, the government’s response has only intensified, he argues: “People are being attacked, detained and deported – if they’re lucky – almost for nothing, for political viewpoints and opinions and expressions that the government finds distasteful.”San Diego was born in the progressive stronghold of Berkeley, California. His father, Edmund San Diego, was the respected city manager of Belvedere, a wealthy enclave on Marin county’s Tiburon peninsula. He fell into activism as a teenager: starting when he was 19 years old, he worked for two years at In Defense of Animals, a non-profit thatcampaignsagainst animal testing.At the turn of the millennium, animal rights and environmental direct action were an integral part of the burgeoning anti-globalization movement that defined much of contemporary youth counterculture, particularly on the west coast. Information tables about the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign, veganism and forest defense campaigns were part of the landscape at punk shows, book festivals and raves.It was through that subculture that young people were drawn to the underground of militant environmentalism and animal liberation, which had thrived since the early 1980s. “The major difference between the scene now and then is there were a lot of paper flyers, word-of-mouth actions, things that felt like a punk rock secret society and a cheerleading aspect where one city was trying to outdo each other in terms of direct action and sabotage,” recounted a former militant, whom the Guardian is not identifying because of fear of targeting by theTrump administration.San Diego was well-known among the above-ground animal rights activists and participated in the formal SHAC campaign. “He was not a guy who was festering in the basement and building bombs,” Rod Coronado, a direct-action advocate and militant environmentalist who worked with San Diego on Huntingdon-related campaigning in California, told theLos Angeles Timesin 2003. “He was not the person with the loudest, most radical voice in meetings, but he was active in demonstrations.”Two former radicals involved in direct actions like freeing animals from testing labs or sabotaging testing companies in northern California during the early 2000s said that San Diego did not participate in such activities, to the best of their knowledge.The first pipe bomb went off at 2.55am on 28 August 2003 outside Chiron Corporation’s headquarters in Emeryville. A second nail-filled explosive device went off at a separate building on Chiron’s campus around 3.59am. No one was injured in the explosions, which blew out windows and caused superficial damage to the office building. For weeks, authorities searched in vain for a suspect caught on grainy CCTV footage holding a bag outside Chiron. On 26 September, another pipe bomb attached to a digital timer exploded at 3.22am outside a building that houses Shaklee Corporation.San Diego had been pulled over by a Pleasanton police officer at an on-ramp to the highway about half a mile from the Chiron campus about an hour before the device outside the Shaklee Corporation exploded. He was released, but the officer wrote up a field contact card with his information. Court records do not make clear why San Diego was pulled over, and the officer who made the stop has since passed away.During their investigation following the explosion, federal investigators came across the card and put San Diego under 24-hour surveillance.On 8 October 2003, San Diego drove from his two-story home in Schellville, Sonoma county, to San Francisco, tailed by an FBI team in a vehicle following his car and a fixed-wing surveillance airplane. Two former FBI agents whospoke to the BBC earlier this yearsaid San Diego was being tailed in hopes that he would lead them to other violent animal rights militants. He drove west through fog-shrouded Marin county and across the Golden Gate Bridge, causing the FBI’s aerial surveillance to lose track of him. He drove to a busy intersection in downtown San Francisco, where he parked his car, left the engine running, got out and walked down the stairs into a Muni station. He was never seen again in the United States. His parents urged him to surrender in 2003, but their appeals did not land.When FBI agents searched San Diego’s Schellville home and car later that week, they found copies of the animal rights magazine whose website posted claims for both bombings. Per federal prosecutors, the trunk of his car contained a mobile bomb-making kit, with copper coil, black PVC pipes, methyl ethyl ketone, aconite, adenosine triphosphate and a wire stripper. San Diego’s fingerprints were found on some of the chemical containers, authorities say.In court this September, British crown prosecutors said a wire stripper found in his car was matched to crimp markings on copper wiring found in the debris from all three bombings San Diego is charged with.In 2009, the FBI added San Diego to the agency’s Most Wanted list and offered a $250,000 reward for his capture, generating another burst of publicity. FBI graphics from the time show San Diego’s photograph featured alongside that of al-Qaida’s Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.After San Diego evaded US authorities, his trail went cold. Dana Ridenour, a retired FBI undercover agent who attempted to penetrate the animal rights world in northern California during the mid-2000s, recounted tracking San Diego’s whereabouts as part of her “domestic terrorism” assignment on apodcast this February.“That was one of my missions, to try to ascertain where he was, if he was still in the United States. There was a couple of people that I kind of cozied up to that we thought may know where he was laying low,” Ridenour said, adding that she chased reports he was in Germany, Hawai’i and Massachusetts.It was only after his November 2024 arrest in the northern Welsh hamlet of Maenan, more than 5,000 miles (8,000km) from California, that his life as a fugitive took shape. When arrested, San Diego possessed an Irish passport in the name of “Danny Stephen Webb”, with a date of birth eight months earlier than his own.According tothe Times of London, San Diego surfaced in Great Britain around February 2005, when he started work as an information technology expert with a digital startup firm in London. A decade later,he obtained another jobas a Linux system administrator in a larger, Manchester-based e-commerce company. He moved to the remote, sparsely populated Conwy valley in the late 2010s, buying a detached home with a twin garage near the village of Treuddyn near Mold for £223,000 in cash in January 2018.It’s unclear what ultimately gave San Diego away. Was it his second home purchase, in 2023, for which he obtained a £40,000 mortgage from the Nationwide Building Society? Or him joining Unity, the digital games company based in San Francisco – his first time working for a company from his birth country since fleeing the United States 21 years earlier?Regardless, the FBI ascertained his true identity. He was arrested on 25 November 2024, with locals telling the Times there had been rumors that the village had been under surveillance by British authorities for months.It is still unclear how San Diego made his way across the Atlantic Ocean and established a new identity, replete with documentation sufficient for him to obtain work. It is unclear whether his Irish alias enabled him to obtain a passport or travel outside the United Kingdom.When arrested, San Diego denied his true identity but was given away by old tattoos from his radical days, including ink with burning buildings, a tree growing out of a road and a picture of a burning hillside with the inscription “It only takes a spark”.Shortly after his arrest, former animal rights activist Peter Young toldthe Guardianthe FBI twice asked him for information about San Diego’s whereabouts, most recently in 2019. “I think the theory of the FBI is that there’s this underground railroad for activists, fugitives, and that is really not the case. It really just comes down to who you know, in terms of your supporters, [but] there is no underground network,” he said. Indicted in 1998 over a string of fur farm raids across three states, Young served two years in federal prison in the mid-2000s after fleeing the US for Great Britain.During extradition proceedings earlier this year in London, San Diego’s lawyers argued that the United States is no longer a country where the former activist can receive a fair trial.“The issue of political interference in the trial process, or prison designation process, is a significant issue in this case,” barrister Mark Summers said at San Diego’s 8 September hearing, also noting the Trump administration’s systemic attacks on judges.US student who took four chickens after breaking into slaughterhouse sentenced to 90 days in jailRead more“In the system prevailing in America, Mr San Diego is a politically disfavored case.”The charges against San Diego, his attorneys allege, are “stacked” in a manner that is designed to elicit plea agreements, in contravention of a2018 federal lawmeant to decrease prison terms.They also argue that if convicted, he faces serious risks of harm from other incarcerated people because he’s designated a “high-risk” prisoner by the Bureau of Prisons. The legal arguments against his extradition are structured around European court of human rights rulings about disproportionate sentencing, political prosecutions, conditions of detention and the possibility of receiving a fair trial, all of which they claim San Diego will not receive should he be returned to the United States.The final days of evidence at San Diego’s extradition hearing will be 8 December, with closing arguments scheduled for 23 December. Senior district judge Paul Goldspring, the ranking justice at the Westminster magistrate’s court, is expected to rule on San Diego’s extradition early in January 2026.Explore more on these topicsUS justice systemUS crimeAnimal welfareTrump administrationUS politicsLaw (US)EnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That is abundantly clear afterthe incendiary interview at Elland Roadon Saturday night that also poses a test of the club’s relationship with Arne Slot. The next revelation will be the extent of internal support for the coach who delivered Liverpool’s record-equalling20th league titleeight months ago.Salah may have been emotional having been on the bench for the third successive game, but stunning waiting reporters not only by stopping to speak but by dropping a series of grenades during a post-match interview lasting more than seven minutes was not a case of heart ruling head. It never is when one of the greatest players to pull on the red shirt deigns to address the media. Whether it is criticism of contract negotiations, applying a little more pressure to get an agreeable deal done or, in this instance, piling more problems on Slot, Salah’s words are calculated to achieve what he wants.Mohamed Salah says ‘I’ve been thrown under the bus’ and signals Liverpool exitRead moreAt Leeds, however, he may well have overplayed his hand. This has echoes of Roy Keane’s infamous MUTV interview that led to Manchester United sacking their captain 20 years ago. But Keane’s words were not made public at the time and the full transcript has never appeared.The Egypt international twice accused Liverpool of throwing him under a bus in response to theirdismal Premier League title defence. Salah made sure that everyone else at Liverpool – the club’s hierarchy, head coach and even teammates he professed to love – would be under it with him.Slot went under the bus with Salah’s revelation that there is no longer a relationship between Liverpool’s head coach and star player. An untenable situation. Members of the club’s hierarchy – specifically the sporting director, Richard Hughes, and Michael Edwards, the chief executive of football atFenway Sports Group(FSG) – were dragged under by Salah’s claim that someone wants him out of the club. Unwittingly or otherwise, the finger immediately points in their direction with Liverpool committed to paying the 33-year-old more than £32m for the remaining 19 months of a contract signed only in April.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah stopped to speak for seven minutes after Liverpool’s 3-3 draw with Leeds and vented his frustrations.Photograph: Dennis Goodwin/ProSports/ShutterstockTeammates were thrown under too by Salah’s entitled insistence that he has earned the position Slot has taken from him. Only in the past week, mind you. Those teammates include Dominik Szoboszlai, Liverpool’s best performer this season, who started in Salah’s placeagainst West Ham, Sunderland and Leeds. Virgil van Dijk may take issue with his colleague too, having said: “It’s not like you have unlimited credit, everyone has to perform,” when asked about Salah’s demotion in midweek.Anotherpost-Sunderland linefrom the Liverpool captain leaps out after Salah’s interview. “I need him around as one of the leaders,” Van Dijk said on Wednesday. This was not leadership from Salah, it was pure self-indulgence and a betrayal of the dressing room. There is seemingly no end to Liverpool’s problems this season, too many of them self-inflicted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The response must be emphatic, however, or Slot’s position will be seriously undermined by his own employers. His position has already weakened in the eyes of many supporters after a miserable run of results and performances. Keane was sacked by United after directly lambasting his teammates. Salah did not go that far but he has taken on his manager and openly criticised his decision making.Liverpoolcannot allow that to pass if Slot is to retain authority over the rest of the squad. Banishing the forward from this week’s Champions League trip to Milan to play Inter and the home game against Brighton on Saturday, when Salah floated the possibility of saying goodbye to Anfield – permanently, or just before heading off to the Africa Cup of Nations, went unsaid – seems a fair place to start.It is usually easier, and cheaper, to change an underperforming manager than an underachieving team. But given Salah’s age and marked decline in form this season, that is less of a dilemma for Liverpool. It appears inconceivable that Salah and Slot will both be Liverpool employees by the time the former’s contract expires in the summer of 2027.View image in fullscreenArne Slot looks on at Elland Road, a game Liverpool drew after being 2-0 up.Photograph: Dennis Goodwin/ProSports/ShutterstockThe club’s next move will reveal who they are backing. Hughes, Edwards and FSG will be acutely aware of Saudi Arabian interest in Salah and the probability of it ramping up in January. Liverpool were right to reject a £150m bid from Al-Ittihad for the forward in September 2023. His phenomenal contribution to last season’s title triumph alone justifies that decision. But there must be a greater temptation to cash in now, especially if the proceeds enable Liverpool to strengthen when the transfer window opens next month. Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo, signed for the south coast club by Hughes, is understood to have a £65m release clause that can be activated in the first two weeks of January.Salah’s interview was divisive – it may have been given with a move to Saudi in mind – but it has received some support because it chimes with the frustrations surrounding Liverpool’s season. The forward is correct to say he should not be singled out for their failings when so many players are struggling. The club spent almost £450m on a team that won the Premier League comfortably last season and have gone backwards. Fast.View image in fullscreenA downcast Mohamed Salah during the warm-up before the Leeds match.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesHugo Ekitiké is the only one of Liverpool’s expensive summer signings to have had a noticeable impact. Slot has spoken of his team’s problems with set pieces, low blocks, costly defensive errors and profligacy all season, and hasn’t rectified any of them. Ao Tanaka’s 96th-minute equaliser for Leeds on Saturday was the 10th goal Liverpool have conceded from a set piece in the league this season.Salah will retain hero status at Liverpool irrespective of the fallout from his interview, although an internal show of support for Slot would confirm the club believe he has gone too far. “Somehow it will end,” he said in Leeds. “But the thing in my head is why it should end this way?” Because sadly you chose to end it this way, would be one reason.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolFenway Sports GroupArne SlotanalysisShareReuse this content"

You are importing societies. No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders. At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.”Coming after months of mass arrests carried out by Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents, it seemed to foretell a fearful intensification of actions against US citizens and legal residents with origins in a startling range of foreign countries.Such fears were borne out in the following days as the presidentfocused onthe US’s Somali community, mainly based in Minnesota. He also insulted the state’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, with anoffensive slurafter he defended ethnic Somalis and one of its members of Congress,Ilhan Omar, who emigrated from Somalia.But it was the nakedly racist nature of Trump’s comments on Somalians in general that shocked.Having first attacked Somalians at Mar-a-Lago, and then again onboard Air Force One, heraised the ante in a cabinet meetingin the White House, calling Somalians and Omar herself “garbage”.“I don’t want them in our country,” he said, as Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, and the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, sat on either side of him.“We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country. Ilhan Omar is garbage, just garbage. These are people that do nothing but complain.“Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.”Shamefully, the splenetic outpouring was greeted with applause by members of Trump’s cabinet.From ‘criminals’ to ‘garbage’, Trump is ramping up anti-immigrant languageRead moreThe diatribe recalled his outburst against Mexican immigrants in 2015, who he smeared as “rapists”, “criminals” and “drug dealers” when he launched his first presidential bid.It also resembled hisdenigration of Ohio’s Haitian communityin the 2024 election campaign, when hefalsely accused themof eating pet cats and dogs.Yet with Trump now holding power, the tangible impact was much greater, according to Larry Jacobs, a political professor at the University of Minnesota.“You have Somalis who are not leaving their houses,” he said. “They don’t go to school, they’re not going to work. They expect to be kidnapped off the streets by ICE. So this is, you know, just the extraordinarily harmful, you know, actually by the president.“The main thing that stands out today is just the extraordinary harm that he’s done to a group of people who play a very significant and positive role for Minnesota.“It also hurts him. The Republican party in Minnesota has been making headway in recruiting Somalis. There are plenty of Somalis who are conservative on cultural and economic issues – and what Trump is doing is shattering that effort.”Any hopes that Trump’s sentiments would not extend beyond rhetoric has been dispelled in recent days by the actions of his closest associates and ICE agents on the ground.New Orleansbecame the latest Democratic-run cityto betargeted by ICEas the agency launched Operation Catahoula Crunch, in which Trump administration officials set a target of 5,000 arrests. That would surpass the numbers detained during a recent two-month crackdown in Chicago and match the figures arrested last summer in Los Angeles, a third of whose 10 million inhabitants are foreign-born.Local authority leaders denounced the target as unrealistic and said it could only be achieved by arresting those without criminal records.ICE agents alsoswooped on Minnesota’s twin citiesof Minneapolis and St Paul, where the homeland security departmentclaimed“the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” had been arrested.The homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem, announced a “full travel ban” on unnamed countries in a social media post that, for sheer vitriol, matched Trump.“I am recommending a full travel ban on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies,” shewrote.“Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom—not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS. WE DON’T WANT THEM. NOT ONE.”On Thursday,Noem told Fox Newsthat her travel ban would extend to 32 unspecified countries – a prohibition that would dwarf the highly controversial exclusion of ban against seven predominantly Muslim countries of Trump’s first presidency.The effect on some legal foreign residents has already been felt, including some waiting for citizenship appointments. Some green card holders have reported having had their naturalization appointments – at which they were due to become US citizens – cancelled.Writing in theNew York Times, Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said the aspects of the crackdown were illegal.Trump is using a tragic shooting to demonize millions | Mohamad BazziRead more“As the supreme courtexplainedwhen upholding Mr Trump’s first travel ban back in 2018, the president has statutory authority to suspend entry into the United States based on national origin, at least for some period of time,” she wrote. “But that does not permit him to deny visas, cancel green cards or denaturalize immigrants based on nothing more than their country of origin.”But Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman who joined the Democrats after turning against Trump, said the president was unconcerned with legal niceties and was likely to amplify his racist demagoguery if his approval ratings continue to sag, a trend that has led to the GOP suffering several recent successive election defeats.“He was always on this track. The reason it seems more extreme right now is his numbers are tanking,” said Walsh. “What triggers him is he’s not doing well, and Republicans aren’t doing well. He’s getting his butt handed to him in all these special elections. He doesn’t give a damn about those two national guard members.“What they’re going to do is get uglier and uglier and more racist to appeal to their base, to try to scare voters again.“He’s inciting violence against brown and Black immigrants in this country but I am from the right and this is the MO and their favorite go-to tactic. It’s a very scary moment.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Or, to put it another way – The War Between the Land and the Sea, the long-awaitedDoctor Whospin-off from Russell T Davies concentrating on the adventures of Unit rather than the double-hearted man from Gallifrey, is finally here.RTD stalwart Russell Tovey stars as Barclay, an everyman figure who soon – two excellent puns incoming – finds himself out of his depth, nay a fish out of water, as he is forced to take the lead in the geopolitical crisis that surrounds him. Barclay is a low-level clerk with Unit who, through the kind of bureaucratic snafu that you may in your salad days have believed was confined to fictional romps aimed largely at children over the festive period until age and experience poured slugs into them, ends up being part of the operation sent to deal with the discovery by a group of Spanish fishers of – well, fishmen. Fishfolk.These creatures, the leader of the expedition, General Austin Pierce (Colin McFarlane), explains, are Sea Devils. They inhabited the Earth long before we did but became trapped beneath its surface when the planet reformed while they hibernated. Each member of the species – renamed “homo aqua” for the duration – has a pearl embedded in its neck, the purpose of which is unknown. If this conceit strikes you as a little clunky – well, I suggest you pour yourself a shot of Bailey’s and get used to it. We are very much in mid-tier Whoniverse and setting your expectations any higher will only damage such delights as remain. OK? OK. Onward.Two set pieces full of special effects later (ground turns boggy, soldiers and fishy corpse disappear beneath, experts baffled, fishy army emerges from the sea to screech terrifyingly at Unit and rocky outcrops crop up in waterways around the world to hijack global communications), an interspecies meeting is convened to find out what these be-gilled botherers want.View image in fullscreen‘Pour yourself a shot of Bailey’s and get used to it’ … a sea devil from The War Between The Land And The Sea.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/Alistair HeapWhat they want, it turns out as their leader, Salt (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, whose uninspired character name may require another shot of Bailey’s and a small eyeroll), says, is to partake of a modern morality tale delivered with the subtlety of a great white ramming a small boat. Salt opens discussions by slamming down a parcel of her dead babies “who should have been born at the turn of the third cold current” and were not because humans have poisoned and polluted everything.Homo aqua will only continue this discussion, she says, with Barclay as the leader of the human side. Why? Because presidents, politicians, ambassadors and military leaders cannot be trusted and because he was the only one to show respect to the body of the creature killed by the fishers. Barclay wonders if she might have a point. “Maybe it is time people like me had more of a voice?” One parable at a time, please, guys! Or at least wait while we put more Bailey’s in the fridge.But Kate Lethbridge-Stewart (Jemma Redgrave), already known to Whovians as the head of Unit, is thrilled by this turn of events. She has always felt constrained by the political and bureaucratic rules that surround her. Now “we can build a better world for everyone!” Although quite how, when all she seems to do thereafter is beg him to keep reading the committee’s words off the teleprompter and not go rogue as he speaks with Salt, I am not quite sure.Meanwhile, fat cats and traitors who want to protect economies instead of ecologies are plotting in the wings, and at home Barclay’s wife is being wholly unreasonable about things Barclay has no control over. I always enjoy shows that pride themselves on progressiveness then make the nearest minor female role a thick harpy. Is that bottle chilled yet?Look, it’s fine. It’s solid entertainment for kids and I can see teenagers starting off sneering but falling under its spell soon enough. But when you have a spin-off series with such potential, when you couldn’t help but hope for something along the lines of RTD’s brilliant Years and Years for a younger demographic, it’s hard not to feel that The War Between the Land and the Sea is an opportunity wasted. They could have taken another pass at the title at least. And “Salt”. And the pearl thing. Given us a real Christmas treat, instead of relying on the season’s goodwill.The War Between the Land and the Sea aired on BBC One and is on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDoctor WhoreviewsShareReuse this content"

I figured I would book accommodation when I arrived but when I arrived, there was a big convention in town and all the backpacker hostels and budget accommodation were fully booked.Coming from Singapore, I thought perhaps I could just sleep at the airport – but quickly found Canberra airport, unlike Singapore’s, was not open 24 hours. Not knowing quite what to do and getting a bit desperate, I caught a bus into town, then started wandering towards the casino, thinking I might spend the night in a place that was open all night. That wouldn’t put me in the ideal condition for nailing an interview the next morning, but as a broke student, I couldn’t afford a pricey hotel.The kindness of strangers: I had a fear of flying – and as the plane shook and plummeted, she held my handRead moreI must have looked lost because a young woman spotted me wandering around the city and asked if I was OK. I explained my situation and without hesitation she said I could sleep on the floor of her dormitory at the Australian National University – which was perfect, as that’s where my interview was the following day. She even offered me some free dinner, one of the stuffed baguettes she had taken home from her part-time job. I had access to a hot shower and somewhere safe and secure to spend the night.In retrospect, I can appreciate what a big chance she took as a woman letting a man she’d just met sleep on her floor. Back then I was in my male privilege bubble and not even thinking about things like that. Now, as a father, I’m amazed she did that – but still very grateful.I didn’t end up attending ANU, and I never saw her again, but I’ve never forgotten her amazing act of generosity. I hope the universe has repaid her act of kindness many times over. The world needs more people like that woman.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

To donate, visitiamsanta.org.uk.I am five and having my picture taken at school.On my eye is a medical patch. That’s what they did to you in the 1980s if you had a squint. My dad cut my hair using a bowl, which is why it is such a tragedy.I had a safe and loving childhood, and that’s what I see when I look at that kid. At school, I was bullied a little bit, but it didn’t affect me because I was a happy weirdo and totally comfortable in myself. Being a dweeb fuelled my life.There’s a real misnomer that actors are extroverts, but they rarely are. I was one of those introverted extroverts; quite shy in social situations but totally singular when it came to my ambitions. I was never concerned with what anyone else was doing, which made me very driven. I would watch Cary Grant films and think: “Whatever that is, I want to do it.” Drama and singing was my only dream.My parents were scientists, but they fully signed up to help me pursue my ambition. When I was 10, I started entering competitions. I did a local singing heat and got into a national final, so my mum and dad drove me down to London, which would have been a sacrifice – it was expensive and we didn’t have much money. I sang London Is London while dressed as a pearly queen. I didn’t win, but I got to sing in a real theatre. I was so adrenalised on the way home I was pinging off the car walls.I was dedicated to being a very earnest actor, to the extent that I was probably a twatEven as a teenager, I didn’t deviate from being a dweeb. I was desperate to do well at school and always had my hand up – I was that kid that made the “Ask me, ask me” noises in class. I was in all the choirs, orchestras and plays. I had good mates but in my spare time I did drama lessons. As a result, I never really aligned with any cultural tribe. I vividly remember this black and white woollen, dogtooth coat with a velvet collar my mum made me wear as a teenager. She came from a very poor background so her daughter having a proper winter coat was very important to her sense of pride. You can’t wear dogtooth and velvet in a secondary school in Beverley, so I was immediately destroyed by the other kids. Fortunately, their mean words didn’t touch the sides.Before drama school I went to university to study history.I would have been far too green to go to Lamda straight out of the blocks, because it was overwhelming at first. A massive cringe fest. The whole point is that you throw yourself into every single exercise or performance without self-consciousness. What it’s preparing you for is the hard stuff, like improvised comedy, when none of the crew on set are laughing, and 99% of what you’re saying isn’t funny. Basically Lamda taught me to turn off the part of my brain that needs to be liked for being good. I learned: just get on with it, even if it’s humiliating.Once I left, I was dedicated to being a very earnest actor, to the extent that I was probably a twat. I took things very seriously because I cared so much about the integrity of whatever performance we were creating, and I believed everyone should put in the same level of effort. That quality probably made me a bit of a tit, whereas I am now a lot more lighthearted.That being said, when I auditioned for Motherland I was livid. I was horrible. I had reached a bit of a nadir with my career and I was in the early years of motherhood, and exhausted. What I really wanted was to be at home with my kids. As a result I was surly in the room. To my shock, I got a phone call the next day from my agent saying: “They really like you. They want to see you again.” I said: “No. Not going in again. Why do I have to go in again?”They said: “Graham Linehan [who helped develop the pilot] is a bit scared of you.”Thankfully, it turns out that’s what they wanted from my character Julia.I feel very grateful for who I was as a kid. I often look at pretty little girls and I think: ‘Life is harder for you’That job was brilliant – the writing, the cast, everything. I’m so proud of what everyone’s doing now. Diane [Morgan] has her own show, and Paul [Ready] is in it with her. Amandaland is fantastic. I do sometimes wonder, though: why is everyone else working together? I even asked Lucy [Punch] recently, “Can I come along to the Amandaland set, just for the day?” But she said no.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It was a big challenge, like a one-act play. There are still times people confuse me with my character in the show. They shout: “Pat! Pat! You’re a bitch!” Other times it’s: “You’re a cow!” I do get a break at Christmas, though. Instead, I get a lot of: “It’s Christmas Eve, Geoff!” from Motherland.When Roger died, it was difficult, because I wanted to be with my daughters all the time, but I also needed to work. We were suddenly a single-income, single-parent family and it was extremely hard. Now, when I get offered a job, I ask: “How little time can I be in makeup? Where is it and who else is going to be there?” That last one is the most important. I don’t want to be around anyone who’s a dickhead or an arsehole because I no longer have the bandwidth. Unless, of course, it’s a money job. Otherwise, there is no chance I am going to spend my time with someone who rampages around frothing on set. When it comes to method acting, it’s often men who do it. I always think: “What a luxury for you to go to work, while your wife is at home. You can come home and remain in character, and not help out with the kids.”Actor Dylan Llewellyn looks back: ‘I warned Mum that Big Boys was a bit raw. Thankfully she never commented on the glory hole scene’Read moreMy life is not my job – my life is my children. Even though it’s good to show my daughters the side of me who loves to work, I definitely have perspective. I do a lot of advocacy for vulnerable children, so I no longer imbue acting with a sense of status that isn’t appropriate. And the act of juggling motherhood, work and advocacy is never a hardship. It’s one of my skills. I shapeshift quickly; I’m practical and strong – much like that dweeb in the picture.I feel very grateful for who I was as a kid. I often look at pretty little girls and I think: “Life is harder for you.” When you don’t have beauty, you shape your life exclusively around your hobbies, your interests, your ambitions. There’s nothing else to worry about. If you are born with beauty, you have to maintain it. There’s a sense of identity connected to how you look. I have never felt like that, and I am so glad. It’s given me a release – the total freedom to do the things I love.Explore more on these topicsAnna Maxwell MartinFlashbackTelevisionFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And God forbid anyone says ‘commercial’. To them, it’s the worst thing in the world.”Kors doesn’t just sell clothing but a glamorous aspirational lifestyle that he and his brand embody. His designs have been worn by everyone from first ladies to Gwyneth Paltrow and Megan Thee Stallion. But while his Instagram feed is peppered with A-lister dinner parties, summers sailing around the Saronic islands and glossy catwalk shots, it’s the brand’s more mainstream off-shoot MICHAEL Michael Kors that is its economic moat. Stroll down any high street and you’ll spot the shiny MK logo swinging from bags slung over the shoulders of finance graduates or hanging from the elbows of women who wanted a designer bag for less than four figures.View image in fullscreenMichael Kors: ‘We all know different people of different ages and different sizes. Don’t you want them all to be invited to the party?’Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Michael KorsAlongside Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors remains just one of the last three big heritage designers to still be designing at their American namesake brands. Matthieu Blazy at Chanel may be the industry’s new hot topic but in a pub quiz its Kors’ name that is going to resonate. A 10-season stint as a judge on the TV show Project Runway means he is now recognised on the street. He has honed his look too, including aviator sunglasses and a year-round caramel tan.In the context of a noticeable return to extreme thinness in the industry – after the latest round of shows in September, industry experts expressed concern aboutsize zero coming back to the catwalks, with many crediting the widespread use of weight-loss drugs as having a normalising effect – Kors continues to cast a range of sizes. In contrast, some brands that had previously included plus-size models used exclusively straight-sized models (a UK 4-8).View image in fullscreenSuki Waterhouse in the Michael Kors 2025 fall campaign.Photograph: Michael KorsKors finds attitudes towards sizing in the industry frustrating. “Unfortunately, I think fashion people can be overly trendy. They think things are a trend rather than actually moving something forward. We all have families. We all know different people of different ages and different sizes. Don’t you want them all to be invited to the party? That’s to me how it should be.”Kors started his label in 1981 with a debut collection featuring sports-inspired pieces such as loosely tailored trousers and knitted polo shirts, laying the foundations of what would later become known in the industry as athleisure. His empire now spans watches, shoes, eyewear and fragrance.In her new photo book,The Look, the former first lady Michelle Obama – who wore a black sleeveless dress designed by Kors in her first official portrait – described how the media and public’s “fascination” with her bare arms wasused as a tool to “otherize” her.A staunch Democrat, Kors describes political dressing as “the trickiest thing in the world”. His designs are also favoured by Melania Trump, whom Kors describes as “a longtime client”. Kors says: “It doesn’t matter who you are, it’s an impossible situation to have eyes on you at every angle.” He compares it to the red carpet. “People think if they were a celebrity they could wear anything they want but they’re just as petrified walking out the door.”Capri Holdings’s increased interest in the business comes after a series of setbacks for the group, including itsfailed $8.5bn proposed mergerwith Tapestry and higher pricing missteps at Michael Kors – the result of an attempt to cushion the impact of US trade tariffs.View image in fullscreenThe new flagship Michael Kors store in Regent Street, central London.Photograph: Courtesy of Michael KorsPart of Capri’s strategy to turn Michael Kors into the next global behemoth is to focus on the sizeable mid-tier market. According to the data research company Edited, luxury prices have risen 25% since 2019. While the 1% are unfazed, the more aspirational customer, who previously would have saved up to buy a designer coat or bag once a year, have in effect been priced out. This is the customer Capri Holdings – which also owns Jimmy Choo – is now confident it can appeal to.Kors’ bags – including the Quinn tote that fits a laptop without looking like a laptop bag – hover around the £230 mark, while a new take on its bestselling Hamilton bag, carried by Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss, is £275. Rachel Morgans, the director of fashion at John Lewis, credits the brand’s “brilliant price point” as one of the reasons it has been a top seller since the retailer started stocking it in 2013.At a dinner to celebrate the London opening, Kors was flanked by the singer Suki Waterhouse and the actor Gemma Chan, but the day before he was in a Philadelphia mall meeting customers. “If you lock yourself in your atelier and you’re only surrounded by your circle of friends or your circle of employees, you’re gonna limit yourself,” Kors says. “You have got to stay curious. It’s important I know what type of thing my customers want.” Right now that is“things that delight but still function”, with a shift away from a wear-once mentality.View image in fullscreenSuki Waterhouse at the 2025 Met Gala.Photograph: John Shearer/WireImageAt 66, Kors says he doesn’t dwell on succession plans. “In fashion we are always working on the next thing. It changes so quickly. As long as I still enjoy it and I’m curious and energised then great. If not I’ll go do something else.”He isn’t nostalgic but does spend time searching for pieces from his earliest collections. “At the time I had no money so I sold everything. I spend time hunting, but a vintage dealer told me my pieces are hard to find. People don’t want to sell them. They hang on to them or pass them on.”Part of the appeal is pegged to his inclusive catwalks spanning size, age and race. “If you’re a good designer and you like people, your job should be to be a problem solver for different ages, different sizes, different heights and so on.”Explore more on these topicsFashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our in-house perfectionist tries all the fiddly bits for you …Felicity CloakeSun 7 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 09.39 ESTShareIf you’re asking what on earth chocolate has to do with a city with an average annual temperature of 28C, then you must have been stuck in the desert for the past three years. Because, since its creation in the UAE in 2022, apparently to satisfy chocolatier Sarah Hamouda’spregnancy cravingsfor pistachio and pastry, this bar has taken over the world. Though food (among those with the luxury of choice, at least) has never been immune to the absurdities of fashion, the internet has supercharged and globalised the process, so much so that pistachios, which back in January weredubbed “the new pumpkin spice”by this very newspaper, are now everywhere, from Starbucks lattes to Aldi mince pies.View image in fullscreenOnly Ravneet Gill uses dark chocolate in her Dubai bar. All inset photographs by Felicity Cloake.The thing is, however, that whatever your thoughts on green, sugary, coffee-adjacent beverages,Hamouda’s Dubai chocolatedeveloped for Fix Dessert Chocolatier has triumphed, because it really does taste as good as it looks: crunchy pastry, sweet chocolate and rich, slightly savoury nut butter are an incredibly satisfying combination, so a big bar of it is guaranteed to impress under the Christmas tree. Experience demands that I suggest you wrap it in a pet-proof box, however –emergency vet billsare no one’s idea of a great present.The pistachiosThis is the key flavouring – and, probably more importantly as far as the internet is concerned, colouring. The price of pistachioshas surgedsince Dubai chocolate went viral, with the Financial Times reporting in April that global kernel prices had risen by a third “as demand for viral cream-filled bars strains supplies”. Given they weren’t cheap to start with, this isn’t an ideal choice of gift if you’re making presents for reasons of economy; that said, it’s still better value than a scarf they’ll never wear, or some novelty gin they’ll just give to the PTA raffle.View image in fullscreenThe Kitchn’s ‘green-tinged white chocolate is the work of minutes, yet looks surprisingly impressive’.Many recipes call for pistachio cream, or crème as British supermarkets aspirationally style it, an Italian product that caters for the Italian sweet tooth. Not only are many wincingly sugary, but I’ve come across at least one that’s as little as 10% pistachio, so check the label if you’d like to save time by subbing in a ready-made paste here. Just mix it in with the pastry – you’ll need about 350g – and don’t be swayed by the colour, because most are dyed. I used one that was 45% pistachio, but it was sold behind the counter because it was £10 a jar, so you do get what you pay for in this department.Though I use it in both US websitethe Kitchnand Swiss grocery giantMigros’ recipes, I come to the conclusion that it’s both better and cheaper to make your own. However, that’s only if you have a food processor to hand –Good Housekeeping,Rama,the creator behindIndicious Kitchen, and our very ownRavneet Gillall start from scratch.Toast the nuts first, as Rama suggests – in side-by-side comparisons, my testers all remark how much nuttier hers tastes, though this may also be because she uses five times as many nuts as Gill does. That said, I do end up with a lot of leftover filling, so in reality it’s probably more like three times as many. As the pistachios are the point here, I’ve also been generous with them on the basis that there’s little point investing if you don’t use enough actually to taste them.View image in fullscreenGreen genie: skinned homemade pistacho butter (left) versus unskinned (right).Rama is also the only person to bother skinning as well as shelling her nuts, which is annoying, given that she uses so many. But it really does make a difference to the colour of the end result, which compels me to recommend you do the same. You can buy vivid green, skinned nutsonline, but at a cost, so to start with I’d advise going for the greenest nuts you can find (the ones I buy from Waitrose are greener than the smaller nuts from the Mediterranean food hall I visit in a fruitless search for skinned ones). Then, rub off as much skin as you have the patience for (I wouldn’t blanch them to loosen the skins, unless you’re also committed to drying them out properly afterwards; moisture is the enemy of crunchy pastry.) Rama whizzes her pistachios to a smooth cream, much like the one bought in a jar, while Good Housekeeping and Gill both stick with a coarser rubble of ground nuts, which I prefer – again, it’s all about keeping as much of the pistachio in there as possible, and that goes for texture as well as flavour. For the same reason, I’ve included a few roughly chopped salted nuts, too, but that’s very much not in keeping with Hamouda’s original sweet and velvety version, so feel free to leave them out,.Though Rama makes absolutely everything else from scratch, she is refreshingly unapologetic about artificially enhancing the colour of the filling. You may shy away from this (though if you’ve admired a Dubai chocolate bar that’s green, rather than beige inside, be aware it’s probably not entirely natural). But bear in mind that the first bite is with the eyes, and a few drops of dye are unlikely to be the naughtiest thing you eat thisChristmas. (Note: to make a cheaper alternative, you could use peanut butter, or indeed another nut butter of your choice, and adjust the sugar as necessary.)The creamView image in fullscreenMigros’s Dubai chocolate features homemade pistachio cream.Chopped nuts and crunchy pastry would make for a very dry mouthful indeed, which is why, even if eschewing the jarred creams, it’s imperative to add a few more ingredients to the filling. Gill and Good Housekeeping bind it with melted white chocolate, with the latter also adding double cream, an ingredient that sets off alarm bells in my head. I remember the words of Raphael Bachmann, owner of Confiserie Bachmann in Lucerne, on the Migros website: “It is important to use a high-quality [pistachio] cream containing plenty of pistachios … If the cream contains a lot of water or oil, the ‘angel hair’ will quickly become soft.” Even double cream is more water than anything else, so this is best avoided, yet white chocolate is, inevitably, very sweet. Again, the best solution comes from Rama, who uses milk powder (which gives the rich creaminess of dairy without any of the water) and icing sugar, allowing her to control the sweetness. Depending on what sort of chocolate you use, you may want to add more than I’ve suggested below, but don’t omit the pinch of salt: it’s key to bringing out the savoury flavour of the nuts.The original bar also contains tahini paste, which brings both creaminess and a bitter edge that helps to stop it tipping over into sickly territory. As this is my version, however, I’ve decided I don’t want anything to muddy the flavour or colour of the nuts I’ve just spent time peeling. So, inspired by Bachmann, who mentions using a neutral oil instead, I’ve replaced it with flavourless coconut oil:, as this is solid at room temperature, it’ll help keep the filling firm enough to slice. Up to you.The crunchKataifi, which looks like vermicelli, has a similar snappy texture to filo, but is made in strands that are perfect for soaking up syrup in dishes such asknafehandbaklava. If you have a specialist grocers nearby, they’ll probably have it in the fridge. Or you can buy it online, or even make it yourself, as Rama does – unless specifically noted otherwise, it’ll require toasting first to crisp it up. You could do this in a hot pan, as in the Kitchn’s recipe, but baking it, as Gill does, makes much more sense; not only does it cook more evenly without constant babysitting, but it can be done at the same temperature and therefore time as the pistachios. I have added butter to the baking tray, however, because, though not strictly necessary, it does taste nice.If you can’t find kataifi, Gill and Good Housekeeping both mention Shredded Wheat as a substitute, which makes sense given they’re both made from wheat and come in long thin strands. Not being a big consumer of breakfast cereal, however, it’s not until I open the packet that I realise even dry Shredded Wheat is more chewy than crunchy, which makes Bachmann’s cornflakes a better choice, despite the difference in flavour.The chocolateView image in fullscreenRama of the Indicious website tempers her chocolate before putting it in the mould.Everyone but Gill uses milk chocolate, in obedience to the original FIX bar. Oddly, though I think I’ll prefer her dark version, it does threaten to overpower the filling, so, if you go down that route, don’t go too high with the cocoa content.Only Rama tempers the chocolate – the process by which, after disrupting them with heat, you rearrange the crystals in a more orderly fashion than just allowing them to solidify haphazardly. I’ve included instructions below, though personally I wouldn’t bother, because all anyone is really interested in here is what’s inside the bar. You may consider it worthwhile. (It also has the benefit of keeping the bar firmer at room temperature, though if yours is melting in December in the UK, you’ve got the heating on too high.)It’s easier to decorate the top of the bar to disguise any imperfections; the Kitchn’s green-tinged white chocolate is the work of minutes, yet looks surprisingly impressive once set into the rest of the chocolate.The formView image in fullscreenGood Housekeeping’s take on Dubai chocolate comes in individual ball form; ‘Simple to make, even easier to eat.’Deep chocolate moulds are easily found in cookware shops and online, but if you don’t have one, or would prefer to give a box of chocolates rather than one oversized bar, Good Housekeeping have you covered with their little Dubai chocolate balls (see the end of the method, if you’re tempted by those). Simple to make, even easier to eat. Otherwise, you’ll need a 25cm x 13½cm x 2cm chocolate bar mould.Perfect Dubai chocolatePrep20 minCook1 hr(assuming you’re skinning the pistachios, which takes about 20 minutes)Set3 hr+Makes1 large bar, or 18 individual chocolates1 tbsp butter, or neutral coconut oil (optional)100g kataifi pastry, roughly chopped, or cornflakes, roughly crushed200g shelled raw pistachios20g white chocolate, chopped (optional)Green food colouring(optional)160g milk or dark chocolate2 tbsp neutral coconut oil, melted, or tahini35g milk powder20g icing sugar, or to tasteA pinch of salt20g shelled salted pistachios, peeled and roughly chopped (optional)25cm x 13½cm x 2cm chocolate bar mould(optional; see the final step if making individual filled chocolates)Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and, if using kataifi, melt the butter or oil on a shallow rimmed baking tray.Roughly chop the kataifi, toss it in the melted butter, then bake, stirring every 10 minutes so it colours evenly, for about 30 minutes, until golden.View image in fullscreenRemove and leave to cool. (If using cornflakes, simply roughly crush them into shards.)Tip the raw pistachios on to another baking tray large enough to hold them all in a single layer, and bake alongside the kataifi for about 15 minutes, until they smell toasty.View image in fullscreenRemove, leave to cool, then, to remove some of the skins, either rub them in a clean tea towel or shake vigorously in a large jar to help dislodge the papery husks, then remove by hand. (This is fiddly, time-consuming work – it took me 20 minutes – and is largely just for the colour, so feel free to skip if you can’t be bothered.) Roughly chop the nuts.View image in fullscreenIf using white chocolate, melt it in a heatproof bowl set over but not touching a pan of simmering water, then stir in a couple of drops of green food colouring, if using (be sparing, because if you add too much, the chocolate will seize).View image in fullscreenSpoon or drizzle the white chocolate mix over the base of the chocolate bar mould, then put it in the fridge to set while you melt the remaining chocolate (put the mould on a board or baking tray to keep it level).Chop the milk or dark chocolate (a bread knife is useful here). If you’re tempering it, melt 110g of the chocolate as above, to 40-45C for milk and 46-48C for dark, then stir in the remaining 50g until melted. Cool to 26C for milk and 27C for dark, then heat back to 29C (milk) or 31C (dark) before use. (Alternatively, just melt all the chocolate at once.) Tip just enough of the melted chocolate into the mould thoroughly to coat the white chocolate base, then chill for about 30 minutes until set firm.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, whizz the chopped pistachios in a food processor or blender until they’re fairly finely ground and beginning to look slightly oily and to clump together, then add the coconut oil or tahini and whizz again to combine. Add the milk powder, icing sugar and a pinch of salt and whizz again. Taste and add more sugar if you’d like it sweeter. If using salted pistachios, roughly chop them, then stir in.View image in fullscreenOnce you’re ready to fill, stir the kataifi into the pistachio mixture until well combined, then spoon into the chocolate shell and level the top, leaving a small gap around the edge; run a butter knife around the edge to help do this.View image in fullscreenRe-warm the remaining melted chocolate, then pour it all over the top. Tilt the mould to help push the melted chocolate into the sides until the filling is entirely encased in chocolate.View image in fullscreenChill for at least two hours, or until completely set, before turning out.For individual truffles, make the filling as above, then spoon small, roughly 20g balls of it on to a tray and chill for about 30 minutes, until firm, while you’re melting the milk or dark chocolate as above (depending on your generosity, you may need a little more than specified here). Dip the balls in chocolate to coat, then return to the fridge to set. Decorate with the green white chocolate once firm, or put a whole pistachio on top while the balls are still slightly tacky.View image in fullscreenDubai chocolate; is this one viral trend that’s passed you by, or have you fallen victim to its verdant charms?

The test should instead ask about soap operas and sandwichesSun 7 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 12.50 ESTShareWhat medal did Mary Peters win in the 1972 Olympics? How many Scottish ski resorts are there? Where was Florence Nightingale born? Until I got these questions as exasperated screenshots from my husband, I had no idea, like any normal Briton (it’s gold, five and Italy, apparently). They came from an app he downloaded to revise for his Life in the UK test, a prerequisite for applying for citizenship. Other recent questions have featured the divine right of kings, Hadrian’s Wall fort names and trying minor crimes in Scotland. Can the test itself possibly be this hard? We’ll soon find out: he’s taking it next week, if he doesn’t give up and go back to France instead.Much has been written about the absurdity of the Life in the UK test –it’s inaccurate, partial and sloppily worded,unfit for purpose, a “bad pub quiz” – and now it’s ruining my life (in the UK). Home is tense: my husband is tetchy because he has spent years here (he works, volunteers, pays taxes, can identify both Mitchell brothers and responds appropriately when asked “You all right?”), but now needs to prove he is assimilated by answering multiple-choice questions on the repeal of the Corn Laws. I’m mortified, partly because we’re making people pay £50 to take an absurdly hard exam – you need 75% to pass – and partly because it keeps humbling me. I’m a history graduate, but couldn’t tell you the date of the Habeas Corpus Act with a gun to my head.Other bits are even worse: my husband mentioned Britain being attached to Europe by a land bridge 10,000 years ago and I corrected him confidently, saying he “must have misread”. He had not. I also qualified as a solicitor, but apparently know nothing of judicial history. It’s causing irrevocable damage to my brand as household smartarse.It’s not fair to demand that citizenship applicants jump through hoops that would see us all faceplant in the attemptYou could argue that I’m stupid – I am, but we’re all stupid these days! New York magazine justpublished a whole issue about how much stupider we’re getting.Research in 2021suggested that two-thirds of Britons would fail the UK citizenship test and that was before TikTok and ChatGPT fully ate our brains; I bet it would be higher now. It’s not fair to demand that citizenship applicants jump through hoops that would see us all faceplant in the attempt. For my successful citizenship interview in France I was asked to identify a photo of General de Gaulle.View image in fullscreenAnne Kirkbride as Deirdre Barlow and William Roache as Ken Barlow in Coronation Street in 1987.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockMaybe applicants should have a degree of cultural understanding. Why not, I suppose. But it’s meaningless testing people on a UK they don’t actually live in: a dated, sanitised version with an unproblematic imperial legacy and an Elgar soundtrack; where there are still Welsh cakes (they come up bafflingly often) for tea and the rivers aren’t full of faeces. A revision guide chapter entitled “A modern, thriving society” is illustrated with a picture of the Mall thronged with white faces waving union jacks, for goodness sake.Workshopping a better test was a fun distraction for a while. We considered testing identification of the Greggs logo and the Strictly theme tune, “contextual swearing”, meal-deal value extraction, and soap opera modules (it’s ridiculous you need to know about 14th-century poet John Barbour but not Deirdre Barlow). I also suggested that candidates should study videos to identify the correct order of boarding in a poorly organised bus stop queue, demonstrate a working knowledge of the various usages of the word “sorry” and implement hot drink protocols in domestic and workplace settings. But then I started thinking how the delighted fetishising of our humdrum foibles is quite an unappealing national trait and depressed myself further.So I’m back to pinning lists of dates on the fridge and praying my husband passes the test, despite his fatal inability to retain any of them. Actually, he has learned one, he says: “1066, when we conquered you. So, you’re all French – you should take a life in France test.” It’s also taught him, he says, that we’re all immigrants, whether we took that land bridge I still don’t believe in, came over with the Conqueror or only arrived last week. And we’re all rewriting what life in the UK is every minute. That, at least, is cheering us up.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionMigrationImmigration and asylumCommunitiesFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Now Russia’s collapsing economy could lead to his downfallSimon TisdallThe war against Ukraine has hit ordinary Russians hard, and the deteriorating situation is likely to inflame tensionsSun 7 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 06.43 ESTSharePeople in Britain who think they are governed by fools should take a closer look at the Russian and US presidents. Vladimir Putin is systematically ruining his country. His war of choice in Ukraine is an economic, financial, geopolitical and human calamity for Russia that worsens by the day. For his own murky reasons, Donald Trump, another national menace, offered him a lifeline last week. Yet Putinspurned it. These two fools deserve each other.On the table in Moscow was a “peace” deal that, broadly speaking,rewarded Russia’s aggressionby handing over large chunks of Ukrainian land, compromised Kyiv’s independence and weakened its defences against any future attack. The Trump deal, if forced through, would have split the US and Europe; ruptured Nato, perhaps fatally; reprieved Russia’s pariah economy; and probably toppled Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government.These are key Russian war aims. But Putin, suffering from neo-imperial fantasies and legacy issues, said “no”. Hereckons he can get it all, and more, by fighting on. He has persuaded the idiot Trump that Russia’s victory is inevitable – and that scheming Europeans are the real warmongers. Yet his premise is fundamentally flawed. Hard facts confound him. Almost four years on, he’s still trapped in Donbas mud and ice. And at home, things fall apart.After two years of growth artificially fuelled by higher defence spending, Russia’s oil and gas income, representing up to 50% of state revenue,is down27% year-on-year, andrecession looms. Inflation is up, at 8%; interest rates top 16%. The budget deficit is rising, more than half of Russia’s liquid sovereign wealth fund has been squandered since 2022, state monopoliesface huge debts, foreign investment has plunged, import costs of strategic goods have risen by 122%, and consumer taxes are soaring, all to fund Putin’s war. Russians must even pay more to drown their sorrows: the price of vodka is up 5%.The pain gets steadily worse. Ukraine has identified a weak spot: Russia’s refineries, pipelines and “shadow fleet” of oil tankers carrying illicit exports. A thirdtanker was set ablazein the Black Sea last week by naval drone strikes. Kyiv is regularly hitting energy facilities deep inside Russia, causing panic and fuel shortages. Meanwhile, Russia’s two energy giants, Rosneft and Lukoil, are reeling as Asian buyers, including in China’s vital market, rush to avoidsecondary US sanctions.Putin’s economic ruination of Russia, though still a work in progress, is matched by plummeting geopolitical influence. Bogged down in Ukraine, Moscow could only watch as Syria, a prized Middle East ally, turned to the west and Iran came under US and Israeli attack. Now Venezuela, too, looks in vain for support.Ties with Chinahave been upended, with a humiliated Russia relegated to the role of dependent junior partner. Visiting India last week, Putin cut a needy figure in a country that, following US pressure,now boycotts Russian oil.The “Russia is winning” narrative hinges on supposed battlefield successes. Yuri Ushakov, one of Putin’s aides, claimed recent territorial advances “positively impacted” the Moscow talks – meaning they strengthened Russia’s hand. That’s delusional. The gains are marginal. Despite his surprise, full-scale invasion and overwhelming advantages in manpower and materiel, Putin has utterly failed to subjugate Ukraine – a failure measured inshocking Russian casualty figures: more than 280,000 killed or injured in the first eight months of 2025; about one million in total.How much longer will the Russian people tolerate their mass-murderer dictator-president – theSalisbury poisoner,the indicted war criminal – who, refusing all peace overtures, is now threatening war with Europe? This question is key. Putin’s readiness to risk the lives and wellbeing of ordinary Russians is only too evident, symbolised by the cynical signing-up fees and death benefits paid to infantry volunteers from poor rural areas – whose averagefrontline life expectancyis 12 days. Adding insult to injury,pay-outs have been slasheddue to budget cuts.Theseblood money schemesreflect deep indifference to entrenched problems of poverty and demographic collapse, independent journalist Alexey Kovalev has argued: “Military spending temporarily masks decades of neglect, providing social mobility through carnage.” When the fighting eventually stops, a “vast social crisis” could ensue, he has suggested – and the Kremlin fears it, hence its crushing of public and online dissent. For Putin, this is another reason not to end the war. Hiscrimes against his own peoplemay yet prove his undoing.A newLSE experts’ report, Against the Clock: Why Russia’s War Economy is Running Out of Time,found that while the war has “dramatically improved” the incomes of 20% of Russians, it is hugely socially divisive. “For the bulk of Russians, real incomes have fallen by 16% to 42%,” it said. Citing the 2023 Wagner uprising, it predicted deteriorating economic conditions could intensify “intra-elite and intra-regime” tensions.The latestUS negotiating fiascohas once again exposed Trump’s idiotically lopsided Ukraine “strategy”. Appeasing Russia from the start, he has undermined Ukraine by attacking Zelenskyy and halting arms supplies. Trump’s egotistic eagerness to play peacemaker and make a quick buck, choice of inept relatives and cronies as amateur envoys, and attempts to sideline and pillory Europe assist andembolden Putin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company, which operates about 3,000 shared vehicles in Britain, hasannounced plansto shutter its UK operations at the end of the month. The news comes as a bitter blow to thehundreds of thousandsof Britons who regularly rely on carsharing, and is a major setback in efforts to reduce emissions and traffic congestion.I’m particularly gutted.This year I finally learned to drive, specifically in order to become a Zipcar member for the rare occasions when I need a vehicle. As newly qualified drivers aren’t allowed to hire Zipcars until they’ve held a licence for a year, I bought a secondhand VW Beetle to tide me over, counting the days until I could flog it and sign up for Zipcar instead. Now, with the service shutting up shop, I fear I will be stuck maintaining a costly lump of steel that I need for less than 1% of the year.Growth in private car ownership is a problem. Domestic transport remains the largestsource of emissions in the UK. Expanding car clubs such as Zipcar could have helped, as research suggests each shared vehicle replaces about20 private cars.Yet Britain was already lagging behind our neighbours in car clubs. According to Invers, a carsharing tech company, Germany hasmore than six times as manyshared cars per capita as Britain. Zipcar’s departure will reduce the total number of shared cars in the UK to just one for every 30,000 people–effectively eliminating carsharing for huge swathes of the population.The impending collapse of UK carsharing should be a severe embarrassment to the government, which elsewhere is attempting to curb car dominance. The revisedNational Planning Policy Framework, for example, has an entire section dedicated to expanding sustainable transport, including carsharing, and a requirement for local authorities to “promote sustainable travel modes that limit future car use”. But what good is setting lofty policies for tomorrow without supporting the companies and services that can enable better choices today?In last week’s budget, Rachel Reeves showered the private-car sector with funding,raising subsidiesfor new electric cars to £1.95bn and topping up grants for new electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure to £500m.Reeves’ EV giveaway comes as shecoughed up£1.5bn to underwrite a loan to Jaguar Land Rover after a recent cyber-attack, andfroze fuel dutyfor yet another year. How is the chancellor finding billions to support the private car sector but offering nothing to support (massively more cost-effective) car clubs and their328,539 users?Arthur Kay, a Transport for London board member and author of the new bookRoadkill: Unveiling the True Cost of Our Toxic Relationship with Cars, fears that the Treasury has been seduced by the claims of electric car manufacturers, and is funnelling money into questionable EV rollouts that could otherwise be supporting effective schemes supporting reduced and shared car-use schemes. “The EV lobby has so effectively captured the state,” he tells me, but warns that “changing the fuel source doesn’t change all the other things that are bad about cars”.The truth is that electric cars are no panacea. They are quieter and spew fewer direct emissions than their petrol counterparts, but still produce brake, tyre and other particulates that account for a large portion of driving-based air pollution. EVs are also carbon-intensive to manufacture, and require energy from the grid to run most of the time; some EV cars only reduce the carbon emissions of drivingby 47%.Shockingly, rising private electric car ownership may also actually be fuelling more car use. In Norway94% of new cars soldare now electric thanks to astronomical public subsidies. However, a little-reported studyhas revealeda hidden dark side to the Scandinavian EV revolution. In September, researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology found greater EV ownership is driving an overall increase in car trips of 10-20%. Just asbuilding new roads increases trafficby encouraging more people to drive, so, too, flooding Norway with shiny new private EVs has prompted more Norwegians to get behind the wheel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If a peace deal includes two key elements, it should acceptSun 7 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 15.37 ESTShareThe negotiations over the war inUkraineare frustrating and tragic. On the one side, a victim of aggression whose plight is more and more desperate. On the other, a brutal aggressor, willing to go to extraordinary lengths to win the war. In the middle, a transactional American president eager for a deal.It’s no surprise that so many observers have railed against the proposals recently put forward by President Donald Trump and his emissary Steve Witkoff. These proposals appear to offer much toRussiaand little to Ukraine – other than an end to the violence. If the negotiations produce a plan that offers Ukraine no hope of security after the war, no Ukrainian leader will accept it. Security is the core of sovereignty, and it would be political suicide to trade Ukraine’s sovereignty for peace.But here is the problem: in the past, Kyiv and its partners repeatedly overestimated their leverage to end the war on favorable terms, only to find themselves confronted with further Russian gains and a weaker negotiating position months later. That Ukraine’s leaders did this under immense strain and encouraged by western promises of long-term support is tragic but does not change the reality.For many months after Russia invaded in 2022, Ukraine insisted onmaximalist demandsthat sometimes included recapturing Crimea or returning Ukraine to its 2014 borders. These demands were unrealistic, and focusing on them ruled out more modest proposals at a time when Russia was still at risk of battlefield reversals and might have considered alternatives – as it appeared to do briefly atIstanbulin April 2022.The following summer, as Russia’s invasion inched forward, a degree of realism set in. Maximalist objectives were moderated, but Kyiv and many of its partnersinsistedUkraine join Nato – a demand that Russia clearly would not accept. Another year was lost. Ukraine’s position weakened further.More recently, Russia has pulverized its way even deeper into the Donbass, turning the land into a moonscape of mines, bombed-out apartment blocks, and trees cut in half by artillery. Yet many of Ukraine’s backers insist Kyiv not cede this wasteland, even though battlefield trends over the last several months suggest Ukraine is very likely to lose it anyway.Meanwhile military and political winds continue to blow in Ukraine’s face. Corruption scandals havereached the inner circleof the president himself, weakening him domestically and with Ukraine’s foreign backers. Although engaged right now, the United States under Trump may well disengage. Russia remains stable, militarily capable and retains the backing of China and other allies – despite the economic strain it faces from sanctions and massive battlefield losses.Russia will move the goalposts again. It will insist on no security guarantee at all. It may even demand its own political allies be installed in KyivThe upshot is this: if what emerges from the current negotiations offers Ukraine a military capability and security guarantee – even a weak one – Ukraine should accept it. This is a bitter pill, but it could be Ukraine’s last chance to end the war with sovereignty intact.If history holds, however, Ukraine may not. Then it will find itself in an even weaker position next year. Russia will move the goalposts again. It will insist on no security guarantee at all. It may even demand its own political allies be installed in Kyiv.Ukraine will then no longer be negotiating to retain its sovereignty; it will be negotiating the details of its return to vassal status under Russia.Morally and practically, Ukraine and its leaders are the only ones who can choose whether to agree to a settlement or continue the battle. Their costs are deeply sunk into this war – especially for the military, which is almost certain to resist any compromise, further straining Ukraine’s delicate civil-military balance.But if Kyiv rejects an offer of peace, negotiated by Trump, there should be no illusions about what this will mean for further support from the United States – a likely end to vital intelligence sharing and the US weapons that now flow throughEuropeto Ukraine.Unfortunately, the war has created perverse incentives for some of Ukraine’s partners, who may see continued fighting as their own best option – not because it’s best for Ukraine, but because it keeps the Russian army off their backs and gives them time to develop the military capabilities they need to deter a Russian onslaught in the future.But this logic is wrongheaded. Europeans have more time than they realize to protect themselves against Russia, which will needyears to reconstituteits military capabilities to be a serious threat to Nato.Throughout the war, Ukraine has faced a Hobson’s choice between bad and worse options. Again and again, Ukraine and its partners have tried to escape this by doubling down on rhetoric and hope. Selling hard compromises to a nation whose suffering has gained the sympathy of millions around the world will be a huge challenge. But the geopolitical odds are stacked against Ukraine. Hoping reality away will not solve its problems or give its citizens – or Europe’s – the peace and prosperity they have been fighting for.Christopher S Chivvis is a senior fellow and director of the American statecraft program at the Carnegie Endowment for International PeaceExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionEuropeRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

For clients looking to get sober, reflecting on what a sober Christmas might look like, and whether it’s even possible to achieve, is important.One client, Peter*, was planning to host 20 relatives for Christmas. Traditionally his family drink from breakfast until bedtime on Christmas Day. Peter was feeling anxious about what they might say if he stuck to soft drinks. He feared being pressed to have alcohol or becoming the butt of everyone’s jokes. Even worse, he dreaded feeling left out of the fun and spending Christmas Day feeling ashamed and sorry for himself.Peter’s concerns are common. But people who struggle with alcohol, contrary to expectations, usually find Christmas far more enjoyable if they stay sober. That’s because a hallmark of alcoholism is its unpredictability: there are no guarantees of what consequences may follow a drink. Not usually a recipe for a merry Christmas.But with some careful thought and planning, anyone should be able to enjoy Christmas in a way that works really well.Peter and I began by examining the gap between his fantasy of how Christmas should be celebrated and the reality of his actual Christmas celebrations in years past.Homesickness is a form of loss which may never grant closure. But a heart in two places can still find joy | Gaynor ParkinRead morePart of Peter’s fantasy was that everyone in his family would get along well and have fun together on Christmas Day. The reality, however, was that his family invariably pick fights with each other, especially a few drinks in, and find fault with his cooking, his home and the way he is raising his young kids.Peter also fantasised that he would be able to buy all the presents, pay for all the extra food and not lose sleep over spending money he couldn’t afford. But in reality, he usually ends up in debt by January, and this causes him a lot of stress and worry.Most importantly, Peter dreams he will be able to drink a glass or two of champagne and have one beer with lunch. In reality, he keeps on drinking until his wife is annoyed with him and he has grown angry enough to let off steam by telling one of his relatives what he really thinks of them. This embarrasses his children, who enjoy spending time with their cousins.Peter and I began to focus on what a relaxing and special Christmas could be, if it was tailor-made just for him. It turned out that this featured neither his relatives nor alcohol. For him, it was a simple picnic with his wife and his kids by the water, accompanied by one gift each that would be really special to the person who received it, a film and an early night. For Peter, this plan felt manageable and promised a sense of closeness and back-to-basics values that really mean something to him.Peter has since bravely called his relatives and told them that he will not be hosting them after all.He was anxious about prioritising himself and what he needed to do to stay sober. He was used to acting in a way he thought would please everyone else. But Peter was pleasantly surprised. His brother confided in him that he too dislikes the pressure of big family get-togethers and was glad of the chance to do something different. He even expressed his support for Peter trying to get sober, and they quietly wondered which other family members could maybe benefit from doing the same.Christmas can be difficult. Not because of a lack of alcohol, but because of the relationship dynamics involved in bringing it all together. If you’ve decided that drinking isn’t for you this year, then keeping things real may help keep you sober.*Name and some other details have been changed to protect client confidentialityDr Antonia Saunokonokois a psychotherapist from Sydney specialising in addiction and complex traumaExplore more on these topicsAlcoholismThe modern mindMental healthChristmasFamilyAlcoholPsychologycommentShareReuse this content"

Holding assets of £4.9bn between them, the UK’s credit unions serve about 2 million members.Their UScounterparts have more than 143 million.The FCA’snew report, which Rathi was in Rochdale to launch, included a series of recommendations aimed at encouraging credit unions to expand, and to offer more services.The Treasury has already promised to review the “common bond” – the legal promise that governs each credit union, for example specifying the area it serves – to allow these to adapt more easily to changing circumstances. Ministers have also set aside £30m to fund modernisation – updating credit unions’ IT systems, for example.Yet campaigners for fairer lending fret that cash-strapped customers will continue to be left at the mercy of loan sharks unless mainstream banks are forced to do more.The need is certainly there. Visiting an employability project on a housing estate in Stockton this week, it was depressing to hear about residents resorting to loan sharks, often unaware of the cheaper and less unpleasant alternative of a local credit union.I need £2,000 now! How to find the money for an unexpected disasterRead moreThat chimed with evidence from a recent roundtable discussion organised in Glasgow by campaign group the Finance Innovation Lab, where low-income borrowers recounted their experiences to local MPs.“When there’s an unexpected cost like that you just need to get it sorted, but you’re left with no good options,” one woman said, citing a broken bed as an example of the kind of expense that can drive consumers into paying extortionate interest rates to unscrupulous lenders.Recent research by Fair4All Finance, the government-backed, not-for-profit organisation that promotes financial inclusion, found that 1.9 million adults in Britain had turned to unlicensed money lenders or loan sharks in the past year.Dr Paul A Jones of Liverpool John Moores University is an expert on the credit union movement. He is optimistic about its future, and argues that some of the impetus for growth must come from within the sector itself.“We need more credit unions of a significant size. We need more credit unions to get in the fast lane,” he says. “If you don’t want to, and you want to carry on in your village hall with 1,000 members, no problem, but that’s not where growth is going to come from.”He welcomes some of the changes promised by the government – but warns that the constraint on many credit unions is lack of capital. “External investment is going to be important,” he says.That’s where the Finance Innovation Lab and a coalition of other charities and lenders argue that legislation is needed, to force the powerful high street banks to play their part.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it included no specific targets, and made few firm demands of the finance sector.There was backing for a “small sum lending pilot”, led by Fair4All Finance, “to help expand access to affordable credit in England”. But the scale of the pilot was not specified – and it was unclear how it would differ from existing mutual lenders that already make small loans.Campaigners including the actor Michael Sheen, who made a TV documentary on the exorbitant cost of debt for low-paid consumers in his home town of Port Talbot, argue for a much more muscular approach of a “FairBankingAct”.This would be a new law, modelled on the US Community Reinvestment Act, which has been in force for almost 50 years. Under the US version, banks are ranked by regulators according to how well their services reach underserved communities – and obliged to publish strategies to show how they will improve.In many cases this then involves working with credit unions, or community development financial institutions (CDFIs) – another form of non-profit lender – hugely expanding the amount of capital these institutions have available to back new lending.The coalition promoting the idea, which includes the Finance Innovation Lab alongside a string of mutual lenders and other campaign groups,argues that if such an act were implementedin the UK, it could lead to lending by credit unions and CDFIs to jump from £250m today to up to £3bn a year.The proposal is backed among others by the Co-operative party,whose members include 41 Labour MPs, including the Treasury minister James Murray and the Treasury select committee chair, Meg Hillier.It is a stretch to imagine the government slapping a Fair Banking Act on an industry that Rachel Reeves has calledthe “crown jewel in our economy”, but with the sector’s power should come responsibility.The banksescaped the windfall taxthat many on the left had hoped to see in the budget, and which the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) argued could raise £8bn a year. It does not seem too much to ask that, in return, they put a fraction of that sum behind supporting the local, mutual lenders that help to keep the loan sharks at bay.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyEconomics viewpointCredit unionsEconomicsFinancial Conduct AuthorityFinancial sectorBankingRegulatorscommentShareReuse this content"

But I do love Meghan’s Christmas specialPolly HudsonThe Duchess of Sussex is back and suddenly her show makes sense. It is cringingly ultra-extra, of course, but isn’t that what Christmas is all about?Sun 7 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 03.39 ESTShareNo matter the time of year, ’tis always open season on the Duchess of Sussex’s televisual offering,With Love, Meghan. Critics, professional and armchair, have rarely been so united as when gleefully ripping series one and two of the lifestyle show to shreds. The consensus was that there has never been a greater royal outrage than when she took some pretzels out of a labelled bag, put them in a different bag, then labelled it. And she didn’t even attempt to explain herself to Emily Maitlis afterwards.Now, like a merry renegade master, she is back once again with a “Holiday Celebration” (aka a Christmas special). But this time, it’s different. There are still the usual elements we’ve come to expect – psychobabble word salads, extreme hosting – but in the context of a yuletide episode, suddenly it all makes sense. The pieces have fallen into place; it’s a perfect snow storm.By this point, Meghan is like the eccentric aunt at most festive family gatherings – offering unsolicited, unnecessary advice, and supplying the odd random outburst. (“I love spinach!” … “A tradition has to have a beginning.” … “A tree is part of my memory and love of the holiday season.”) She’s a bit of a character, but her presence is familiar and oddly reassuring. And she seems happy enough; she’s not doing any harm.She knows her every micro expression, syllable and glance will be dissected and criticised, but still appears carefreeMaybe this is the first occasion in history where that old chestnut that mums used to offer up when somebody was being mean to their little darling – “Ignore them, they’re just jealous” – might be true. Because, you know what? Everything in Meghan’s Holiday Celebrationislovely. Yes, it’s all cringily ultra-extra, nonsense and over the top – but isn’t that exactly what Christmas is about? And the talk she’s talking might be ridiculous, but the walk she’s walking genuinely looks shop-bought.Whatever she turns her beautifully manicured, diamond-adorned hand to, she pulls off with style. Her cooking is delicious, the wreath she makes is stunning, her presents are almost too pretty to unwrap. Nothing is average or aesthetically displeasing – even the way she ties her apron is artful and chic. She doesn’t bung a dish in the microwave, it “takes a twirl”, and she folds wrapping paper like an origami guru (quick tip: make your wax seals in advance!). She also seems to be thoroughly enjoying herself throughout. How could any hate-watcher not be won over, filled with seasonal cheer and left with a deep longing for handmade crackers filled with thoughtful items selected just for them or a crudites platter where broccoli is arranged in the shape of a wreath?Meghan used to pretend for a living, of course, but even so, after the level of scrutiny she has endured since she started dating Prince Harry, the love child of Meryl Streep and Judi Dench would struggle to act this naturally. She knows her every micro expression, syllable and glance will be dissected and criticised, but she still manages to appear relaxed and carefree. Too blessed to be stressed.With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration review – take anti-nausea pills, she’s back!Read moreHer refusal to change or even tone down her shtick, despite it being so relentlessly, globally mocked, is weirdly comforting. In our uncertain world, here is something we can count on: Meghan will be like this, come what may. We will always know where we are with her.If you’re still not buying what she’s selling, a reminder that will surely come as a relief: you don’t have to. There isn’t national service in this country any more, and if there were, it would be unlikely to include watching With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration, especially post-Megxit. If, however, you willingly check it out and are overcome with envy about her picture-perfect Christmas, all is not lost either. Whether you’re a duchess or a data administrator, no kid truly appreciates the effort and hard work their mum does in December. So you can console yourself by imagining Archie and Lilibet’s faces when they open the calligraphy note that says, ‘I love you because you are brave,’ from their homemade Advent calendar, instead of a chocolate.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Israeli military operations continue to displace hundreds of families in Gaza. Aid has increased but Israel isstill blockingvital supplies. Palestinians desperately require security, humanitarian relief and reconstruction. But they need and expect a political horizon too. Donald Trump’s plans make only thevaguest and most conditional referenceto a Palestinian state, and Israelis – as well as their ultra-right government – have entrenched their opposition since the atrocities of 7 October 2023. Yet after two years of annihilation, Palestinian nationhood has won international support that many thought unimaginable.The political fate of Palestinians is bound to the personal fate of Marwan Barghouti. After more than two decades in an Israeli jail for murder, the charismatic 66-year-old is by far the most popular Palestinian leader, widely regarded as the only figure capable of uniting factions riven by ideology and enmity. Though a member of Fatah, Mr Barghouti has criticised abuses by the Palestinian Authority and has won respect within Hamas ranks. He has led Palestinian prisoners, while the PA’s old guard are seen as self-serving, ineffective, unaccountable and essentially as security contractors forIsraelin the West Bank.The belief that Mr Barghouti can galvanise Palestinian politics, creating the momentum for statehood and lasting peace, lies behind the new international campaign for his release,backed by figuresincluding Paul Simon, Delia Smith, Richard Branson and Margaret Atwood, and the former world leaders known asthe Elders. Critically, some from the Israeli security and political establishment agree.Mr Barghouti has long supported the two-state solution, repeatedly engaged with Israeli officials and taught himself Hebrew. His convictions – in a trial criticised as flawed by legal experts – are for ordering attacks that killed civilians during the second intifada. Gulf states pushed for him to be among the prisoners released in the ceasefire deal; Israel vetoed it. Yet murderers were freed. As one former military officialobserved recently: “Israel is willing to release people who did really bad things, but … it has no interest to release symbols.”For Palestinians, Mr Barghouti – called by some their Mandela – stands for a path towards their inalienable rights. Many leaders, including in Israel itself, have moved from armed struggle to statesmanship. Israel has long complained that it has no real partner for peace. ButBenjamin Netanyahuand his partners do not fear that the Israeli state could never come to terms with a man such as Mr Barghouti – they fear that it could. To free him would indicate that they could contemplate nationhood for Palestinians, which they will not tolerate as even a distant prospect. He will not be released without external pressure.Conditions for Palestinian prisoners have worsened dramatically since 2023. Video this summer showed the far-right minister of security, Itamar Ben-Gvir,taunting and threateninga gaunt, almost unrecognisable Mr Barghouti. His family say he has beenseverely beaten by guards. There is concern that the government will approve a draft lawintroducing a mandatory death penaltyfor terrorism. The case for Mr Barghouti’s release is pressing. Some weeks ago the US president indicated that hemight consider raisingit. He should urge Israel to free Mr Barghouti, in the interests of the peace which he claims to be building in the Middle East.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One morning you awake to find new aches, or lapses in strength and memory that you could swear were not present just a few days prior. We do not literally age overnight, but as research is increasingly showing, we may not do so in a steady, linear path either.Over the past decade a multitude of studies have suggested that ageing – at least for certain organs and bodily systems – may actually consist of long periods of stability, punctuated by inflection points or periods of rapid biological change. This shift in thinking has raised hopes for anti-ageing medicines. But it could also make us rethink our attitude to ageing in general, viewing it as a dynamic and varied journey – rather than simply a slow march of attrition and breakdown.Thelatest studybolstering this view, published in Nature Communications, used a large number of brain scans to show that the structure and interconnectivity of the brain can be separated into five distinct eras, marked by turning points at nine, 32, 66 and 83. Of particular interest in this study is the identification of a very long “adolescent” phase from age nine to 32 in which brain connections appear to become stronger and more efficient – a period that extends well into what we traditionally consider a static “adulthood”.Other recent studies looking at a variety of bodily structures have proposed a rapid period of ageing in many organs ataround age 50; specific changes in metabolism and other systemsaround age 44 and 60; or thatthe skin as an organ goes throughfour distinct ageing phases, while the adult immune systemages in two phases.These results are largely the fruits of the so-called “omics” revolution in research, with the generation of large datasets allowing the cheap and rapid measurement of an organ or body’s entire complement of proteins, DNA/RNA, or other molecules. (Of similar importance is an explosion in funding and interest for ageing research, likely a byproduct of our increasingly elderly society.)At this stage many of the studies are underpowered – the widely covered Stanford study showing shifts at 44 and 60 had only 108 participants – and so specific claims they offer about a certain organ ageing at a certain time may not hold. But taken together they suggest that as far as our bodies are concerned, ageing is not a linear process.If ageing is more acute than previously thought, it would seem ripe for simple interventions that could untip the tipping points, or leave checkpoints between eras unpassed. There is currently no shortage of tech mogulswilling to trywhateverscientific-ish treatmentscan be spun off from this preliminary research. Let them chance it. That sort of medical whack-a-mole is likely to be ineffective at best.A bigger question is whether we even should prioritise interventions against ageing as such. The authors of the brain stage study were careful to not frame the transitions only in terms of decline, suggesting that each stage was simply a different phase in the journey of a human brain. This seems correct. As we head towards a more granular understanding of ageing, we may be able to better time and apply the anti-disease measures we already know about, from cancer tests to preventive medications. Prioritising wellness over raw longevity is the way to go – and if a longer life is the result, so be it.Explore more on these topicsAgeingOpinionBiologyNeuroscienceeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromVicky MillsandKit JacksonSun 7 Dec 2025 11.44 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 15.12 ESTShareJonathan Liew’s article (Won’t somebody please think of Britain’s poor £2m homeowners? Oh, wait – everyone already is, 2 November) entirely misses the point that underlies the spate of criticism against the “mansion tax”. While wealth disparity is no doubt an issue that needs to be addressed, this tax is a spiteful assault on hard-working taxpayers who already pay an enormous proportion of their salary to the Treasury to support a woefully mismanaged public sector and welfare state. Those who support the tax seem to be driven by a simple ideology that we need to “bash the rich” to create equality.In the real world, this tax penalises hard-working families who have made difficult choices and made huge sacrifices to get to where they are. I come from a working-class background, I worked hard at school and achieved good grades, I worked part-time jobs, paid my own way through university and chose a profession that pays well, relocating to London and making sacrifices to earn good money – spending 18 hours a day in the office – and I chose to buy property and invest in it. I did not enjoy annual holidays or a defined-benefit pension that others enjoy.These are all choices that I have made in the hope that the hard work and sacrifices will pay off, and that my family and I can enjoy the fruit of my labour. The principles of hard work, self-sacrifice and aspiration should be rewarded. We are biting the hand of middle England that feeds this bloated country.Robert ApplefordSevenoaks, KentJonathan Liew’s article is a brilliantly witty and accurate depiction of the skewed nature of current public discourse on wealth and fairness in this country. Maybe it’s nothing new, but the reaction to the so-called mansion tax that Jonathan describes seems indicative of an increasing lack of any sense of privilege among the most privileged in our society.My wife and I own our home (worth £250,000), though with a substantial mortgage. Our annual household income is around £70,000, which has to cover the aforementioned mortgage as well as the cost of raising three young children. I don’t always feel lucky (I mainly just feel tired), but I know that in the grand scheme of things, I am incredibly lucky and privileged. I try to remind myself of this fact whenever I’m tempted to complain or whine about something.I (maybe naively) assumed that most people in similar or more privileged circumstances shared this sentiment, but am increasingly worried that it might be becoming a more and more rare perspective.Tom HoldenOtley, West YorkshireThe people complaining about being subject to the mansion tax have no recognition of how privileged they are to be able to afford to buy property outright, never mind a property of that value. I wonder how they would feel to be in my shoes. I have a supposedly affordable shared-ownership flat. The balancing charges for the last three years have amounted to almost £10,000 on top of the monthly fee. A £2,500 tax seems reasonable by comparison. I would love to own a house outright so I don’t have to be subject those charges, but that is not going to happen on my income. Some people really do have a tin ear.Vicky MillsWinchesterI loved Jonathan Liew’s piece about the rich whingeing about a small bit of tax. It reminded me of the billionaire bankers and hedge fund managers whingeing about a bit of corporation tax. Meanwhile, children starve. Men and women live in tents in the park. The problem is that the rich honestly think they deserve their wealth while the poor deserve their poverty. Otherwise how could they live with themselves?

Why not become a nun?, 1 December). It is always refreshing to see nuns and religious sisters portrayed in a context other than the horror-movie stereotype we seem to have inherited.I was intrigued by her mention of Convent Wisdom: How Sixteenth-Century Nuns Could Save Your Twenty-First-Century Life by Ana Garriga and Carmen Urbita. I look forward to reading it and I may well recommend it in our Franciscan newsletter.Emma is absolutely right that there has been a renewed interest among younger women in religious life. I have been a Franciscan sister for two years. While some women are called to the cloistered, contemplative life, many of us belong to active orders. Our work is practical and rooted in service to the poor. In my own ministry, I divide my time between soup kitchens, homeless shelters, emergency food and housing programmes, and – drawing on my background in healthcare – providing medical support to people living on the streets.For me, this vocation offers the best of both worlds. I live in a community of women and participate in our daily offices of prayer, yet I also live and work in central London, very much immersed in the life of the city.Not everyone called to religious life flourishes behind monastery walls. Fortunately, there are many forms of religious life – contemplative cloistered orders, mixed contemplative/active communities, apostolic and fully active orders – each offering a distinct way to live out one’s calling.It has become increasingly common for people to be unsure of what a nun actually is, and with the abundance of cinematic nuns (few of them flattering) – and the unfortunate legacy of some deeply troubled individuals in our history – it’s heartening to encounter writing that treats us with curiosity and wit.Sister Sophia RoseCommunity of St Francis, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

These aren’t just socioeconomic – they have a huge impact on our health, wellbeing and how long we live.This harsh truth is nowhere clearer than in my constituency, Leeds Central and Headingley, which has thewidest life expectancy gapin England based on data from Health Equals. Residents in the Hyde Park area are expected to live a shocking 14 years less than those in neighbouring Far Headingley and Weetwood. A half-hour walk takes you from one area to the other – equating to more than a decade of life lost.Child povertyandfuel povertyplay a big role in the divide between these two parts of Leeds, but other factors will be at play too. Our health is shaped by the air we breathe, the homes we live in, the work we do, the money in our pockets – and these building blocks don’t stack up for everyone. The 10-year health plan has set clear targets for the NHS, but health isn’t just about access to services. All aspects of policy can shape health and that’s why a cross-government health inequality strategy is vital. It must prioritise prevention, set ambitious targets and make better health a shared goal for every part of government.By taking action to make health equal, thisLabourgovernment could stop lives in constituencies like mine being needlessly cut short.Alex SobelMP for Leeds Central and Headingley, and parliamentary champion of Health EqualsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The 33-year-old also claimed he no longer has a relationship with Slot, who omitted the forward from his starting lineup for a third game in succession.Self-indulgent Mohamed Salah betrays teammates and hastens end of Liverpool era | Andy HunterRead moreThe Egypt forward has 19 months remaining on the £400,000-a-week contract he signed in April but is likely to be the subject of renewed interest from the Saudi Pro League when the transfer window reopens next month. Al-Ittihad, who failed in a £150m move for Salah in September 2023, and Al-Hilal are both believed to be keen on signing the third highest goalscorer in Liverpool’s history.Salah’s immediate future is also unclear. The forward reported for training on Sunday as scheduled. Members of the Liverpool hierarchy are understood to have discussed the situation but did not wish to inflame matters with a public response. Slot now has to decide whether to include the disillusioned player in his plans for Inter.Liverpool will train at their AXA base in Kirkby on Monday morning, with the first 15 minutes open to the media. The squad will fly to Italy in the afternoon before Slot faces questions for the first time on Salah’s claims at a press conference at San Siro.Salah, who received a message of support from the Egyptian Football Association on social media on Sunday, suggested in his interview at Elland Road that he may have played his final game for Liverpool. He is due to report for Africa Cup of Nations duty next Monday, 48 hours after Liverpool host Brighton at Anfield, but it is uncertain whether he will be involved in the club’s next two matches.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

After enduring two defeats againstCrystal Palacehere in the space of five weeks earlier in the year, the Fulham manager could only watch in horror as Marc Guéhi’s late header sealed another victory that moved Palace into the top four.Glasner has made no secret of his dissatisfaction with Palace’s transfer business in the summer, having beatenFulhamon their way to winning the FA Cup, and he was without the influential Daniel Muñoz for their latest trip to west London. But the Austrian has proven during his 18 months at the helm that he has a habit of finding a way to win and this was a typically shrewd performance from his well-drilled side.Fulham 1-2 Crystal Palace: Premier League – live reactionRead moreThey weathered the Fulham storm after Harry Wilson’s wonder goal had cancelled out Eddie Nketiah’s opener on his firstPremier Leaguestart of the campaign. It was left to Guéhi, who is likely to leave south London at the end of the season when his contract expires, to seal the victory that will have Palace’s supporters dreaming of what else might be possible under their remarkable manager if he is backed in the January transfer window.“I have to ask if they get the bonus if we are fourth in December. I don’t think so,” joked Glasner, whose side face Shelbourne in their latest Conference League fixture on Thursday night before meeting Manchester City at Selhurst Park on Sunday. “Of course it’s nice. But for me, it felt in recent weeks that we were getting a little bit of fatigue at the end of the games due to our schedule. And today I felt it was the opposite.”This was Palace’s 24th match of the season and their first time without Muñoz, after the Colombia defender was ruled out by a knee problem that Palace have been managing for a few weeks, Glasner revealed afterwards. But while the 34-year-old former England defender Nathaniel Clyne did not provide the same attacking threat as the marauding Colombian usually does, Silva was frustrated that his side struggled to find a way through the visitors’ defence after Wilson’s brilliant equaliser.“These are the type of games that if you can’t win, then you can’t lose,” the Fulham manager said. “We have to be more resilient in crucial periods of the game.”Had it not been for Guéhi’s block to deny Emile Smith Rowe from Alex Iwobi’s clever corner then Fulham would have taken an early lead. But Palace stood firm against the early pressure and they began to pick holes in the home defence. The imperious Adam Wharton was the architect of the opening goal when he picked out Tyrick Mitchell on the left before the England midfielder eventually played in Nketiah, whose crisp finish left Bernd Leno flailing at thin air.View image in fullscreenHarry Wilson’s stunning finish brings Fulham’s level before half-time.Photograph: John Walton/PAThe Croydon-born Smith Rowe, who was wanted by Palace last year but joined Fulham instead from Arsenal, could not believe his eyes when Dean Henderson somehow kept out his rasping drive from Sander Berge’s through ball. Fulham continued to look dangerous, although Clyne had the next big chance when he found himself bearing down on goal but could produce only an air shot.There was no doubting the quality of Fulham’s equaliser. Wilson, who scored another goal of the season contenderagainst Tottenham last weekend, and Raúl Jiménez were on exactly the same wavelength when the Wales forward beat Maxence Lacroix to the ball. They played a one-two on the edge of Palace’s box before Wilson unleashed a sumptuous finish using the outside of his left boot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fulham thought they had taken the lead through Smith Rowe after Calvin Bassey had struck a post with a header, only for celebrations to be cut short when Samuel Chukwueze was found to have been offside in the buildup. “He has to be careful because even a fingernail can be offside these days,” Silva said.It was a rare occasion when they managed to penetrate Palace’s defence. For all their pretty buildup play, Fulham are lacking incisiveness this season, and Silva will be concerned that could end up with them being dragged into a relegation battle.Concerns over Palace’s heavy workload in a December that will feature eight matches prompted Glasner to withdraw Mateta midway though the second half. Silva threw on Kevin, the club‑record signing, in the hope of finding the breakthrough. But it was Palace who took all three points when Guéhi beat Kenny Tete to a near-post corner and celebrated with the away fans behind the goal.“I can’t lie, it’s tough,” the England defender said when he was asked about Palace’s hectic schedule. “We’ve got to recover and go again – we’ve got no choice.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Seeing the strip, what catches the eye first, though, is the fluorescent, neon green socks. You cannot fail to notice them and that is now also true of Manchester City in this season’s Women’s Super League title race; a team that quietly went under the radar initially, scarcely being spoken about as contenders, are now unmissable as they keep on winning, shining bright with a six-point lead at the top of the table.Their latest victory, their ninth in a row in the league, not unlike the climate their kit honours, was not always particularly pretty. They spent well over an hour being frustrated by a Leicester side who were content to keep 11 players behind the ball with a deep, well-organised back five, but this is the sort of game, on a wet lunchtime in the East Midlands, when teams who go on to win titles manage to find a way through. Eventually, Manchester City did so, and then some, with two goals and an assist from Khadija Shaw delivering a 3-0 victory that more closely reflected their control of the contest than the 0-0 scoreline on the 73-minute mark had suggested. The visitors had 75.5% of the possession and 30 shots at goal compared to Leicester’s two.WSL roundup: Everton end Chelsea’s record-breaking unbeaten runRead moreIt is the first time the club have won nine of their opening 10 games of a season, and will build belief among their fanbase that in 2026 – a full decade on from their sole title triumph – they may finally be able to wrestle back the WSL trophy. Watching them on Sunday, some of the key reasons why they are enjoying such good form were clear. They have whipped more crosses into the box from open play – 130 times in their previous nine WSL games this term – than any other side and this tactic continued against Leicester. So much so that Shaw could have scored at least a hat-trick of first-half goals, from crosses delivered by their dangerous wingers Lauren Hemp, Aoba Fujino, and a hanging ball from the left-back Leila Ouahabi that the striker headed over. Balls into the box – simple, but very effective.They have also scored the highest number of goals from corners in the WSL and they got another at the King Power Stadium, as Shaw nodded in at the back post moments after Kerolin was bizarrely denied a penalty. By then, Shaw had already clinically opened the scoring with a low finish after a swivel in the box. Kerolin, whose 69th-minute arrival as a substitute injected pace and direct running into the game, was electric and she raced on to a Shaw pass and slotted into the corner to complete the 3-0 win.View image in fullscreenKerolin completes Manchester City’s ninth win in a row with their third goal.Photograph: Molly Darlington/WSL/WSL Football/Getty Images“I pride myself with what I do in front of goal,” said Shaw, the WSL’s leading scorer with eight goals. “The quality I have around me does shine through – even if I miss a chance, I know another one is coming after that.”Her manager was singing Shaw’s praises, with Andrée Jeglertz saying: “She could probably have scored a couple more goals, but she never loses the trust. She is still working hard, she’s doing the runs into the box and she’s doing everything for the team anyway, so I’m so happy for her, she also deserves it. She’s never dropping in performance, which can easily happen for a goalscorer.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The marauding runs of Ouahabi and Kerstin Casparij from the full-back positions and the stylish, technical prowess of Yui Hasegawa in the middle is helping them thrive, along with the ever-improving Laura Blindkilde Brown in the holding midfield position. Then they have the strength on the bench to bring on an England player such as Grace Clinton, who helped up the tempo in the final 25 minutes. For a team that finished 16 points behind Chelsea last term, they appear reborn. In fact, there were seven different players in the starting side compared with the team that won on this ground in April last season.The Leicester manager, Rick Passmoor, who was proud of how his team adhered to their gameplan for the first 70 minutes, said of the league leaders: “That cutting edge that they’ve got really came to the fore in the last 15 minutes and they were ruthless. I think they’ll only get better.”That may well be true. Tricky obstacles lie in wait in the second half of the season – not least March’s Asian Cup, when Hasegawa, Fujino and the goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita will all be absent with Japan – but, with no European football to juggle, this could well be City’s year, domestically.PosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women1017272Chelsea Women1010213Man Utd Women1011204Arsenal Women1011195Tottenham Hotspur Women100196London City Lionesses10-6157Brighton & Hove Albion Women104148Aston Villa Women9-2109Everton Women10-6810Leicester Women10-14611West Ham Women10-15412Liverpool FC Women9-102Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenLeicester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But if you can’t put it down to skill then you start to wonder, what is it? Do we need to start thinking about what mentality we’re taking into those pressure moments?“Because when we’re on top we’re great, but when the game is neck and neck we’re not coming out on top on enough occasions to be able to challenge Australia. There is a saying that we have said a lot here, that Australia is not for weak men. A dressing room that I am captain of isn’t a place for weak men either.”Stokes suggested England were receiving a taste of their own medicine at Australia’s hands, and that they had not been able to cope with it. “The mental side of this game is tough,” he said. “Being in the right frame of mind when you’re on top, that’s the easy part. It’s when you’re behind, or when you’re in the pressure moments, that’s the hard part.“We’ve been the team who have done that to other oppositions before, where we’ve put them under serious amounts of pressure and they’ve not been able to stand up to what we’ve offered. And at the moment, we’ve not been able to stand up to what Australia have thrown at us.”Though England have been criticised for their preparations for both Tests, choosing to play a single, brief and not truly competitive warm-up game before the first and no warm‑up game at all before the second, the England coach,Brendon McCullum, suggested the players had, in fact, worked too hard.“I actually felt like we overprepared to be honest,” McCullum told Channel 7. “We had five intense training days and I think sometimes when you’re in the heat of the battle the most important thing is to feel a little bit fresh. I think the boys just need a few days off and probably need to change up a few of the training methods a little bit. I’m a horse racing man and you wouldn’t just keep doing the same thing with your horse – you’d send it around in figure eights or over the little jumps, just to switch it up a bit. So we’ll look at some alternative methods over the next few days.”View image in fullscreenBrendon McCullum said of his England side: ‘I actually felt like we overprepared to be honest … Sometimes when you’re in the heat of the battle the most important thing is to feel a bit fresh.’Photograph: Jason O’Brien/ShutterstockEngland to seek better warmup preparations before 2029-30 Ashes seriesRead moreStokes agreed with McCullum’s analysis. “There’s a great saying: are you going to train to train, or are you going to train to dominate? There’s a lot of training that you see go on where you’re just doing it for the sake of doing it,” he said.“You’re doing it to look right, to be doing the right things, whereas actually you’re not achieving anything out of it. It might look good to the external world [but] wasting energy can be very, very detrimental. I understand that [people would think], surely if you train more you’re going to be better. But there’s that saying, and I like to train to dominate, as does this team.”Stokes said he still believed England can win the Ashes. “If we lose hope we might as well not turn up,” he said. “I haven’t lost hope, that dressing room hasn’t lost hope, and I’ll be doing everything I can as captain to ensure that everyone is as positive as they possibly can be.”To that end, the squad head to the Sunshine Coast beach resort of Noosa for a short break before moving to Adelaide, venue of the third Test, on Saturday – the same day Australia’s team will assemble there after a few days at home.“It’s been pretty full-on, on the field, off the field. And as physical as this game is, a huge part of it is the mental side,” Stokes said. “I know what the game can do to you when it isn’t feeling right or going well, so trust me when I say it is so important for teams to put the pressure aside for a couple of days.“It’s very important that when you do get the opportunity you are able to go away and refresh your mind, because obviously in Adelaide we need to be not only physically very good but mentally very good as well.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketAustralia sportThe AshesBen StokesnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump pulled back to 7-3 and won a dramatic and error-strewn 11th frame helped by an act of sportsmanship by Selby, after Trump disputed the referee Olivier Marteel’s award of a free ball in Selby’s favour.Selby accepted Trump’s protest and the balls were returned to the position of the original snooker, out of which Trump duly fluked the last red and further reduced the deficit to 7-4.Trump had clearly stepped up a level, delivering two centuries – 105 and 124 respectively – which sandwiched a cool 91 from Selby and the mid-session interval, ensuring the world No 1 kept clinging on at 8-6 down.Selby twice missed blacks off their spots as Trump closed within one at 8-7, and Trump did so again at 9-8 after Selby jarred the simplest of reds with the title seemingly at his mercy.

In the meantime, it is worth pondering how on earth the club got into this pickle.By the time Kieran Tierney cracked home a stoppage-time goal againstHearts, ordinarily the trigger for a cavalry charge by those in green and white, the stadium was all but empty. Hope had been abandoned by a supporter base who seem – rightly – to flick between mutiny and bewilderment.Those watching at home caught a glimpse of Paul Tisdale, Celtic’s head of football operations, appearing to nod off during the second half. Had Tisdale paid attention, he would have witnessed Celtic’s latest failure to deal with a team who sat deep and displayed excellent defensive discipline. “We were in between playing through the middle or going wide,” Nancy said. This was accurate. His analysis of a “really good first half” was more questionable. Goodness knows what Nancy would regard as a cause for concern.Tisdale was not in attendance as Nancy addressed the media on Friday, in what was the most underwhelming arrival of a Celtic manager in living memory. No other senior club official flanked the Frenchman, either. There was no opportunity to press the Celtic hierarchy on precisely why Brendan Rodgers resigned – immediately after their last defeat against Hearts – or why it felt wise to coax Nancy from Columbus Crew, who finished seventh in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer in the US. This process took more than a month.Quick GuideSaturday's Premiership roundup: Rangers ease past KilmarnockShowBojan Miovski scored twice asRangersmoved to within six points of the leaders with a 3-0 win atKilmarnock. Danny Rohl’s side hit the front in the 33rd minute with a drive from the North Macedonia striker, who added his second nine minutes after the break with a fine finish from inside the box. The travelling fans celebrated further when the Spurs loanee Mikey Moore came off the bench to add a third in the 81st minute before having a second disallowed. The Kilmarnock manager, Stuart Kettlewell, was sent off by the referee, Kevin Clancy, in the 72nd minute as Rangers moved up to fourth.A first-half Adil Aouchiche double helpedAberdeenbeatDundee3-1 and extend their unbeaten run to six. Aouchiche got the opener on 16 minutes and then got his second soon after, putting his side in command at the break. Dundee pulled one back through Ryan Astley on 63 minutes but it was not enough as just before the end Kevin Nisbet got Aberdeen’s third to seal the win.Hiberniangot back to winning ways, endingFalkirk’s five-game unbeaten streak in a 3-0 victory. The Australian forward, Martin Boyle, scored the first after making no mistake from the penalty spot. Just before half-time, Hibernian’s lead was doubled through a Kieron Bowie finish from outside the box. Ethan Ross thought he had got Falkirk back in it, however, after a lengthy VAR review it was deemed to be offside, before Bowie got his second to wrap things up.Motherwellalso came out on top as 3-0 winners against the bottom sideLivingston, extending their unbeaten run to eight league games. After a strong start, Motherwell went ahead in the 18th minute courtesy of a curling 20-yard strike from midfielder Elliot Watt. On the hour mark, that lead was doubled as Apostolos Stamatelopoulos converted from the spot and Emmanuel Longelo made it three with two minutes to go.St Mirrengot their first victory in eight league games in a 2-0 win againstDundee Unitedat the SMISA stadium. A first of the season for Conor McMenamin put St Mirren in the lead after 16 minutes when he headed home at the far post. Keanu Baccus got St Mirren’s second with his first goal since returning to Saints to round things off.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nancy may well be a terrific coach. He might be the man to rejuvenate Celtic. It is never wise for anybody associated with Scottish football to adopt a sniffy attitude towards incomers. It is just so difficult to fathom how Celtic, who jousted with the best in the Champions League last season, find themselves at this low ebb. Nancy is incomparable in respect of status and experience to Rodgers. The scale of necessary Celtic rebuild is huge. They are trusting a coach who has never managed anywhere remotely resembling this environment to oversee it.Celtic’s showing against Hearts was abject, typified by misplaced passes and a lack of imagination within 30 yards of goal. Cláudio Braga and Oisin McEntee have been fine signings for Hearts. Yet here were players signed from the Norwegian second tier and on a free transfer from Walsall punishing a team who went toe‑to‑toe with Bayern Munich this year. Tomas Bent Magnusson, who excelled in the visiting midfield, was a £35,000 signing from Icelandic football.View image in fullscreenCláudio Braga gives Hearts the lead at Celtic Park.Photograph: Malcolm Mackenzie/Hearts FC/ProSports/ShutterstockThose in the stands continue to vent frustration towards Celtic’s directors. This is a club at odds with itself, a scenario not at all masked by the 73-year-old Martin O’Neill churning out some reasonable results between Rodgers exiting and Nancy arriving. There will be no cause for wild celebration, either, if Celtic win their League Cup final against St Mirren next weekend.It would be unfair to disregard the significance of this result for Hearts. They arrived in Glasgow having not won in four matches and with scepticism surrounding their capability of challenging for the title. Hearts headed back along the M8 with their three-point lead at the top restored.Derek McInnes, the Hearts manager, had predicted Nancy would immediately deploy the 3-4-3 formation he favoured in the US. It is worth noting Hearts have lost just one fixture over 90 minutes since April. “The players shouldn’t doubt themselves, shouldn’t doubt what we are,” McInnes said. This proved his latest tactical triumph.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hearts grew in belief during a scrappy first half, albeit the opening goal arrived in strange circumstance. Celtic’s defence stopped inexplicably in the incorrect belief that Braga was offside during the build-up. Hearts played on, the Portuguese striker latching on to Harry Milne’s mis-hit shot to turn the ball beyond Kasper Schmeichel.Braga’s strike visibly boosted the Hearts mood. They started the second period in confident fashion, albeit without seriously troubling Schmeichel. The Denmark goalkeeper turned a Lawrence Shankland shot round a post, triggering a corner from which Milne found McEntee’s head. Schmeichel was duly beaten as Hearts reached an unassailable position.Tierney lashed home with little over a minute of stoppage time left. Arne Engels had forced a terrific save from Alexander Schwolow and Reo Hatate hit the bar but it would be inaccurate to suggest that Celtic approached bombardment of the Hearts goal. “The season is long,” Nancy said; which may be just as well.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipCelticHeartsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 27-year-old finished seventh in a strong field in a time of 2hr 6min 38sec, quicker than any Briton in history apart from Mo Farah, whoran 2:05:11 in Chicago in 2018.‘Athletes are entertainers too’: Alex Yee on being a showman and dealing with Olympic gloryRead moreIt was a remarkable performance, especially given Yee took up the marathon only this year as a mini-sabbatical from triathlonafter he won gold in Paris. As Yee crossed the line he roared to the skies before placing his hands to his head, in disbelief at the time he had just achieved.“Valencia marathon blew away any expectations I had of myself,” said Yee. “I had learned so much from London which was such a special experience but I felt with better preparation I had a chance to do something special. From start to finish the atmosphere was amazing and kept my legs and mind pushing through to one of the best performances of my life.”It also came after Yee’s first attempt over 26.2 miles in London in April had not gone entirely to plan after a series of illnesses interrupted his preparations. After finishing in 2:11:08, he said: “God damn, marathon is hard.”However, Yee, who has always had serious running pedigree, having competed for Britain over 10,000m at the EuropeanAthleticsChampionships as a 20-year-old, felt he had more to give. His training posts in the buildup to Valencia, in which he had run alongside the seasoned marathon runners Emile Cairess and Phil Sesemann, suggested he had put in the miles and sessions to go much quicker. And so it proved.Paced by Cairess, who finished fourth in the Olympic marathon in Paris and has a personal best of 2:06:46, Yee looked comfortable as he went through halfway in 1:03:32.Despite warmer than ideal conditions, with temperatures climbing into the mid-teens, he still had plenty left in the tank to run the second half in a negative split of 1:03:06.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Netanyahu dismisses the warrants as “trumped-up charges” from a “corrupt prosecutor”.During the first phase of the current ceasefire agreement, Hamas released the last 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for about 2,000 Palestinian detainees held byIsrael, and it has handed over all but one of 28 bodies of hostages killed during the war. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have withdrawn to a ceasefire line, leaving them in control of 58% of the Gaza Strip.Since the ceasefire was declared on 10 October, Israeli forces have killedmore than 360 Palestinians, including an estimated 70 children. Three Israeli soldiers have been killed in Hamas attacks over the same period.Neither Trump’s proposals, nor UN security council resolution 2803 which largely endorsed them, set out a timetable extending the ceasefire into a lasting peace. Hamas is supposed to disarm, Israeli troops are meant to withdraw farther, and an international stabilisation force (ISF) is to be set up under the control of a “board of peace” of world leaders chaired by Trump, overseeing a technocratic Palestinian committee to run the day-to-day governance of Gaza.The sequencing of these steps is not clear in Trump’s proposals or in resolution 2803. In his remarks on Sunday, Netanyahu put his emphasis on Hamas disarmament.“I think it’s important to make sure that Hamas complies not only with the ceasefire, but also with their commitment which they undertook to disarm and have Gaza demilitarise,” he said.Netanyahu raised the prospects of “alternatives” to the ISF, without explaining what those might be. He would not rule out Israeli annexation of the West Bank, describing it as a subject of “discussion”, and stressed that Israel was adamantly opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state, the aim of the peace process desired by most European and Arab capitals as well as the overwhelming majority of UN member states.Netanyahu said the reason he would not be able make a return visit to Germany was the ICC arrest warrants, which he described as fabricated by the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, as a means of diverting attention from allegations of sexual harassment against him. Khan has denied any wrongdoing, but stepped aside from his role in May pending the conclusion of an investigation.Netanyahu said Khan was “destroying the reputation of the ICC” with “trumped-up charges of starvation and genocide” from a “corrupt prosecutor”.Another tribunal, the international court of justice, is weighing up charges that Israeli has committed genocide in Gaza. In September, a UN independent commission of inquiry concluded that Israel had committed genocide.Asked about the possibility of Netanyahu visiting Germany, Merz told reporters on Sunday: “There is no reason to discuss this at the moment.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

Both men have previously expressed support for the Conservative party and havedonated money to it.Richard Walker donated nearly £10,000 in July 2020, when Boris Johnson was prime minister during the Covid pandemic. He was then added to a list of approved parliamentary candidates for the party in 2022, only to perform an abrupt about-turn the following year.Writing inthe Guardianin 2023, Walker said the Conservatives had “drifted badly out of touch with business and the economy, and with the everyday needs of the British people”.He thenbacked Keir Starmerin early 2024, saying that “after a lot of soul-searching” he had decided he had “exactly what it takes to be a great leader”. Walker’s comments did not, however, suggest a would-be Labour politician. He said the Tories’ abandonment of “basic Conservative principles” had added to his disenchantment.Nevertheless, his appointment as a Labour peer, first reported by the Sun, would add a rare business voice in support of Starmer’s government, which has irked several sectors by raising national insurance. The Conservative party counts another retail boss, Simon Wolfson of Next, among its peers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suggested alternatives include the less appetising“discs” or “tubes”.McCartney said: “To stipulate that burgers and sausages are ‘plant-based’, ‘vegetarian’ or ‘vegan’ should be enough for sensible people to understand what they are eating. This also encourages attitudes which are essential to our health and that of the planet.”The musician is one of the world’s most prominent advocates of a vegetarian diet. He and his late wife founded the Linda McCartney plant-based foods brand in 1991 and he and their daughters Mary and Stella launched the global“Meat Free Monday”campaign to encourage people to eat less meat.View image in fullscreenThe EU is set to decide whether to ban wording for plant-based and vegetarian foods following lobbying by the meat industry.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockLinda McCartney sausages andburgershave been part of a global trend of increased interest in products to replace meat, even if investment haswaned since a bubbleduring the coronavirus pandemic.Yet with the growth of plant-based products has come a backlash, particularly from the politically powerful farming and meat distribution industries, which are worried about the potential effects of lower demand on jobs.The European parliament voted 355–247 to ban “meat-related” names from being used on plant-based products. According to Euronews, Céline Imart, a French member of the centre-right European People’s party and proponent of the ban, told the parliament: “I accept that steak, cutlet or sausage are products from our livestock farms. Full stop. No laboratory substitutes, no plant-based products.”The letter signed by the McCartney family and the British MPs argued that the EU rulescould force Britain into changesas well, because the markets and regulation are still so intertwined despite the UK’s departure from the EU.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the attempt to limit the use of generic terms is more controversial.Many of the terms that would be banned have malleable meanings. For instance, the Collins dictionary defines a sausage firstly in relation to meat but secondly as “an object shaped like a sausage”. Even more problematically for a ban, the primary definition of “burger” is given as a “flat round mass of minced meat or vegetables”.The eight MP signatories to the letter include the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the former Green party co-leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionVegetarian food and drinkVegan food and drinkPaul McCartneyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That killing has been met with intense scrutiny and accusations of war crimes after the Washington Postreporteddefense secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to“kill them all”. Adm Frank Bradley of the US navy, who oversaw the attack, told lawmakers on Thursday there wasno such order– and the Pentagon has defended the legality of the attack.Experts have said the defense islegally shaky.Pressure grows on ‘reckless’ Hegseth as twin scandals engulf Pentagon chiefRead more“If the Pentagon and our defense secretary are so proud of what they’re doing, let the American people see that video,” Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator from California, said during an interview on Sunday onNBC’s Meet the Press.“Let the American people see two people standing on a capsized boat, or sitting on a capsized boat, and deliberately killed and decide for themselves whether they’re proud of what the country is doing. I can’t imagine people would be proud of that.”Donald Trumphas said he has no problem releasing the video. But, despite the president’s statement, Hegseth did not commit to doing so on Saturday.“We’re reviewing the process, and we’ll see,”he said on Saturday, adding that the Pentagon wanted to ensure sensitive information was not compromised.Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut had previously said the video was “one of the most troubling scenes I’ve ever seen in my time in public service”.“You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion – with a destroyed vessel – who were killed by the United States,” said Himes, who is the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee.Representative Adam Smith of Washington state, the ranking Democrat on the House armed services committee, said on Sunday it was “pretty clear they don’t want to release this video”.“They don’t want people to see it because it’s very, very difficult to justify,” he said during an interview on Sunday on ABC’sThis Week.US airstrike survivors clung to boat wreckage for an hour before second deadly attack, video showsRead more“When [the survivors] were finally taken out, they weren’t trying to flip the boat over. The boat was clearly incapacitated. A tiny portion of it remained, capsized – the bow of the boat. They had no communications device. Certainly, they were unarmed.”Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, said he personally did not oppose releasing the video.“It’s not gruesome. I didn’t find it distressing or disturbing. It looks like any number of dozens of strikes we’ve seen on Jeeps and pickup trucks in the Middle East over the years,” he said onNBC’s Meet the Press. “I would trust Secretary Hegseth and his team to make the decision about whether they can declassify and release the video. But again, there’s nothing remarkable on that video in my opinion.”Cotton also defended the legality of the strike, disputing that the two men killed in the second strike were helpless.“It doesn’t really matter what they were doing,” he said. “They were on that boat. That boat was still a valid target. They were not in a state of distress on a plank of wood in the ocean like subsequent survivors were,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryDemocratsUS politicsPete HegsethUS CongressCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

First Nations fear another ‘worst-case scenario’Mark Carney is considering lifting a tanker ban that has protected coastal communities for 53 yearsLeyland Ceccoin Bella Bella and Toronto, CanadaSun 7 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 12.38 ESTShareThe distress call went out to the Canadian coast guard station after midnight on an October night. The Nathan E Stewart, an American-flagged tugboat, sailing through the light winds and rain of the central British Columbia coast, hadgrounded on a reef.The captain tried to reverse, moving the rudder from hard over port to hard over starboard. The boat pivoted but did not move, and the tug repeatedly struck the sea bed.Four hours later, the ship began taking on water, and leaking diesel into the sea. That evening, a coast guard helicopter confirmed the “worst-case scenario”: a large sheen of diesel oil on the water was visible outside of a containment boom. In total, 110,000 litres spilled near the entrance to Seaforth Channel.“I remember being in my office later that day getting calls from elders in the community. Some were crying and very upset. They talked as though we had lost someone in our community. People were devastated,” said Marilynn Slett, chief councillor of the Heiltsuk Nation, whose community of Bella Bella was 10 nautical miles from the grounding. “The spill contaminated our primary harvesting sites, causing immediate economic loss that are still ongoing today.”Canada minister resigns from cabinet over Carney’s controversial oil pipeline dealRead moreNearly a decade after the 2016 disaster, the nation is still fighting for compensation for the losses it bore, including the destruction of clam gardens they had cultivated for centuries. And their lengthy and tiring battle has returned to the spotlight as Mark Carney, the prime minister, supports a pipeline project that would ferry bitumen across Alberta and British Columbia. Part of that would involve lifting a tanker ban that has been in place for 53 years.Against the backdrop of a trade war and the climate crisis,Canadais in a difficult position. It is the world’s fourth-largest oil producer with the fourth-largest reserves, outproducing most members of Opec. But swathes of the country are also warming faster than the rest of the world, and communities are facing the devastating effects.Grappling with those two realities, Carney has pledged to help Alberta with a pipeline that would move“at least one million barrels a day” to Asia. With new legislative powers, Carney’s government could also slash permitting and approval delays and is weighing lifting the moratorium on tanker traffic along the BC north coast.For many, that ban, formalized into law in 2019, reflects the inherent danger of shipping oil through a region of tempestuous weather,physical hazardsanddeeply revered marine ecosystems.“It’s spectacularly dangerous to conceive of putting a pipeline to northern BC and hauling that oil across the Gulf of Alaska to Asian markets,” Rick Steiner, who was one of the first on the scene of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, told the Canadian Press. “It should not see the light of day.”View image in fullscreenPrince William Sound, Alaska, after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, on 24 March 1989.Photograph: William Nation/Getty ImagesLarge oil tankers would likely have to traverse portions of the Hecate Strait, described by author John Vaillant as a “malevolent weather factory” where winter storms produce “one of the most diabolically hostile environments that wind, sea and land are capable of conjuring”.Coastal First Nations, which represent nine nations along the central coast,swiftly declared that the project “would never happen”, and said the tanker ban was non-negotiable. Chiefs representing more than 600 First Nations voted unanimously for Ottawa to uphold the oil-tanker ban and to withdraw from the deal between the federal and Alberta governments that could see a pipeline project pushed through.Green party leader Elizabeth May said in a statement there was “no chance on God’s green Earth that an oil tanker will ever move through the inner waters between Haida Gwaii and the north coast of British Columbia”. May added that “governments cannot wish away science” nor can they “pretend that an oil tanker would not break apart under those conditions”.For First Nations on the coast, the prospect of an oil spill is deeply feared.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The ecosystem still bears the scars of the Nathan E Stewart grounding: traditional harvesting sites have been closed and the damage to the ecosystem has permitted invasive species such as the European green crab to thrive.λáλíyasila Frank Brown, a Heiltsuk hereditary chief, said hiscommunity is open to industrial development, but only projects for which the risks can be safely managed – and the community consents.BC’s premier, David Eby, alluded to this reality when he told reporters he was open to a pipeline proposal, but said any project that would require the tanker ban to be lifted was a non-starter. He pointed out that billions of dollars’ worth of projects in the region, including liquefied natural gas terminals, currently have support from First Nations, and warned that support could be rapidly withdrawn if the federal government pushes to lift the tanker ban. Scrapping the ban would be a “grave mistake”, he said, adding: “I think that the risk of an oil spill is really significant in terms of the economic harm.”View image in fullscreenWorkers use pressure washers to wash oil from the beach at Smith Island on Prince William Sound.Photograph: Bob Hallinen/MCT/Getty ImagesFor Slett and her community, the potential harms transcend economics and push into cultural losses that have proven far more damaging. Under existing maritime law, the Heiltsuk aren’t eligible for compensation for cultural losses – including the loss of access to cultural sites. A delegation traveled to London last year to meet with the UN’s international marine organization to lobby for changes.“We’ve been fighting for justice through this colonial legal system and it’s really a process of ‘show me your receipts’. But how do you show a receipt for the loss of our ability to transmit our knowledge and our cultural practices between generations?” she asked.The cleanup salvage operations for the Nathan E Stewart spill took 40 days, with harsh weather suspending work for 11 of those. It took 45 vessels and more than 200 people to help with both the initial response and the cleanup.“That was a spill of fewer than 700 barrels and yet it polluted over 1,500 acres of our territory,” said Slett, adding that large oil tankers can carry more than 2m barrels. “We just cannot accept this risk to our community after seeing what can happen. We can’t. And we won’t.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaOil spillsIndigenous peoplesOilOil and gas companiesEconomic recoveryEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No one knows where it’s come from, but it’s found what I consider a perfect beaver habitat,” said the reserve’s manager, Richard Spowage. He estimates the beaver has been living in an isolated and almost impenetrable area of the reserve for about a month.“It’s a section of the river that we’ve left to go wild,” he added. “There’s plenty of tree cover and we think it might be travelling into the adjacent marshes, hunting for food.”View image in fullscreenTelltale chips of wood gave away the lone beaver’s presence at Pensthorpe nature reserveThe beaver – a nocturnal herbivore – is collecting willow trees at night and building a larder of bark to store near its home. “It’s turned up and it’s just doing what a beaver does, which is cutting down trees and gathering food for the winter. That way, once it gets too cold, or if there’s too much flooding, it can just stay in its little lodge and keep warm,” Spowage said.He first had an inkling a beaver was living on the reserve after a volunteer noticed an oddly shaped tree stump that was “cut almost like a pointed stick”.At first he wondered whether “some small boy with an axe had somehow found his way into the woodland”. But after spotting “classic beaver chips” at the base of another tree, he set camera traps, which captured a lone beaver walking through the forest at night.“It’s very elusive,” Spowage said. “It was such a special moment to see it out there, living its life, after not being seen in Norfolk for hundreds of years.”Natural England, which advises the government on the natural environment, announced in March that it would begin issuing licences to projects that aimed to reintroduce beavers into the wild. By August, the government had received 39 expressions of interest, 20 of which are from theWildlifeTrusts federation.Beaver location mapHowever, only one population of beavers has been legallyreleased into the wild so far in England– four sleepy beavers made history by crawling from their crates into the ponds of the Purbeck Heaths in Dorset.Cornwall Wildlife Trust is still waiting for approval to introduce beavers to its Helman Tor reserve, even though it is already home to a wild population.Since 2021, the Scottish government has formally allowed the movement and release of beavers and thepopulation there is put at 1,500.It is not clear whether the Pensthorpe beaver, whose sex and age is unknown, was illegally released into the reserve by activists using a practice known as beaver bombing. It is possible it wandered of its own accord into the Wensum – an aquifer-fed chalk river whose name is derived from the Old English adjective for “wandering”.“It could be a naturally dispersing wild beaver,” said Emily Bowen, a spokesperson for the Beaver Trust, a charity that aims to restore beavers to regenerate landscapes. “There are actually 10 individual wild populations in England at the moment.”Wild beavers have also been spotted in Kent, Hampshire, Somerset, Wiltshire and Hereford, she said. Norfolk has some captive beavers but none have been reported missing.Spowage doubts whether a wild beaver could have reached Norfolk by itself. “It’s unlikely it’s been born wild, or if it was wild, potentially there was some sort of human influence to move it,” he said, adding that the beaver would be welcome to live at Pensthorpe. “From our point of view, it’s a wild animal and it’s got the right to be here.”This headline was amended on 7 December 2025.

There were huts abandoned a year before that were sinking into the forest floor, and brazil nut pods discarded around old campfires. They were all signs that thePardo River Kawahivapeople were there.View image in fullscreenIndigenous leader Beto Marubo on the southern border of the Javari Valley Indigenous territory during the Funai Kawahiva expedition in Brazil’s Mato Grosso state.Photograph: J Reid/GuardianA year later, the Brazilian government continues to ignore directives by the country’ssupreme courtapproving a plan of measures to protect the isolated Indigenous community, including accelerating the demarcation of their territory and explaining how it would reduce deforestation.Bureaucratic delays, funding shortages and violent conflicts over land – including attacks by self-proclaimed leaders linked to loggers – have blocked the process.Without physical boundaries, loggers and ranchers continue to encroach, leaving the Kawahiva vulnerable to genocide and cultural erasure. Advocates call the stalling a deliberate, life-threatening violation of Brazil’s constitution.A map showing Indigenous territories around Brazil and highlighting the Pardo River Kawahiva.The presence of the Kawahiva people came as no surprise to Jair Candor, who led the expedition last year and who first confirmed their location in 1999. But their proposed 400,000-hectare (1m-acre) reserve still lacks full protection, as required by Brazil’s constitution, and remains the largest unprotected forest with uncontacted Indigenous people in Brazil.Just outside the reserve’s boundaries, the forest has been burned and cattle graze on recently cleared land. Fences and gates are being erected, and roads are stretching farther and farther into the forest.View image in fullscreenThe Funai expedition members.

But the climate conference came and went without a word about the Pardo River Kawahiva.Physical demarcation of the 200-mile (320km) perimeter of the Kawahiva’s territory involves placing concrete markers and signs along the boundary, and is a decisive step in convincing loggers and cattle farmers that the government is serious about its protection. But the demarcation remains stalled.Money has been one of the major stumbling blocks as the demarcation was to be funded by compensation received for the environmental impact of a highway in Mato Grosso state, which encompasses the territory. When that did not happen, Funai sought other sources of funding.The delay in demarcation is not only illegal, it is also extremely dangerousPriscilla Oliveira, Survival InternationalIt has now turned to theInstitute of Geosciencesat the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). “It’s a technical partnership that we’ve already had success with in other demarcations of Indigenous lands,” says Manoel Batista do Prado, Funai’s director of Indigenous land demarcation. “The fieldwork is scheduled to begin in early 2026.”The UFMG institute confirmed that it was in “advanced talks” with Funai, but did not say when or how it would present a plan for the demarcation work.The subtext to all this bureaucratic wheel-spinning is what Funai calls the “conflictual situation in the region”, which will require an armed police presence during the work.In 2018, an armed group of residents attacked the Funai base in the Kawahiva territory. In the ensuing gun battle, one of the attackers was killed.

Calling himself “Chief Francisco”, and thought to be Francisco das Chagas Paulo Rodrigues, who claims to be a chief affiliated with the Arara Indigenous Association, he called on local ranchers to reclaim the land “stolen by that scoundrel Jair”.He claimed to have conducted a six-day expedition within the Kawahiva Indigenous territory, “looking for those isolated Indians that Jair talks so much about”.‘They knew that we were here’: following in the footsteps of the uncontacted Pardo River Kawahiva peopleRead more“We can’t work because of this guy, but I have faith that we’re going to get him out of there,” he said in the recording.The self-styled chief is linked to loggers in the region and has allegedly committed several environmental crimes. He is facing charges in the federal civil and criminal court of Juína, including for the attempted murder of Candor during the armed attack on the Funai base.Elias Bigio, an anthropologist at theObservatory of Isolated Indigenous Peoples(Opi), says: “It has been 26 years since the confirmation of isolated Indigenous people on Kawahiva land and throughout this time, land-grabbers have always sought to overturn the land declaration in court, not to mention the threats and invasions that are still happening today. And now, once again, the demarcation is delayed.”He raises the possibility “that this is a political, not technical and legal, obstacle. So we fear that this may not happen even next year.”After that, he says, if a right-leaning government is elected, all Indigenous land demarcation is widely expected to stop, as was the case during the years when Jair Bolsonaro was president. Many see 2026 as the last chance for the Kawahiva territory project to be realised.View image in fullscreenA butterfly lands on a Funai cap hung out to dry during the trek.Photograph: John Reid/GuardianThe petition that led to the supreme court directive for the demarcation to go ahead was filed by theAPIB, a national organisation of Brazil’s Indigenous people.The court’s decision was clear: it ordered the federal government to present a firm schedule for completing the demarcation of the Kawahiva do Rio Pardo territory, recognising the “risk of genocide, food insecurity and acculturation”.Ricardo Terena, a lawyer for Apib, describes the process as “stalled”. The supreme court has said it is awaiting compliance with the decision.“The delay in demarcation is not only illegal,” warns Priscilla Oliveira, representative of Survival International, an organisation that campaigns forIndigenous peoples.“It is also extremely dangerous and puts the lives of the isolated Kawahiva Indigenous people at risk.”This series on uncontacted peoples is a partnership between the Guardian and the Brazilian newspaper O Globo and is supported by theOpen Society Foundations, theFord Foundation, thePulitzer Centerand theNia Tero Foundation.

There is no suggestion that any of the three committed criminal acts or had been aware Gill took bribes to promote Russian interests.Amid the continuing police investigation, the Labour party has called on Farage to voluntarily offer to help investigators, who have already spoken to MEPs he led in the European parliament.The chair of the Labour party, Anna Turley MP, said: “He must order an urgent investigation into pro-Russia links in Reform, and he should voluntarily go to the police for interview and help them with their inquiries.”Last week, another former leading member of the group of MEPs headed by Faragedenied taking moneyas part of a campaign to promote Russian interests.David Coburn, who was also the leader of Ukip in Scotland for four years, was mentioned in WhatsApp messages between Gill and Voloshyn – a former Ukrainian MEP who is accused of the bribery – that were released by prosecutors.The messages showed Gill and Voloshyn apparently discussing how much should be set aside for Coburn, who was also an MEP for Reform UK’s precursor the Brexit party. Coburndenied taking any paymentwhen confronted by BBC journalists outside his home in France.The messages were sent in April 2019 before a meeting at the European parliament of the editorial board of 112 Ukraine, whose membership included Gill and Coburn, and which was connected to Viktor Medvedchuk, Vladimir Putin’s ally in Ukraine.View image in fullscreenJonathan Bullock (centre) leaving the European parliament holding a union jack on 31 January 2020.Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty ImagesBullock rejected any wrongdoing on his part when the Guardian approached him, saying that the comments he made to 112 Ukraine about the sovereignty of nation states were normal in the context of his role as an energy spokesperson.A transcript of Bullock’s comments to the channel record that he stated: “I do think that it’s much better for nation states to act individually, so Ukraine’s to do what’s best in Ukraine’s interest and likewise we in western Europe and in the United Kingdom, for example, to do what we would like.”Contacted by the Guardian, Bullock said that he was a known critic of Russia, adding: “My comment was a standard run-of-the-mill answer from me which I connected with my energy views on UK choices relating to nuclear power and renewables.”View image in fullscreenSteven Woolfe.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA MediaWoolfe declined to comment when approached by the Guardian. However, a friend said that police had never contacted or investigated the former MEP.“He does feel personally appalled by the way he and others have been dragged into it but the reality is he has nothing to hide,” they added.It is understood that Gill had appealed to Woolfe’s interest in free speech, knowing that this was an issue the then MEP for North West England was particularly interested in.Reid did not respond to requests for comment.The former head of Gill’s office in Brussels, Ethan Wilkinson, has also denied to the Guardian that he received any payment, after documents released by the CPS showed Voloshyn suggesting he should be rewarded with “3k euro” for his “fieldwork”.“I was Nathan’s head of office in Brussels and I recall submitting paperwork in relation to ‘mission’ expenses and resolutions for the EFDD group, all of which I genuinely believed were legitimate activities of an MEP who was advocating for free speech/expression/freedom of the press,” he said, referring to the Eurosceptic and populist political group in the European parliament.“I didn’t receive any payment from Mr Voloshyn,” said Wilkinson, who went on to work for the TaxPayer’s Alliance and was also a Conservative party local election candidate.“I had no idea that he was a Russian intelligence asset, I had no idea Nathan was being paid by him or anybody else to carry out this work, and I fully cooperated in the Met police investigation into Mr Gill as a witness, including sharing WhatsApp conversations etc.”Other MEPs elected for either Ukip or the Brexit party who were named in the CPS note include Jonathan Arnott, who visited Ukraine with Gill on an October 2018 trip.During the visit, Coburn, Gill and Arnott appeared on camera in interviews with 112 Ukraine and all made similar statements six weeks later during a debate in the European parliament on 11 December that touched on press freedom in Ukraine and the question of whether it should be allowed to join the EU.Arnott spoke to the police as a potential witness, the Guardian understands. He has rejected any suggestion that he had links to Russia or was acting in its interests.Alex Phillips, who was a Brexit party MEP, told the Guardian last month she had voluntarily gone to speak to the police when she learned of the investigation into Gill.The CPS note states Gill had promised his handler Voloshyn that he would “get Alex [Phillips]” to speak, although this does not appear to have happened and Phillips has since stressed that she was outspoken in her hostility to Putin.Another Brexit party MEP, James Wells, was named in the CPS notes in the context of a fresh intervention by Gill in September 2019. The notes state Gill asked Voloshyn to send him lines to take in a European parliament subcommittee on human rights. WhatsApp messages indicate Gill had commented in the media afterwards and “secured the cooperation” of Wells.Gill reported that he had taken Wells out for dinner as a thank you, to which Voloshyn replied: “Wonderful! We owe you for that.”Wells, who has accused Gill of dragging colleagues into his activities without their knowledge, has told the Guardian: “I had no knowledge of what Gill was up to at the time. The police did not require an interview with me after I had a short call with them, so there is no question about my innocence.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKUK Independence party (Ukip)Nigel FarageRussiaEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Among those treated was a three-year-old girl.Tom Bate, who was caught up in the incident after landing at Heathrow on Sunday morning, said he was shaken up after people began coughing and his throat burned. “Everyone was coughing and looking at each other thinking how weird it was that we were coughing at the same time,” he said.One man was arrested on suspicion of assault, and inquiries continued to trace further suspects, police said.Commander Peter Stevens said: “Our team have been working at pace today to review CCTV from the area and speak with witnesses at the scene.“At this stage, it’s understood that a woman was robbed of her suitcase by a group of four men, who sprayed a substance believed to be pepper spray in her direction.“This occurred within a car park lift, with those in the lift and surrounding area affected by the spray.“Our officers are working to determine the full circumstances around what happened but we do believe this to be an isolated incident with those directly involved known to each other.“We appreciate that this has been a concerning incident and I commend the actions of the emergency services and members of staff at Heathrow airport.”Police said the victims’ injuries were not believed to be life-changing or life-threatening.A London ambulance service spokesperson said: “We have a number of resources on scene, and are caring for a number of patients.” The service later said it had been stood down from the scene at 10.58am.A London fire brigade spokesperson said: “Firefighters have been providing specialist assistance alongside multi-agency partners at the scene. The brigade was stood down shortly after 10.30.”Footage posted on social media appeared to show a man being handcuffed, and ambulances, fire engines and armed officers at the scene.Bate said he had seen three men who did not have luggage running past the lift lobby of the car park at Terminal 3 at about 8am, shortly after he had landed from the US.“The second they left people started coughing one by one,” he said. “There must have been about 50 of us in the lobby waiting for the lifts and it was really eerie because everyone started coughing, including me.“There was a burning taste in my throat and there were children there, there were elderly people. A lot of people were exposed to whatever this was.”The student, 27, who was travelling to London to spend Christmas with his family, said he went to his car and began driving down the car park ramp.“That was when I saw what must have been 20 very heavily armed police officers running and looking really quite stricken,” he said. “During this I said to one officer: ‘What’s going on?’ and he said: ‘We don’t know – there’s been an attack.’”Bate said he had given a statement to police and was kept in the car park with other passengers for more than an hour.“It was total gridlock. They swept the whole garage, every car, they were very professional and very quick,” he said. “It felt really terrifying.”A Heathrow spokesperson said its teams were responding to the incident with the emergency services. Heathrow has advised passengers to allow extra time when travelling to the airport and, if they have any queries, to check with their airline.The terminal remained open throughout, though the incident caused some traffic and public transport disruption.The policing minister, Sarah Jones, said: “My thoughts are with all those affected by the incident at Heathrow this morning. My heartfelt thanks go to the emergency services for their rapid response and the arrest made.“I am being regularly updated on the investigation. Those in the area should follow police advice.”Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call 101, quoting CAD 1803 7 DEC.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Britain hasalmost a million Neets aged 16 to 24, in what some experts have called ayouth jobs crisis.Rachel Reeves announced £820m in funding at her budget last month fora “youth guarantee”of a six-month paid work placement for every eligible 18- to 21-year-old who has been on universal credit and looking for work for 18 months.The job guarantee programme will start in the spring, with up to 55,000 young people in line. The government said the jobs would be in areas with some of the highest need, including: Birmingham and Solihull, the East Midlands, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Essex, central and east Scotland, and south-west and south-east Wales.A graph of NeetsWith a million young people locked out of work, the UK’s hidden jobs crisis is only growing | John HarrisRead moreReeves also announced £725m at the budget to try to increase the number of apprenticeships. The government said on Sunday that this money would fund 50,000 extra apprentices.McFadden also announced that 900,000 young people would be given a “dedicated work support session”, followed by four weeks of “intensive support” to try to find work experience, training or a job.He told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the government had an “expectation” that young people would take up the work.Asked if young people could lose benefits if they don’t cooperate, McFadden said: “Yes, sanction is part of the system. This is an offer on one hand, but it’s an expectation on the other, because the future we don’t want for young people is to be sitting at home on benefits when there are other options out there.”Ben Harrison, the director of the Work Foundation, a thinktank based at Lancaster University, said the funding and the prospect of more intensive work coaching was welcome, but warned the overall effects could be harmful if the threat of sanctions pushes people into unsuitable or insecure jobs.“Evidence from the UK and overseas is clear that these schemes must focus on connecting individuals to ‘good’ jobs with a living wage, job security and opportunities to progress if they are to lead to long-term sustained employment,” he said.“If reforms end up pushing young people into ‘any job’ under the threat of benefit sanctions, they may do more harm than good to their future work prospects. Nearly half of young people currently not in education, employment or training report are disabled, so it is vital that participants have some agency over the types of jobs and sectors they work in.”Harrison highlighted that the hospitality, care and construction sectors targeted by the government oftenprovided insecure work, making it difficult for people to step up to longer-term stability.The Department for Work and Pensions said there was “an expectation that young people will take up the opportunities they are offered, and sanctions to benefits could be applied for those who don’t engage with the offered support without good reason”.The apprenticeship money will include £140m managed by local mayors to link young people to local businesses, in the belief that mayors “best understand their local economies”.Any apprenticeships for under-25s with small and medium-sized businesses will also be fully funded by the government. Previous schemes required businesses to pay for 5% of the cost, which the government said was a “burden”.Keir Starmer said: “If you choose an apprenticeship, you should have the same respect and opportunity as everyone else. It’s time to change the way apprenticeships are viewed and to put them on an equal footing with university.”Explore more on these topicsYouth unemploymentYoung peopleUnemploymentWork & careersPat McFaddennewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers areconsultingon the third cycling and walking investment strategy (CWIS3), which promises a “fundamental shift” in how active travel is treated.Some parts of the active travel world not connected to the letter have expressed concern that the Department for Transport (DfT) under Alexander is less engaged with the subject than it was under her predecessor, Louise Haigh, and that momentum is being lost.In contrast, the letter, which is also signed by representatives of the Association of Directors of Public Health, Ramblers and three of England’s regional active travel commissioners, is not directly critical and is trying to engage positively while making it plain that more should be done.Saying that CWIS3 should put active travel on an equal footing with roads and rail, it argues for clear targets that should be met by 2030, the period covered by the strategy, including that by then 50% of trips of less than five miles in towns and cities should be walked, wheeled or cycled.The letter warns CWIS3’s proposed objectives, which include “ensuring people are safe to travel actively”, are “open to interpretation and not measurable”.It goes on: “Other transport modes operate with predictable five-year cycles and transparent progress reporting; active travel can and should match that level of maturity. Long-term targets, with interim reviews, will give local leaders the confidence to plan networks, support larger projects, unlock private sector investment and demonstrate how devolved investment and progress contribute to national missions.”There should also be a national strategy for active travel networks, it adds, saying that while things like walking and cycling routes should be designed locally, they also need to be “coherent, connected, consistent and accessible to all” and should link to key destinations such as rail and bus stations, hospitals and schools.The letter says: “Without reliable, safe, joined-up routes to walk, wheel and cycle, people cannot reasonably be expected to travel actively, impacting health, opportunities and independence from childhood to older adulthood.”Xavier Brice, the chief executive of Walk Wheel Cycle Trust, one of the signatories, said CWIS3 was originally intended to shift active travel “from stop-start funding and priorities to a long-term framework for investment and change. However, it has never quite lived up to this promise.”Without targets, he said, even the existing target in the strategy for active to be a safe, easy and accessible option for everyone by 2035 “is unachievable under the current proposals”.A DfT spokesperson said: “We have committed £616m to Active Travel England up to 2030 so that local authorities can deliver walking and cycling infrastructure across the country, with the aim that by 2035 walking, wheeling and cycling is easy, safe, and accessible for everyone. We have just launched a consultation on how we can achieve this, and we encourage stakeholders and the public to have their say.”Explore more on these topicsTransport policyTransportCyclingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It led to a debate over the museum’s ageing infrastructure.The Louvre said there would be an internal investigation into the November leak, which was caused by the accidental opening of a valve in the heating and ventilation system that led to water seeping through the ceiling of the Mollien wing, where the books were stored.The “completely obsolete” system had been shut down for months and was due to be replaced from September 2026, the museum administrator added.The works will “be dried, sent to a bookbinder to be restored, and then returned to the shelves”, Steinbock said.In late November, the Louvre said it would raise ticket prices for most non-EU visitors, meaning US, British and Chinese tourists, among others, will have to pay €32 (£28) to get in.The museum said the 45% price hike aimed to boost annual revenues by up to $23m to fund structural improvements.The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors in 2024, 69% from abroad.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceMuseumsEgyptologyArchaeologyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump called the campaign the “hottest ad out there”.‘I can’t control how others perceive me’: Sydney Sweeney on boxing, weight gain and her flair for controversyRead moreThe brand wasn’t only criticised by the left of the political spectrum – the financial magazine Forbes argued that it should “reconsider” the campaign. The publication also reported that American Eagle store visits were 9% down by the end of the summer.“I was honestly surprised by the reaction,” Sweeney added. “I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand. I don’t support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign. Many have assigned motives and labels to me that just aren’t true.”“Anyone who knows me knows that I’m always trying to bring people together. I’m against hate and divisiveness,” she added.“I hope this new year brings more focus on what connects us instead of what divides us.”Sweeney is considered an outside bet for an Oscar next year for her lead performance in Christy, David Michôd’sbiopic of the trailblazing boxer Christy Martin.She has mostly avoided the American Eagle ad in promotional interviews but has described Trump’s commenting on it as “surreal”.Explore more on these topicsSydney SweeneynewsShareReuse this content"

According to one report, the strain in question is instead similar to one detected in Georgia in 2007.“The discovery of a virus similar to the one that circulated in Georgia does not, therefore, rule out the possibility that its origin lies in a biological containment facility,” the ministry said on Friday.“The ‘Georgia 2007’ virus strain is a ‘reference’ virus frequently used in experimental infections in containment facilities to study the virus or to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines, which are currently under development. The report suggests that the virus may not have originated in animals or animal products from any of the countries where the infection is currently present.”Catalonia’s regional president, Salvador Illa, said on Saturday that he had ordered the Catalan agrifood research institute to conduct an audit of five facilities within 20km (12 miles) of the outbreak site that work with theAfrican swine fevervirus.“The regional government isn’t ruling out any possibilities when it comes to the origin of the outbreak of African swine fever, but neither is it confirming any,” he said. “All hypotheses remain open. First and foremost, we need to know what happened.”The agriculture ministry has confirmed 13 cases of the virus – all of them in dead wild boar found within 6km of the initial focus. It has said the corpses of 37 more wild animals found in the zone had been analysed, and that all had tested negative for swine fever.Experts dispatched to the 39 pig farms within a 20km radius of the affected area have found no trace of the illness in animals there. More than 100 personnel from Spain’s military emergencies unit have also been deployed to the area to work alongside police and wildlife rangers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It can happen anywhere, given the circumstances.”When asked about the book’s enduring popularity, Atwood told the show’s host, Lauren Laverne: “Well it’s a perennial possibility, right? Then in 2016 everything changed again, and we are now in that period where The Handmaid’s Tale has become much closer.“Not the outfits. I don’t think we’re going to get the outfits, but the rest of it seems more and more plausible.”The Handmaid’s Tale was published in 1985 and tells the story of a totalitarian and fundamentalist regime called the Republic of Gilead which takes over in the US and subjugates women who are forced to become slaves and bear children. The novel was dramatised in a TV series starring the US actor Elisabeth Moss in 2017.The red cloaks worn by the handmaids have become a symbol of US protest againstDonald Trumpand the decision to overturn the Roe v Wade ruling on abortion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

This particular one seems quite chaotic,” Atwood said.“Also, let us not count America out. It’s first of all a lot more diverse than it might appear from a distance. Second, Americans are quite ornery.“They do not like people telling them all to line up and do what they’re told. They really don’t like that, but they don’t like being bossed around by anybody right or left.”Atwood’s follow-up story, The Testaments, was a joint winner of the 2019 Booker prize. In aninterview with the Guardian in November, she said the very fact that filming for the first season of the novel had just finished was proof of hope for the US.“The States is not a totalitarianism – yet,” she said. “Though moving towards a concentrated-power structure. If it were a full totalitarianism we would not be filming The Testaments at all.

My nan sent me and my cousin to pick up some bits in Dalston and there was some change left over so I went into HMV and bought this CD for £1.99. I shouldn’t have been stealing my nan’s change but I felt so grownup. If my Jamaican dad had found out, he wouldn’t have been happy. I would have got a couple of licks.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toMambo No 5 (A Little Bit of …) by Lou Bega. I was working on my album recently and realised I knew every word. I was so impressed because I barely remember my own lyrics.The song I’ve streamed the mostWitness (1 Hope) by Roots Manuva. It’s an island track that suits any occasion. If I’m feeling a bit down it gives me some bad girl energy and reminds me to come correct. It also gives me a good adrenaline hit on a run.The song I can’t help singingGenius of Love by Tom Tom Club. They had a real influence on my sound and the newer stuff I have coming out soon. I love funky, electronic dance and I also love soulful stuff.The song I pretend to hate that I secretly likeNuttin Nuh Go So by Notch. There’s a lot of dancehall artists whose music I love but they have problematic lyrics. One day my dad was like: “Do you know what they’re saying?”The song I tell people is my favouriteBillie Holiday’s I’m a Fool to Want You. When I started working at a record shop age 15, Billie Holiday was my introduction into music that wasn’t so commercial. I feel like if you say you like Billie Holiday, you sound a bit bougie.My karaoke go-to song?Amy Winehouse, You Know I’m No Good. I’m bussing out Amy on any occasion, I’m a diehard fan. This was my anthem at Stoke Newington School where I went. We even had an Amy Winehouse concert. It was an amazing school with a lot of funding for the arts. A plethora of great artists have come out of that school.The song that is my actual favouriteWifey Riddim by Voltage. A love ballad by a grime artist. A song of teenage angst. It reminds me of being 15, a little rude girl in my feels, with my hair slicked down, sitting at the back of the bus.The best song to have sex toLet’s Straighten It Out by John L Watson. It feels like a make-up song. His voice is so soothing and sultry. If I ever got into an argument with my partner, I would play this to get him back into bed.The best song to play at a partyI’ll go with one of mine: BOTA (Baddest of Them All). I’ve been told it was the soundtrack to people’s best nights out and that people have got married to it. It’s a safe bet for me.The song I want played at my funeralIrma Thomas, Time Is on My Side.

But a new edition has made his final thoughts on his opera performable again, andOpera Raraand the BBC Symphony Orchestra got to do the big reveal.The standard version of La Rondine, performed at the premiere in 1917, ends with Magda – the “migrating swallow” of the title – nobly leaving her lovelorn Ruggero so that he can find someone more marriageable. Yet Puccini’s 1921 revision – his third version of the opera, the one he was finally happy with – has Ruggero angrily sending Magda away. It’s a big change, making the opera’s aftertaste bitter where it used to be sweet. There are lots of other differences too, notably some extra merrymaking for the chorus and orchestra in the second act.Few people got to hear this version when it was new – its premiere happened a few months before Puccini’s death, by which time he was too ill to advocate for it – and then in 1943 the score and orchestral parts were destroyed in the allied bombing of Milan. Now, though, thanks to reconstruction work by the musicologist Ditlev Rindom and some new orchestrations by Martin Fitzpatrick, opera companies have a choice of which version to use – and if a case needs making for this version, the recording this team has just finished making should do just that.The changes fell seamlessly into place here. Puccini’s music turns on a dime – so much flirting and dancing, yet so much wistfulness – and Carlo Rizzi’s conducting kept the sparkling orchestra on its toes, while the BBC Singers provided all the energy and precision needed in the expanded nightclub scene. The cast sang from behind music stands but did a decent job of acting nonetheless. Ermonela Jaho is a stage animal and her beautifully sung Magda drew us in even if her glowing soprano didn’t always outdo Rizzi’s orchestra. The supporting cast, including Juan Francisco Gatell as the wry, charming poet Prunier and Ellie Neate as the maid Lisette, was outstanding from top to bottom, but the tenor Iván Ayón-Rivas was first among equals here, his ardent Ruggero, complete with vibrant, beefy top notes, marking him out as a real rising star.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicBarbicanGiacomo PuccinireviewsShareReuse this content"

Their loving and feuding was spread across nine books and set against more than four decades of British history.Unlike Downton, the story features just the upstairs lot. They have come a long way from their Dorset farming descendants and are not the best sort of people: they hold money paramount with a need to “possess things”. Adapted by Shaun McKenna and Lin Coghlan, who previously adapted the story for radio, we see how this entitlement manifests in love, marriage and betrayal.There is plenty of human drama and the focus is on female experience across both parts, the first involving Irene (Fiona Hampton) and her marital rape at the hands of proprietorial husband, Soames (Joseph Millson) in the Victorian era. The second is that of Fleur (Flora Spencer-Longhurst), the daughter of Soames and our sometimes narrator, taking place after the Great War. It is less reliant on familiar melodrama and is more alive for it, featuring a star-crossed romance between Fleur and Irene’s son, Jon (Andy Rush), who are on either side of a family schism. We see strong-headed Fleur regarding love as an entitlement (like father, like daughter?). “You’re mine,” she repeats, proprietorially. Jon is a more passive, pallid, character compared to Irene’s lover, Philip Bosinney (also played by Rush).The first part is a kind of War and Peace Lite, showing how the fortunes of family members are shaped or constricted by the time in which they live, although the greater historical gyrations seem distant, with the briefest of talk about the Boers in South Africa and Queen Victoria’s funeral, but without being blended in the human drama. The post-war generation of the 1920s speak of life as a comedy and bear a hedonistic nihilism in Part 2 but this is repeatedly stated rather than felt.View image in fullscreenWar and Peace Lite … Fiona Hampton as Irene and Andy Rush as Philip Bosinney in a production photo from The Forsyte Saga Part 1.Photograph: Cam HarleSoames, the villain of the piece in Part 1, becomes the vulnerable father who must stand and watch his daughter repeating his mistakes. Irene, whose beauty seems to be anobjet d’artfor younger Soames, to possess alongside his art collection, captures the contained anguish and strangled options of a woman living in an age that renders her powerless as a wife, however privileged she might look from the outside. In some respects she is a British Anna Karenina, although she proves herself a survivor.This production’s initial run was in the intimate, fringe, space of the Park theatre, in London, where it was staged, innovatively, with an expertly spare set, consisting of little more than layers of velvet curtain. All the wealth of this family had to be imagined by the audience. It is the same in thisRoyal Shakespeare Companystaging but it has a different effect. It seems less experimental, more a slick Merchant Ivory-style costume drama that does the job of hooking you in.Still, it is realised with wit and pace by director Josh Roche. The minimal set design is striking in its red velvet opulence. Premium is on sound, composed and designed by Max Pappenheim, which is crisp and vivid (cooing wood pigeons, clopping horses, etc).There is a fluidity in switching of scenes that adds a psychological undertow: characters from the last scene stand watching the next, as if eavesdropping, or they loom, like spectres in the mind. Several performances involve the adept juggling of characters. But this imaginative form of storytelling is hemmed in by a familiar story of rich scions being typically rapacious and beastly. It is essentially a posh soap opera that slips down easily enough across five hours (if you see them both) but it is not exactly penetrating in character or story.At Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 10 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

They belong to leading man Don Lockwood (a charismatic Louis Gaunt), who taps out a quick dance before shrugging them on and transforming into his movie star persona. Immediately we’re in Hollywood, a world obsessed with appearances.It’s an apt start for a musical that pokes fun at the gap between reputation and reality. There’s Don, whose pre-Hollywood vaudeville career is at odds with his public image, and whose self-importance is quickly mocked by aspiring actress Kathy Selden (Carly Mercedes Dyer). Opposite him, co-star Lina Lamont’s on-screen glamour knocks up against her screeching voice, here delivered with squeaky relish by Laura Baldwin. The arrival of the talkies leaves the studio scrambling to save face, with entertaining if familiar consequences.View image in fullscreenPlays to the strengths of the Royal Exchange’s in-the-round space … Singin' in the Rain.Photograph: Johan PerssonThis version hits all the key beats with crowd-pleasing confidence. Everyone, of course, is waiting forthatnumber – and the creative team know it. When Don finally starts tap-dancing in the pre-interval downpour, Gaunt teases the audience with it, playfully threatening front-row spectators with the flick of his umbrella. It’s a smart way of tackling such an iconic moment: letting us all in on the game.This is characteristic of Shaw’s production, which – like his2018 revival of The Producers– plays to the strengths of the Royal Exchange’s in-the-round space. Audience members are very much involved, whether as adoring movie fans, high-fiving accomplices to Cosmo Brown’s hijinks (a comic highlight in the hands of Danny Collins), or confidantes to a riled Lina. With relatively little set, the action is carried along by the excellent ensemble and Alistair David’s high-energy choreography.The Exchange’s recent Christmas offerings have often had a more quirky or topical flavour, be it last year’sSpend Spend Spendor 2022’s musical telling of the life of Betty Boothroyd. This year, by contrast, the approach is sheer, unapologetic joy. As a respite from doom-scrolling, it feels both necessary and infectious. By the puddle-stomping finale, resistance is futile.Singin’ in the Rain is at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester, until 25 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsRoyal ExchangereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a handy edict for anyone adapting the many moralising, terrifying and bizarre episodes within Carlo Collodi’s 1883 novel. Charlie Josephine and Jim Fortune’s new family musical takes heed, barreling out of the blocks to cover an impressive chunk of Collodi’s story while swapping its darkness and finger-wagging for heartwarming lessons and boisterous humour.In a narrow-minded Italian town (hammily chorused “mamma mias!” kick off the blissful silliness to come), free-thinking inventor Geppetto is an outcast. His ticket to adventure arrives as a piece of talking wood, which he plans to craft into a fortune-winning puppet. Pinocchio, of course, has other ideas. But here, the puppet’s journey to boyhood isn’t just about learning what makes us good, but what makes us human. His scrapes along the way are born not out of wickedness but curiosity and impulsive energy – perfectly captured by the three puppeteers animating Peter O’Rourke’s simple wooden design (including Lee Braithwaite, who gives Pinocchio a voice wild and wonder-filled), and by Josephine’s book, which sees Pinocchio firing off life’s big questions only to interrupt the answers with yells of “I’m hungry!”View image in fullscreenLucy McCormick as The Blue Fairy in Pinocchio at Shakespeare’s Globe.Photograph: Johan PerssonUnder Sean Holmes’s meticulous direction, the 14-strong cast bring full-tilt fun to the villains and helpers Pinocchio meets along the way. Kerry Frampton and Lucy McCormick are deliciously dastardly as Fox and Cat, who leave him penniless, hanging by his foot in a tree, but Steven Webb is the standout as campy Giacomo Cricket and the terrifying, kidnapping Coachman.The ensemble are excellent, nailing Vicki Igbokwe-Ozoagu’s inventive choreography and giving us gorgeous soaring harmonies. Fortune’s songs, which range from rock’n’roll to ska, from pop to blues, are catchy and the lyrics (by Fortune and Josephine) are witty and poignant, but at times too fast and complicated to make out.The production leans into Collodi’s barminess (a chicken emerging from a cooked egg? “That makes perfect sense,” eye-rolls Cricket) and the Globe’s collapsible fourth wall, with meta-theatrical skewering of the audience and a perfect moment when Pinocchio’s puppeteers duck as he insists he’s moving unaided. But its biggest success is its addition of another transformation – that of Geppetto (played with humour and heart by Nick Holder) from natural but nervous caregiver to fully fledged father. A reminder that what makes us human is connection.Pinocchio is at the Globe theatre, London, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreShakespeare's GlobereviewsShareReuse this content"

The feed stations along the route were crammed with packets ofMeli honey wafflesandMeli honey cake. I ate so many that I suffered withdrawal symptoms after finishing the last of them at the end of the 167-mile route.On return visits to Ghent, my first port of call is any local supermarket to buy a couple of boxes of the sweet treats. After stocking up, I head to theTierenteyn-Verlentmustard shop on the Groentenmarkt. The 19th-century interior is like an old-fashioned apothecary filled with the soothing aromas of the spices and herbs used in the mustards they make fresh each day in wooden vats on the premises.From there, it’s a short hop toMokabonon Donkersteeg, a 1950s cafe that has seemingly been preserved in aspic with all the original sleek features, including a beautiful wooden bar, red walls and small round tables. At the front of the cafe is a small counter where they sell home-roasted coffee beans (they’ve been roasting since the late 1930s) that they then package in distinctive yellow and red paper bags.Oh, and on that first visit, I also came home with a Belgian bike.Andy PietrasikFrance: ‘Artfully arranged shelves are a siren call to drool’View image in fullscreenThe Bonne Maman jam section in a French supermarket.Photograph: Andy PietrasikThe middle aisle of my local Lidl has nothing on French supermarket booty. I once bought six big saucissons in ahypermarchébecause they each came with a free Laguiole-style steak knife. Eventually, even the dog started turning his nose up at dried sausage treats.You know what they say about French style; well, it carries on through to the shelves of French supermarkets, each brand artfully arranged with labels facing forward and issuing a siren call to linger and drool.There’s the perfectly aligned Bonne Maman jam section offering typically Gallic flavours such asmirabelle intense,coings(quince),figues violettes(fig) andreines-claudes(greengage). Identifying the different types of fromages blancs, crèmes fraîches and creams could qualify as a specialist section on Mastermind. Then there are the cheeses: there are countless varieties from Normandy, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.But my favourite aisles, aside from the wines, are the tins and terrines:terrine de sanglier(wild boar),terrine de lapin(rabbit),pâté du dimanche(pork and duck liver); cassoulet made with duck and Toulouse sausages; and my all-time Proustian taste – confit de canard. Then a quick dash through the snack section reaps armfuls of Lay’s crisps,paysannetapenadeflavour (only in France);galettes au beurre(buttery biscuits); and Haribo Pik Dragibus sweets.APItaly: ‘I have a weakness for sugared jellies and lemony beer’View image in fullscreenA confectionery shop in Florence.Photograph: John Bracegirdle/AlamyAs a child, I went on holiday abroad just twice – both times to visit family in Italy. That was the start of my love affair with Italian sweets. This is a country that loves a little something sugary and all shops, from big supermarkets to localalimentari,offer an Aladdin’s cave of candies. I have a particular weakness for fruit jellies and the joy of the Italian supermarket is that you can buy huge bags of them (my favourites areDufour’s Big Frut range), each individually wrapped.View image in fullscreenI also never leave Italy without several boxes ofBaci chocolates. There is something so beguiling about these “little kisses”, the mound of nutty filling encased in dark chocolate with a whole hazelnut popped on top and then wrapped in silver and blue paper with a message of love tucked inside. Don’t even think of buying them at the airport, where they mysteriously triple in price; instead, find a Prix, which is super cheap, or, for more choice, the big supermarket chains such as Coop and Conad.If you’ve driven to Italy, then a supermarket sweep will lend itself to armfuls of groceries worth bringing back – olive oil, pasta, balsamic vinegar and don’t forget the porcini mushrooms – but make sure you leave room for a couple of packs ofBirra Moretti Limone. While you may be tempted to scoop up a bottle of limoncello, everyone knows it never tastes as good once you get it home. Much better to get that citrusy hit in a beer. Basically, it’s an Italian shandy made from lager and Sicilian lemon juice, making it low alcohol – and delicious. Turns out those tangy, citrusy notes are the perfect accompaniment to a delicious bag of sugared jellies.Max BenatoIreland: ‘Skip the Taytos and get tortilla chips made in Tipperary’View image in fullscreenSmoked wild Atlantic salmon from the Woodcock Smokery, Skibbereen.Photograph: Paul Sherwood PhotographyFor Irish expats on a trip home and international tourists alike, it is almost mandatory that you stock up on Barry’s tea and Tayto crisps before leaving the country. They won’t let you through airport security on your way out if youdon’thave at least one big red box of teabags and a few jumbo packs of salted potato snacks crammed into your suitcase.Fine as these exemplars of Irish marketing ingenuity are, I’m here to tell you that other great products do exist; it’s just that sometimes you need to dig around a bit to find them. Most Irish supermarkets supply a range of farmhouse cheeses such as Gubbeen and Durrus, which are wonderful, but I’d go the extra mile for Boyne Valley Bán, a magnificent hard goat’s cheese available atSheridans cheesemongers, which has shops and concessions around the country.I’d also track down a big jar ofHarry’s Nut Butter(the original paprika flavour with the shades-wearing elephant on the label) and White Mausu’s dangerously addictivepeanutrāyu– both easy to find in delis and some supermarkets too (SuperValu usually has a good selection of small Irish producers).I might lose my passport for saying this, but I’d skip the Taytos and grab a bag ofBlanco Niño tortilla chips, made in the very un-Mexican county of Tipperary but no less spicily delicious for it. And be sure to pick up some smoked fish –Burren Smokehouseis good, and widely available, but Sally Barnes’sWoodcock Smokery, though harder to come by, is the gold standard.Killian FoxGermany: ‘I head for in-store bakeries and deli counters’View image in fullscreenGerman bakeries sell a huge variety of breads.Photograph: Jurgen Wiesler/AlamyOne of the things I miss when I’m travelling away from Germany is the fantastic bakeries. Most of the big supermarket chains – such as Edeka and Rewe (which tend to be pricier than Aldi and Lidl) – have in-store bakeries selling everything from pastries to pretzels.But few things say “home” to me more than the aroma of freshly bakedBrötchen. I don’t even know what the proper translation would be – bread roll? Bun? Bap? – but you can get them in many different varieties, with sunflower or poppy seeds, made from sourdough, or as a soft pretzel roll. Fill them with cream cheese, cheese or meat from the deli counters for a good value lunch or breakfast.Germany’s highly federal system is reflected in its regional cuisine – which is sometimes represented in the fresh counters, too. If you’re in Bavaria, please try a pretzel and white sausage with mild mustard, or in northern Germany a bread roll with battered fish or pickled herring. And if you’re longing for a sugar hit, Hamburg’s finestFranzbrötchenwith butter and cinnamon should do the trick.From the confectionary aisle I would stock up on Ritter Sport chocolate and vegan gummy bears or liquorice fromKatjes, one of Germany’s largest sweet makers and a pioneer in using plant-based ingredients and natural flavourings.However, the thing I miss most about German supermarkets when I’m abroad is the good old deposit system, calledpfánd, where you return plastic bottles and cans to the supermarket and get up to 25 cents each. They then get recycled. Throwing them in the bin just does not feel right.Anna EhlebrachtExplore more on these topicsShopping tripsFood and drinkEurope holidaysShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At home or in a restaurant? It’s at this juncture of the year, withChristmasdinner hurtling towards us, that you may well find yourself muttering: “Well, we could always go out!” Who could blame any home cook for wanting to shove this great burden on to someone else’s back, especially since every culinary TV show, magazine article and advertising break since mid-November has hammered home what a colossal faff Christmas dinner actually is. No, it’snotjust a slightly posh Sunday roast with a few more guests.Christmas dinner in the UK these days is more like a cross between dinner at Balmoral and 4 July at Mar-a-Lago. The table has to be heaving with holly-embossed crockery, the carrots must be bejewelled in star anise and Himalayan pink pepper, the turkey has to be brined in aromatic salt water and your roasties shaken in polenta and smothered in duck fat. If you’re the designated martyr organising proceedings, field-marshalling everything and cooking this tinsel-strewn palaver, it is common to try instead to divert it all to the local pub, where they’re doing “turkey and all the trimmings” for £79 a head (and including a cracker and a pre-dinner “glass of something sparkly”).After several attempts at spending Christmas “out”, however, I’m still on the fence as to whether or not it’s really worth it. Chances are, if you’re the designated cook, as I often am, you’ll also find yourself equally burdened as the designated table-finder, taxi-booker and exasperated berk trying to get Aunt Agnes up to the Queen’s Head by 3pm, mainly because she won’t on any account miss the king’s speech, won’t eat turkey without bread sauce and would ideally like herJim Reevescassette played over the pub’s sound system.Agnes’ demands will be paltry compared with those of your vegan cousin, however, or your father with Alzheimer’s who may or may not keep his trousers on for the entire meal, and, of course, the teenager in the family, who will go missing on Christmas Eve and slink in the next day at 7pm with a love bite and hot rock burns down their Christmas jumper.I once paid the same price as a holiday in the Algarve for a two-person Christmas Day lunch at a fancy five-star hotelTen years ago, I shepherded the Dent flock to a local pub in the Lake District for a twinkly table beside a log fire, where a traditional big bird and figgy pudding-type menu was served. The cooking was passable – soggy parsnips, dry turkey, over-sweet cranberry and a drought of gravy delivered in stingy jugs – and the service was just about sanguine, bearing in mind that not one hospitality person in history has ever truly wanted to work on the 25th. Perhaps that’s the rub with Christmas dinner service: anyone working clearly drew the short straw.One year, I paid the same price as a short holiday in the Algarve for a two-person Christmas Day lunch at a fancy five-star London hotel. The dining room was classily decked out in twinkly lights, all gold and bronze, and there was nothing so naff as a Christmas tree, of course, but rather posh, frankincense room fragrance and crackers that cracked expensively, didn’t have jokes but did have posh prizes such as silk scarves inside. The room was filled with unhappily married trophy wives, all plodding their way through turkey ballotine with fragments of cranberry sap – just one of 11 courses – and they kept us there for so long that the meal started eating into Twixmas. When we left, London was in a huge traffic jam , because thousands of people had driven in to see the lights, and I spent Christmas evening in a gridlock on the Holloway Road, instead of eating aPaxosandwich while lying horizontal and watchingThe Vicar of Dibley.This year, meanwhile, I have already made two reservations for Christmas dinner and cancelled them both. That’s mainly because I can’t quite commit to taking Charles out to our local bistro for the annual blowout, despite being exhausted after filming MasterChef right up to the wire, because, well, I know that, by that stage of the festive delirium, there will be nowhere quite like home.The truth is, despite moaning about cooking Christmas dinner and the raggle-taggle bunch of family and friends who will inevitably appear with demands for a beef option because they don’t like turkey, vegan roasties and something chocolatey and stacked high with gold leaf because they don’t eat Christmas pudding, well, it turns out that I actually quite enjoy the kitchen carnage. It’s a rare moment, when the plates go down and 10 dirty pans are coped with all at once, that I feel like a grown-up, and that I’m doing something my mother, if she could see me, would be proud of – not least because I am carrying on the long line of angry matriarchs who, despite the odds, got Christmas done. You can let someone in a white hat take the strain with your sprouts and spare your angry tears, but where’s the fun in that?Explore more on these topicsFoodGrace Dent on restaurantsRestaurantsChristmasChristmas food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s versatile, full of vitamins, and perfect on a winter night. Here’s how to make the most of itTim DowlingSun 7 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 05.04 ESTShareIt’s not good news: despite a lot of messaging about healthy eating, Britons consume 12% less vegetables per week than they did in 1974, when the government’s FamilyFoodsurvey began. And while the consumption of some specific vegetables – courgettes, say – has risen over the past 50 years, others have experienced a sharp decline. Among the biggest losers is cabbage. Cabbage consumption in the UK dropped by 80%, beaten only by brussels sprouts (87%) which are, after all, a kind of cabbage.This is a tragedy, not just because cabbage is an unsung superfood containing essential vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, as well as protein and dietary fibre, but because it’s a flexible, abundant and potentially delicious culinary ingredient. It even comes in different colours.Cabbage can sometimes seem uninspiring – especially at this time of year, when there’s a lot of it about – but it doesn’t have to be that way. Here are 17 delicious uses for cabbage, guaranteed to get you eating more of it.View image in fullscreenMeera Sodha’s cabbage peanut butter and gochujang noodles.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian. Food Styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay.

Herwhite cabbage, peanut butter and gochujang noodlesis a good place to begin: a recipe so simple it’s targeted at students, takes about 30 minutes to make, requires no particular skill, and nothing – beyond perhaps gochujang, a Korean red chili paste – you won’t likely find in your cupboard.It’s worth remembering that you don’t have to cook cabbage at all – finely shredded, it’s great raw ina straightforward coleslawor in a spicierJaipur slaw– Sodha again, this time from her cookbook Made in India – with carrot, red onion and mooli (daikon radish). When I can’t find mooli, I have substituted kohlrabi to no disadvantage, even though they’re not really the same thing at all. I’m guessing celeriac would also serve.ForNigel Slater’s just-warm bean and cabbage saladthe cabbage is blanched in boiling water for no more than a minute – that doesn’t really count as cooking.Ironically, one of the problems with cabbage is how much you get for your money – it’s difficult to expend more than half a head on a single evening meal, and you invariably end with some left over.Okonomiyaki– Japanese cabbage pancakes – are an easy way to use up the other half of a white cabbage, with a simple sauce made from soy, honey and ketchup.Rachel Roddy’s cabbage and sausage cakeuses the outer leaves to create a sealed parcel of cabbage and sausage meat. Cabbage soup has a reputation as a hideous privation, but the reputation is undeserved – cabbage soup can be great.Yotam Ottolenghi’s cabbage and pot barley soupwith whipped feta may be good for you, but it’s no kind of privation, whileJosé Pizarro’s smoky cabbage and white bean soup, with cured chorizo and two kinds of paprika, sounds downright indulgent.View image in fullscreenNigel Slater’s cabbage with mussels.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverFelicity Cloake likes braised red cabbageat Christmas, and it makes a welcome addition to the day’s feast, if only because it has a long cooking time, which mostly requires nothing of you.Keralan cabbage thoran, on the other hand, cooks in under 10 minutes.Slater’s cabbage with musselsis a handy midweek dinner for two to have in your repertoire, especially as it makes use of dark green cabbage leaves.View image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s kimchi.Photograph: Dan Matthews/The GuardianOne of the trendiest things you can do to a cabbage is burn it. We may have been over-served with recipes featuring charred quarter-wedges of hispi cabbage (the pointy kind), but the idea is still a welcome one – scorch your hispi wedges under a grill, on a barbecue or in a ridged pan, then dress as desired, perhaps withdried miso and ponzu, or withherb yoghurt and shallots, or as part ofThomasina Miers’ cabbage Caesar salad.The other trendy thing you can do with cabbage is make kimchi out of it.Cloake’s masterclass versionwill put you on the right track, but if you haven’t got the patience for long-term fermentation, thesequick pickled cabbage wedges from Alex Elliott-Howerywill be ready to eat in as little as three days.Finally, a pasta recipe:Jamie Oliver’s savoy cabbage and pancetta farfalle.

Verity’s attraction to a colleague changed all thatHow do you do it? Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toSun 7 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTShareVerity, 45I never felt that stomach-churning excitement and uncertainty we associate with desireA couple of years ago, Darya and I had a crisis in our relationship. I developed an infatuation with a colleague, a woman who made me feel nervous and insecure, in a way I never had with Darya. I started to question whether I’d ever been attracted to Darya, because she had only ever made me feel loved and comfortable – I never felt that stomach-churning excitement and uncertainty we associate with desire.Darya and I got together 20 years ago, but were friends first.Sexwas fun and pleasurable, but it was our conversations and emotional connection that really made me fall in love with her. As the years went by, sex became something I did to keep things ticking along. Part of the problem was that we both lacked sexual confidence.The early ‘90s was not a great time to be a gay teenager in the UK. I can remember my mother making homophobic comments about women who she suspected of being lesbians.When Darya and I met, neither of us felt comfortable describing our desires or suggesting new things, so sex grew more inhibited and predictable. But when I confessed to Darya about my attraction to my colleague, we were finally forced to confront the issues with our sex life. One turning point was when I asked Darya to slow down.What if the degree to which a lover makes you feel panicked and sick isn’t the best way of measuring attraction?When we have sex now, we start by spending time just lying side by side, stroking each other’s bodies and seeing where that takes us. Romantic movies train you to think of sex as an uncontrollable urge that just possesses you, but Darya and I have learned how to build desire that is no less strong for being consciously cultivated.Darya has never made me feel sick and panicked with desire. But what if the degree to which a lover makes you feel panicked and sick isn’t the best way of measuring attraction? What if you can feel safety and desire at the same time?Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

It’s shocking it took us 19 years to work that outFor years, I would try to instigate sex and Verity would reject me. That really knocked my confidence. Sometimes, months would go by and sex wouldn’t happen at all. We didn’t talk about sex, because I think we were both afraid that to do so would mean admitting we were done.This is how we do it: ‘I do get jealous and question whether I’m cut out for non-monogamy’Read moreIn June last year, Verity told me she had feelings for a colleague, and we hit a critical point. I actually threw Verity out of the house for a night. I said: “You need to leave, I can’t take this any more.” But in the middle of this horrendous time, we started having more sex. I’ve read online that it’s called “clinging-on-for-dear-life sex”, because everything is falling apart but you hold on. We started to talk about sex, too. I finally felt able to talk openly with Verity because I thought I’d already lost everything so I might as well be honest.If you had told me 18 months ago that sex could be like this between us, I wouldn’t have believed youOne thing we realised is that we are very different, sexually. On our 19th anniversary, Verity told me to “slow down”. She had always been very quick to orgasm, so sex lasted a very short time. That was a very powerful moment, because we realised that Verity is a slow burner, whereas I am a fast burner. It’s shocking that it took 19 years for us to work that out. Verity is the main instigator of sex now.We now have a daily couple’s chat, where sex is mentioned casually. If you had told me 18 months ago that sex could be like this between us, I wouldn’t have believed you. But the wonderful thing about sex and relationships is that nothing stays the same. People can change, so sex can change too.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My reasoning is that if we’re thinking about migration as something that happens not just to the UK but to the world, in many cases the UK government is recruiting workers from countries like west Africa, where there’s a skills shortage. I don’t think that’s an ethical thing to do.Dining across the divide: ‘I don’t want to live in a white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant country with warm beer’Read moreSamuelIt’s not that Catrina’s unwelcoming or racist; it’s more that she was concerned that by allowing a vacuum in our system, which needs doctors etc to come and work for us, we were creating a brain drain elsewhere. I said it reminded me of thatStewart Lee anti-Ukip sketch: “I think the brightest and best should stay in Bulgaria”. She said that was her favourite sketch.CatrinaA lot of net migration comes from an international student base, and universities cannot afford to turn anyone away. I absolutely love living in a multicultural country, but this doesn’t benefit anyone.SamuelI understood her point. But the reason people want to come here is that we have such an amazing higher education system. It’s not international students who are the problem; it’s putting profit before people.View image in fullscreenSharing plateCatrinaWhen it comes to the wokerati, yes, it has gone too far. But I say that because I think there’s an overemphasis on individual action in contemporary “woke” politics. Racism and sexism are systemic societal issues, and we all participate in society. Individualising it makes people reluctant to engage.SamuelCatrina and I are probably thinking of people like Ash Sarkar or Slavoj Žižek, who argue that the problem with woke culture is that it’s dividing the left. It doesn’t need a debate: you treat human beings as you’d like to be treated, you go through life showing love and respect, and people return it to you.View image in fullscreenFor aftersCatrinaSam was more optimistic than me about the potential for AI and technology. I think social media is really complicating our politics and diminishing people’s quality of life.SamuelIt’s difficult to completely disagree that social media algorithms keep us trapped in doom spirals. But I come at it from the point of view that you’ve got all of these incredible advances in technology over the last 200 years, that speak to the desire of humans to connect with each other and find answers to the puzzles we’ve been wondering about for ever.

Even in the face of repeated warnings to protect online accounts, a new study reveals that “admin” is the most commonly used password in the UK.The second most popular, “123456”, is also unlikely to keep hackers at bay.The annual review of the top 200 most common passwords by the tech company NordPass makes depressing reading for security experts, the police and anti-fraud bodies.Although cybersecurity experts keep repeating that simple passwords are extremely easy to guess, these warnings are going unheeded.In the UK, words, number combinations, and common keyboard patterns dominate the top 20. Different variations of the word “password” take up as many as five of these spots, with simple numeric combinations, including “12345678” and then “123456789” using another five. So far, so easy to hack.View image in fullscreenUse a password management tool to help with more complicated secure passwords.Photograph: Koshiro K/AlamyIt’s not just a problem here – Australians, Americans and Germans also use “admin” more than any other password when accessing websites, apps and logging in to their computers. Around the world, “123456” emerges as the most popular.“Despite all efforts in cybersecurity education and digital awareness over the years, data reveals only minor improvements in password hygiene,” says Karolis Arbaciauskas of NordPass, a password manager that aims to keep details secure.“About 80% of data breaches are caused by compromised, weak, and reused passwords, and criminals will intensify their attacks as much as they can until they reach an obstacle they can’t overcome.”What the scam looks likeAt a time when many of us grapple with a growing number of passwords, it seems people are picking the easy option. Criminals are well aware of this and will use the obvious options during a systematic attack on someone’s accounts.“The problem with easy-to-remember passwords is that most of them can be cracked or guessed in seconds using a technique called a ‘dictionary attack’ – a systematic method of guessing a password by trying many common words and their simple variations,” Arbaciauskas says.View image in fullscreenHackers use a ‘dictionary attack’, a method of trying common words and numbers and their variations.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA“Another problem is that people tend to reuse them quite often. Users cite having too many accounts to create, and remember, unique passwords for all of them. That is terrible. People who use weak passwords, or reuse them, risk their digital lives and their identities.”Recent research from Virgin Media O2suggests four out of every five people use the same, or nearly identical, passwords on online accounts, giving an almost open door for hackers to compromise log-ins.You might be alerted to an attack by a message advising that you have been trying to change your email address, or other details, connected to an account.What to doMake your passwords long and strong. This could be by combining three random words (eg, applepenbiro) or mixing numbers, letters and special characters.Don’t reuse the same password. The rule of thumb is that each account should have a unique password because if one account gets broken into, hackers can use the same credentials for other accounts.Change any passwords that are variations on the same word now, starting with the important sets of accounts: banks, email, work and mobile.Use password managers – these are often integrated into web browsers. Apple has iCloud Keychain, while Android phones have Google Password Manager, both of which can generate and save complicated passwords.Two-factor authentication (2FA) is something you can set up for your email, and other important online accounts, to add an extra layer of security. It involves providing something that only you can access – for example, a code sent to you by text message. You should turn 2FA on for every service that offers it.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsComputingInternetCybercrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photography byJulia KochetovaSun 7 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 15.34 ESTShareFor almost all of their 62-day deployment on the frontline east of Pokrovske, Bohdan and Ivan hid – first in a village shop, then, after a deadly firefight with Russian soldiers, in a tiny basement where the infantrymen from Ukraine’s31st Brigade had to survive seven more weeks.Food, water, cigarettes and other supplies were airlifted in by a friendly drone, their toilet was their 3 sq metre room, their nearest comrades 200 metres or so away. Their only hope was to remain underground, because they knew if they were detected a Russian drone could kill them all.Though the fight in Ukraine is characterised as a war of remotely piloted craft, the role of infantry is easily forgotten. In large parts of the front, the job of Ukrainian ground troops is to quietly hold a position, while danger looms overhead. “I can’t sleep properly now,” says Bohdan, easily the more talkative of the pair. “It’s too quiet for me.”View image in fullscreenRuslan (left), a battalion commander, at the command point of the 31st brigade at the undisclosed location in eastern Ukraine.When the infantrymen headed out to the front at the end of September, a diplomatic effort to end the near four-year war after the Alaska summit appeared to have faltered. But by the time the crew had returned at the end of November, from the south-east of the Dnipropetrovsk region, a newRussian-US peace planhad emerged.Hand over all of Donetsk province, just east of the soldiers’ position, abandon occupied territory to Russia, give up permanently on joining Nato, and only then, Moscow said, it would be willing to consider peace. It was in effect a demand for a surrender. Ukraine objected. But a revised plan with Ukrainian input was then deemed “unacceptable” by Russia.If Ukraine fights on, it is infantrymen like Bohdan, 41, who installed heating insulation before he volunteered in 2022, and Ivan, a 45-year-old handyman who joined up in July, who will have to risk their lives and resist for some time to come.“Nobody, of course, wants the war to continue because there have been a lot of sacrifices, a lot of victims. But at the same time we don’t want to give up, to give our land because we don’t then want those sacrifices to be wasted,” Bohdan says, dirt still on his hands and uniform.View image in fullscreenIvan and Bodhan sitting during their interview.It is a familiar sentiment across the unit. Andriy, a 31-year-old sergeant responsible for drone operations at the unit’s command point, when asked about Ukraine handing over land for peace responds by saying, “Do you want me to be honest?”, before adding: “It’s fucking bullshit.” A group of comrades who have been quietly listening in burst out laughing in agreement.But for all the defiance of Bohdan and many other soldiers like him, there are strains elsewhere. A Ukrainian military psychologist said between 3% and 5% of those returning from frontline deployments needed further examination or treatment, in addition to those killed or wounded. Bohdan and Ivan were being monitored to ensure they could be sent back to the front.A record 21,602 went absent without leave from the Ukrainian army in October. A frequent complaint across the military is the lack of reserves, meaning there is a shortage of troops available for rotations. Long deployments at the front are common. It emerged last month that a platoon medic with the 30th Brigade, Serhiy Tyshchenko, spent 471 days in one combat position in Donetsk province.Map showing location of PokrovskeBohdan and Ivan had not expected to be on the frontline for so long. “I told my wife I’ll be there for two weeks,” says Bohdan, a father of five. “She was calling everyone here, almost eating their brains, asking them why was it taking so long?” But the soldiers did not know of their families’ concerns.While frontline drone crews have access to the internet through Starlink and can video call their families, the infantry have no such option. They can send radio messages home, but family members are not allowed to send messages back in return.View image in fullscreenAnti-drone nets being constructed on a road in the Dnipropetrovsk region.The ubiquity of drones, whose feeds are visible at command points well behind the frontlines, has fundamentally changed Russian tactics. Armoured attacks, common in 2023, have long been abandoned, because so many Russian tanks were destroyed.Instead they have been replaced by a perpetual probing of scattered Ukrainian positions to find weak points, or weaker brigades, which can be followed up by more substantive attacks, as appears to have happened east of Huliaipole, in Zaporizhzhia province to the south-west, where about six miles of territory was lost last month.Ruslan, a battalion commander in the 31st Brigade, says the Russians “are infiltrating in groups of two or three people” to avoid being spotted by drones in the “kill zone” about 15km (9 miles) on either side of the front. Some rely on thermal hoods of varying quality to try to avoid being detected by heat-seeking cameras that so clearly mark out a human body in white on black.View image in fullscreenRuslan, a battalion commander of the 31st Brigade, says fog and heavy rain have made it easier for Russians to avoid detection.They are “95% likely to be killed if we see them,” the commander says, though he acknowledges the worsening weather conditions – fog or heavy rain – mean it has become easier for the Russians to accumulate numbers behind the frontline with the aim of attacking and exposing the defenders’ positions.For Ivan and Bohdan, a moment of danger came suddenly, at 7am one morning, when three Russians stumbled near their location appearing “across the road 10, 15 metres away”. The Ukrainians shot back immediately, killing two, but the survivor was able to call in drone strikes on their position, before he in turn was killed by a Ukrainian drone.The infantrymen scattered. After a time, they regrouped in the basement, isolating at about the time the US envoySteve Witkoff was wooing the Kremlinwith phone calls offering up Ukrainian territory. At one point, a Russian Baba Yaga drone bombed the entrance, half blocking it with rubble. “We were thinking it would come back. Two more mines and we’d have been done,” Bohdan recalls.View image in fullscreenIvan shows a selfie he took when he was on a 62-day deployment.No other strikes followed, so the soldiers concluded it was a speculative attack, though it became harder to scramble outside and pick up supplies dropped from above. Gear recovered included a fresh pair of boots for Bohdan, though they were two sizes too big for him.It was the trip back that was the most terrifying. The journey to safety was a 10-15km walk, with drones making it too dangerous to travel by any vehicle, an easy target in the open countryside. A relief team had arrived, but for three days it was too dangerous to depart.When the moment came, the trio were given just 10 minutes’ notice. The moment was opportune because visibility had deteriorated overhead: “It was rainy and foggy,” Bohdan says. Even so, the walk back took three days – “we were not moving in the night”, he explains – the men hid in tree lines in the dark to avoid drones with thermal sights.Finally, it was possible to pick them up. But even then, there was a final moment of drama. “Just when we were driving we saw another car that was hit by a drone. So there wasn’t a relief moment then,” Bohdan says. Now, in the calm of the rear, they feel a little more relaxed, ready to return “in a week maximum” if needed.Are they ready to risk their lives in another 62-day stint? “What choice do we have?” Bohdan says, adding there is no reason why after all this fighting Ukraine should have to accept a bad deal. “We have a saying in Ukraine: if you let a cat under the table, it will appear on the table. It’s the same with Putin.”"

Chaos’: Red Rose superstar Ellie Kildunne on confidence, cowboy dances and why it’s cool to be differentSimon HattenstoneKildunne is known for her startling speed and audacious tries, but there’s more to the talented full-back than rugby, from a passion for photography to a sideline in DIY tattooingSun 7 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareEllie Kildunne says it’s not quite sunk in yet. A couple of months on fromwinning the Rugby Union World Cupwith her England teammates, she’s still on a high. I ask if she slept with her winner’s medal by her bed the night they won. “Thatnight?” She gives me a look. “It’sstillby my bed. Every day. I wake up and the medal’s next to my bed. And it’s, like,as if!”But Kildunne is not resting on her laurels. She says the medal is also a reminder of what’s left to achieve – for her, and for women’s rugby in general. “Your heart’s telling you that you’ve done it, but I need to refocus. So it’s about how can we win the prem, how can we win another Six Nations, more World Cups? How can we keep fans coming to games? We’ve sold out Twickenham, so how do we do it again?”Kildunne is a freak, as she tells me time and again. First of all, there’s the way she plays the game. Rugby is a team sport involving strict discipline and complex rules. But Kildunne, a full-back, plays largely on instinct and is impossible to predict. She has phenomenal speed and stamina (an unusual combination), exceptional grace and strength, pops up anywhere on the pitch, and could out-sidestep Fred Astaire. In 2024, she was namedWorld Rugby women’s 15s player of the year– the greatest individual honour in the game.In September’s World Cup final against Canada, she scored a try that reminds me of Diego Maradona’s legendary goal for Argentina against England in 1986 (widely regarded as football’s greatest World Cup goal ever). Kildunne caught the ball on the left flank about 30 yards from Canada’s try line, she ran through two players, sprinted past a third, swerved past a fourth, then a fifth, raced past a sixth and seventh before planting the ball down in the middle of the goal. Genius.One of the great sights of the World Cup was seeing Kildunne and her fellow England teammates Meg Jones and Jess Breach celebrate scoring with the cowboy dance – one hand on the hip, the other throwing imaginary lassos above their heads, while bobbing side to side on their imaginary horses. Joyous.I just thought it was weird that other girls didn’t play, because I knew how much I enjoyed itView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Ingram/The Guardian. Cardigan:Adidas. Joggers:Gymshark. Trainers: New Balance fromSchuh. Earrings:MissomaKildunne scored another audacious try in the semi-final a week before, crossing the entire pitch as she swerved past player after player. She admits this try gave her an extra buzz because it came after a spat with the opposition. “Just before, I’d given one of the French girls a bit of chat, told her to shush – it got out on camera.” Does she often sledge the opposition? “I try not to, but the French woman pushed me and another one of the girls in the back. I’ve done it before, when I scored a try and a girl was getting in my ear. Before I put the ball down, I waved at her. That caused a bit of havoc as well.” Do her opponents think she’s arrogant? “I’m sure people do, but I’m not big-headed.”We meet in Guildford, Surrey, at the training ground of Harlequins, her club team. Her self-belief is obvious from the off. She’s a supreme athlete, and she knows it. But there’s more. She’s also a brand expert – the brand in question being Ellie Kildunne. To be fair, she is a hugely marketable asset – brilliant, good fun, eloquent and thoroughly eccentric. Ask her to describe herself, and she does so in one word: chaos.One of the unusual things about Kildunne is that both she and her younger brother Sam play rugby (he is a winger for Ampthill club and has played for England rugby sevens) despite coming from a non-rugby household. She grew up in a remote farmhouse in West Yorkshire, but there were families with kids on either side, so she played football with the boys from an early age. Kildunne is a Liverpool fan, and she adored Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres. One day, she was playing outside with her neighbours and they were called in because they had to go to rugby training. If they were doing rugby, Kildunne reasoned, why shouldn’t she? And that’s how it all started. As with football, she was the only girl on a boys’ team. Did she feel weird? “I didn’t think about it, because it was my normal. I just thought it was weird that other girls didn’t play, because I knew how much I enjoyed it. I knew I was different. And I don’t think that’s a bad feeling. It’s cool to be different.”View image in fullscreenPhotographs: Alex Ingram/The Guardian. Tracksuit:Adidas. Trenchcoat:T/Ala. Vest:Cos. Earrings:MissomaHas she always had that confidence? “Yes. I was talking to someone about it the other day. I remember having this thing in my head when people asked me why I played rugby. I must have been 11 at the time, and I said, ‘If you go to a farmers’ market and there are loads of green apples, but in the middle there’s a red apple, which apple do you think about the most? You think about the red apple. I’m that red apple.’ I’ve always been that red apple. I’m not a sheep.”Kildunne, aged 26, says her childhood was idyllic. Her mother (who works in marketing) and her father (who trains sales people) encouraged her and Sam to do whatever they wanted. Their home was so remote they weren’t in a school catchment area, so her parents made sacrifices and educated the children privately. Did her school have great sports facilities? “Yeah, but I don’t think that made me what I am today, because private schools are very traditional. I was told to play netball not rugby, and I wiggled my way in by getting my old rugby coach to come in and say, ‘Give her a chance.’” She was allowed to play in the B team with the boys.At school, she was well behaved (not a single detention), academic (all A*s and As in her GCSEs), but still chaos. If she wasn’t forgetting things, she was losing them, whether it was her gum shield or boots for rugby or her planner for work. Her weekends were dedicated to sport – rugby league Saturday morning, rugby union Saturday afternoon, football Sunday. “I played as much sport as I could, for as long as I could.”Were she and Sam competitive? “Incredibly. Over everything. We were so close, but we were really competitive. We still are, but it’s a lot more collaborative now. He watches my games and I watch his, and we talk about stuff in the most honest way – like, ‘That pass was shit!’” Nice, I say. She laughs. “But when you get a compliment you know it’s meant.”Kildunne began playing rugby league for Keighley Albion and rugby union for Keighley, then moved on to West Park Leeds and Castleford. Kildunne was so single-minded she didn’t even consider that her parents might object when, aged 16, she told them she wanted to leave Yorkshire for Gloucester so she could join the semi-professional women’s rugby club Gloucester-Hartpury. Her parents weren’t happy and, for the first time in her life, they told her no. But she wasn’t going to be deterred. After much talk, and the shedding of many tears, they conceded. Two years later, in autumn 2017, she made her England debut as a substitute against Canada. Of course, she scored a try. And it’s gone on like that ever since. She has played 57 times for England scoring 235 points.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenKildunne against Canada in 2017 (top), during the Women’s Rugby World Cup final between Canada and England in September (centre) and celebrating their win (above). Photographs: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian; Naomi Baker/Getty ImagesI admit to her I know sod all about rugby. She seems delighted. “I love that. That’s cool. I don’t like it when journalists know all about rugby, because they just ask me the rugby questions you can search on Wikipedia, whereas I want people to know Ellie, not Ellie Kildunne the rugby player.” I reckon I’m not the only rugby ignoramus who’s a fan of hers. At the World Cup she made a splash, not just with the brio and audacity of her play, but with her cascade of corkscrew curls, big grin (few people smile as they’re playing any sport, let alone rugby) and, of course, the cowboy dance.Where does the dance come from? “Me and Meg. Nobody knows this part of the story. We went on holiday with a few of the girls to Zante [also known as Zakynthos] a few years ago, just before Covid, and we had quad bikes. And we were, like, should we just be cowboys? Go and eat doughnuts and stuff. We were just being silly, like jumping off walls into the pool. Then when Meg came back into the Red Roses, we were in New Zealand [for the 2021 World Cup, which took place in 2022 due to Covid] and a bit bored on this day off, and there were scooters, and we were, like … should we play cowboys?” So what does it mean to be a cowboy? “Have fun!”Do you have to be hard to play rugby? “It depends what position you play, but you’ve got to be pretty hard. The biggest thing is mentally you’ve got to be tough. I’m not going to be running into people. My job is to avoid people.” You still get whacked though, don’t you? “You do. People want to hit you. There are times when I question why the hell am I doing this?” Really? “Well, when it’s raining outside, and someone’s just stood on my hand, my toes are freezing and I’m running into someone who’s tackling me – you do think, why do I do this?” She stops, and smiles. But I never think Idon’twant to do this. I wouldn’t do anything else for the world.”What’s the worst injury she’s suffered? “Ach, I haven’t had major injuries,” she says dismissively. “I’ve broken my hand, torn my hamstring, torn my calf, had shoulder surgery. They’re not too bad, touch wood, but it’s all part of it.” I wonder what she considers a serious injury.This is the golden age of women’s sport. What British women have achieved over the past couple of years will shape the next generationKildunne is not built like a prop forward (rugby’s classic brick shithouse – think Joe Marler, as seen in Celebrity Traitors). But look at some of the photos of her on Instagram and you can see just how defined she is – six-pack, washboard stomach, ripped biceps. She says she was reluctant to muscle up in the early days. It simply wasn’t her idea of womanhood. “I remember being at school and everyone wanted to be a Hollister model – tiny runway models – and everyone wanted the thigh gap. I didn’t want to put on loads of muscle mass because I was young and impressionable, and you see what you see on social media.” But Kildunne came to understand her lack of strength was holding her back. “I got a stress fracture in my knee because I wasn’t strong enough. So I realised I needed to knuckle down and get stronger and more robust. I had to flick a switch and learn to enjoy the gym; enjoy being strong.” And she does now.Thankfully, she says, the Hollister ideal is changing. Kildunne points out that the more there are visible, successful women in sports such as rugby, bodybuilding and weightlifting, the greater the variety of role models for girls and young women. “Now there are so many women of different sizes and with muscles, and they’re prepared to show them off on their personal Instagrams. So, where it used to be the tiny, slight women on magazine covers, now you’ve got people like Ilona Maher, the American rugby player, who is a superstar and incredibly strong. Now, the younger generation has Ellie Kildunne to look up to.” For a second, I assume she’s talking about somebody else. But I soon discover she often talks about herself in the third person.“I’m proud of my body. My body is what’s made me an Olympian and a world champion. I’ve got muscles on my arms and shoulders when I’m wearing a dress and I’ve got strong legs. I do have a bit of tone on my tummy. And all this helps make me a good rugby player, and keeps me on the pitch.”Even when she started playing rugby for Gloucester-Hartpury, she didn’t really believe she could make a career of it. The ticket sales and salaries still fall far short of the elite men’s game, which, in turn, falls far short of elite football. A couple of years ago, Kildunne said top-ranked British players, such as herself, made £40,000-£50,000 a year from the game. She wasn’t talking about a salary; that was a combination of club wages, fees for playing international matches and the few advertising/marketing opportunities that existed. And even this would have been unimaginable a few years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I think it’s against my contract to say what I’m on, but you get your England salary, which was upped just before the World Cup, your Quins salary, your PWR (Premiership Women’s Rugby) salary, and then your commercial brands. We’ve gone from doing free appearances to signing deals with brands. It’s a nightmare for mortgages, because we get paid in all these different formats.”But, she says, it’s about so much more than the money. Kildunne has often said it’s easy to have great moments in sport, but she wants to be part of something bigger, something more significant. She is determined to be in the vanguard of a movement revolutionising women’s sport. And she’s convinced that this is finally happening.The Red Roses have won the World Cup twice before this year (1994 and 2014), but women’s rugby was smaller then. “This is the golden age of women’s sport. I truly believe that. It’s not just what the Red Roses have achieved, but what British women have achieved in general in sport over the past couple of years is going to shape the future for the next generation.”Kildunne says the Lionesses led the way by winning football’s Euros in 2022. Back then, she was invited as a guest to the Sports Personality of the Year ceremony (Spoty), and she couldn’t believe it when England women’s football captain Leah Williamson knew who she was. For all that self-assurance, she still didn’t expect anyone to recognise her, let alone fete her. When a fan asked for a selfie at a match a few years ago, she thought she was being asked to take the fan’s photo, which she did. The fan had to explain that she wanted Kildunne in the frame.I’m not the player who’ll do ice baths, eat fish and a rice cake every night and wake up at 5am to do my stretchesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Ingram/The GuardianHow times have changed. Now, she’s expected to be on the shortlist for this year’s Spoty and she gets stopped regularly. But it still surprises her. “I was in the petrol station the other day and a policeman tapped me on the back, and I was, like, ‘I’ve done nothing wrong, officer.’ And he said, ‘You’re Ellie Kildunne, aren’t you? I just want to say congratulations.’ I said, ‘God, I thought you were going to take me away and lock me up.’ I thought, that’s crazy – you know who I am, and you’re inspired by what we’ve achieved.”A while ago, Kildunne’s boyfriend, a businessman called Cameron Sommerville-Bailey, said he cleaned her boots for her because “you can’t expect the world’s best player to clean her own”. Sommerville-Bailey used to feature regularly in her social media, but has been absent recently. Are they still together? “No. We split just before the Six Nations. It was very amicable. We lived together for four-five years. I still love him to pieces, but it was the best for where we are. I couldn’t have asked for someone better, right down to washing my boots. It was his love language!” Is there a new boot cleaner on the scene? “No, there is not.” She says she doesn’t have much time to think about her love life at the moment. There is so much going on – the rugby, a podcast series, loads of promotional work.What’s her life like away from rugby? “Chaos,” she says instantly. In what way? Well, she says, she lives her life the way she plays her rugby: nobody can predict what she’ll do next. She can’t keep still, she has to keep moving, and she has endless micro-obsessions that come and go. “I got diagnosed with ADHD last year, which was really good for my understanding of why I can be fine with the way my life is, but when I explain it to someone else, it blows their mind.”What does she mean? “I’ll go to bed and I can’t go to sleep, because I’m thinking I want to change my room around and I can see what it looks like in my head. So I have to get up and do it. Then I got a huge canvas, and I was in bed and I couldn’t stop thinking about painting it, so I had to get up and paint it through the night.”Then there’s her thing with music. “I wanted to learn how to play a song on guitar. And, again, I couldn’t go to sleep because I’m thinking about this God-damned guitar. So I bought two guitars. I painted one of them because I thought it would be cool as a canvas. It looks rubbish. And the other one I bought so I could play this song on it.” Can she play the guitar? “No!”That’s the point, she says. That’s the chaos. “Then I got a keyboard because I heard a song and decided I wanted to learn how to do that on the keyboard.” Can she play the keyboard? “No!” she says. “I couldn’t learn it in a day. I spent the whole day trying. Did not move from that seat.” She’s also got a drum kit in her garage. Can she play that? “No.No!”Then there’s her main obsession: photography. She’s actually pretty good, she says. She still likes to turn up to events with a camera round her neck, so people think she’s the official photographer. It makes it easier to mix with people, she says. They ask her to take a photo of them, she obliges and it’s an icebreaker. “There are cameras all over my house. I love cameras.” How many? “Well, professional cameras, I’ve probably got four. Then I’ve got two different vlog cameras and a couple of digital cameras. That’s my switch-off; when I’m at rugby, I’m so focused on rugby.”I don’t see this World Cup as the pinnacle of our careers.

Earrings:MissomaAnd finally, there’s her penchant for DIY tattoos. “I just randomly bought a tattoo gun off Amazon. Who does that? Well, I do.” How much did it cost? “£30.” She shows me a dot on her finger. “That represents my brother.” And two dots on another finger. “That’s my mum and dad.” To be honest, as tattoos go, they’re rubbish. Then there’s the tattoo on her leg. “I tattooed myself on my ankle, but it was shit.” She corrects herself. “Itisshit. It’s meant to be a heart.” But she’s not letting a lack of talent hold her back. “I’ve tattooed a few of the Red Roses and a few of the GB sevens girls. My most recent one was John Mitchell, our head coach. I did him after the World Cup. His first-ever tattoo, and if you know Mitch, he’s a bit of a hard nut. Everyone was like, ‘You gave him a tattoo?As if!’ And I was, like, ‘Yeah, I did.’”I’m getting exhausted just listening to all her activities. Does she drive herself mad? “All the time. But I drive myself mad when I’ve got nothing on. I know I need to calm down. My mum and dad say to me, ‘Just calm down, don’t be on your phone, don’t be thinking about the next thing, project, idea, just relax.’”But she thinks her inability to sit still is also what makes her a great sportswoman. Whatever she turns her attention to – painting, photography, tattooing or rugby – her focus is absolute. The only difference is that when it comes to rugby, she’s a world-beater. She spends lots of her spare time watching videos of rivals and teammates playing, studying their every physical move and mental reaction. “I hyper-focus on how quickly can this person in my own team catch the ball then pass it, and I watch it over and over again so I know how to time my run. Before a match, I’m, like, ‘OK, what does this woman do? She steps off her right foot about 70% of the time, left foot 30%. What’s her mental state? Does she lose her head easily? How can I get into that, without being an arsehole?’ I think about all those things.”England’s Ellie Kildunne: ‘Losing the World Cup final fuelled a fire in me’Read moreYou really are a freak, I say. She grins. “I am. It makes me the player I am. I’m not the player who’ll do ice baths, who’ll eat fish and a rice cake every night, and wake up at 5am and do my stretches. That type of stuff doesn’t bother me. But I put in so much work that people don’t see. John always says I’m a freak. We do a 1,200m test and I smash everyone at that. No one gets near me, but I’m also the fastest. Normally, sprinters are not very good at the 1,200m. I’m good at both, so he says I’m a freak of nature. I take it as a positive.”Kildunne’s late for training, so she has to leave. As she heads off, she reminds me that this is just the start – for her, for her fellow Red Roses and for women’s sport. “I don’t see this World Cup as the pinnacle of our careers. We’ve got the ball rolling, and it will take us into places we’ve never been before.” She’s got so much ahead of her, she says. “I am a very optimistic person. I never want to be at the peak of my career. I just want to keep on going and going, till I can’t walk any more.”Explore more on these topicsEngland women's rugby union teamRugby unionWomen's rugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lt Col Pascal Tigri was appointed president of the military committee, the soldiers said.View image in fullscreenVideograb from Benin TV footage shows soldiers from the Military Committee for Refoundation announcing the government’s dissolution.Photograph: Benin TV/AFP/Getty ImagesThe rapid mobilisation of forces loyal to the government “allowed us to thwart these adventurers”, Talon said in remarks aired on state TV after the government regained control of the broadcaster.“This treachery will not go unpunished,” he added.The attempted coup was the latest threat to democratic rule in the region, where militaries have in recent years seized power in Benin’s neighbours Niger and Burkina Faso, as well as in Mali, Guinea and,only last month, Guinea-Bissau.But it was a surprising development in Benin, where the last successful coup took place in 1972.A government spokesperson, Wilfried LéandreHoungbedji, earlier said that 14 people had been arrested in connection with the coup attempt as of Sunday afternoon, without providing details.The attempt came as Benin was preparing for a presidential election in April that would mark the end of the tenure of Talon, 67, who has held power since 2016.In their televised statement, the coup plotters mentioned the deteriorating security situation in northern Benin “coupled with the disregard and neglect of our fallen brothers-in-arms”.Talon has been credited with reviving the economy, but the country has also seen an increase in attacks by jihadist militants that have wreaked havoc in Mali andBurkina Faso.Explore more on these topicsBeninAfricaGhanaNigeriaSierra LeoneGuineaGuinea-BissaunewsShareReuse this content"

But when it came to stealing research, Vigneault said all of society, not just politicians, needed to come together to fight the threat.Vigneault left the CSIS in July last year after seven years there and now works for the US company Strider, which advises organisations on potential espionage threats.He said he said seen “the full spectrum” of approaches – from cyber-attacks to “people who are infiltrated into programmes, get the information and bring it back”.University staff were recruited by foreign powers based on either naivety, ideology or greed, he said.Canada says Russia and China are ramping up spy efforts in Arctic regionRead moreHe claimed these threats justified the decision to require national security evaluations for university programmes in sensitive areas that received government funding.He dismissedcriticismfrom some researchers that the rules were too restrictive and could stymie academic excellence and openness. “You cannot imagine that you work in isolation. You’re not living on an island and doing pure research for the good of humanity,” he said.Vigneault conceded that focusing on China could lead to a problematic sense of racial profiling among students and faculty in universities and other sectors.“It’s an absolutely critical point – we are not far from potentially being accused, wrongly or rightly, of racism,” he said.“What I’ve tried to do is always make the distinction that the problem is not China or the Chinese people, the problem is the Chinese Communist party.”He added that some espionage cases linked to China involved people with no Chinese heritage.Vigneault said his seven years in charge of Canada’s intelligence service had been marked by an “evolution from the focus on terrorism to big power politics”. He was in charge during the run-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when Canada had access to almost everything collected by US and UK agencies on Vladimir Putin’s plans.Vigneault described that intelligence as “exquisite” and said he had had little doubt thatRussiawould invade for several weeks before it did.He suggested that, as well as lacking the same detailed intelligence, the failure of European security services to anticipate the attack was at least partly down to dependence on Russian oil and gas. The fear of the “political cost or the economic cost of trying to diversify before an invasion” made it easier to hope the invasion would not take place.“We saw it with Germany, which later had to reorient a large part of their energy,” he said. “That has an impact on decision-making, that has an impact on how you assess information.”Although Canada is dealing with the hostile rhetoric and high tariffs imposed by its erstwhile closest ally, the US, Vigneault called for a pragmatic approach. This meant identifying areas where cooperation was crucial and “building sovereign capabilities” where it might be preferable not to rely on an increasingly erratic ally.He added: “In the world we are in now, and the world we foresee for the future, data is going to be absolutely critical. So how do you make sure that you know you have a level of sovereignty over your data to protect your citizens, your national securities?“Developing sovereign cloud capabilities … allows you to control your information, and not be at the mercy of a company that may have legal requirements to share this information back to the US.”Explore more on these topicsEspionageCanadaChinaRussiaVladimir PutinAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It led to a debate over the museum’s ageing infrastructure.The Louvre said there would be an internal investigation into the November leak, which was caused by the accidental opening of a valve in the heating and ventilation system that led to water seeping through the ceiling of the Mollien wing, where the books were stored.The “completely obsolete” system had been shut down for months and was due to be replaced from September 2026, the museum administrator added.The works will “be dried, sent to a bookbinder to be restored, and then returned to the shelves”, Steinbock said.In late November, the Louvre said it would raise ticket prices for most non-EU visitors, meaning US, British and Chinese tourists, among others, will have to pay €32 (£28) to get in.The museum said the 45% price hike aimed to boost annual revenues by up to $23m to fund structural improvements.The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors in 2024, 69% from abroad.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceMuseumsEgyptologyArchaeologyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Suggested alternatives include the less appetising“discs” or “tubes”.McCartney said: “To stipulate that burgers and sausages are ‘plant-based’, ‘vegetarian’ or ‘vegan’ should be enough for sensible people to understand what they are eating. This also encourages attitudes which are essential to our health and that of the planet.”The musician is one of the world’s most prominent advocates of a vegetarian diet. He and his late wife founded the Linda McCartney plant-based foods brand in 1991 and he and their daughters Mary and Stella launched the global“Meat Free Monday”campaign to encourage people to eat less meat.View image in fullscreenThe EU is set to decide whether to ban wording for plant-based and vegetarian foods following lobbying by the meat industry.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockLinda McCartney sausages andburgershave been part of a global trend of increased interest in products to replace meat, even if investment haswaned since a bubbleduring the coronavirus pandemic.Yet with the growth of plant-based products has come a backlash, particularly from the politically powerful farming and meat distribution industries, which are worried about the potential effects of lower demand on jobs.The European parliament voted 355–247 to ban “meat-related” names from being used on plant-based products. According to Euronews, Céline Imart, a French member of the centre-right European People’s party and proponent of the ban, told the parliament: “I accept that steak, cutlet or sausage are products from our livestock farms. Full stop. No laboratory substitutes, no plant-based products.”The letter signed by the McCartney family and the British MPs argued that the EU rulescould force Britain into changesas well, because the markets and regulation are still so intertwined despite the UK’s departure from the EU.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the attempt to limit the use of generic terms is more controversial.Many of the terms that would be banned have malleable meanings. For instance, the Collins dictionary defines a sausage firstly in relation to meat but secondly as “an object shaped like a sausage”. Even more problematically for a ban, the primary definition of “burger” is given as a “flat round mass of minced meat or vegetables”.The eight MP signatories to the letter include the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the former Green party co-leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionVegetarian food and drinkVegan food and drinkPaul McCartneyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He welcomed signals that theTrump administrationwas “in favour of dialogue and building good relations”. He warned, however, that the supposed US “deep state” could try to sabotage Trump’s vision.It came as the White House’s efforts to push through a peace deal inUkraineenter a key phase. US officials claim they are in the final stage of reaching an agreement, but there is little sign that either Ukraine or Russia is willing to sign the framework deal drawn up by Trump’s negotiating team.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,will visit Downing Streeton Monday for a four-way meeting with with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz.Zelenskyy has previously called on European allies for support at times when the White House has tried to push Ukraine towards agreeing to give up territory. A key issue for Kyiv is what security guarantees it would receive if it does agree to renounce control of some territory.Zelenskyy has said he had a “substantive phone call” with US officials on Saturday evening after they finished three days of talks with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida. Those meetings followed a visit to Moscow by Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, earlier in the week. A sourcetoldAxios the call had lasted two hours and was “difficult”.“Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media. He said the two sides had discussed “key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full-scale invasion”.It is not clear that either the US or Europe are willing to offer the kind of security guarantees that would genuinely deter Russia from invading again. Nor is it likely that Vladimir Putin would agree to a deal that involved any western troops stationed in Ukraine.US officials have claimed to be close to a sustainable deal on numerous occasions since Trump began his second term in office, only for the claims to be exposed as wishful thinking.Trump’s outgoing Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said at a defence forum on Saturday that the administration’s efforts to end the war were in “the last 10 metres”. He said there were two outstanding issues: territory and the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.Kellogg is seen as among the US officials most sympathetic to Kyiv’s position, but is due to leave his role in January and was present at the Florida talks. Many others in Trump’s orbit, including Witkoff, have been much more open to adopting Russian positions. Trump’s son, Donald Jr, said at a forum in Doha on Sunday that Zelenskyy was deliberately continuing the conflict for fear of losing power if it ended. He said the US would not be “the idiot with the chequebook” any longer.Analysts in Kyiv say the situation is not yet so bad that Ukraine would be forced to sign any deal whatsoever simply to prevent a continuation of the war, but they say a difficult and potentially bleak winter lies ahead as Russia continues to target energy infrastructure, disrupting power and heating supplies for millions of Ukrainians.Exhaustion is setting in as Ukraine enters the fourth winter of full-scale war, and Zelenskyy has been weakened by a corruption scandal that has touched numerous associates and led tothe resignation of his powerful chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.One person was killed during a drone attack in the northern Chernihiv region late on Saturday, according to local officials, and a combined attack of drones and missiles targeted energy infrastructure in the central city of Kremenchuk. It left much of the city without power and water on Sunday. It was the second consecutive night of attacks targeting energy, after more than 600 drones and 50 missileswere used on Friday night.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUS foreign policyUkraineTrump administrationEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There is no suggestion that any of the three committed criminal acts or had been aware Gill took bribes to promote Russian interests.Amid the continuing police investigation, the Labour party has called on Farage to voluntarily offer to help investigators, who have already spoken to MEPs he led in the European parliament.The chair of the Labour party, Anna Turley MP, said: “He must order an urgent investigation into pro-Russia links in Reform, and he should voluntarily go to the police for interview and help them with their inquiries.”Last week, another former leading member of the group of MEPs headed by Faragedenied taking moneyas part of a campaign to promote Russian interests.David Coburn, who was also the leader of Ukip in Scotland for four years, was mentioned in WhatsApp messages between Gill and Voloshyn – a former Ukrainian MEP who is accused of the bribery – that were released by prosecutors.The messages showed Gill and Voloshyn apparently discussing how much should be set aside for Coburn, who was also an MEP for Reform UK’s precursor the Brexit party. Coburndenied taking any paymentwhen confronted by BBC journalists outside his home in France.The messages were sent in April 2019 before a meeting at the European parliament of the editorial board of 112 Ukraine, whose membership included Gill and Coburn, and which was connected to Viktor Medvedchuk, Vladimir Putin’s ally in Ukraine.View image in fullscreenJonathan Bullock (centre) leaving the European parliament holding a union jack on 31 January 2020.Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty ImagesBullock rejected any wrongdoing on his part when the Guardian approached him, saying that the comments he made to 112 Ukraine about the sovereignty of nation states were normal in the context of his role as an energy spokesperson.A transcript of Bullock’s comments to the channel record that he stated: “I do think that it’s much better for nation states to act individually, so Ukraine’s to do what’s best in Ukraine’s interest and likewise we in western Europe and in the United Kingdom, for example, to do what we would like.”Contacted by the Guardian, Bullock said that he was a known critic of Russia, adding: “My comment was a standard run-of-the-mill answer from me which I connected with my energy views on UK choices relating to nuclear power and renewables.”View image in fullscreenSteven Woolfe.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA MediaWoolfe declined to comment when approached by the Guardian. However, a friend said that police had never contacted or investigated the former MEP.“He does feel personally appalled by the way he and others have been dragged into it but the reality is he has nothing to hide,” they added.It is understood that Gill had appealed to Woolfe’s interest in free speech, knowing that this was an issue the then MEP for North West England was particularly interested in.Reid did not respond to requests for comment.The former head of Gill’s office in Brussels, Ethan Wilkinson, has also denied to the Guardian that he received any payment, after documents released by the CPS showed Voloshyn suggesting he should be rewarded with “3k euro” for his “fieldwork”.“I was Nathan’s head of office in Brussels and I recall submitting paperwork in relation to ‘mission’ expenses and resolutions for the EFDD group, all of which I genuinely believed were legitimate activities of an MEP who was advocating for free speech/expression/freedom of the press,” he said, referring to the Eurosceptic and populist political group in the European parliament.“I didn’t receive any payment from Mr Voloshyn,” said Wilkinson, who went on to work for the TaxPayer’s Alliance and was also a Conservative party local election candidate.“I had no idea that he was a Russian intelligence asset, I had no idea Nathan was being paid by him or anybody else to carry out this work, and I fully cooperated in the Met police investigation into Mr Gill as a witness, including sharing WhatsApp conversations etc.”Other MEPs elected for either Ukip or the Brexit party who were named in the CPS note include Jonathan Arnott, who visited Ukraine with Gill on an October 2018 trip.During the visit, Coburn, Gill and Arnott appeared on camera in interviews with 112 Ukraine and all made similar statements six weeks later during a debate in the European parliament on 11 December that touched on press freedom in Ukraine and the question of whether it should be allowed to join the EU.Arnott spoke to the police as a potential witness, the Guardian understands. He has rejected any suggestion that he had links to Russia or was acting in its interests.Alex Phillips, who was a Brexit party MEP, told the Guardian last month she had voluntarily gone to speak to the police when she learned of the investigation into Gill.The CPS note states Gill had promised his handler Voloshyn that he would “get Alex [Phillips]” to speak, although this does not appear to have happened and Phillips has since stressed that she was outspoken in her hostility to Putin.Another Brexit party MEP, James Wells, was named in the CPS notes in the context of a fresh intervention by Gill in September 2019. The notes state Gill asked Voloshyn to send him lines to take in a European parliament subcommittee on human rights. WhatsApp messages indicate Gill had commented in the media afterwards and “secured the cooperation” of Wells.Gill reported that he had taken Wells out for dinner as a thank you, to which Voloshyn replied: “Wonderful! We owe you for that.”Wells, who has accused Gill of dragging colleagues into his activities without their knowledge, has told the Guardian: “I had no knowledge of what Gill was up to at the time. The police did not require an interview with me after I had a short call with them, so there is no question about my innocence.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKUK Independence party (Ukip)Nigel FarageRussiaEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The ISF mandate “should be peace monitoring not peace enforcement”, he added.Norway’s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, said the plan proposed by the US president, Donald Trump, was not clear on the sequencing of the ISF tasks. As a result, he warned: “The different parties can say ‘I will do my part but only when he has done its part’, so we need to get the board of peace and the ISF in place this month because it is very urgent.”He added: “We are now in a very fragile ceasefire. We can either go forward or backward. I do not think we can stay many more weeks in this situation. The alternatives are back to war and descent into total anarchy, or we move forward.”Eide said the ISF mandate was not clear, and leaders of Muslim countries ready to provide a large number of troops were still seeking clarification about rules of engagement. “Are they actually going to try to go down into the tunnels and fightHamas, or are they going to work with a temporary Palestinian Authority where Hamas will actually voluntarily hand in their weapons and demobilise, which they have said they are willing to do when the institutions are in place?” he asked, predicting there would not be a consensus behind an ISF mandate to disarm Hamas physically against its will.Israel has said it will not withdraw from Gaza until disarmament has taken place.View image in fullscreenThe Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, speaking in Doha on Saturday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMajed Mohammed al-Ansari, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said the issue was whether disarmament had to start before the occupation ended. “You can disarm a group now and end up with 10 groups two months later if the people who took up arms are faced with the same security crisis,” he said. What was needed was political will, he added.He said Qatar was not prepared again to take sole responsibility for the reconstruction of Gaza, saying if the reconstruction was the responsibility of the entire international community Israel may feel less willing “to bomb the hell out of it”.The Saudi foreign minister, Dr Manal bint Hassan Radwan, warned against being sidetracked by detail or redefinitions of what had already been agreed. She said ultimately there would be no security for anyone without a Palestinian state.The Gulf states and Turkey had both proposed in the draft UN resolution that Hamas should be required to disarm to the Palestinian Authority and not to the ISF, since a handover of weapons to fellow Palestinians would look less like a Hamas surrender, but have the same practical impact.The amendment was not accepted by the US.The Hamas chief negotiator and its Gaza chief, Khalil al-Hayya, has said it would hand over its weapons to “the authority of the state”, later clarifying that meant a sovereign and independent Palestinian state.“We accept the deployment of UN forces as a separation force, tasked with monitoring the borders and ensuring compliance with the ceasefire in Gaza,” Hayya said, signalling his group’s rejection of the deployment of an international force whose mission would be to disarm it.Fidan said: “First, we need to see the Palestinian committee of technical experts take over the administration of Gaza, and then we need to see a police force, composed of Palestinians, not Hamas, established to secure Gaza again.”Fidan acknowledged that the main Trump special envoy, Steve Witkoff, had been detained trying to work on the Russian-Ukraine deal, and this may be delaying the process of setting up the new bodies. He said Turkey and the Trump administration shared the same broad objectives.The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, said: “A ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of the Israeli forces – [until] there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out – which is not the case today.”Explore more on these topicsGazaHamasPalestineIsraelTurkeyUnited NationsEgyptnewsShareReuse this content"

Netanyahu dismisses the warrants as “trumped-up charges” from a “corrupt prosecutor”.During the first phase of the current ceasefire agreement, Hamas released the last 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for about 2,000 Palestinian detainees held byIsrael, and it has handed over all but one of 28 bodies of hostages killed during the war. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have withdrawn to a ceasefire line, leaving them in control of 58% of the Gaza Strip.Since the ceasefire was declared on 10 October, Israeli forces have killedmore than 360 Palestinians, including an estimated 70 children. Three Israeli soldiers have been killed in Hamas attacks over the same period.Neither Trump’s proposals, nor UN security council resolution 2803 which largely endorsed them, set out a timetable extending the ceasefire into a lasting peace. Hamas is supposed to disarm, Israeli troops are meant to withdraw farther, and an international stabilisation force (ISF) is to be set up under the control of a “board of peace” of world leaders chaired by Trump, overseeing a technocratic Palestinian committee to run the day-to-day governance of Gaza.The sequencing of these steps is not clear in Trump’s proposals or in resolution 2803. In his remarks on Sunday, Netanyahu put his emphasis on Hamas disarmament.“I think it’s important to make sure that Hamas complies not only with the ceasefire, but also with their commitment which they undertook to disarm and have Gaza demilitarise,” he said.Netanyahu raised the prospects of “alternatives” to the ISF, without explaining what those might be. He would not rule out Israeli annexation of the West Bank, describing it as a subject of “discussion”, and stressed that Israel was adamantly opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state, the aim of the peace process desired by most European and Arab capitals as well as the overwhelming majority of UN member states.Netanyahu said the reason he would not be able make a return visit to Germany was the ICC arrest warrants, which he described as fabricated by the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, as a means of diverting attention from allegations of sexual harassment against him. Khan has denied any wrongdoing, but stepped aside from his role in May pending the conclusion of an investigation.Netanyahu said Khan was “destroying the reputation of the ICC” with “trumped-up charges of starvation and genocide” from a “corrupt prosecutor”.Another tribunal, the international court of justice, is weighing up charges that Israeli has committed genocide in Gaza. In September, a UN independent commission of inquiry concluded that Israel had committed genocide.Asked about the possibility of Netanyahu visiting Germany, Merz told reporters on Sunday: “There is no reason to discuss this at the moment.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

The chief justice, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, later called for stricter enforcement.The government of PresidentMasoud Pezeshkianhas refused to ratify a bill passed by the parliament that would have imposed tough penalties for women who do not observe the dress code.In May 2023, the head of Iran’s athletics federation resigned after women without headscarves took part in a sporting event in the southern city of Shiraz.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Those found responsible will face most stringent action under the law – any negligence will be dealt with firmly.”It was reported that upwards of 100 people were in the venue when the fire started, during a live music performance which included a band and a bellydancer. In a video, flames could be seen emerging from behind the stage behind the musicians.According to officials, the fire started on the first floor and then engulfed the rest of the building. A preliminary inquiry by police suggested most of those who died were trapped in the basement area of the club and suffocated.Firefighters worked through the night to suppress the fire and rescue those trapped. Images from the scene showed vast flames ripping through the building as it was reduced to a blackened shell and investigators combed the wreckage on Sunday morning.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of the firePhotograph: Atish Naik/AFP/Getty ImagesMost of the dead were the club’s workers who had been in the basement at the time of the fire, said officials. Sawant told journalists at the scene that “three to four” tourists had died but the process of identifying the dead was ongoing.Speaking to the Indian Express, a Goa police official said that many of the guests had been gathered on the first floor for a live music show when a fire started at about 11.45pmHe said: “In the ensuing panic and chaos, many guests ran towards the exit and reached safety. The staff members working in the basement were effectively trapped because it lacked an exit and was engulfed in smoke. Some guests also seem to have rushed towards the basement and got trapped.”Location mapA police report filed after the incident said the venue was operating with proper licenses and “did not have an emergency exit door on the ground floor as well as on the deck floor to evacuate in case of emergency”.The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the fire as “deeply saddening”.Goa, a former Portuguese colony on the shores of the Arabian Sea, lures millions of both Indian and international tourists every year with its nightlife, sandy beaches and laidback coastal atmosphere. According to government data, about 5.5 million tourists visited Goa in the first half of this year, with 270,000 visiting from abroad.Goa politician Michael Lobo called for a fire safety audit of all the clubs. “Tourists have always considered Goa a very safe destination. The fire incident is quite disturbing, and such incidents should not happen in the future,” he said.Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.In May at least 17 people died after a fire ripped through a three-storey building in the Indian city of Hyderabad. A month before that a fierce blaze broke out in a hotel in Kolkata, killing at least 15 people. Some people clambered out of windows and on to the roof to escape. In 2024 at least 24 people died after a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Among those treated was a three-year-old girl.Tom Bate, who was caught up in the incident after landing at Heathrow on Sunday morning, said he was shaken up after people began coughing and his throat burned. “Everyone was coughing and looking at each other thinking how weird it was that we were coughing at the same time,” he said.One man was arrested on suspicion of assault, and inquiries continued to trace further suspects, police said.Commander Peter Stevens said: “Our team have been working at pace today to review CCTV from the area and speak with witnesses at the scene.“At this stage, it’s understood that a woman was robbed of her suitcase by a group of four men, who sprayed a substance believed to be pepper spray in her direction.“This occurred within a car park lift, with those in the lift and surrounding area affected by the spray.“Our officers are working to determine the full circumstances around what happened but we do believe this to be an isolated incident with those directly involved known to each other.“We appreciate that this has been a concerning incident and I commend the actions of the emergency services and members of staff at Heathrow airport.”Police said the victims’ injuries were not believed to be life-changing or life-threatening.A London ambulance service spokesperson said: “We have a number of resources on scene, and are caring for a number of patients.” The service later said it had been stood down from the scene at 10.58am.A London fire brigade spokesperson said: “Firefighters have been providing specialist assistance alongside multi-agency partners at the scene. The brigade was stood down shortly after 10.30.”Footage posted on social media appeared to show a man being handcuffed, and ambulances, fire engines and armed officers at the scene.Bate said he had seen three men who did not have luggage running past the lift lobby of the car park at Terminal 3 at about 8am, shortly after he had landed from the US.“The second they left people started coughing one by one,” he said. “There must have been about 50 of us in the lobby waiting for the lifts and it was really eerie because everyone started coughing, including me.“There was a burning taste in my throat and there were children there, there were elderly people. A lot of people were exposed to whatever this was.”The student, 27, who was travelling to London to spend Christmas with his family, said he went to his car and began driving down the car park ramp.“That was when I saw what must have been 20 very heavily armed police officers running and looking really quite stricken,” he said. “During this I said to one officer: ‘What’s going on?’ and he said: ‘We don’t know – there’s been an attack.’”Bate said he had given a statement to police and was kept in the car park with other passengers for more than an hour.“It was total gridlock. They swept the whole garage, every car, they were very professional and very quick,” he said. “It felt really terrifying.”A Heathrow spokesperson said its teams were responding to the incident with the emergency services. Heathrow has advised passengers to allow extra time when travelling to the airport and, if they have any queries, to check with their airline.The terminal remained open throughout, though the incident caused some traffic and public transport disruption.The policing minister, Sarah Jones, said: “My thoughts are with all those affected by the incident at Heathrow this morning. My heartfelt thanks go to the emergency services for their rapid response and the arrest made.“I am being regularly updated on the investigation. Those in the area should follow police advice.”Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call 101, quoting CAD 1803 7 DEC.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Both men have previously expressed support for the Conservative party and havedonated money to it.Richard Walker donated nearly £10,000 in July 2020, when Boris Johnson was prime minister during the Covid pandemic. He was then added to a list of approved parliamentary candidates for the party in 2022, only to perform an abrupt about-turn the following year.Writing inthe Guardianin 2023, Walker said the Conservatives had “drifted badly out of touch with business and the economy, and with the everyday needs of the British people”.He thenbacked Keir Starmerin early 2024, saying that “after a lot of soul-searching” he had decided he had “exactly what it takes to be a great leader”. Walker’s comments did not, however, suggest a would-be Labour politician. He said the Tories’ abandonment of “basic Conservative principles” had added to his disenchantment.Nevertheless, his appointment as a Labour peer, first reported by the Sun, would add a rare business voice in support of Starmer’s government, which has irked several sectors by raising national insurance. The Conservative party counts another retail boss, Simon Wolfson of Next, among its peers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In some cases referrals that GPs have agreed to make do not even get sent from their surgery to the hospital,Healthwatch England’s findings show.The research found that 14% of all referrals are getting “stuck” betweenGPsand hospitals, leaving patients in the dark and anxious about when they will be seen and treated.GPs failing older people living with frailty, National Audit Office findsRead moreChris McCann, Healthwatch’s deputy chief executive, said: “Behind every delayed, lost or rejected referral is a human story of pain, stress and uncertainty.“While improvements have been made, too many people remain stuck in this referral ‘black hole’, telling us that they’re ‘existing not living’ due to delays.”Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said the findings were “deeply alarming” and that delays to referrals can leave some patients afraid to leave their home.“When seven out of 10 people only find out their referral failed because they chased it up themselves, something is badly wrong.“These are people already anxious about their health, already stressed waiting for treatment – and then they discover they weren’t even in the queue. While they wait, their conditions could be getting worse,” said Power.Healthwatch’s findings are based on a YouGov survey of a nationally representative sample of 2,622 adults in England whom a GP had referred for tests or treatment in the last year.They raise questions about how accurate theNHSwaiting list is as a true reflection of the number of people who need care – 6.24 million people are waiting for 7.39 million tests or treatments – and how good the service is at keeping patients informed about the progress of their referral.Just over half (53%) of people referred seek medical help or advice while they wait for the NHS to act, the survey found. While 7% go private, one in five (20%) asks for help from other parts of the NHS, such as a different GP or urgent care services. “These results suggest that referral delays may increase pressure on other NHS services”, the report noted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “When I rang they were nice on the phone but they couldn’t give me any good news. It could be as long as a year before I get an appointment, and that’s just to take the first step in a long process.”His pain has become so bad he struggles with daily tasks such as shopping, driving or even putting on his shoes. He does not know when he will be seen.“I feel like I’m stuck in limbo,” he added.The 14% of people whose referral gets lost, rejected or denied is an improvement on the 21% who experienced the same fate when the watchdog undertook similar research in 2023.Since then ministers and health service chiefs have tried to tackle the problem by making it easier for patients to track the progress of their referral via the NHS app and using pharmacies to help people with suspected cancer.“Yet, despite progress, many patients still report that poor communication, delays and uncertainty caused by long waits are affecting their health, wellbeing and ability to work,” Healthwatch said.One in four (23%) people are dissatisfied with the referrals process, it found. Public satisfaction with the NHS generally has fallen to just 21% – the lowest level – the most recent British Social Attitudes survey found.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said the situation revealed by the findings was “not acceptable”. But improvements have been made since the research was done in March, the spokesperson added.They include theintroduction in September of Jess’s rule, under which GPs are meant to seek a second opinion if they cannot diagnose a patient’s illness after three appointments.The DHSC is putting an extra £1.1bn into general practice, recruiting more family doctors and cutting red tape so GPs can spend more time with patients, the spokesperson added.Family doctors are also now encouraged to seek “advice and guidance” from specialist hospital doctors about referrals. Patient satisfaction with primary care has risen from 60% in July 2024 to 75%.The DHSC spokesperson said: “We have been clear that it will take time to turn around the NHS but we are starting to see improvements. There’s still a long way to go but we are beginning to see the green shoots of recovery.”Explore more on these topicsGPsHealthNHSEnglandDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers areconsultingon the third cycling and walking investment strategy (CWIS3), which promises a “fundamental shift” in how active travel is treated.Some parts of the active travel world not connected to the letter have expressed concern that the Department for Transport (DfT) under Alexander is less engaged with the subject than it was under her predecessor, Louise Haigh, and that momentum is being lost.In contrast, the letter, which is also signed by representatives of the Association of Directors of Public Health, Ramblers and three of England’s regional active travel commissioners, is not directly critical and is trying to engage positively while making it plain that more should be done.Saying that CWIS3 should put active travel on an equal footing with roads and rail, it argues for clear targets that should be met by 2030, the period covered by the strategy, including that by then 50% of trips of less than five miles in towns and cities should be walked, wheeled or cycled.The letter warns CWIS3’s proposed objectives, which include “ensuring people are safe to travel actively”, are “open to interpretation and not measurable”.It goes on: “Other transport modes operate with predictable five-year cycles and transparent progress reporting; active travel can and should match that level of maturity. Long-term targets, with interim reviews, will give local leaders the confidence to plan networks, support larger projects, unlock private sector investment and demonstrate how devolved investment and progress contribute to national missions.”There should also be a national strategy for active travel networks, it adds, saying that while things like walking and cycling routes should be designed locally, they also need to be “coherent, connected, consistent and accessible to all” and should link to key destinations such as rail and bus stations, hospitals and schools.The letter says: “Without reliable, safe, joined-up routes to walk, wheel and cycle, people cannot reasonably be expected to travel actively, impacting health, opportunities and independence from childhood to older adulthood.”Xavier Brice, the chief executive of Walk Wheel Cycle Trust, one of the signatories, said CWIS3 was originally intended to shift active travel “from stop-start funding and priorities to a long-term framework for investment and change. However, it has never quite lived up to this promise.”Without targets, he said, even the existing target in the strategy for active to be a safe, easy and accessible option for everyone by 2035 “is unachievable under the current proposals”.A DfT spokesperson said: “We have committed £616m to Active Travel England up to 2030 so that local authorities can deliver walking and cycling infrastructure across the country, with the aim that by 2035 walking, wheeling and cycling is easy, safe, and accessible for everyone. We have just launched a consultation on how we can achieve this, and we encourage stakeholders and the public to have their say.”Explore more on these topicsTransport policyTransportCyclingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Beside calling them “garbage”, the president said Minnesota’s Somali community should be sent back to Somalia.“Look at their nation,” Trump also said. “Look how bad their nation is. It’s not even a nation. It’s just people walking around killing each other.“Look, these Somalians have taken billions of dollars out of our country – billions and billions.”The Trump administration restricted all immigration cases for Somalis already in the US, along with people from 18 other countries. Community members expected the Minneapolis-St Paul metro area, where most Somalis in the state reside, to see increased immigration enforcement operations. And, as a consequence, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey recently signed anexecutive orderprohibiting federal, state and local officials from using city-owned parking lots, ramps, garages and lots for immigration enforcement operations.On Thursday, Omar penned anop-edin the New York Times claiming that Trump was resorting to racist attacks because various campaign promises – including a better US economy – have been failing.“While the president wastes his time attacking my community … the promises of economic prosperity he made in his run for president [in 2024] have not come to fruition,” Omar wrote in the Times. “The president knows he is failing, and so he is reverting to what he knows best: trying to divert attention by stoking bigotry.”Attention on Minnesota’s Somali community ramped up in recent weeks as the right wing has seized on fraud cases in the state. Dozens of Somali residents were convicted in a scheme that involved lying to the state to receive reimbursements for meal disbursements, medical care and other services. The investigations into the series of fraud schemes spanned years – one of the most significant cases had charges filed three years ago.One of the cases revolves around an organization called Feeding Our Future, which partnered with state agencies to distribute meals to kids. Federal prosecutors alleged that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the organization submitted fake documents to trick government officials into thinking they served food to thousands of children. The group’s founder wasconvictedin March. US House Republicans have since launched an investigation aimed at how fraud cases were handled by Tim Walz, Minnesota’s Democratic governor who was his party’s vice-presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election won by Trump.Omar on Sunday said she was among the first members of Congress who called on the fraud in question to be investigated. She also said the fraud was “reprehensible”.Furthermore, Omar deniedTrump administrationallegations that taxpayer money involved in fraud investigations in Minnesota was siphoned to a terrorist organization in Somalia.The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,saidhis department was investigating whether the taxpayer money was going to al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization in Somalia. House Republicans have also echoed those claims.“There are people who have been prosecuted and who have been sentenced,” Omar said. “If there was a linkage in that – the money that they had stolen going to terrorism – then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out and basically charging them with these charges.”Bessent also said those involved in the fraud donated to Omar’s campaign. Omar said Sunday: “We sent that money back a couple years ago.”Explore more on these topicsIlhan OmarDonald TrumpTrump administrationMinnesotaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That killing has been met with intense scrutiny and accusations of war crimes after the Washington Postreporteddefense secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to“kill them all”. Adm Frank Bradley of the US navy, who oversaw the attack, told lawmakers on Thursday there wasno such order– and the Pentagon has defended the legality of the attack.Experts have said the defense islegally shaky.Pressure grows on ‘reckless’ Hegseth as twin scandals engulf Pentagon chiefRead more“If the Pentagon and our defense secretary are so proud of what they’re doing, let the American people see that video,” Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator from California, said during an interview on Sunday onNBC’s Meet the Press.“Let the American people see two people standing on a capsized boat, or sitting on a capsized boat, and deliberately killed and decide for themselves whether they’re proud of what the country is doing. I can’t imagine people would be proud of that.”Donald Trumphas said he has no problem releasing the video. But, despite the president’s statement, Hegseth did not commit to doing so on Saturday.“We’re reviewing the process, and we’ll see,”he said on Saturday, adding that the Pentagon wanted to ensure sensitive information was not compromised.Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut had previously said the video was “one of the most troubling scenes I’ve ever seen in my time in public service”.“You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion – with a destroyed vessel – who were killed by the United States,” said Himes, who is the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee.Representative Adam Smith of Washington state, the ranking Democrat on the House armed services committee, said on Sunday it was “pretty clear they don’t want to release this video”.“They don’t want people to see it because it’s very, very difficult to justify,” he said during an interview on Sunday on ABC’sThis Week.US airstrike survivors clung to boat wreckage for an hour before second deadly attack, video showsRead more“When [the survivors] were finally taken out, they weren’t trying to flip the boat over. The boat was clearly incapacitated. A tiny portion of it remained, capsized – the bow of the boat. They had no communications device. Certainly, they were unarmed.”Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, said he personally did not oppose releasing the video.“It’s not gruesome. I didn’t find it distressing or disturbing. It looks like any number of dozens of strikes we’ve seen on Jeeps and pickup trucks in the Middle East over the years,” he said onNBC’s Meet the Press. “I would trust Secretary Hegseth and his team to make the decision about whether they can declassify and release the video. But again, there’s nothing remarkable on that video in my opinion.”Cotton also defended the legality of the strike, disputing that the two men killed in the second strike were helpless.“It doesn’t really matter what they were doing,” he said. “They were on that boat. That boat was still a valid target. They were not in a state of distress on a plank of wood in the ocean like subsequent survivors were,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryDemocratsUS politicsPete HegsethUS CongressCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

Look at their service that they gave this country and take that into consideration.”Wade, a grandfather and US army veteran, was arrested for driving without a license in September and was then taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency tasked with carrying out Trump’s “mass deportation” program, local outlet KENS5reported. He has been in ICE detention since.Wade’s case is emblematic of a rising number of non-US citizen military veterans swept up by ICE under Trump’s immigration policies. The Biden administration had previously issued an ICEdirectivethat helped protect non-citizen veterans and also issued an executive order that later created an initiative to help return deported veterans and their families.The Trump administrationrescindedthe ICE directive after his second presidency began in January.Non-citizens are eligible to join theUS military. Wade, 65, came to the US from Jamaica at 15 years old, eventually joined the army and earned commendations for wartime service as well as good conduct, as KENS5 reported.He later received multiple college degrees and worked multiple jobs throughout his time in the US. He was working at a cafe when he was detained by ICE, KENS5 reports.Wade was being held inside the Stewart detention center, an immigration jail in Lumpkin, Georgia. The facility, one of the largest in the country, is run by the private prison company CoreCivic.For years, Stewart has faced grave accusations of rights abuses, including allegations of medical neglect. There have also been a series of deaths at the facility.One of the mostrecentdeaths was a suicide in June. That was thethird suicide at Stewartin recent years.Wade’s six children told KENS5 they have not been able to visit their father as often as they would like.“Just the process of being able to see my dad is very traumatic,” one of Wade’s daughters told the outlet. “He doesn’t deserve this, what he’s experiencing right now.”Wade’s family has been seeking assistance with their legal fight against his deportation on theGoFundMeplatform.“We are looking to minimize financial catastrophe during his absence,” the family’s GoFundMe says.Members of Congress have been requesting further information from the Trump administration about its targeting of non-citizen veterans for deportation. In September, multiple House representatives launched a congressional investigation into the detention and deportation of non-citizen veterans.Those members of Congress wrote aletterto top Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, demanding more information on the number of veterans swept up by immigration agents.A congressional letter from Juneestimatedthat 10,000 veterans or more have been deported. A 2022reportfrom the Migration Policy Institute said about 16 million US military veterans were born in another country.The Guardian recentlyrevealedthat a number of US veterans may be swept up further by immigration officials, as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeks to hand over to the Trump administration internal data of its non-citizen workforce. More than a quarter of the VA’s workforce is made up of veterans.An internal memo shows the VA is urgently working on an internal report of non-citizens who are “employed or affiliated” with the department, potentially sweeping up thousands of people. Some details of the report will then be shared with other government agencies, including ICE.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US militaryUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

A slight smell of musk hangs in the air as shoppers weave carefully around racks of coats and shelves of handbags and shoes. For the holidays, the store set up a small ice rink on its second floor where skaters perform on weekends.The French luxury retail emporium opened its firstNew Yorkoutlet earlier this year and has said it wants shoppers to feel so comfortable that it feels like their own chic “French apartment”. The store has a bar upstairs, along with a roving champagne cart, and encourages shoppers to sip on their drinks while they browse. Plush carpeting in the dressing room, full of orange and reds, is reminiscent of aWes Andersonmovie set.Across the street atTrinity Church, hundreds of people line up for free food and other necessities. Dodge your way past the steaming potholes and snarling traffic and a doorman welcomes you to another world. The atmosphere is so heady that suddenly, when browsing through its racks, a $600 black fur coat seems entirely inexpensive, and the $1,450 leather tabi boots upstairs are an investment.On a recent weekday afternoon, fashionably dressed shoppers milled slowly around the store. Some took pictures of the skating rink or of displays of housewares that instructed: “Please ask for assistance – do not touch.”View image in fullscreenShoppers outside the Printemps department store in lower Manhattan during its grand opening on 21 March 2025Photograph: Richard Levine/AlamyJulien, who declined to give his last name, was visiting the store to pick up a gift for a Secret Santa exchange and said he wasn’t surprised by the prices. “For the brands they have, it’s normal,” he said.Kathy, another shopper, said that she offered to take her friend out to lunch at the restaurant located inside the store and see if she could find a certain brand of ballet flats. “This is the only place that carries them,” she said, holding two bright green Printemps bags.For a small fraction of Americans, the Printemps fantasy of comfortable luxury is just a way of life. An $890 chapka hat is a sweet gift for a friend, dropping $200 on perfume that smells like freshly cut grass is normal.Around the corner from Printemps is the headquarters of the New York Stock Exchange, the ultimate symbol of American wealth and one of the main drivers of all this luxury spending.View image in fullscreenCustomers shop in the Printemps sneaker room on 29 March 2025.Photograph: Zuma Press Inc/AlamyOver the last few years, many Americanshave reportedthey’re struggling with higher grocery prices, rising healthcare costs and other bills, and havegiven upon dreams of buying homes. And yet the stock market has only gone up and up.The S&P 500 has shot up nearly 86% over the last five years, hitting record highs, especially with the recent AI boom. A ballooning stock market has meant a small percentage of Americans have been striking gold. According to data from the Federal Reserve, Americans in the top 1% of wealthownnearly 50% of the stock market. The top 10% own 87.2% of the market. The bottom 50% of all Americans own just 1.1% of stocks.Area chart showing corporate equities and mutual fund shares held, in millions of dollars, by wealth percentileMeanwhile, inflation has gone up from a recent low of 2.3% in April to 3% in September, while the unemployment rate has risen slightly, from 4% in January to 4.4% in September. The Yale Budget Lab hasestimatedthat price increases from Donald Trump’s tariffs will cause a 1.2% price rise in the short run, costing the average household $1,700.The split between rich and poor has handed Trump the biggest dilemma of his presidency. While the president promised to fix prices, and continues to blame Joe Biden’s presidency for today’s prices, his recent approval ratings show Americans are unhappy about the economy. In the YouGov/Economistpollof Trump’s approval ratings around specific economic issues, he had +5% approval on inflation after his inauguration in January. By 2 November, his ratings dropped to -35%.With Republicans facing a tough fight to maintain control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections, Axiosreported that Trump isset to embark on a US-wide tour to stare down “criticism that he’s prioritized global issues over pocketbook worries”.View image in fullscreenThe interior of the Printemps store in Manhattan on 29 March 2025.Photograph: Carlos Chiossone/Zuma Press Wire via Reuters ConnectIt may prove to be a tough sell. In April 2020, at the very start of the pandemic, economist Peter Atwater came up with an easy way to describe what this divide feels like to Americans: a K-shaped economy. A small few are on the upper part of the “K”, while most Americans feel as if they’re sliding down on the bottom side of the letter.To Atwater, the “K” described a time when “those at the bottom experience price inflation at a time when those at the top are experiencing asset inflation”.Higher prices affect everyone, no matter a person’s financial status. But inflation doesn’t affect everyone equally.A line chart showing that the wage growth for lower-income households dropped to just 1%, while it rose to 3.7% for higher-income households, compared with same time last year“Those at the top appear to have everything – not only everything, but have it in oversupply,” Atwater said. “Meanwhile, those at the bottom feel like they’re experiencing scarcity in everything that matters – affordability of food, healthcare, education, job opportunity.”“If you’re at the bottom, the difference between 2% to 3% inflation over time is significant.”Atwater said the phenomenon of the K-shaped economy didn’t start with the pandemic, but with the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Many Americans were upset to see the federal government focus stimulus efforts from the top down.“What we saw is that it took until about 2018 before those at the bottom began to see any real wage growth,” Atwater said. “But Covid just poured gasoline on that fire.”View image in fullscreenThe Red Room Bar at the Manhattan Printemps.Photograph: Carlos Chiossone/Zuma Press Wire via Reuters ConnectWhile inflation skyrocketed in 2022 after the Covid pandemic, prices started to cool in the years following. The annualized inflation rate went from 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.3% in April 2025 – the lowest it had been since March 2021. But since the spring, inflation has started climbing again.And just as prices have been getting higher, key anti-poverty programs have been cut under the Trump administration, which advocates say has led to more Americans coming under the poverty threshold. Over the last year, the White House tightened enrollment into the national food stamp program and cut funding for housing assistance.Researchfrom the Robin Hood Foundation, an anti-poverty non-profit based in New York, found that the city’s poverty rate hit 25% this year – almost double the national poverty rate of 13%.Expect a tale of two holiday seasons as the well-off spend and the rest pull back | Gene MarksRead more“The combination of rising costs, stagnation at the lower-end of the wage scale and reduction in support for helping people meet their basic necessities, these are all driving the poverty rate increase,” said Matthew Klein, chief program officer at Robin Hood.Recent data has shown the outsized spending higher-income Americans have been doing compared with those in the bottom tiers of wealth. Bank of Americafoundthat low-income household spending has grown 0.7% over the last year, compared with a 2.7% growth for high-income earners.A line chart showing that spending growth rose to 0.7% for lower-income households and to 2.7% for higher-income groups, compared with same time last yearThe trend has been showing up slowly in people’s credit scores. The number of people with super-prime credit scores has climbed simultaneously to the number of people with sub-prime credit scores also rising, according to credit agencyTransUnion.Chief executives of companies such as Delta, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s have pointed out the K-shaped gap they’re seeing in consumer behavior.Delta’s CEO, Ed Bastian, said the company is seeing a lot of growth from its premium customers, who buy business- and first-class tickets. Henrique Braun, the chief operating officer of the Coca-Cola Company, said on an earnings call that the company’s revenue growth is being led by higher sales of its premium products, such as Topo Chico sparkling water and Fairlife protein shakes.Meanwhile, McDonald’s CEO, Chris Kempczinski, said that the chain’s middle- and low-income consumers are “feeling under a lot of pressure right now”.“It’s a really kind of two-tier economy,” he said. “People are actually skipping breakfast – or they are choosing to just eat at home.”Julien, the PrintempsChristmasshopper, said he’s seen his business as a custom stylist grow over the last year.“Our company is growing, it’s better than last year,” he said. “No complaints there.

And God forbid anyone says ‘commercial’. To them, it’s the worst thing in the world.”Kors doesn’t just sell clothing but a glamorous aspirational lifestyle that he and his brand embody. His designs have been worn by everyone from first ladies to Gwyneth Paltrow and Megan Thee Stallion. But while his Instagram feed is peppered with A-lister dinner parties, summers sailing around the Saronic islands and glossy catwalk shots, it’s the brand’s more mainstream off-shoot MICHAEL Michael Kors that is its economic moat. Stroll down any high street and you’ll spot the shiny MK logo swinging from bags slung over the shoulders of finance graduates or hanging from the elbows of women who wanted a designer bag for less than four figures.View image in fullscreenMichael Kors: ‘We all know different people of different ages and different sizes. Don’t you want them all to be invited to the party?’Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Michael KorsAlongside Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors remains just one of the last three big heritage designers to still be designing at their American namesake brands. Matthieu Blazy at Chanel may be the industry’s new hot topic but in a pub quiz its Kors’ name that is going to resonate. A 10-season stint as a judge on the TV show Project Runway means he is now recognised on the street. He has honed his look too, including aviator sunglasses and a year-round caramel tan.In the context of a noticeable return to extreme thinness in the industry – after the latest round of shows in September, industry experts expressed concern aboutsize zero coming back to the catwalks, with many crediting the widespread use of weight-loss drugs as having a normalising effect – Kors continues to cast a range of sizes. In contrast, some brands that had previously included plus-size models used exclusively straight-sized models (a UK 4-8).View image in fullscreenSuki Waterhouse in the Michael Kors 2025 fall campaign.Photograph: Michael KorsKors finds attitudes towards sizing in the industry frustrating. “Unfortunately, I think fashion people can be overly trendy. They think things are a trend rather than actually moving something forward. We all have families. We all know different people of different ages and different sizes. Don’t you want them all to be invited to the party? That’s to me how it should be.”Kors started his label in 1981 with a debut collection featuring sports-inspired pieces such as loosely tailored trousers and knitted polo shirts, laying the foundations of what would later become known in the industry as athleisure. His empire now spans watches, shoes, eyewear and fragrance.In her new photo book,The Look, the former first lady Michelle Obama – who wore a black sleeveless dress designed by Kors in her first official portrait – described how the media and public’s “fascination” with her bare arms wasused as a tool to “otherize” her.A staunch Democrat, Kors describes political dressing as “the trickiest thing in the world”. His designs are also favoured by Melania Trump, whom Kors describes as “a longtime client”. Kors says: “It doesn’t matter who you are, it’s an impossible situation to have eyes on you at every angle.” He compares it to the red carpet. “People think if they were a celebrity they could wear anything they want but they’re just as petrified walking out the door.”Capri Holdings’s increased interest in the business comes after a series of setbacks for the group, including itsfailed $8.5bn proposed mergerwith Tapestry and higher pricing missteps at Michael Kors – the result of an attempt to cushion the impact of US trade tariffs.View image in fullscreenThe new flagship Michael Kors store in Regent Street, central London.Photograph: Courtesy of Michael KorsPart of Capri’s strategy to turn Michael Kors into the next global behemoth is to focus on the sizeable mid-tier market. According to the data research company Edited, luxury prices have risen 25% since 2019. While the 1% are unfazed, the more aspirational customer, who previously would have saved up to buy a designer coat or bag once a year, have in effect been priced out. This is the customer Capri Holdings – which also owns Jimmy Choo – is now confident it can appeal to.Kors’ bags – including the Quinn tote that fits a laptop without looking like a laptop bag – hover around the £230 mark, while a new take on its bestselling Hamilton bag, carried by Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss, is £275. Rachel Morgans, the director of fashion at John Lewis, credits the brand’s “brilliant price point” as one of the reasons it has been a top seller since the retailer started stocking it in 2013.At a dinner to celebrate the London opening, Kors was flanked by the singer Suki Waterhouse and the actor Gemma Chan, but the day before he was in a Philadelphia mall meeting customers. “If you lock yourself in your atelier and you’re only surrounded by your circle of friends or your circle of employees, you’re gonna limit yourself,” Kors says. “You have got to stay curious. It’s important I know what type of thing my customers want.” Right now that is“things that delight but still function”, with a shift away from a wear-once mentality.View image in fullscreenSuki Waterhouse at the 2025 Met Gala.Photograph: John Shearer/WireImageAt 66, Kors says he doesn’t dwell on succession plans. “In fashion we are always working on the next thing. It changes so quickly. As long as I still enjoy it and I’m curious and energised then great. If not I’ll go do something else.”He isn’t nostalgic but does spend time searching for pieces from his earliest collections. “At the time I had no money so I sold everything. I spend time hunting, but a vintage dealer told me my pieces are hard to find. People don’t want to sell them. They hang on to them or pass them on.”Part of the appeal is pegged to his inclusive catwalks spanning size, age and race. “If you’re a good designer and you like people, your job should be to be a problem solver for different ages, different sizes, different heights and so on.”Explore more on these topicsFashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Suggested alternatives include the less appetising“discs” or “tubes”.McCartney said: “To stipulate that burgers and sausages are ‘plant-based’, ‘vegetarian’ or ‘vegan’ should be enough for sensible people to understand what they are eating. This also encourages attitudes which are essential to our health and that of the planet.”The musician is one of the world’s most prominent advocates of a vegetarian diet. He and his late wife founded the Linda McCartney plant-based foods brand in 1991 and he and their daughters Mary and Stella launched the global“Meat Free Monday”campaign to encourage people to eat less meat.View image in fullscreenThe EU is set to decide whether to ban wording for plant-based and vegetarian foods following lobbying by the meat industry.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockLinda McCartney sausages andburgershave been part of a global trend of increased interest in products to replace meat, even if investment haswaned since a bubbleduring the coronavirus pandemic.Yet with the growth of plant-based products has come a backlash, particularly from the politically powerful farming and meat distribution industries, which are worried about the potential effects of lower demand on jobs.The European parliament voted 355–247 to ban “meat-related” names from being used on plant-based products. According to Euronews, Céline Imart, a French member of the centre-right European People’s party and proponent of the ban, told the parliament: “I accept that steak, cutlet or sausage are products from our livestock farms. Full stop. No laboratory substitutes, no plant-based products.”The letter signed by the McCartney family and the British MPs argued that the EU rulescould force Britain into changesas well, because the markets and regulation are still so intertwined despite the UK’s departure from the EU.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the attempt to limit the use of generic terms is more controversial.Many of the terms that would be banned have malleable meanings. For instance, the Collins dictionary defines a sausage firstly in relation to meat but secondly as “an object shaped like a sausage”. Even more problematically for a ban, the primary definition of “burger” is given as a “flat round mass of minced meat or vegetables”.The eight MP signatories to the letter include the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the former Green party co-leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionVegetarian food and drinkVegan food and drinkPaul McCartneyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

First Nations fear another ‘worst-case scenario’Mark Carney is considering lifting a tanker ban that has protected coastal communities for 53 yearsLeyland Ceccoin Bella Bella and Toronto, CanadaSun 7 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 12.38 ESTShareThe distress call went out to the Canadian coast guard station after midnight on an October night. The Nathan E Stewart, an American-flagged tugboat, sailing through the light winds and rain of the central British Columbia coast, hadgrounded on a reef.The captain tried to reverse, moving the rudder from hard over port to hard over starboard. The boat pivoted but did not move, and the tug repeatedly struck the sea bed.Four hours later, the ship began taking on water, and leaking diesel into the sea. That evening, a coast guard helicopter confirmed the “worst-case scenario”: a large sheen of diesel oil on the water was visible outside of a containment boom. In total, 110,000 litres spilled near the entrance to Seaforth Channel.“I remember being in my office later that day getting calls from elders in the community. Some were crying and very upset. They talked as though we had lost someone in our community. People were devastated,” said Marilynn Slett, chief councillor of the Heiltsuk Nation, whose community of Bella Bella was 10 nautical miles from the grounding. “The spill contaminated our primary harvesting sites, causing immediate economic loss that are still ongoing today.”Canada minister resigns from cabinet over Carney’s controversial oil pipeline dealRead moreNearly a decade after the 2016 disaster, the nation is still fighting for compensation for the losses it bore, including the destruction of clam gardens they had cultivated for centuries. And their lengthy and tiring battle has returned to the spotlight as Mark Carney, the prime minister, supports a pipeline project that would ferry bitumen across Alberta and British Columbia. Part of that would involve lifting a tanker ban that has been in place for 53 years.Against the backdrop of a trade war and the climate crisis,Canadais in a difficult position. It is the world’s fourth-largest oil producer with the fourth-largest reserves, outproducing most members of Opec. But swathes of the country are also warming faster than the rest of the world, and communities are facing the devastating effects.Grappling with those two realities, Carney has pledged to help Alberta with a pipeline that would move“at least one million barrels a day” to Asia. With new legislative powers, Carney’s government could also slash permitting and approval delays and is weighing lifting the moratorium on tanker traffic along the BC north coast.For many, that ban, formalized into law in 2019, reflects the inherent danger of shipping oil through a region of tempestuous weather,physical hazardsanddeeply revered marine ecosystems.“It’s spectacularly dangerous to conceive of putting a pipeline to northern BC and hauling that oil across the Gulf of Alaska to Asian markets,” Rick Steiner, who was one of the first on the scene of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, told the Canadian Press. “It should not see the light of day.”View image in fullscreenPrince William Sound, Alaska, after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, on 24 March 1989.Photograph: William Nation/Getty ImagesLarge oil tankers would likely have to traverse portions of the Hecate Strait, described by author John Vaillant as a “malevolent weather factory” where winter storms produce “one of the most diabolically hostile environments that wind, sea and land are capable of conjuring”.Coastal First Nations, which represent nine nations along the central coast,swiftly declared that the project “would never happen”, and said the tanker ban was non-negotiable. Chiefs representing more than 600 First Nations voted unanimously for Ottawa to uphold the oil-tanker ban and to withdraw from the deal between the federal and Alberta governments that could see a pipeline project pushed through.Green party leader Elizabeth May said in a statement there was “no chance on God’s green Earth that an oil tanker will ever move through the inner waters between Haida Gwaii and the north coast of British Columbia”. May added that “governments cannot wish away science” nor can they “pretend that an oil tanker would not break apart under those conditions”.For First Nations on the coast, the prospect of an oil spill is deeply feared.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The ecosystem still bears the scars of the Nathan E Stewart grounding: traditional harvesting sites have been closed and the damage to the ecosystem has permitted invasive species such as the European green crab to thrive.λáλíyasila Frank Brown, a Heiltsuk hereditary chief, said hiscommunity is open to industrial development, but only projects for which the risks can be safely managed – and the community consents.BC’s premier, David Eby, alluded to this reality when he told reporters he was open to a pipeline proposal, but said any project that would require the tanker ban to be lifted was a non-starter. He pointed out that billions of dollars’ worth of projects in the region, including liquefied natural gas terminals, currently have support from First Nations, and warned that support could be rapidly withdrawn if the federal government pushes to lift the tanker ban. Scrapping the ban would be a “grave mistake”, he said, adding: “I think that the risk of an oil spill is really significant in terms of the economic harm.”View image in fullscreenWorkers use pressure washers to wash oil from the beach at Smith Island on Prince William Sound.Photograph: Bob Hallinen/MCT/Getty ImagesFor Slett and her community, the potential harms transcend economics and push into cultural losses that have proven far more damaging. Under existing maritime law, the Heiltsuk aren’t eligible for compensation for cultural losses – including the loss of access to cultural sites. A delegation traveled to London last year to meet with the UN’s international marine organization to lobby for changes.“We’ve been fighting for justice through this colonial legal system and it’s really a process of ‘show me your receipts’. But how do you show a receipt for the loss of our ability to transmit our knowledge and our cultural practices between generations?” she asked.The cleanup salvage operations for the Nathan E Stewart spill took 40 days, with harsh weather suspending work for 11 of those. It took 45 vessels and more than 200 people to help with both the initial response and the cleanup.“That was a spill of fewer than 700 barrels and yet it polluted over 1,500 acres of our territory,” said Slett, adding that large oil tankers can carry more than 2m barrels. “We just cannot accept this risk to our community after seeing what can happen. We can’t. And we won’t.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaOil spillsIndigenous peoplesOilOil and gas companiesEconomic recoveryEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 33-year-old also claimed he no longer has a relationship with Slot, who omitted the forward from his starting lineup for a third game in succession.Self-indulgent Mohamed Salah betrays teammates and hastens end of Liverpool era | Andy HunterRead moreThe Egypt forward has 19 months remaining on the £400,000-a-week contract he signed in April but is likely to be the subject of renewed interest from the Saudi Pro League when the transfer window reopens next month. Al-Ittihad, who failed in a £150m move for Salah in September 2023, and Al-Hilal are both believed to be keen on signing the third highest goalscorer in Liverpool’s history.Salah’s immediate future is also unclear. The forward reported for training on Sunday as scheduled. Members of the Liverpool hierarchy are understood to have discussed the situation but did not wish to inflame matters with a public response. Slot now has to decide whether to include the disillusioned player in his plans for Inter.Liverpool will train at their AXA base in Kirkby on Monday morning, with the first 15 minutes open to the media. The squad will fly to Italy in the afternoon before Slot faces questions for the first time on Salah’s claims at a press conference at San Siro.Salah, who received a message of support from the Egyptian Football Association on social media on Sunday, suggested in his interview at Elland Road that he may have played his final game for Liverpool. He is due to report for Africa Cup of Nations duty next Monday, 48 hours after Liverpool host Brighton at Anfield, but it is uncertain whether he will be involved in the club’s next two matches.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

Josh Allen threw for three touchdowns and ran for one, and Christian Benford scored the go-ahead TD on a 63-yard interception return. Allen’s 40-yard TD rush broke his record for the longest by a Bills quarterback. Buffalo flipped the game with big plays on defense on a snowy afternoon. Benford and defensive end AJ Epenesa intercepted Joe Burrow on consecutive plays from scrimmage, leading to the Bills scoring three touchdowns in a span of 4:20 in the fourth quarter.Pittsburgh Steelers 27–22 Baltimore RavensAaron Rodgers threw for 284 yards and a touchdown and even ran for TD in perhaps his best game with the Steelers, and Pittsburgh (7-6) took sole possession of first place in the AFC North, holding on for victory over the Ravens (6-7) when a Baltimore touchdown with 2:43 remaining was overturned by a replay review. Isaiah Likely secured a pass from Lamar Jackson with two hands in the end zone, and both his feet came down, but as he was about to complete another step with his right foot, Joey Porter Jr knocked the ball free. It was initially called a touchdown but then changed to incomplete. The Ravens eventually turned the ball over on downs.Chicago Bears 21–28 Green Bay PackersThe Green Bay Packers (9-3-1) have overtaken the Chicago Bears (9-4) for first place in the NFC North. Keisean Nixon intercepted Caleb Williams’ pass in the end zone with 22 seconds remaining to seal Green Bay’s win over Chicago. The Bears were facing fourth-and-one from Green Bay’s 14-yard line when Williams faked a handoff and rolled to his left. Tight end Cole Kmet had gotten behind Nixon in the end zone, but Nixon made a leaping catch of the underthrown pass. Josh Jacobs scored the tiebreaking touchdown on a two-yard run with 3:32 remaining as the Packers won their fourth straight and snapped Chicago’s five-game win streak.Indianapolis Colts 19–36 Jacksonville JaguarsTrevor Lawrence threw two touchdowns, and Travis Etienne rushed for two others to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars to a commanding victory in a crucial AFC South matchup. Lawrence completed 17 of 30 passes for 244 yards. Brian Thomas Jr caught three passes for 87 yards, while Tim Patrick had 78 yards and a touchdown on five catches. Jacksonville (9-4) won their fourth straight game to move into sole possession of first place in the AFC South. Indianapolis (8-5) lost starting quarterback Daniel Jones to an achilles injury late in the first quarter. The offense continued to move the ball at times with his backup, rookie Riley Leonard, but struggled to finish drives.Los Angeles Rams 45–17 Arizona CardinalsMatthew Stafford threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns, Puka Nacua and Blake Corum both scored twice and the Los Angeles Rams (10-3) rolled past the Arizona Cardinals. The Rams (10-3) scored 35 unanswered points to bounce back from last week’s turnover-filled loss to the Panthers. They won for the seventh time in eight games. Los Angeles are tied with the Seahawks atop the division, one game ahead of the 49ers. The reeling Cardinals (3-10) have lost five straight and 10 of their past 11 after starting the season with a 2-0 record.Denver Broncos 24–17 Las Vegas RaidersThe Denver Broncos have finally won a game where they didn’t fall behind. Bo Nix passed for 212 yards and rushed for a touchdown, and the Broncos beat the Las Vegas Raiders. The Raiders lost quarterback Geno Smith, who injured his right hand and shoulder in the third quarter and was replaced by Kenny Pickett. The Broncos improved to 11-2. They tied New England for the top seed in the AFC, and they ended theirNFLrecord of rallying for nine consecutive victories. The Raiders (2-11) have lost seven straight.New Orleans Saints 24-20 Tampa Bay BuccaneersThe New Orleans Saints upset the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to tighten the NFC South race. Rookie quarterback Tyler Shough ran for two touchdowns for lowly New Orleans, who improved to 3-10. The Saints were 8.5-point underdogs. They frustrated Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers in a sloppy game mostly played through a storm. The four-time defending division champion Bucs fell to 7-6. They lost for the fourth time in five games and fell into a first-place tie with Carolina. The Bucs and Panthers face off twice in the final three games.Seattle Seahawks 37–9 Atlanta FalconsRashid Shaheed returned the second-half kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, Seattle’s defense came up with three turnovers and the Seahawks beat the hapless Atlanta Falcons. Seattle improved to 10-3 and have their sights on a division title, maybe even a top seed in January. Sam Darnold threw for 249 yards and three touchdowns, including a pair of scores to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. The Seahawks broke away from a 6-6 tie at halftime with a 31-point beatdown of the Falcons over the final two quarters. The Falcons dropped to 4-9 and were officially eliminated from playoff contention.Tennessee Titans 31-29 Cleveland BrownsCam Ward threw two touchdown passes and Tony Pollard ran for two touchdowns as the Tennessee Titans ended a seven-game losing streak. The Titans kept Cleveland (3-10) out of the end zone in the second half until the Browns tallied two touchdowns in the waning minutes–- and followed both with failed two-point conversion attempts – to create drama between a pair of struggling teams. Shedeur Sanders threw seven yards to Harold Fannin II for a touchdown with 1:03 to play, but a two-point conversion pass failed. Pollard rushed for 161 yards on 25 carries as the Titans (2-11) won despite managing only 292 yards of total offense. Tennessee piled up their largest point total of the season. Ward was 14-for-28 for 117 yards and threw an early interception.Washington Commanders 0–31 Minnesota VikingsJJ McCarthy threw a career-high three touchdown passes in his first turnover-free game, returning from his latest injury absence in prime form for the Minnesota Vikings in a victory that sent the Washington Commanders to their eighth straight loss. McCarthy went 16 for 23 for 163 yards in his seventh NFL start. He sat out last week with a concussion while the Vikings were shut out for the first time in 18 years. McCarthy hit his tight ends for all three scores, two to Josh Oliver and one to TJ Hockenson. The Vikings are 5-8. The Commanders are 3-10.Miami Dolphins 34–10 New York JetsTua Tagovailoa remained unbeaten against the New York Jets, leading the Miami Dolphins (6-7) to victory over their AFC East rivals. With the win, Tagovailoa improved to 7-0 against the Jets (3-10) as a starter. The Dolphins have now won five of their last six games. De’Von Achane ran for 92 yards and a touchdown before leaving with a rib injury. Jaylen Wright stepped in with a career-high 107 yards. The Jets, now eliminated from playoff contention, saw rookie quarterback Brady Cook make his NFL debut after Tyrod Taylor left with a groin injury. Miami’s defense and special teams also played key roles in the win.Explore more on these topicsNFLBuffalo BillsPittsburgh SteelersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet it was testament to the resolution he has shown all season that while down he was far from out, as he proved in going on to claim the title that he felt had slipped away.When Norris took the world championship with histhird‑place finish in Abu Dhabion Sunday he became the first British champion since Lewis Hamilton took his last title in 2020 and, similar to Hamilton for his first win in 2008, he had to show his absolute determination to close it out after a rollercoaster ride for the 26-year-old.Lando Norris wins F1 world title in Abu Dhabi despite Verstappen’s GP winRead moreQuite apart from what has been a gruelling test of his driving ability across a season marked by intense competition, the level of emotional and psychological control that Norris has had to demonstrate must not be underestimated.He had gone in as favourite back in Melbourne for the opening race but for great swathes of this season he has been under the cosh. He was on the back foot first to his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri, who had for so long been leading with a calm consistency that gave him the air of a world champion in waiting, and then in the late stages toan intimidating chargefrom that most threatening of beasts, Max Verstappen, with the bit between his teeth and nothing to lose.A season of twists and turns had opened well for Norris, as with great verve he weathered a storm towin the Australian Grand Prixin treacherous conditions. He held his nerve like a champion and the McLaren was so quick that this writer considered their biggest headache might be how they managed their two charges. This would, in turn, come to dominate the discourse.View image in fullscreenLando Norris of McLaren after securing third place at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi – and the world title.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty ImagesWhat followed, however, was not the narrative Norris would have liked. He was, it became clear, not as at ease with the performance characteristics of theMcLarenas Piastri. Notably there was his feel for the front grip, a key part of his driving style, and it was proving particularly costly in qualifying as he attempted to adapt.Piastri won from polein China, Verstappen then in Japan and, in Bahrain, Norris was found wanting in what was to be a real indicator of how hard he was trying to push his car and the knife-edge it represented. He qualified poorly in a race Piastri went on to win and at the next round in Saudi Arabia worse followed: Norris crashed out in qualifying, and Piastri won again to take the championship lead for the first time.As Norris battled, the young Australian was demonstrating all the hallmarks of a prospective champion. There was something of Alain Prost about the smooth ease and precision of his performance. He followed it with no little battling spirit to take victory from fourth onthe grid in Miami.It was not until Monaco, round eight, that Norristook his second victory, a win he enjoyed like no other. Yet what was most notable was that the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, was spot-on in describing it as cold‑blooded in how clinically he delivered under pressure and an indication that he had lost none of his resolve to stay in the fight as he closed to within three points of Piastri.View image in fullscreenLando Norris (right) began the season with victory at the Australian Grand Prix.Photograph: James Ross/EPAThey were in touching distance. The McLaren chief executive, Zak Brown, had conceded early in the season that with two evenly matched drivers in a championship-winning car, on-track contact between them was more a question of when than if – and at the next round, in Canada, clash they did and Norris was at fault. Three laps from the end as they battled over fourth place, Norris hit the back of Piastri’s car attempting to pass the Australian. Norris held his hands up. “All my bad, all my fault, stupid from me,” he said.However, what stood out at this point in conversation with Norris was how impressively he was handling the highs and lows of such a challenging season. Assessing these blows and the storm around him, he maintained a rock-like equilibrium with striking good humour. He would reiterate confidence in his own ability, a determination to eliminate errors, a belief that he could and he would. Observing at the time, it might have been possible to surmise that this was the wishful thinking so beloved of sport psychologists – but for the fact he did indeed deliver on it all.At thenext round in Austriathere was a turning point. McLaren brought a major upgrade, a front‑suspension development they were hoping would give Norris the feel he required. It worked, as with a nerveless run he closed out a tightly fought battle against his teammate with superb control. Stella had praised Norris’s resilience as “typical of a champion” and he demonstrated it at the Red Bull Ring.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri and Lando Norris crash out during the sprint race at the United States Grand Prix.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/ReutersHe and Piastri then exchanged blows, Norris taking the home victory at Silverstone he craved so much, Piastri being on top at Spa, and then Norris pulling off something of a coup with a one-stop strategy to claim victory in Hungary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By its close, after his car gave out with seven laps to go, he was left, head bowed, alone in the dunes beside the North Sea. With Piastri winning, he was 34 points back with only nine races to go. It appeared a mountain to climb with so little between them in their cars.Yet the next round at Monza was another gamechanger. Verstappen, who had long since declared he had abandoned any title ambitions and who was 104 points back from Piastri after the race in the Netherlands, launched his own fightback, as Red Bull finally found the balance for their car that had eluded them all season. He duly won in a race that would come to loom over Norris and McLaren.The team’s laudable efforts to be scrupulously fair to both drivers, allowing them to race freely and according to the team’s agreed arrangements, reached a somewhat tortuous conclusion as Piastri was told to cede back to Norris the second place he had gained because of a slow pit stop for the British driver. The team had made arrangements for this scenario. Norris had nothing to do with it, but the optics were terrible and he was booed repeatedly in races that followed because of a perceived bias in his favour.Far more significant was the next round in Azerbaijan where Piastri, still aggrieved at the Monza orders, endured his first major wobble. Dropping to last from a botched start, he went into a corner too hot in an effort to make up places, locked up and put his McLaren in the wall. The touch that was so assured for so long had deserted him just as Norris found a purple patch of form.View image in fullscreenLando Norris showed confidence in his own ability and a determination to eliminate errors on his way to world title glory.Photograph: DPPI/ShutterstockNorris was blunt in barging past him at the start in Singapore and, while Verstappen won again in Texas, it was Norris who claimed second before taking dominant, assured victories in Mexico, where he retook the title lead, and Brazil. In this series of four races, Piastri could manage no better than fourth.It had been no little turnaround, unexpected perhaps by everyone except Norris himself, whose belief had not wavered. Heading into the Las Vegas GP with a 24‑point lead on Piastri and 49 on Verstappen, there was more to come. Both McLarens were disqualified in Nevada for excessive wear to the skid block and Verstappen’s win brought him to within 24 points of the lead, looming larger than ever.With the nerves jangling and only two races remaining after their miscalculations in Vegas, closing it out was an impossibly tense affair, exacerbated as the team dropped the ball again at the penultimate round in Qatar. There McLaren were found wanting with a decision not to pit their drivers under an early safety car while the rest of the field did so, costing them the lead and then ceding the win to Verstappen. Piastri took second but Norris was only fourth and Verstappen was within 12 points, a lurking threat for an all‑or‑nothing finale.Yet Norris was as unperturbed in the decider at Abu Dhabi as he had been in the throes of the early season travails. Confident in the abilities that had brought him so far, he was solid and nerveless, clinching it with the necessary third place to ensure he controlled his own destiny – as he had all season. He beat Verstappen to the title by just two points, but that is all that matters. He weathered the eye of the storm with a burger of solace and emerged a deserved champion.Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisMcLarenFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Fighting Irish (10-2), who won their last 10 games by an average of nearly 30 points, watched championship weekend from afar, idle as an independent with no options to impress the selection committee one last time in a league title game. Miami also finished 10-2, while Alabama ended the season 10-3.Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua and coach Marcus Freeman had taken the high road in recent weeks, avoiding too much lobbying and believing their winning streak would be enough to earn a berth over Alabama.“As a team, we’ve decided to withdraw our name from consideration for a bowl game following the 2025 season,” the team said in a statement. “We appreciate all the support from our families and fans, and we’re hoping to bring the 12th national title to South Bend in 2026.”CFP selection committee chair Hunter Yurachek said the head-to-head meeting between Miami and Notre Dame was the deciding factor.“Once we moved Miami ahead of BYU, then we had that side-by-side comparison that everybody had been hungering for,” Yurachek said. “You look at those two teams on paper, and they are almost equal in their schedule strength, their common opponents, the results against common opponents. But the one metric we had to fall back on, again, was the head to head.”Unlike Iowa State and Kansas State, who each got fined $500,000 by the Big 12 for opting out of a bowl game because of coaching changes, Notre Dame won’t be punished because they are not a full-fledged member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.American Conference champion Tulane got the 11th spot and Sun Belt champion James Madison got the last spot over Duke, the champion of the Atlantic Coast Conference.The rest of the field: No 5 Oregon, No 6 Ole Miss, No 7 Texas A&M and No 8 Oklahoma.The playoffs start 19-20 December with first-round games: James Madison at Oregon; Tulane at Misssissippi; Miami at Texas A&M; and Alabama at Oklahoma.The final is set for 19 January at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The move follows reports in the Guardian that have raised questions from MPs about the activities of Bloom, a billionaire who has made his money from gambling.The Guardian revealed last week that Bloom, the majority shareholder at Brighton,is being suedin a lawsuit that alleges “frontmen” were sometimes used when his gambling syndicate placed bets on sports events. The details were set out in a public document at the high court in London, which named George Cottrell, a close associate of the Reform party leader, Nigel Farage, as one person who acted as a front for the collective, known as the Starlizard Betting Syndicate. The case involves a dispute between Bloom and Ryan Dudfield, a former associate who claims he is owed a share of gambling profits.The syndicate makes about £600m each year in winnings, the document alleges.Bloom has yet to file a defence to the lawsuit. He did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the claim. Lawyers acting for Cottrell were approached for comment.On Friday,the Guardian published a second storywhich focused on allegations Bloom could be an anonymous gambler behind $70m (£52m) in winnings – which allegedly included bets on his football teams.Bloom declined to comment about this specific claim, but through a source made clear he denied betting on his own teams or competitions that involve them, describing any such allegations as “entirely false”.Following publication of the Guardian story, Bloom issued a public statement through Brighton FC in which he said: “I can categorically assure our supporters that I have not placed bets on any Brighton & Hove Albion matches since becoming the owner of the club in 2009.”MPs have said these matters need to be properly examined.Clive Betts, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on football, said on Friday that the Football Association needed to conduct “a thorough and comprehensive investigation”.Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservative party, said: “The FA must be much more transparent about their lax policy concerning the use of gambling money in the running of their clubs.”A spokesperson for the Guardian said: “It is a worrying development that Brighton has introduced this ban. The questions raised by our reporting are in the public interest and have been pursued in a responsible manner.”Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionGamblingThe GuardiannewsShareReuse this content"

Surely. Definitely. Inter Miami would be behind. Lionel Messi’s chance at capturing the trophy he most wanted to win would be teetering on a knife’s edge. And perhaps most distressingly to Inter Miami, two retiring legends, Sergi Busquets and Jordi Alba, would be closing in on ignominious ends. They would have come to MLS to accompany Messi, their friend, but would end their time on the field as losers of a final, the type of game they so often won at club and international level.All that ball had to do was cross the line. The Vancouver Whitecaps’ Emmanuel Sabbi had imbued it with a seeming destiny after a virtuoso run into the heart of the Inter Miami defense. His left-footed effort wrapped around the outstretched hand of Miami goalkeeper Rocco Ríos Novo. It smacked the inside of the far post. It bounced on the line.Inter Miami claim MLS Cup as Messi inspires tight win over VancouverRead moreAnd then it hit the inside of the other post, its spin bringing it unexpectedly to the foot ofInter Miamidefender Maximiliano Falcón. The Uruguayan made a mess of his first touch, the ball ricocheting back towards the goal line as Sabbi went in for the rebound. With a desperate lunge, Falcón slid to knock the ball away, sending it careening off of Sabbi’s shin, and finally, incredibly, out of play.Sabbi grabbed the net and kicked the advertising boards in frustration. Falcón celebrated just as hard as the delirious crowd in the South Florida heat. A game the Whitecaps had started to take by the scruff of the neck had turned around and barked.“It’s the luck that you need to be champions,” Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano put it afterward.A little more than 30 minutes later, with silver confetti strewn on the turf, Lionel Messi walked towards the luxury suites at field level here at Chase Stadium. That is where his children and family reside during Miami home games, right next to those of Alba, right next to those of Busquets, right next to those of Luis Suárez. An improvised in-stadium neighborhood where the players’ significant others and children mingle from suite to suite. Surrounded by photographers and with hundreds of Miami fans perched above, yelling congratulations and following their every move on video, the quartet of ex-Barcelona amigos nonetheless looked entirely at ease. Busquets posed for a picture with one of his sons. Alba soon joined with one of his own. Messi filtered in and out of all the suites, chasing his own sons as they made mock snow angels in the confetti. At one point, he looked up with Suárez and marvelled that the crowd was, indeed, watching them.“Given what they’ve been – as players, both were among the greatest in history, each in his position, with the careers they had and the titles they won – it’s wonderful that they can retire with thisMLStitle,” Messi said afterward of Busquets and Alba. “I don’t think they’re fully aware yet of what they’re experiencing, of what it means to retire. Today something very beautiful ends for them, something to which they dedicated their whole lives. Now a new life begins for them. I wish them the very best, because they are two friends I care for deeply. I’m happy they can leave with this title.”Only Busquets and Alba have announced their retirement, but Suárez too seems to potentially be one his way out – if not as a professional then perhaps as an Inter Miami player. The Uruguayan did not play in the MLS Cup final, with his relegation to the bench before the playoffs proving to be part of the spark that ignited a great run from Inter Miami down the stretch.Alba and Busquets, too, had to evolve – and there were signs even in the final that the natural physical dropoff that happens at the end of every career had reached its end. Busquets failed often to be the outlet for the back four that had been his calling card, with Vancouver repeatedly causing dangerous turnovers in Miami’s own third, in spots where Busquets might otherwise have been. Alba, meanwhile, had a whale of a time dealing with Sabbi, whose double-post moment could so easily have swung the postgame mood to one of despair.Yet both had bright moments, with Busquets remaining the incisive and intelligent passer he always was, and Alba continuing his seemingly telepathic connection with Messi throughout the season.“We were kind of conscious that this moment was going to happen,” said Miami midfielder Yannick Bright, one of many young players in pink who have spoken repeatedly at the impact the pair had in raising their level as the Herons competed on five fronts through 58 games this regular season. “I had to stop walking in the locker room because I was getting really, really sad. Really emotional.”It could have gone the other way, with just one degree of spin, or a tackle arriving a split-second too late.“Honestly, it was insane,” Bright said. “Sometimes you need some luck.”Explore more on these topicsInter MiamiMLSUS sportsLionel MessiVancouver WhitecapsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the meantime, it is worth pondering how on earth the club got into this pickle.By the time Kieran Tierney cracked home a stoppage-time goal againstHearts, ordinarily the trigger for a cavalry charge by those in green and white, the stadium was all but empty. Hope had been abandoned by a supporter base who seem – rightly – to flick between mutiny and bewilderment.Those watching at home caught a glimpse of Paul Tisdale, Celtic’s head of football operations, appearing to nod off during the second half. Had Tisdale paid attention, he would have witnessed Celtic’s latest failure to deal with a team who sat deep and displayed excellent defensive discipline. “We were in between playing through the middle or going wide,” Nancy said. This was accurate. His analysis of a “really good first half” was more questionable. Goodness knows what Nancy would regard as a cause for concern.Tisdale was not in attendance as Nancy addressed the media on Friday, in what was the most underwhelming arrival of a Celtic manager in living memory. No other senior club official flanked the Frenchman, either. There was no opportunity to press the Celtic hierarchy on precisely why Brendan Rodgers resigned – immediately after their last defeat against Hearts – or why it felt wise to coax Nancy from Columbus Crew, who finished seventh in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer in the US. This process took more than a month.Quick GuideSaturday's Premiership roundup: Rangers ease past KilmarnockShowBojan Miovski scored twice asRangersmoved to within six points of the leaders with a 3-0 win atKilmarnock. Danny Rohl’s side hit the front in the 33rd minute with a drive from the North Macedonia striker, who added his second nine minutes after the break with a fine finish from inside the box. The travelling fans celebrated further when the Spurs loanee Mikey Moore came off the bench to add a third in the 81st minute before having a second disallowed. The Kilmarnock manager, Stuart Kettlewell, was sent off by the referee, Kevin Clancy, in the 72nd minute as Rangers moved up to fourth.A first-half Adil Aouchiche double helpedAberdeenbeatDundee3-1 and extend their unbeaten run to six. Aouchiche got the opener on 16 minutes and then got his second soon after, putting his side in command at the break. Dundee pulled one back through Ryan Astley on 63 minutes but it was not enough as just before the end Kevin Nisbet got Aberdeen’s third to seal the win.Hiberniangot back to winning ways, endingFalkirk’s five-game unbeaten streak in a 3-0 victory. The Australian forward, Martin Boyle, scored the first after making no mistake from the penalty spot. Just before half-time, Hibernian’s lead was doubled through a Kieron Bowie finish from outside the box. Ethan Ross thought he had got Falkirk back in it, however, after a lengthy VAR review it was deemed to be offside, before Bowie got his second to wrap things up.Motherwellalso came out on top as 3-0 winners against the bottom sideLivingston, extending their unbeaten run to eight league games. After a strong start, Motherwell went ahead in the 18th minute courtesy of a curling 20-yard strike from midfielder Elliot Watt. On the hour mark, that lead was doubled as Apostolos Stamatelopoulos converted from the spot and Emmanuel Longelo made it three with two minutes to go.St Mirrengot their first victory in eight league games in a 2-0 win againstDundee Unitedat the SMISA stadium. A first of the season for Conor McMenamin put St Mirren in the lead after 16 minutes when he headed home at the far post. Keanu Baccus got St Mirren’s second with his first goal since returning to Saints to round things off.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nancy may well be a terrific coach. He might be the man to rejuvenate Celtic. It is never wise for anybody associated with Scottish football to adopt a sniffy attitude towards incomers. It is just so difficult to fathom how Celtic, who jousted with the best in the Champions League last season, find themselves at this low ebb. Nancy is incomparable in respect of status and experience to Rodgers. The scale of necessary Celtic rebuild is huge. They are trusting a coach who has never managed anywhere remotely resembling this environment to oversee it.Celtic’s showing against Hearts was abject, typified by misplaced passes and a lack of imagination within 30 yards of goal. Cláudio Braga and Oisin McEntee have been fine signings for Hearts. Yet here were players signed from the Norwegian second tier and on a free transfer from Walsall punishing a team who went toe‑to‑toe with Bayern Munich this year. Tomas Bent Magnusson, who excelled in the visiting midfield, was a £35,000 signing from Icelandic football.View image in fullscreenCláudio Braga gives Hearts the lead at Celtic Park.Photograph: Malcolm Mackenzie/Hearts FC/ProSports/ShutterstockThose in the stands continue to vent frustration towards Celtic’s directors. This is a club at odds with itself, a scenario not at all masked by the 73-year-old Martin O’Neill churning out some reasonable results between Rodgers exiting and Nancy arriving. There will be no cause for wild celebration, either, if Celtic win their League Cup final against St Mirren next weekend.It would be unfair to disregard the significance of this result for Hearts. They arrived in Glasgow having not won in four matches and with scepticism surrounding their capability of challenging for the title. Hearts headed back along the M8 with their three-point lead at the top restored.Derek McInnes, the Hearts manager, had predicted Nancy would immediately deploy the 3-4-3 formation he favoured in the US. It is worth noting Hearts have lost just one fixture over 90 minutes since April. “The players shouldn’t doubt themselves, shouldn’t doubt what we are,” McInnes said. This proved his latest tactical triumph.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hearts grew in belief during a scrappy first half, albeit the opening goal arrived in strange circumstance. Celtic’s defence stopped inexplicably in the incorrect belief that Braga was offside during the build-up. Hearts played on, the Portuguese striker latching on to Harry Milne’s mis-hit shot to turn the ball beyond Kasper Schmeichel.Braga’s strike visibly boosted the Hearts mood. They started the second period in confident fashion, albeit without seriously troubling Schmeichel. The Denmark goalkeeper turned a Lawrence Shankland shot round a post, triggering a corner from which Milne found McEntee’s head. Schmeichel was duly beaten as Hearts reached an unassailable position.Tierney lashed home with little over a minute of stoppage time left. Arne Engels had forced a terrific save from Alexander Schwolow and Reo Hatate hit the bar but it would be inaccurate to suggest that Celtic approached bombardment of the Hearts goal. “The season is long,” Nancy said; which may be just as well.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipCelticHeartsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He also owned MLB’sTexas Rangersfrom 1998 to 2010, and the club reached the World Series in his final year with the team.However, his involvement with Liverpool was much more turbulent than his ventures in the US. Hicks acquired a 50% stake in Liverpool in 2007 alongside George Gillett. Hicks and Gillett were widely unpopular with Liverpool fans as questions were raised over their leadership and financial stewardship, and they wereeventually forced to sell the clubto Fenway Sports Group in 2010, ushering in an era of success for the Reds.Liverpool paid tribute to Hicks on Sunday. “LFC sends its condolences to the Hicks family and Tom’s friends at this difficult time,” the club said in a statement.Jerry Jones, the owner of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys, called Hicks a “champion of sports.”“Tom was a close friend and a great partner. He dreamed big and watching him bring the Stanley Cup here to Dallas was something that I will always cherish,” Jones said in the statement. “Fans could feel the heartbeat of our teams and our community together ... We shared a lot of miles together, and I’ll miss him greatly. My heart goes out to his family.”Hicks is survived by his wife of 35 years, Cinda Cree Hicks, six children and 14 grandchildren.His family members said in a statement that, of all Hicks’s achievements, his “most cherished title was ‘Dad’. No matter the trials and tribulations he faced in life, he was constant in his generosity and love for his family.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolDallas StarsTexas RangersMLBNHLBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The hosts dominated much of the first half and created the clearer chances, with Scott McTominay nearly scoring just before the interval when his header glanced past the near post. Napoli were given a fright as the Scot was forced to visit the touchline several times for treatment, seemingly struggling with a muscular issue, though he managed to play on.Although the home side continued to press after the break, it was Juventus who hit back just before the hour with a counter-attack that found Kenan Yildiz inside the box and he drilled a low effort into the far corner to equalise.View image in fullscreenNapoli’s Rasmus Højlund scores his first goal against Juventus.Photograph: Ciro Fusco/EPAHøjlund was not finished, however, and in the 78th minute he scored a second goal, heading in from point-blank range after Weston McKennie diverted a header to the Dane as he tried to clear a cross.

After enduring two defeats againstCrystal Palacehere in the space of five weeks earlier in the year, the Fulham manager could only watch in horror as Marc Guéhi’s late header sealed another victory that moved Palace into the top four.Glasner has made no secret of his dissatisfaction with Palace’s transfer business in the summer, having beatenFulhamon their way to winning the FA Cup, and he was without the influential Daniel Muñoz for their latest trip to west London. But the Austrian has proven during his 18 months at the helm that he has a habit of finding a way to win and this was a typically shrewd performance from his well-drilled side.Fulham 1-2 Crystal Palace: Premier League – live reactionRead moreThey weathered the Fulham storm after Harry Wilson’s wonder goal had cancelled out Eddie Nketiah’s opener on his firstPremier Leaguestart of the campaign. It was left to Guéhi, who is likely to leave south London at the end of the season when his contract expires, to seal the victory that will have Palace’s supporters dreaming of what else might be possible under their remarkable manager if he is backed in the January transfer window.“I have to ask if they get the bonus if we are fourth in December. I don’t think so,” joked Glasner, whose side face Shelbourne in their latest Conference League fixture on Thursday night before meeting Manchester City at Selhurst Park on Sunday. “Of course it’s nice. But for me, it felt in recent weeks that we were getting a little bit of fatigue at the end of the games due to our schedule. And today I felt it was the opposite.”This was Palace’s 24th match of the season and their first time without Muñoz, after the Colombia defender was ruled out by a knee problem that Palace have been managing for a few weeks, Glasner revealed afterwards. But while the 34-year-old former England defender Nathaniel Clyne did not provide the same attacking threat as the marauding Colombian usually does, Silva was frustrated that his side struggled to find a way through the visitors’ defence after Wilson’s brilliant equaliser.“These are the type of games that if you can’t win, then you can’t lose,” the Fulham manager said. “We have to be more resilient in crucial periods of the game.”Had it not been for Guéhi’s block to deny Emile Smith Rowe from Alex Iwobi’s clever corner then Fulham would have taken an early lead. But Palace stood firm against the early pressure and they began to pick holes in the home defence. The imperious Adam Wharton was the architect of the opening goal when he picked out Tyrick Mitchell on the left before the England midfielder eventually played in Nketiah, whose crisp finish left Bernd Leno flailing at thin air.View image in fullscreenHarry Wilson’s stunning finish brings Fulham’s level before half-time.Photograph: John Walton/PAThe Croydon-born Smith Rowe, who was wanted by Palace last year but joined Fulham instead from Arsenal, could not believe his eyes when Dean Henderson somehow kept out his rasping drive from Sander Berge’s through ball. Fulham continued to look dangerous, although Clyne had the next big chance when he found himself bearing down on goal but could produce only an air shot.There was no doubting the quality of Fulham’s equaliser. Wilson, who scored another goal of the season contenderagainst Tottenham last weekend, and Raúl Jiménez were on exactly the same wavelength when the Wales forward beat Maxence Lacroix to the ball. They played a one-two on the edge of Palace’s box before Wilson unleashed a sumptuous finish using the outside of his left boot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fulham thought they had taken the lead through Smith Rowe after Calvin Bassey had struck a post with a header, only for celebrations to be cut short when Samuel Chukwueze was found to have been offside in the buildup. “He has to be careful because even a fingernail can be offside these days,” Silva said.It was a rare occasion when they managed to penetrate Palace’s defence. For all their pretty buildup play, Fulham are lacking incisiveness this season, and Silva will be concerned that could end up with them being dragged into a relegation battle.Concerns over Palace’s heavy workload in a December that will feature eight matches prompted Glasner to withdraw Mateta midway though the second half. Silva threw on Kevin, the club‑record signing, in the hope of finding the breakthrough. But it was Palace who took all three points when Guéhi beat Kenny Tete to a near-post corner and celebrated with the away fans behind the goal.“I can’t lie, it’s tough,” the England defender said when he was asked about Palace’s hectic schedule. “We’ve got to recover and go again – we’ve got no choice.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Chelsea mounted attack after attack in response, having 18 corners while Everton had none, but the Merseyside club were able to hang on to a memorable victory.It also briefly looked as thoughManchester Unitedwere going to drop points in the title race too, after an acrobatic effort from Shekiera Martinez looped into the far corner and drewWest Hamlevel at Leigh Sports Village, but Dominique Janssen’s free-kick earned the home side a 2-1 victory, after Elisabeth Terland had opened the scoring by turning in Anna Sandberg’s cross.PosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women1017272Chelsea Women1010213Man Utd Women1011204Arsenal Women1011195Tottenham Hotspur Women10019There was late drama asTottenhambeatAston Villa2-1 thanks to Olivia Holdt’s 95th-minute close-range finish, as they fought back against opponents down to 10 players despite falling behind on 84 minutes.The Villa defender Océane Deslandes was sent off midway through the second half, before the visitors took the lead through Kirsty Hanson.

Jarrod Bowen, West Ham’s talisman, had executed perfectly his manager’s counter‑attacking strategy. Nuno’s team were fighting their way towards safety, with three points appearing to be heading back to London.Nuno’s plan was coming together so well that Bowen’s goal had been supplied by Callum Wilson, a substitute on the field for just 51 seconds. Yet the masterplan fell short. The Amex Stadium, home of late goals, staged another, Georginio Rutter squeezing in a stoppage-time equaliser for his first goal of the season to complete the type of madcap scramble commonplace at Brighton.Brighton v West Ham: Premier League – liveRead moreBefore that timely late surge, Brighton had not landed a shot on target. Ambitions of returning to the European stage are being hindered by the inconsistency shown by Aston Villa’s comeback in midweek. West Ham’s horizons are significantly lower.Leeds’s recent formhas deepened relegation worries and Rutter’s goal meant the three‑point gap to Daniel Farke’s team had only one chiselled from it. “We did so much to get into the lead,” Bowen said. “But we sat back too far and invited the pressure.”Nuno, unhappy that a handball by Rutter within the decisive scramble had been passed over by the video assistant referee, said: “We contained them, then we scored, and we tried to close out the game but unfortunately we couldn’t.” At least the West Ham team he inherited – shapeless, hopeless, rudderless – are playing for him.Amid a horrible swirl of wind and rain that appeared to be keeping spectators from the Amex’s lower tiers, West Ham adopted Nuno’s trademark low block, thwarting their opponents’ speed in transition. Bowen, Lucas Paquetá and Crysencio Summerville were meanwhile asked to chase long balls out of defence. With none of that trio as adept as Wilson at holding up the ball, the passing of Paquetá, back after suspension followinghis tantrum, was the weapon of choice.Fabian Hürzeler said of his Brighton team: “We wanted more definitely, but in the end we didn’t deserve more because we didn’t play with energy and intensity in the first half.” Amid the hosts’ slim pickings of the first 45 minutes, the closest they came was Maxim De Cuyper almostemulating Bruno Guimarãesin scoring from a corner. Worsening weather played its part in Mats Wieffer missing a more genuine chance, De Cuyper’s cross skidding from the mud beyond reach when any touch would have done.When Paquetá’s low shot tested Bart Verbruggen for a first proper West Ham attempt, it suggested Nuno’s strategy could pay off. The grimmer that conditions became, the more likely a mistake or deflection would result in a goal. Half-time arrived as respite from wholly missable fare.View image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen celebrates after giving West Ham a second-half lead.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersWith El Hadji Malick Diouf blocking off the speed of Yankuba Minteh down the flank, Summerville and Bowen began to grow in threat and Verbruggen, left unprotected, was asked to make a brilliant double save from Bowen’s grubber and Summerville’s volley.Carlos Baleba departed on the hour. Concerns continue over the prized asset’s ability to complete a full 90 minutes, as Hürzeler sought a control of midfield that would not arrive until the fourth official was preparing to display the stoppage time allowance. Minteh blasted wide – his shot selection is often wayward – for his last participation in the game, amid changes from both managers that brought Wilson into West Ham’s forward line, and Brajan Gruda and Charalampos Kostoulas into Brighton’s.Those alterations immediately preceded West Ham’s goal as Wilson pounced on Jan Paul van Hecke’s mistake to send away Bowen. “We deserved to concede a goal and we reacted well,” Hürzeler said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alphonse Areola, previously all but decommissioned, made a fine save from Kostoulas but, as tired defenders slackened concentration, the Hammers goalkeeper was left unprotected from Rutter’s initial shot, before Van Hecke, calm amid the squall, laid the ball laterally for Rutter to crash in.The hint of handball and flailing high feet, plus a lengthy VAR wait, gave false hope to West Ham. “A natural position,” according to Stockley Park. “I was confused and scared about the VAR,” Rutter said.Nuno said: “It’s a handball … I don’t understand,” lamenting his winning strategy being squandered by fortune and fatigue.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Seeing the strip, what catches the eye first, though, is the fluorescent, neon green socks. You cannot fail to notice them and that is now also true of Manchester City in this season’s Women’s Super League title race; a team that quietly went under the radar initially, scarcely being spoken about as contenders, are now unmissable as they keep on winning, shining bright with a six-point lead at the top of the table.Their latest victory, their ninth in a row in the league, not unlike the climate their kit honours, was not always particularly pretty. They spent well over an hour being frustrated by a Leicester side who were content to keep 11 players behind the ball with a deep, well-organised back five, but this is the sort of game, on a wet lunchtime in the East Midlands, when teams who go on to win titles manage to find a way through. Eventually, Manchester City did so, and then some, with two goals and an assist from Khadija Shaw delivering a 3-0 victory that more closely reflected their control of the contest than the 0-0 scoreline on the 73-minute mark had suggested. The visitors had 75.5% of the possession and 30 shots at goal compared to Leicester’s two.WSL roundup: Everton end Chelsea’s record-breaking unbeaten runRead moreIt is the first time the club have won nine of their opening 10 games of a season, and will build belief among their fanbase that in 2026 – a full decade on from their sole title triumph – they may finally be able to wrestle back the WSL trophy. Watching them on Sunday, some of the key reasons why they are enjoying such good form were clear. They have whipped more crosses into the box from open play – 130 times in their previous nine WSL games this term – than any other side and this tactic continued against Leicester. So much so that Shaw could have scored at least a hat-trick of first-half goals, from crosses delivered by their dangerous wingers Lauren Hemp, Aoba Fujino, and a hanging ball from the left-back Leila Ouahabi that the striker headed over. Balls into the box – simple, but very effective.They have also scored the highest number of goals from corners in the WSL and they got another at the King Power Stadium, as Shaw nodded in at the back post moments after Kerolin was bizarrely denied a penalty. By then, Shaw had already clinically opened the scoring with a low finish after a swivel in the box. Kerolin, whose 69th-minute arrival as a substitute injected pace and direct running into the game, was electric and she raced on to a Shaw pass and slotted into the corner to complete the 3-0 win.View image in fullscreenKerolin completes Manchester City’s ninth win in a row with their third goal.Photograph: Molly Darlington/WSL/WSL Football/Getty Images“I pride myself with what I do in front of goal,” said Shaw, the WSL’s leading scorer with eight goals. “The quality I have around me does shine through – even if I miss a chance, I know another one is coming after that.”Her manager was singing Shaw’s praises, with Andrée Jeglertz saying: “She could probably have scored a couple more goals, but she never loses the trust. She is still working hard, she’s doing the runs into the box and she’s doing everything for the team anyway, so I’m so happy for her, she also deserves it. She’s never dropping in performance, which can easily happen for a goalscorer.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The marauding runs of Ouahabi and Kerstin Casparij from the full-back positions and the stylish, technical prowess of Yui Hasegawa in the middle is helping them thrive, along with the ever-improving Laura Blindkilde Brown in the holding midfield position. Then they have the strength on the bench to bring on an England player such as Grace Clinton, who helped up the tempo in the final 25 minutes. For a team that finished 16 points behind Chelsea last term, they appear reborn. In fact, there were seven different players in the starting side compared with the team that won on this ground in April last season.The Leicester manager, Rick Passmoor, who was proud of how his team adhered to their gameplan for the first 70 minutes, said of the league leaders: “That cutting edge that they’ve got really came to the fore in the last 15 minutes and they were ruthless. I think they’ll only get better.”That may well be true. Tricky obstacles lie in wait in the second half of the season – not least March’s Asian Cup, when Hasegawa, Fujino and the goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita will all be absent with Japan – but, with no European football to juggle, this could well be City’s year, domestically.PosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women1017272Chelsea Women1010213Man Utd Women1011204Arsenal Women1011195Tottenham Hotspur Women100196London City Lionesses10-6157Brighton & Hove Albion Women104148Aston Villa Women9-2109Everton Women10-6810Leicester Women10-14611West Ham Women10-15412Liverpool FC Women9-102Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenLeicester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I’ve obviously been in championship battles before in the junior categories, but in F1, it’s got a little bit extra to it, so I’ve learned plenty about that and think that’ll only help me as I go forward.”View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris on the podium at Yas Marina Circuit.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesPiastri was adamant he felt “pretty good” about his final-day effort as he finished behind winner Max Verstappen, with Norris’s third place enough to secure him the crown.“On a personal level, it’s obviously not quite the ending that I wished for but when you look at the season as a whole, I’m very proud of the work I, and my team, have been able to put in to make so much progress from last year. I’m looking forward to plenty more fights in the future.”Losing to Norris, ultimately, by just 13 points, Piastri could reflect on that costly barren spell, which started with a calamitous weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and continued with disappointing outings at the US, Mexican and Sao Paulo Grands Prix.“It was nice to find some form again because it would have been pretty painful to end it on the note of Austin, Mexico and Brazil,” he said. “Ultimately, there were ups and downs through the year, but I’ll look back on the ups with a lot of pride and joy, and look on the downs with plenty of lessons learned. There are plenty more years left to go and hopefully plenty more opportunities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump pulled back to 7-3 and won a dramatic and error-strewn 11th frame helped by an act of sportsmanship by Selby, after Trump disputed the referee Olivier Marteel’s award of a free ball in Selby’s favour.Selby accepted Trump’s protest and the balls were returned to the position of the original snooker, out of which Trump duly fluked the last red and further reduced the deficit to 7-4.Trump had clearly stepped up a level, delivering two centuries – 105 and 124 respectively – which sandwiched a cool 91 from Selby and the mid-session interval, ensuring the world No 1 kept clinging on at 8-6 down.Selby twice missed blacks off their spots as Trump closed within one at 8-7, and Trump did so again at 9-8 after Selby jarred the simplest of reds with the title seemingly at his mercy.

I just won it my way – by being a fair driver, by trying to be an honest driver. At times, could I have been more aggressive and got off the brakes and had a few people over? I certainly could have done. Is that the way I want to go racing? Is that me? It’s not.”Norris also admitted that much as he had appeared to be in complete control, the final moments were nerve-jangling.“I felt calm until three corners to go, I started to shake a little bit,” he said. “Then I got to see the team when I went over the line and this is a moment that I’ll never forget.”Norris has made a remarkable comeback from 34 points off the then leader, Piastri, in August after he failed to finish in Zandvoort with a mechanical problem and said that low point had been a real spur to his efforts and that he had brought new people into his team to try to hone his approach.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri (left) on the podium after his second place in Abu Dhabi.Photograph: Antonin Vincent/DPPI/Shutterstock“I was like: ‘Oh, shoot. I’m quite a long way behind against a pretty freaking fast driver, and I’ve got to step it up,’” he said. “I got to be more myself because of external factors, working with more professionals in different areas to unlock more of my ability and when you saw that, I had that run of great results, which is ultimately what got me the championship in the end.”Verstappen took only positives from his and Red Bull’s performances, having come back from a 104‑point deficit and believing they had given their all against a McLaren that was the superior car for the majority of the year. When asked if he thought it was the best he had driven in a career that included four titles, he concurred.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve hated this car at times, but I’ve also loved it at times. I always tried to extract the most from it, even in the difficult weekends that we’ve had.“It’s been a proper rollercoaster with the car. Also, in the team we have a great atmosphere at the moment. We’re really on a roll. Positive energy, belief, confidence and that’s exactly what you want heading into next year.”However the Dutchman, who ultimately claimed eight wins – more than any other driver – reacted testily when asked if he had any regrets over the incident at the Spanish GP where he was penalised for deliberately driving into George Russell’s car, demoting him from fifth to 10th, which cost him nine points.“You forget about all the other stuff that happened in my season,” Verstappen snapped. “The only thing that you mention is Barcelona. I knew that would come. It is part of racing. You live and learn. A championship is won over 24 rounds and I have also had a lot of early Christmas presents given to me in the second half of the season so you can also question that, too.A clearly disappointed Piastri, who had led the championship for more races than Norris before a drop in form in the final third and took seven wins, reflected that he felt he would emerge only stronger from being beaten to the title.“Obviously I would have wished for a slightly different ending,” he said. “But I think this year I’ve learned a hell of a lot about myself as a race car driver, myself as a person. If you had presented this season at the start of the year with the pole positions and the wins and the podiums, I definitely would have been pretty happy with that.“I think even in the tough moments, I’ve learned a lot about myself and how I can be stronger in the future. Ultimately there’s a little bit of disappointment but I think I can be very proud of the season I’ve had and plenty of lessons to take to the future.””Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

He refused to tolerate any moral victories or close calls and instead expected to win, to win big and win immediately.In just 737 days, he turned what had been the Football Bowl Subdivision’s most losing program into the nation’s No 1 seed heading into the playoffs, a legitimate championship contender and a Big Ten champion for the first time since 1967. On Sunday, the inevitable was confirmed with Indianabecoming the No 1 teamin The Associated Press Top 25 college football poll for the first time in their history.Indiana clinch CFP’s No 1 seed as Alabama and Miami push out Notre DameRead more“I think we were a year late,” Cignetti joked as the trophy presentation began after Saturday night’s 13-10 win over then No 1 Ohio State.To the rest of the college football world, Cignetti’s incredible turnaround has come so quickly, it’s likely to lift the expectations of every program in America.He took over a team that had endured three consecutive losing seasons since qualifying for a bowl game and brashly dared anyone who thought he couldn’t win to google his achievements. The former Nick Saban assistant delivered quickly, winning a school record 11 games and taking the Hoosiers to their first playoff appearance in Year 1.The doubters didn’t think Cignetti or the Hoosiers could come anywhere near replicating that kind of success this season. But they’ve been even better in 2025. At 13-0, the Hoosiers are the last unbeaten team in major college football and have their first outright championship since 1945.By beating the Buckeyes (12-1) in Indianapolis, they ended the nation’s longest active winning streak at 16 and the Big Ten’s longest winning streak in a series. When they beat then No 3 Oregon (11-1) in October, they ended the nation’s longest active regular season winning streak and the nation’s longest active home winning streak.In between they shed the label of FBS’ losingest program, gladly handing the title to Northwestern. And now they have their first win over Ohio State since 1988, snapping a 30-year losing streak by winning their first conference crown in more than half a century.Not enough? Cignetti earned his second straight Big Ten Coach of the Year Award this week, Fernando Mendoza became the first Hoosier to be named the Big Ten’s top quarterback since 2001, and Mendoza also appears poised to become the first Indiana player to win the Heisman Trophy after adding two more signature moments to his resume.His perfectly placed 17-yard TD pass to Elijah Sarratt on the sideline gave Indiana a 13-10 lead midway through the third quarter, and he sealed the win with an incredible 33-yard pass to Charlie Becker on third down with about two minutes to go – all after getting hurt on the first play of the game.“Although I got hit, I never was going to stay down,” Mendoza said. “I’d die for my brothers on that field.”Naturally, the brash-talking Cignetti went for it, too, and Mendoza made him look like a genius.“I wasn’t going to play not to lose,” Cignetti said.How good have Indiana been during his two-year tenure? They are now 24-2, the only losses coming at Ohio State and at Notre Dame last season, the two teams that played in the national championship game. Cignetti and his players have each spoken about what they learned from those experiences and how it helped steel them for the mission they’ve been on this season, and he’s already had his contract extended twice.Indiana head into the playoffs with an offense and defense ranked in the top five in scoring and that managed to beat Ohio State at their usual game – wearing down opponents and holding them out of the end zone.Now a new journey begins for Cignetti and a school far more renowned for winning national titles in men’s basketball, men’s soccer and swimming and diving. Football has never come close – until now. And these Hoosiers believe they have what it takes to continue what seemed unthinkable just two years ago.“It means a lot, we played for each other,” linebacker Isaiah Jones said of winning the championship. “For any of the doubters out there, this was the final nail in the coffin.”Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsIndiananewsShareReuse this content"

In emailsobtained by Crikeyunder freedom of information, the South Australian government wasn’t as keen to hear from Haugen since she had described a ban as a “bumper sticker solution”.Haidt spoke via video link on day two of the summit, which was held in South Australia, saying he was “thrilled” with the potential for a ban.“We need to free kids from these traps by raising the age for opening social media to 16.”And so the campaign for a ban began.Following the summit, the federal government faced pressure to implement a national ban rather than having a patchwork of statesimplementing their own regulations.Less than a year out from the federal election, the then opposition leader, Peter Dutton,made it a signature policy for the Coalition.News Corp went all in, launching the “Let Them Be Kids” campaign, which coincided with Meta’s announcement it would not enter into new deals to pay media companies for news content. Front pages advocating for the ban pushed things along.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and Nova radio host Wippa launched a campaign titled “36 months”, advocating for the age to be raised from 13 to 16. Albanese appeared on Wippa’s program at least five times in the past two years.The Labor government never publicly confirmed it, but its adoption of the idea and rush to pass the law before parliament ended for the year in December 2024 was seen as a bid to take potentialelection issues off the table.In Albanese’s telling, the policy was designed to leave the responsibility for keeping kids off social media to the government. He framed the policy as a bid to get kids off devices and on to the footy fields and netball courts.The countdown is onAfter the legislation was introduced, it was passed by the parliament in a matter of days, while a committee barely reviewed the bill.The law pushed decisions about which platforms were covered and how the ban would work to the end of 2025. It placed the responsibility for enforcement of the ban on the platforms themselves.The then communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said YouTube would have an exemption on education grounds, but that was not defined in the legislation.A $22.5m technology trial run by a UK firm associated with age assurance providers got under way, with the deadline set for after the federal election. The top line findingthat it was workablewas emphasised by the government after its release, without closer examination ofsome of the shortfalls.Australia social media ban: when is it, how will it work and what apps are being banned for under-16s?Read moreAfter the Albanese government was returned to power in the May election with an even bigger majority, Anika Wells was appointed the new communications minister.TikTok and Meta were not happy that YouTube had been excluded from the ban. YouTube Shorts is very similar to Reels and TikTok’s short-form videos, and the platforms couldn’t see why YouTube was given a broad exemption for a similar product.The eSafety commissioner advised the minister in July that it was her view YouTube should not be excluded from the ban, pointing to the algorithms used to determine the types of videos promoted to teens on the platform and the harms reportedly encountered on the service.Wells agreed.Googlethreatened legal actionand cancelled a planned showcase at Parliament House.Ultimately the eSafety commissioner decided the ban should cover: TikTok, Facebook, Instagram (and, as a result of the account structure, Threads), X, Snapchat, YouTube, Reddit, Kick and Twitch. Other platforms could be added later, as determined by the government.With the countdown on for the ban to take effect, Meta, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, Twitch, YouTube, and Kick have all said they will comply with the ban.A high court challengeagainst the ban was lodgedbut the hearing has been delayed until February.News Corp has done a victory lap for the ban, with News Corp Australia’s executive chair, Michael Miller, describing social media platforms as“true monsters” who “torment our children”.News Corp’s owners, the Murdoch family,are expected to hold a stakein the US version of TikTok.This story was updated on 8 December to reflect that Peter Malinauskas’s wife read Jonathan Haidt’s book in early 2024, not late 2023.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banSocial mediaMetaDigital mediaAustralian politicsAustralian lawfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even in the face of repeated warnings to protect online accounts, a new study reveals that “admin” is the most commonly used password in the UK.The second most popular, “123456”, is also unlikely to keep hackers at bay.The annual review of the top 200 most common passwords by the tech company NordPass makes depressing reading for security experts, the police and anti-fraud bodies.Although cybersecurity experts keep repeating that simple passwords are extremely easy to guess, these warnings are going unheeded.In the UK, words, number combinations, and common keyboard patterns dominate the top 20. Different variations of the word “password” take up as many as five of these spots, with simple numeric combinations, including “12345678” and then “123456789” using another five. So far, so easy to hack.View image in fullscreenUse a password management tool to help with more complicated secure passwords.Photograph: Koshiro K/AlamyIt’s not just a problem here – Australians, Americans and Germans also use “admin” more than any other password when accessing websites, apps and logging in to their computers. Around the world, “123456” emerges as the most popular.“Despite all efforts in cybersecurity education and digital awareness over the years, data reveals only minor improvements in password hygiene,” says Karolis Arbaciauskas of NordPass, a password manager that aims to keep details secure.“About 80% of data breaches are caused by compromised, weak, and reused passwords, and criminals will intensify their attacks as much as they can until they reach an obstacle they can’t overcome.”What the scam looks likeAt a time when many of us grapple with a growing number of passwords, it seems people are picking the easy option. Criminals are well aware of this and will use the obvious options during a systematic attack on someone’s accounts.“The problem with easy-to-remember passwords is that most of them can be cracked or guessed in seconds using a technique called a ‘dictionary attack’ – a systematic method of guessing a password by trying many common words and their simple variations,” Arbaciauskas says.View image in fullscreenHackers use a ‘dictionary attack’, a method of trying common words and numbers and their variations.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA“Another problem is that people tend to reuse them quite often. Users cite having too many accounts to create, and remember, unique passwords for all of them. That is terrible. People who use weak passwords, or reuse them, risk their digital lives and their identities.”Recent research from Virgin Media O2suggests four out of every five people use the same, or nearly identical, passwords on online accounts, giving an almost open door for hackers to compromise log-ins.You might be alerted to an attack by a message advising that you have been trying to change your email address, or other details, connected to an account.What to doMake your passwords long and strong. This could be by combining three random words (eg, applepenbiro) or mixing numbers, letters and special characters.Don’t reuse the same password. The rule of thumb is that each account should have a unique password because if one account gets broken into, hackers can use the same credentials for other accounts.Change any passwords that are variations on the same word now, starting with the important sets of accounts: banks, email, work and mobile.Use password managers – these are often integrated into web browsers. Apple has iCloud Keychain, while Android phones have Google Password Manager, both of which can generate and save complicated passwords.Two-factor authentication (2FA) is something you can set up for your email, and other important online accounts, to add an extra layer of security. It involves providing something that only you can access – for example, a code sent to you by text message. You should turn 2FA on for every service that offers it.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsComputingInternetCybercrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Because they don’t have the guts.”The University of Melbourne’s Dr Robert Walton, a dean’s research fellow in the Faculty of Fine Arts and Music, is taking a different approach to working out whether robots can do comedy.Can’t tech a joke: AI does not understand puns, study findsRead moreThanks to an Australian Research Council grant of about $500,000, he will train a swarm of robots in standup. And, at least in the beginning, they won’t use words.“Robots are good at making people laugh … they are humorous because they break and they bump into things, and so we’re laughing at them,” Walton says.“However, when they try to do something funny on purpose, it ain’t so funny any more. We don’t laugh at them because we really, deep down, don’t believe that they can be funny.”Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsSaturday Night Live’s Tina Fey said exactly that at this year’s Edinburgh comedy festival. AI is “unable to be funny”, she said.But what Walton is looking at is not AI based on text or large language models.He is going to start with non-verbal communication, something that has to be performed rather than written. The fundamentals of comedy, he says, are timing, reading the room, the connection with the audience, along with physical comedy such as clowning.So his ensemble of about 10 robots – which will not be androids but ground vehicles between 40cm and 2 metres tall – will work with humans to learn how to be funny visually in the first instance.View image in fullscreenDr Robert Walton, dean’s research fellow in the Faculty of Fine Arts and Music at University of Melbourne.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianThey’ll sense movement, the way a head tilts or when someone laughs.“We’re giving these systems more senses, like human senses … giving them ears, not just listening for words but for things like the gaps in between words, the rhythms of things,” he says.He likens them to babies who don’t yet know how to make sense of the inputs.“That’s partly what we’re trying to do with machine learning and AI – giving it more ways to sense and more ways to build a more holistic understanding of what it means to be in the world,” he says.“It is in standup comedy, really, that the connection between the robot and the audience is so clear, and there’s so much feedback going on.”Asked if eventually they will add voices, Walton says “potentially”. “Depends how we go,” he adds.There is a tension here, as the performance industry is just one of those where jobs are threatened by AI, and AIsteals creative content.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Israeli military operations continue to displace hundreds of families in Gaza. Aid has increased but Israel isstill blockingvital supplies. Palestinians desperately require security, humanitarian relief and reconstruction. But they need and expect a political horizon too. Donald Trump’s plans make only thevaguest and most conditional referenceto a Palestinian state, and Israelis – as well as their ultra-right government – have entrenched their opposition since the atrocities of 7 October 2023. Yet after two years of annihilation, Palestinian nationhood has won international support that many thought unimaginable.The political fate of Palestinians is bound to the personal fate of Marwan Barghouti. After more than two decades in an Israeli jail for murder, the charismatic 66-year-old is by far the most popular Palestinian leader, widely regarded as the only figure capable of uniting factions riven by ideology and enmity. Though a member of Fatah, Mr Barghouti has criticised abuses by the Palestinian Authority and has won respect within Hamas ranks. He has led Palestinian prisoners, while the PA’s old guard are seen as self-serving, ineffective, unaccountable and essentially as security contractors forIsraelin the West Bank.The belief that Mr Barghouti can galvanise Palestinian politics, creating the momentum for statehood and lasting peace, lies behind the new international campaign for his release,backed by figuresincluding Paul Simon, Delia Smith, Richard Branson and Margaret Atwood, and the former world leaders known asthe Elders. Critically, some from the Israeli security and political establishment agree.Mr Barghouti has long supported the two-state solution, repeatedly engaged with Israeli officials and taught himself Hebrew. His convictions – in a trial criticised as flawed by legal experts – are for ordering attacks that killed civilians during the second intifada. Gulf states pushed for him to be among the prisoners released in the ceasefire deal; Israel vetoed it. Yet murderers were freed. As one former military officialobserved recently: “Israel is willing to release people who did really bad things, but … it has no interest to release symbols.”For Palestinians, Mr Barghouti – called by some their Mandela – stands for a path towards their inalienable rights. Many leaders, including in Israel itself, have moved from armed struggle to statesmanship. Israel has long complained that it has no real partner for peace. ButBenjamin Netanyahuand his partners do not fear that the Israeli state could never come to terms with a man such as Mr Barghouti – they fear that it could. To free him would indicate that they could contemplate nationhood for Palestinians, which they will not tolerate as even a distant prospect. He will not be released without external pressure.Conditions for Palestinian prisoners have worsened dramatically since 2023. Video this summer showed the far-right minister of security, Itamar Ben-Gvir,taunting and threateninga gaunt, almost unrecognisable Mr Barghouti. His family say he has beenseverely beaten by guards. There is concern that the government will approve a draft lawintroducing a mandatory death penaltyfor terrorism. The case for Mr Barghouti’s release is pressing. Some weeks ago the US president indicated that hemight consider raisingit. He should urge Israel to free Mr Barghouti, in the interests of the peace which he claims to be building in the Middle East.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If a peace deal includes two key elements, it should acceptSun 7 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 15.37 ESTShareThe negotiations over the war inUkraineare frustrating and tragic. On the one side, a victim of aggression whose plight is more and more desperate. On the other, a brutal aggressor, willing to go to extraordinary lengths to win the war. In the middle, a transactional American president eager for a deal.It’s no surprise that so many observers have railed against the proposals recently put forward by President Donald Trump and his emissary Steve Witkoff. These proposals appear to offer much toRussiaand little to Ukraine – other than an end to the violence. If the negotiations produce a plan that offers Ukraine no hope of security after the war, no Ukrainian leader will accept it. Security is the core of sovereignty, and it would be political suicide to trade Ukraine’s sovereignty for peace.But here is the problem: in the past, Kyiv and its partners repeatedly overestimated their leverage to end the war on favorable terms, only to find themselves confronted with further Russian gains and a weaker negotiating position months later. That Ukraine’s leaders did this under immense strain and encouraged by western promises of long-term support is tragic but does not change the reality.For many months after Russia invaded in 2022, Ukraine insisted onmaximalist demandsthat sometimes included recapturing Crimea or returning Ukraine to its 2014 borders. These demands were unrealistic, and focusing on them ruled out more modest proposals at a time when Russia was still at risk of battlefield reversals and might have considered alternatives – as it appeared to do briefly atIstanbulin April 2022.The following summer, as Russia’s invasion inched forward, a degree of realism set in. Maximalist objectives were moderated, but Kyiv and many of its partnersinsistedUkraine join Nato – a demand that Russia clearly would not accept. Another year was lost. Ukraine’s position weakened further.More recently, Russia has pulverized its way even deeper into the Donbass, turning the land into a moonscape of mines, bombed-out apartment blocks, and trees cut in half by artillery. Yet many of Ukraine’s backers insist Kyiv not cede this wasteland, even though battlefield trends over the last several months suggest Ukraine is very likely to lose it anyway.Meanwhile military and political winds continue to blow in Ukraine’s face. Corruption scandals havereached the inner circleof the president himself, weakening him domestically and with Ukraine’s foreign backers. Although engaged right now, the United States under Trump may well disengage. Russia remains stable, militarily capable and retains the backing of China and other allies – despite the economic strain it faces from sanctions and massive battlefield losses.Russia will move the goalposts again. It will insist on no security guarantee at all. It may even demand its own political allies be installed in KyivThe upshot is this: if what emerges from the current negotiations offers Ukraine a military capability and security guarantee – even a weak one – Ukraine should accept it. This is a bitter pill, but it could be Ukraine’s last chance to end the war with sovereignty intact.If history holds, however, Ukraine may not. Then it will find itself in an even weaker position next year. Russia will move the goalposts again. It will insist on no security guarantee at all. It may even demand its own political allies be installed in Kyiv.Ukraine will then no longer be negotiating to retain its sovereignty; it will be negotiating the details of its return to vassal status under Russia.Morally and practically, Ukraine and its leaders are the only ones who can choose whether to agree to a settlement or continue the battle. Their costs are deeply sunk into this war – especially for the military, which is almost certain to resist any compromise, further straining Ukraine’s delicate civil-military balance.But if Kyiv rejects an offer of peace, negotiated by Trump, there should be no illusions about what this will mean for further support from the United States – a likely end to vital intelligence sharing and the US weapons that now flow throughEuropeto Ukraine.Unfortunately, the war has created perverse incentives for some of Ukraine’s partners, who may see continued fighting as their own best option – not because it’s best for Ukraine, but because it keeps the Russian army off their backs and gives them time to develop the military capabilities they need to deter a Russian onslaught in the future.But this logic is wrongheaded. Europeans have more time than they realize to protect themselves against Russia, which will needyears to reconstituteits military capabilities to be a serious threat to Nato.Throughout the war, Ukraine has faced a Hobson’s choice between bad and worse options. Again and again, Ukraine and its partners have tried to escape this by doubling down on rhetoric and hope. Selling hard compromises to a nation whose suffering has gained the sympathy of millions around the world will be a huge challenge. But the geopolitical odds are stacked against Ukraine. Hoping reality away will not solve its problems or give its citizens – or Europe’s – the peace and prosperity they have been fighting for.Christopher S Chivvis is a senior fellow and director of the American statecraft program at the Carnegie Endowment for International PeaceExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionEuropeRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

It took much longer and required repeated action and tremendous sacrifice, without any certainty it would workSun 7 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareThe Montgomery bus boycott, which began 70 years ago on 5 December 1955, is now understood as one of the most successful American social movements. And yet, much of how it is remembered is romanticized, inaccurate and even dangerous – distorting how we imagine social change happens.In the fable, Rosa Parks refuses to give up her seat, Black Montgomery residents rise up, a youngMartin Luther KingJr is introduced to the world, and injustice is vanquished. The right action is all it takes – furthering a mythology that, without deep preparation or sacrifice, Americans can make great change with a single act. Today, in the face of rising injustice, many criticize young activists for being too disruptive, too disorganized, too impractical. But, in fact, the Montgomery movement began much earlier and took much longer than we imagine and entailed tremendous sacrifice. It required hard choice after hard choice without evidence these actions would matter, and was considered too disruptive by many at the time – all of which gives us important lessons for how to challenge injustice today.First, Rosa Parks. She was neither old nor tired, as some have claimed, but she also wasn’t planned or planted. By the time Parks was 42 years old, she had been an activist for two decades, helping to turn Montgomery’s NAACP into a more activist branch alongside the union stalwart ED Nixon. “Over the years I have been rebelling against second-class citizenship,” Parks said in a 1956 interview with the Los Angeles Sentinel. “It didn’t begin when I was arrested.” This work was demoralizing, as organizers defended the wrongfully accused, fought for voter registration, tried to find justice for Black women who had been raped: “It was very difficult to keep going when all our efforts seemed in vain,”she saidof their work in the 1940s and early 1950s.A trickle of Montgomery residents had resisted mistreatment on the bus in the decade before Parks’s arrest. Then, eight months before Parks’s act, 15-year-old Claudette Colvin refused to give up her seat and was arrested. When she struggled against the police manhandling her, they also charged her with assaulting an officer. Colvin’s arrest outraged Montgomery’s Black community and many stopped riding the buses temporarily. Parks fundraised forColvin’s caseand encouraged the teenager to take a leadership role in her NAACP Youth Council.But a mass movement did not result, in part because the judge threw out the segregation charge and only found Colvin guilty of assaulting an officer and in part because many adults saw Colvin as too young, poor and feisty to rally behind. But had Colvin not done what she did, it is unlikely Parks’s arrest would have galvanized people the way it did. Movements do not result from the first or second outrage but from an accumulation of injustice that brings people to a breaking point.Indeed, part of what made Parks’s bus stand so courageous was that there wasnothing to suggest that taking a stand on that day would change anything. For two decades, Parks had taken stands, other people she knew had taken stands, and by and large nothing had changed – except that people had been ostracized, hurt or killed for these actions. By that December evening, she had grown quite pessimistic about the possibility of change. “There will never be a mass movement in Montgomery,” she told the other participants at the end of a two-week organizing workshop she attended at Highlander Folk School that summer.There’s an aphorism that the mark of insanity is doing things over and over and expecting a different result. But that is also the definition of courageBut when the driver asked her to get up, Parks saw the line. If she got up, she “approved of this treatment – and I did not approve”. No one on the bus joined her – worried for their safety, wanting to get home, seeing the action as fruitless. She knew what could happen to a Black woman getting arrested – that she might not get off the bus alive – but still when the officers asked why she didn’t move, she spoke back: “Why do you push us around?” There’s an aphorism that the mark of insanity is doing things over and over and expecting a different result. But that is also the definition of courage.Late that night, she called Fred Gray, a young Black attorney she knew from the NAACP, to represent her. Gray then called Jo Ann Robinson, head of the Women’s Political Council (WPC), to let her know. And it was the WPC, who had been organizing against bus segregation for years, that decided to call a boycott for Monday, the day Parks would be arraigned. In the middle of the night, Robinson snuck into Alabama State College, where she was a professor, and with the help of two students, ran off 35,000 leaflets. (Robinson wouldget in trouble for doing this.) The leaflet began: “Another woman has been arrested on the bus.” The accumulation of injustice was clear.Martin Luther King Jr and Coretta Scott King had moved to Montgomery the year before and, just two weeks before Parks’s arrest, had their first baby. The next morning at about 6am, ED Nixon woke King up; he wanted to use King’s church for a meeting that night to organize for Monday’s boycott. The then 26-year-old new fatherhesitated: “Let me think about it awhile and call me back.” There was no lightning bolt, no clear sign of destiny. When Nixon called back in a few hours, King agreed. In the days and months ahead, King would assume an important leadership role. But there was nothing easy about it. Like Parks, part of King’s gift was the ability to act despite fear and uncertainty. This decision would have significant consequences for their family – and by the end of the boycott, he had gained national notice. But the roles he and Coretta would come to play were complex and difficult. The movement made him as much as he made the movement.That weekend, many of Montgomery’s Black activists worried. Would people stay off the bus? The Kings were up by 5.30am. A bus rolled by nearly empty of Black passengers; another bus passed empty. They were elated – “a miracle”, King called it. Parks found it “unbelievable” but also wondered why “we had waited so long to make this protest”, she said in later interviews. Buoyed by the power of the one-day effort, at an overflowing mass meeting that evening, the community voted to continue on with the boycott. The power of collective protest changed the participants – from a one-day boycott to a long-term one, from the initial demand for courteous, first-come, first-served seating to ultimately full desegregation of the bus. Their sense of possibility grew.But it also entailed great sacrifice. The boycott cost many people, including Rosa Parks and her husband, Raymond Parks, their jobs. The Parks never found steady work in Montgomery again. Then, seven weeks into the boycott, the Kings’ house was bombed. Coretta and 10-week-old baby Yolanda were home, but she managed to get them out uninjured. Terrified by this violence, both Martin and Coretta’s fathers traveled to Montgomery to pressure the family – or at least Coretta and the baby – to leave. She refused. “I realized how important it was for me to stand with Martin,” she said in a 1966 interview with New Lady magazine. Had Coretta flinched in this moment, the trajectory of the bus boycott and the emerging civil rights movement might have been very different.While in the popular imagination the Montgomery bus boycott has become all about walking, what actually enabled a community-wide boycott for more than a year was a massively well-organized carpool system. The newly created Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) set up 40 pickup stations across town and at its peak was giving15,000 to 20,000 rides per day. To make this possible, Black women fundraised. Two groups – the Club from Nowhere, led by the cook and midwife Georgia Gilmore, and the Friendly Club, headed by Inez Ricks – competed to see who could raise more. None of the women in these groups had much money, but they knew how to make sandwiches, dinners, pies, and cakes to raise money each week. At the weekly mass meeting, they would present their fundraising accomplishments to a standing ovation. When it still wasn’t enough, the MIA sent King and Parks across the country to raise money and attention for the movement at home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

It drastically hurt the bus company’s revenues but drew criticism as well. The MIA was accused of being just like the segregationist White Citizens’ Council in using economic means to advance racial issues. The city massively harassed the carpool, giving hundreds of tickets. When that harassment didn’t work, the city dredged up an old anti-boycott law and indicted 110 “Boycott leaders”. The Montgomery Advertiser called the boycott “dangerous” and public officials worried about communist influence. Even the national NAACP kept the boycott at arm’s length, not agreeing with its disruptive tactics. But Black Montgomery residents kept at it.With the city trying to break the protest, Gray decided to file a proactive federal case, Browder v Gayle, to challenge Montgomery’s bus segregation, worried that the state would prevent Parks’s appeal after her arrest on the bus. Two adult women, Aurelia Browder and Susie McDonald, and two teenagers, Colvin and Mary Louise Smith, stepped forward. (Parks was not on the case because Gray didn’t want to risk having it thrown out on a technicality, since Parks’s case was already in state court.) Browder v Gayle went to the supreme court and on 21 December 1956, Montgomery’s buses were desegregated. The success of the Montgomery bus boycott was accomplished through a combination of tactics: years of spadework that laid a foundation for the movement to emerge; Rosa Parks’s courageous stand; a year-long consumer boycott; enormous grassroots organization and fundraising; four courageous female plaintiffs and the federal legal case; the Kings’ steadfastness; and a campaign to get the word out across the country. All were necessary to bring decisive change in Montgomery.Today, as people see rising injustice, many get mired in the question:What will work?We search for the right legal case, the right tactic, the right leader. But the greatest lesson of the Montgomery bus boycott is that is the wrong question. If Rosa Parks had asked what will work on 1 December, she wouldn’t have refused to give up her seat. If Black Montgomery residents had worried about being too disruptive, if the Kings had listened to their parents, if Georgia Gilmore had thought about how much money they needed, they wouldn’t have acted. What worked was the ability to keep going, amid fear and uncertainty, amid job loss and police harassment, amid years of stands that produced nothing, amid the need to organize and maintain a massive carpool system no one had ever built before. “We can learn to play on locked pianos,” King’s friend Vincent Harding observed, “and to dream of worlds that do not yet exist.”What’s giving me hope nowPart of what is giving me hope is that amid an onslaught of moves to ban the teaching of a full and accurate American history, many educators across the country are refusing to bend. They are bringing this history to students across the country, even in the states with the most restrictive laws. And what this history shows us is the power of persistence, of taking action after action, of saying no and no again. We won’t know how and when the moment will come, but it will; much like water on the rock, as it runs over and over, the rock breaks down.Jeanne Theoharis is a distinguished professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the author of King of the North: Martin Luther King Jr’s Life of Struggle Outside the South and The Rebellious Life of Mrs Rosa Parks.Explore more on these topicsCivil rights movementFighting BackMartin Luther KingRacecommentShareReuse this content"

Now Russia’s collapsing economy could lead to his downfallSimon TisdallThe war against Ukraine has hit ordinary Russians hard, and the deteriorating situation is likely to inflame tensionsSun 7 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 06.43 ESTSharePeople in Britain who think they are governed by fools should take a closer look at the Russian and US presidents. Vladimir Putin is systematically ruining his country. His war of choice in Ukraine is an economic, financial, geopolitical and human calamity for Russia that worsens by the day. For his own murky reasons, Donald Trump, another national menace, offered him a lifeline last week. Yet Putinspurned it. These two fools deserve each other.On the table in Moscow was a “peace” deal that, broadly speaking,rewarded Russia’s aggressionby handing over large chunks of Ukrainian land, compromised Kyiv’s independence and weakened its defences against any future attack. The Trump deal, if forced through, would have split the US and Europe; ruptured Nato, perhaps fatally; reprieved Russia’s pariah economy; and probably toppled Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government.These are key Russian war aims. But Putin, suffering from neo-imperial fantasies and legacy issues, said “no”. Hereckons he can get it all, and more, by fighting on. He has persuaded the idiot Trump that Russia’s victory is inevitable – and that scheming Europeans are the real warmongers. Yet his premise is fundamentally flawed. Hard facts confound him. Almost four years on, he’s still trapped in Donbas mud and ice. And at home, things fall apart.After two years of growth artificially fuelled by higher defence spending, Russia’s oil and gas income, representing up to 50% of state revenue,is down27% year-on-year, andrecession looms. Inflation is up, at 8%; interest rates top 16%. The budget deficit is rising, more than half of Russia’s liquid sovereign wealth fund has been squandered since 2022, state monopoliesface huge debts, foreign investment has plunged, import costs of strategic goods have risen by 122%, and consumer taxes are soaring, all to fund Putin’s war. Russians must even pay more to drown their sorrows: the price of vodka is up 5%.The pain gets steadily worse. Ukraine has identified a weak spot: Russia’s refineries, pipelines and “shadow fleet” of oil tankers carrying illicit exports. A thirdtanker was set ablazein the Black Sea last week by naval drone strikes. Kyiv is regularly hitting energy facilities deep inside Russia, causing panic and fuel shortages. Meanwhile, Russia’s two energy giants, Rosneft and Lukoil, are reeling as Asian buyers, including in China’s vital market, rush to avoidsecondary US sanctions.Putin’s economic ruination of Russia, though still a work in progress, is matched by plummeting geopolitical influence. Bogged down in Ukraine, Moscow could only watch as Syria, a prized Middle East ally, turned to the west and Iran came under US and Israeli attack. Now Venezuela, too, looks in vain for support.Ties with Chinahave been upended, with a humiliated Russia relegated to the role of dependent junior partner. Visiting India last week, Putin cut a needy figure in a country that, following US pressure,now boycotts Russian oil.The “Russia is winning” narrative hinges on supposed battlefield successes. Yuri Ushakov, one of Putin’s aides, claimed recent territorial advances “positively impacted” the Moscow talks – meaning they strengthened Russia’s hand. That’s delusional. The gains are marginal. Despite his surprise, full-scale invasion and overwhelming advantages in manpower and materiel, Putin has utterly failed to subjugate Ukraine – a failure measured inshocking Russian casualty figures: more than 280,000 killed or injured in the first eight months of 2025; about one million in total.How much longer will the Russian people tolerate their mass-murderer dictator-president – theSalisbury poisoner,the indicted war criminal – who, refusing all peace overtures, is now threatening war with Europe? This question is key. Putin’s readiness to risk the lives and wellbeing of ordinary Russians is only too evident, symbolised by the cynical signing-up fees and death benefits paid to infantry volunteers from poor rural areas – whose averagefrontline life expectancyis 12 days. Adding insult to injury,pay-outs have been slasheddue to budget cuts.Theseblood money schemesreflect deep indifference to entrenched problems of poverty and demographic collapse, independent journalist Alexey Kovalev has argued: “Military spending temporarily masks decades of neglect, providing social mobility through carnage.” When the fighting eventually stops, a “vast social crisis” could ensue, he has suggested – and the Kremlin fears it, hence its crushing of public and online dissent. For Putin, this is another reason not to end the war. Hiscrimes against his own peoplemay yet prove his undoing.A newLSE experts’ report, Against the Clock: Why Russia’s War Economy is Running Out of Time,found that while the war has “dramatically improved” the incomes of 20% of Russians, it is hugely socially divisive. “For the bulk of Russians, real incomes have fallen by 16% to 42%,” it said. Citing the 2023 Wagner uprising, it predicted deteriorating economic conditions could intensify “intra-elite and intra-regime” tensions.The latestUS negotiating fiascohas once again exposed Trump’s idiotically lopsided Ukraine “strategy”. Appeasing Russia from the start, he has undermined Ukraine by attacking Zelenskyy and halting arms supplies. Trump’s egotistic eagerness to play peacemaker and make a quick buck, choice of inept relatives and cronies as amateur envoys, and attempts to sideline and pillory Europe assist andembolden Putin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its proud history of struggle shows it cannot be beaten. But Putin can. He’s losing, not winning.

For clients looking to get sober, reflecting on what a sober Christmas might look like, and whether it’s even possible to achieve, is important.One client, Peter*, was planning to host 20 relatives for Christmas. Traditionally his family drink from breakfast until bedtime on Christmas Day. Peter was feeling anxious about what they might say if he stuck to soft drinks. He feared being pressed to have alcohol or becoming the butt of everyone’s jokes. Even worse, he dreaded feeling left out of the fun and spending Christmas Day feeling ashamed and sorry for himself.Peter’s concerns are common. But people who struggle with alcohol, contrary to expectations, usually find Christmas far more enjoyable if they stay sober. That’s because a hallmark of alcoholism is its unpredictability: there are no guarantees of what consequences may follow a drink. Not usually a recipe for a merry Christmas.But with some careful thought and planning, anyone should be able to enjoy Christmas in a way that works really well.Peter and I began by examining the gap between his fantasy of how Christmas should be celebrated and the reality of his actual Christmas celebrations in years past.Homesickness is a form of loss which may never grant closure. But a heart in two places can still find joy | Gaynor ParkinRead morePart of Peter’s fantasy was that everyone in his family would get along well and have fun together on Christmas Day. The reality, however, was that his family invariably pick fights with each other, especially a few drinks in, and find fault with his cooking, his home and the way he is raising his young kids.Peter also fantasised that he would be able to buy all the presents, pay for all the extra food and not lose sleep over spending money he couldn’t afford. But in reality, he usually ends up in debt by January, and this causes him a lot of stress and worry.Most importantly, Peter dreams he will be able to drink a glass or two of champagne and have one beer with lunch. In reality, he keeps on drinking until his wife is annoyed with him and he has grown angry enough to let off steam by telling one of his relatives what he really thinks of them. This embarrasses his children, who enjoy spending time with their cousins.Peter and I began to focus on what a relaxing and special Christmas could be, if it was tailor-made just for him. It turned out that this featured neither his relatives nor alcohol. For him, it was a simple picnic with his wife and his kids by the water, accompanied by one gift each that would be really special to the person who received it, a film and an early night. For Peter, this plan felt manageable and promised a sense of closeness and back-to-basics values that really mean something to him.Peter has since bravely called his relatives and told them that he will not be hosting them after all.He was anxious about prioritising himself and what he needed to do to stay sober. He was used to acting in a way he thought would please everyone else. But Peter was pleasantly surprised. His brother confided in him that he too dislikes the pressure of big family get-togethers and was glad of the chance to do something different. He even expressed his support for Peter trying to get sober, and they quietly wondered which other family members could maybe benefit from doing the same.Christmas can be difficult. Not because of a lack of alcohol, but because of the relationship dynamics involved in bringing it all together. If you’ve decided that drinking isn’t for you this year, then keeping things real may help keep you sober.*Name and some other details have been changed to protect client confidentialityDr Antonia Saunokonokois a psychotherapist from Sydney specialising in addiction and complex traumaExplore more on these topicsAlcoholismThe modern mindMental healthChristmasFamilyAlcoholPsychologycommentShareReuse this content"

But as a teenager with a severe disability who relies on social media for connection, community and access to a largely inaccessible world, this policy actually has the potential to create further harm.When I was 12, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which triggered a rare nerve condition that has paralysed me. My preteen years were spent in an ICU ward, on a ventilator, going through chemotherapy. Before I got sick I did not have any social media. It turned out that all I had to do was end up in a coma, because when I woke, I had a new iPhone 14 with every accessibility feature. HavingInstagramand Snapchat made me feel less disconnected. I had a window into the outside world, and my friends had a window into my world between hospital visits.How to support your child through the social media ban – listen, be on their side and don’t try to justify the new rulesRead moreSocial media is a powerful thing, especially for teenagers transitioning into adulthood. And I understandwhythere is a need to restrict it or monitor it, especially for children and young teenagers. However as clinical psychologist Dr Rachel Same has pointed out to me in response to questions on this topic, “current evidence does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between social media use and the physical or mental health of children and adolescents”.If banning social media for kids under 16 is a response to a mental health crisis among young people, shouldn’t it considerallyoung people? What about those who are isolated? Those who are in hospital or managing a chronic health condition or disability that means they can’t participate in the world in the same way as other teenagers their age?Even now, as I come to terms with life as a quadriplegic, Instagram andTikTokoffer videos, accounts and communities to remind me I’m not alone. I follow my footy team, I even DM with some of the Carlton boys before and after games, I follow the NBA and my favourite basketball accounts, and have started my own movie account where I review and rate movies. It’s not my behaviour online that’s the issue here, yet it is kids like me who are being punished.View image in fullscreenEzra Sholl and his mother Natasha interact with Ezra’s Instagram page.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianWhat we need is regulation and consequences. Whenever I have reported an account or comment for hate speech or bullying, my report has made no difference. The comment remains, the account still exists, and it’s up to me to block and move on, while that person or bot continues to spread hate. What responsibility do the platforms themselves owe to users? If tech companies have the capability to delete accounts for people under the age of 16, they also have the capability to delete accounts that bully, harass or cause harm. Banning social media for young people doesn’t actually solve the problems at the crux of this issue. Does the government not realise that bullying and trolling will continue on unregulated apps like WhatsApp, Roblox, Discord and probably many others that will pop up in the next few months to fill the gap that Instagram,Snapchatand TikTok have left?It’s not my behaviour online that’s the issue here, yet it is kids like me who are being punishedDr Same agrees. “The focus on banning specific platforms based on social interaction, rather than actual risk, is likely to overlook where dangers lie,” she says. “In some cases, the ban could even increase risk.Childrenare likely to miss out on the opportunity to learn how to use social media safely and responsibly with appropriate adult guidance. If they begin using it secretly, they may be less likely to seek help or tell their parents if they encounter a predator or harmful situation. The ban could push children toward less regulated or underground platforms, where harmful content is more difficult to monitor.”The federal communications minister, Anika Wells, said the ban was about protecting children. In a world that has already become largely inaccessible and very small, I’d like to invite the minister to spend a day with me, and let me know how reducing social media access and making my world even smaller protects me or kids like me.Ezra Sholl is a year 9 student in Melbourne, Australia, and a disability advocateExplore more on these topicsSocial media banOpinionSocial mediaInstagramTikTokSnapchatDisabilityChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

Wes Streeting should not be on itJohn HarrisThankfully, we now know more about conditions such as autism and ADHD. The health secretary must not be part of this attempt to turn back the clockSun 7 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 15.12 ESTShareWes Streeting is a politician whose keen interest in the zeitgeist is only matched by his seeming drive to be as close to the heart of it as possible. It is, therefore, not much of a surprise that the secretary of state for health and social care should end the year by announcing whatthe official blurbcalls an “independent review into mental health conditions, ADHD and autism”. Many of the resulting headlines put it more pithily: in keeping with an increasingly deafening media din, this will seemingly be an investigation into “overdiagnosis”.Candidates for 2025’s word of the year have so far included “rage bait” and “parasocial”, but overdiagnosis is surely the term that perfectly captures the intellectual and political fashions of the past 12 months. The mess of ideas it crystallises now has a set text,published back in March: The Age Of Diagnosis by the neurologist and epilepsy expertDr Suzanne O’Sullivan. Having been pronounced on, with his usual belligerent ignorance,by Nigel Farage, overdiagnosis hasbecome an obsessionof the Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice, who now holds forth about why some children with special educational needs shouldn’t be entitled to dedicated school transport, and claims that the sight of kids with sensory issues wearing ear defenders at school is “insane”.News of an official reviewfirst broke in October, and its terms of reference seem comparatively reasonable. In the Guardian, Streeting wrote last week about a focus on “support for mental health conditions, autism and ADHD”, and “how the NHS can meet the needs of all”. The review’s launch document makes mention of “prevalence, drivers, early intervention and treatment”.But clearly, its work has been commissioned partly for political reasons. There is a queasy whiff about its basic remit that – with strong echoes of what we hear from “overdiagnosis” merchants – clumsily mixes questions about mental illness (anxiety, depression) with autism and ADHD, which are neurodevelopmental. As mentions of “economic inactivity” prove, there is a clear sense of pitch-rolling for the return of so-calledwelfare reform. There are also telling uses of the word “medicalisation”, a term usually favoured by people who think that many conditions do not need any diagnosis at all.And as is becoming its habit, the government has decided to speak to different audiences in contrasting tones of voice. In the front-page splash that first announced the review,the Times saidthe health secretary was “concerned” about rising rates of diagnosis of both mental illness and what we now understand as neurodivergence, and there was also mention of ordinary feelings and stresses being “overpathologised”. All this sounds worryingly like a polite manifestation of a very familiar kind of thinking, reflective of a country in which questioning other people’s needs is almost becoming a national sport.View image in fullscreenWes Streeting in London, 12 November 2025.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersAnswers to questions the new inquiry asks might be less complicated than they seem. There are more peoplebeing diagnosedwith anxiety and depression because of an education system and model of work that are so harshly competitive and inherently precarious, and the still-overlooked effects of the pandemic. ADHD – which, just to reiterate a very important point, isnot a mental illness, but a matter of neural wiring – is something we are only just starting to understand, but it is worth recalling official reports thatput the number of children and adultsin England who are affected at 2.5 million, though only 800,000 currently havea formal diagnosis. Those numbers, moreover, are evidence of something that is not going to go away: our ever-growing understanding of the sheer complexity of our minds and brains, and how much our institutions still lag behind.That is also true ofrising autism diagnoses. We live in the long aftermath of diagnostic changes that happened in the 1980s and 1990s, when the definition of autism was widened to include people without an intellectual or learning disability, reflecting the basic – and incontestably correct – idea of a spectrum. The next stage of those shifts arrived only a relatively short time ago, when the different and often complex ways autism presents among women and girls finally began to be discussed. A new level of autism awareness fostered by the internet, meanwhile, had alerted people to the fact that they need not put up with constant misunderstanding and bullying; these days, they can find out who they – or their children –really are, what help they may need, and how to thereby live a life that is more settled and fulfilling,That prospect ought to be exciting and liberating. Unfortunately, oureconomy is flatlining, and public spending is constantly squeezed. So, amid lengthening waiting lists, how do we deal with all that increased need? Overdiagnosis offers a simple answer: you tell people – not least those who can be classified as “mild” or “moderate” cases – to be more resilient, and wave them away.There is one very convenient article of faith that seems to be increasingly fashionable in Westminster: the idea that diagnoses can do more harm than good, which is the key contentionthat definesO’Sullivan’s book. “The stigma of autism has been associated with low self-esteem among children,” she writes, while blithely feeding those same negative perceptions byreferring to autismas a “brain disorder” and an “illness”. An autism diagnosis, she claims, runs the risk of being “a self-fulfilling prophecy, as some will take the diagnosis to mean they can’t do certain things, so won’t even try”. But unless we can specify who people are and what broad psychological category they fit into, how do we know how to help them: what educational methodologies to use, how to adjust their learning environment and what aptitudes and talents can be developed?Over the past eight months, I have had hundreds of conversations about all this, at events put on to promote Maybe I’m Amazed,the memoir I’ve writtenabout my autistic son James, and how, ever since he was a toddler, music has been a massive part of how we connect. From Jersey to the Yorkshire Dales, one insight has come up countless times: the fact that the autistic spectrum is not nearly as linear as some people think, and that the relevant traits occur with such wildly different intensities that crudely labelling people as “mild”, “moderate” and “severe” is sometimes all but impossible. That blurs into another regularly voiced point: how the plain fact that human beings’ brains work in completely varied ways rather makes a mockery of a basic method of education – standing in front of 30 kids and shouting at them for an hour – that is now decades out of date.There is another thing that people always talk about. Autism often reflects traits that run through people’s family trees – something they tend to become aware of in retrospect. Past flickers and flashes of eccentricity, obsessiveness or social awkwardness will suddenly take on new meanings. More painfully, people suddenly become aware of relativeswho had frustrating andbroken lives, because so little was known about things that many of us now take as a given – not least the fact that autistic minds are as complex and sophisticated as any other kind, and in most cases, they need careful support and nurturing. And in that context, theories and pronouncements about overdiagnosis sound to many people like a nightmarish turning-back of the clock.They are not wrong. Human psychology is complicated. Politics and power, by contrast, tend to be crass, cruel and prone to coming up with completely the wrong questions. Which brings me to one question I’d like to ask the health secretary: however much he prettifies it, why is he picking over the number of diagnoses, when he could be focusing on why our systems of work, education and care are still so closed off to the people who get them?John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

The company, which operates about 3,000 shared vehicles in Britain, hasannounced plansto shutter its UK operations at the end of the month. The news comes as a bitter blow to thehundreds of thousandsof Britons who regularly rely on carsharing, and is a major setback in efforts to reduce emissions and traffic congestion.I’m particularly gutted.This year I finally learned to drive, specifically in order to become a Zipcar member for the rare occasions when I need a vehicle. As newly qualified drivers aren’t allowed to hire Zipcars until they’ve held a licence for a year, I bought a secondhand VW Beetle to tide me over, counting the days until I could flog it and sign up for Zipcar instead. Now, with the service shutting up shop, I fear I will be stuck maintaining a costly lump of steel that I need for less than 1% of the year.Growth in private car ownership is a problem. Domestic transport remains the largestsource of emissions in the UK. Expanding car clubs such as Zipcar could have helped, as research suggests each shared vehicle replaces about20 private cars.Yet Britain was already lagging behind our neighbours in car clubs. According to Invers, a carsharing tech company, Germany hasmore than six times as manyshared cars per capita as Britain. Zipcar’s departure will reduce the total number of shared cars in the UK to just one for every 30,000 people–effectively eliminating carsharing for huge swathes of the population.The impending collapse of UK carsharing should be a severe embarrassment to the government, which elsewhere is attempting to curb car dominance. The revisedNational Planning Policy Framework, for example, has an entire section dedicated to expanding sustainable transport, including carsharing, and a requirement for local authorities to “promote sustainable travel modes that limit future car use”. But what good is setting lofty policies for tomorrow without supporting the companies and services that can enable better choices today?In last week’s budget, Rachel Reeves showered the private-car sector with funding,raising subsidiesfor new electric cars to £1.95bn and topping up grants for new electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure to £500m.Reeves’ EV giveaway comes as shecoughed up£1.5bn to underwrite a loan to Jaguar Land Rover after a recent cyber-attack, andfroze fuel dutyfor yet another year. How is the chancellor finding billions to support the private car sector but offering nothing to support (massively more cost-effective) car clubs and their328,539 users?Arthur Kay, a Transport for London board member and author of the new bookRoadkill: Unveiling the True Cost of Our Toxic Relationship with Cars, fears that the Treasury has been seduced by the claims of electric car manufacturers, and is funnelling money into questionable EV rollouts that could otherwise be supporting effective schemes supporting reduced and shared car-use schemes. “The EV lobby has so effectively captured the state,” he tells me, but warns that “changing the fuel source doesn’t change all the other things that are bad about cars”.The truth is that electric cars are no panacea. They are quieter and spew fewer direct emissions than their petrol counterparts, but still produce brake, tyre and other particulates that account for a large portion of driving-based air pollution. EVs are also carbon-intensive to manufacture, and require energy from the grid to run most of the time; some EV cars only reduce the carbon emissions of drivingby 47%.Shockingly, rising private electric car ownership may also actually be fuelling more car use. In Norway94% of new cars soldare now electric thanks to astronomical public subsidies. However, a little-reported studyhas revealeda hidden dark side to the Scandinavian EV revolution. In September, researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology found greater EV ownership is driving an overall increase in car trips of 10-20%. Just asbuilding new roads increases trafficby encouraging more people to drive, so, too, flooding Norway with shiny new private EVs has prompted more Norwegians to get behind the wheel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His appearance was so unassuming that he told me during a recent public talk, that while he was taking pictures during a recent seaside trip, some passersby remarked that he was “a bit like Martin Parr”. Unbothered by glitz and glamour, for more than five decades Parr purposefully pursued the most boring things he could find – he was unapologetic about the excitement he saw in a perfect cup of tea, a plate of beans on toast, or a woman filling up her car at a petrol station. He also knew that, with time, these supposedly dull things would become interesting.Parr took delight in looking, without flattery, at the things you thought you already knew. In a Parr picture, beauty is not always graceful – the overflowing rubbish at New Brighton beach, the cucumber and cheese sandwiches wrapped in clingfilm at Shalfleet church fete (with the sign, please do take ONE cherry tomato). He made the mundane magnificent with his panache for saturated colours and surprising compositions. He was masterful at capturing the unexpected and unchoreographed interruptions that reveal the unpolished truth of the ordinary moment. He understood that the fluorescent glow of a chip shop could be as revealing as a cathedral; that the colour of a plastic beach bucket could anchor the entire mood of a nation; that the way a stranger holds a sandwich or an ice-cream speaks of class, of longing, of place, of the small stories that batter or buoy us daily. This radical attentiveness – this celebration of the overlooked – is what made Parr one of the most human photographers of our time.View image in fullscreenSmall stories … a photograph from Parr’s The Last Resort series, taken at New Brighton.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosParr had an unremarkable early life, with family trips to the local sewage works where they enjoyed the local history, the views – and the occasional ice-cream. He wasn’t academically successful at school but discovered photography early on, and by his final year at Manchester Polytechnic, he was already doing things differently – his final show was an installation recreating a living room. It divided opinionamong those who saw it, but it was typical of Parr’s innovative, original approach to the medium. He wanted everyone to feel at home in, and with, his pictures.He didn’t always get it right, of course, and he received criticism as well as praise over the years. Parr’s acceptance by the prestigious photo agency Magnum in 1994 was controversial, since many of the old guard, including Henri Cartier-Bresson, didn’t like his style and less serious attitude towards documentary photography. He was accepted, rejected and then eventually accepted on a single vote to Magnum – all on the same day. In 2014, he would become the agency’s president. Parr knew how absurd life’s contradictions were and through his photographs he gave us a way to embrace them.View image in fullscreenDrawn towards fun … a Parr image of a queue for an ice-cream van in Tenby, Wales.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosParr will be fondly remembered for his sense of humour. The quintessential British photographer, he poked fun at Britishness – possibly one of the reasons his photography is so popular in France. Some saw his work, especially his decades of pictures working-class leisure activities, as sneering, but it came from a place of deep love and tenderness for the nation’s idiosyncratic, eccentric culture and fading traditions. Though he travelled to places ranging from Benidorm to Mexico City, Dakar to Moscow and Pyongyang, it was Britain he knew and understood best. He showed the British a society that was unmistakably theirs.Parr’s devotion to photography was unwavering. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of photographic history – he published 100 books of his own and donated a portion of his staggering collection of more than 12,000 photobooks to Tate in 2017. But he was firmly focused on the future generation too. In 2014, he founded theMartin ParrFoundation in Bristol to support British photographers; the public exhibition space and library opened in 2017 and has exhibited artists at the start of their career, including the Turner prize-nominated Rene Matic, Sebastian Bruno and Ian Weldon, alongside era-defining image-makers like Lee Miller, Ajamu X and Chris Kilip. His influence across generations after him is indelible.‘There’s something very interesting about boring’: Martin Parr on his life in picturesRead moreParr loved to travel and take pictures, and he was at almost every photography exhibition and event. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2021, he walked with the support of a rollator – I once saw him hurl it playfully against the wall, exclaiming “crash” with great relish. He took photography seriously – he truly believed in it – but as successful as he was, he never took himself too seriously. His ongoing series of gently self-mocking self-portraits are just one example of that.Parr was drawn towards fun, towards leisure and levity, things that are ineradicably human desires – and our small vanities, our simple pleasures, our unguarded absurdities. Like an anthropologist armed with Kodachrome, he stepped into the social rituals that shape us, that he too was part of: the queues, the holidays, the celebrations, the markets, the inveterate longing we carry into each public space. He didn’t hold these things at arm’s length. He was in there too, unpretentiously, with the curiosity of someone who never stopped being surprised by the world.Explore more on these topicsMartin ParrPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They belong to leading man Don Lockwood (a charismatic Louis Gaunt), who taps out a quick dance before shrugging them on and transforming into his movie star persona. Immediately we’re in Hollywood, a world obsessed with appearances.It’s an apt start for a musical that pokes fun at the gap between reputation and reality. There’s Don, whose pre-Hollywood vaudeville career is at odds with his public image, and whose self-importance is quickly mocked by aspiring actress Kathy Selden (Carly Mercedes Dyer). Opposite him, co-star Lina Lamont’s on-screen glamour knocks up against her screeching voice, here delivered with squeaky relish by Laura Baldwin. The arrival of the talkies leaves the studio scrambling to save face, with entertaining if familiar consequences.View image in fullscreenPlays to the strengths of the Royal Exchange’s in-the-round space … Singin' in the Rain.Photograph: Johan PerssonThis version hits all the key beats with crowd-pleasing confidence. Everyone, of course, is waiting forthatnumber – and the creative team know it. When Don finally starts tap-dancing in the pre-interval downpour, Gaunt teases the audience with it, playfully threatening front-row spectators with the flick of his umbrella. It’s a smart way of tackling such an iconic moment: letting us all in on the game.This is characteristic of Shaw’s production, which – like his2018 revival of The Producers– plays to the strengths of the Royal Exchange’s in-the-round space. Audience members are very much involved, whether as adoring movie fans, high-fiving accomplices to Cosmo Brown’s hijinks (a comic highlight in the hands of Danny Collins), or confidantes to a riled Lina. With relatively little set, the action is carried along by the excellent ensemble and Alistair David’s high-energy choreography.The Exchange’s recent Christmas offerings have often had a more quirky or topical flavour, be it last year’sSpend Spend Spendor 2022’s musical telling of the life of Betty Boothroyd. This year, by contrast, the approach is sheer, unapologetic joy. As a respite from doom-scrolling, it feels both necessary and infectious. By the puddle-stomping finale, resistance is futile.Singin’ in the Rain is at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester, until 25 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsRoyal ExchangereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a handy edict for anyone adapting the many moralising, terrifying and bizarre episodes within Carlo Collodi’s 1883 novel. Charlie Josephine and Jim Fortune’s new family musical takes heed, barreling out of the blocks to cover an impressive chunk of Collodi’s story while swapping its darkness and finger-wagging for heartwarming lessons and boisterous humour.In a narrow-minded Italian town (hammily chorused “mamma mias!” kick off the blissful silliness to come), free-thinking inventor Geppetto is an outcast. His ticket to adventure arrives as a piece of talking wood, which he plans to craft into a fortune-winning puppet. Pinocchio, of course, has other ideas. But here, the puppet’s journey to boyhood isn’t just about learning what makes us good, but what makes us human. His scrapes along the way are born not out of wickedness but curiosity and impulsive energy – perfectly captured by the three puppeteers animating Peter O’Rourke’s simple wooden design (including Lee Braithwaite, who gives Pinocchio a voice wild and wonder-filled), and by Josephine’s book, which sees Pinocchio firing off life’s big questions only to interrupt the answers with yells of “I’m hungry!”View image in fullscreenLucy McCormick as The Blue Fairy in Pinocchio at Shakespeare’s Globe.Photograph: Johan PerssonUnder Sean Holmes’s meticulous direction, the 14-strong cast bring full-tilt fun to the villains and helpers Pinocchio meets along the way. Kerry Frampton and Lucy McCormick are deliciously dastardly as Fox and Cat, who leave him penniless, hanging by his foot in a tree, but Steven Webb is the standout as campy Giacomo Cricket and the terrifying, kidnapping Coachman.The ensemble are excellent, nailing Vicki Igbokwe-Ozoagu’s inventive choreography and giving us gorgeous soaring harmonies. Fortune’s songs, which range from rock’n’roll to ska, from pop to blues, are catchy and the lyrics (by Fortune and Josephine) are witty and poignant, but at times too fast and complicated to make out.The production leans into Collodi’s barminess (a chicken emerging from a cooked egg? “That makes perfect sense,” eye-rolls Cricket) and the Globe’s collapsible fourth wall, with meta-theatrical skewering of the audience and a perfect moment when Pinocchio’s puppeteers duck as he insists he’s moving unaided. But its biggest success is its addition of another transformation – that of Geppetto (played with humour and heart by Nick Holder) from natural but nervous caregiver to fully fledged father. A reminder that what makes us human is connection.Pinocchio is at the Globe theatre, London, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreShakespeare's GlobereviewsShareReuse this content"

But I do love Meghan’s Christmas specialPolly HudsonThe Duchess of Sussex is back and suddenly her show makes sense. It is cringingly ultra-extra, of course, but isn’t that what Christmas is all about?Sun 7 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 7 Dec 2025 03.39 ESTShareNo matter the time of year, ’tis always open season on the Duchess of Sussex’s televisual offering,With Love, Meghan. Critics, professional and armchair, have rarely been so united as when gleefully ripping series one and two of the lifestyle show to shreds. The consensus was that there has never been a greater royal outrage than when she took some pretzels out of a labelled bag, put them in a different bag, then labelled it. And she didn’t even attempt to explain herself to Emily Maitlis afterwards.Now, like a merry renegade master, she is back once again with a “Holiday Celebration” (aka a Christmas special). But this time, it’s different. There are still the usual elements we’ve come to expect – psychobabble word salads, extreme hosting – but in the context of a yuletide episode, suddenly it all makes sense. The pieces have fallen into place; it’s a perfect snow storm.By this point, Meghan is like the eccentric aunt at most festive family gatherings – offering unsolicited, unnecessary advice, and supplying the odd random outburst. (“I love spinach!” … “A tradition has to have a beginning.” … “A tree is part of my memory and love of the holiday season.”) She’s a bit of a character, but her presence is familiar and oddly reassuring. And she seems happy enough; she’s not doing any harm.She knows her every micro expression, syllable and glance will be dissected and criticised, but still appears carefreeMaybe this is the first occasion in history where that old chestnut that mums used to offer up when somebody was being mean to their little darling – “Ignore them, they’re just jealous” – might be true. Because, you know what? Everything in Meghan’s Holiday Celebrationislovely. Yes, it’s all cringily ultra-extra, nonsense and over the top – but isn’t that exactly what Christmas is about? And the talk she’s talking might be ridiculous, but the walk she’s walking genuinely looks shop-bought.Whatever she turns her beautifully manicured, diamond-adorned hand to, she pulls off with style. Her cooking is delicious, the wreath she makes is stunning, her presents are almost too pretty to unwrap. Nothing is average or aesthetically displeasing – even the way she ties her apron is artful and chic. She doesn’t bung a dish in the microwave, it “takes a twirl”, and she folds wrapping paper like an origami guru (quick tip: make your wax seals in advance!). She also seems to be thoroughly enjoying herself throughout. How could any hate-watcher not be won over, filled with seasonal cheer and left with a deep longing for handmade crackers filled with thoughtful items selected just for them or a crudites platter where broccoli is arranged in the shape of a wreath?Meghan used to pretend for a living, of course, but even so, after the level of scrutiny she has endured since she started dating Prince Harry, the love child of Meryl Streep and Judi Dench would struggle to act this naturally. She knows her every micro expression, syllable and glance will be dissected and criticised, but she still manages to appear relaxed and carefree. Too blessed to be stressed.With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration review – take anti-nausea pills, she’s back!Read moreHer refusal to change or even tone down her shtick, despite it being so relentlessly, globally mocked, is weirdly comforting. In our uncertain world, here is something we can count on: Meghan will be like this, come what may. We will always know where we are with her.If you’re still not buying what she’s selling, a reminder that will surely come as a relief: you don’t have to. There isn’t national service in this country any more, and if there were, it would be unlikely to include watching With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration, especially post-Megxit. If, however, you willingly check it out and are overcome with envy about her picture-perfect Christmas, all is not lost either. Whether you’re a duchess or a data administrator, no kid truly appreciates the effort and hard work their mum does in December. So you can console yourself by imagining Archie and Lilibet’s faces when they open the calligraphy note that says, ‘I love you because you are brave,’ from their homemade Advent calendar, instead of a chocolate.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Trump called the campaign the “hottest ad out there”.‘I can’t control how others perceive me’: Sydney Sweeney on boxing, weight gain and her flair for controversyRead moreThe brand wasn’t only criticised by the left of the political spectrum – the financial magazine Forbes argued that it should “reconsider” the campaign. The publication also reported that American Eagle store visits were 9% down by the end of the summer.“I was honestly surprised by the reaction,” Sweeney added. “I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand. I don’t support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign. Many have assigned motives and labels to me that just aren’t true.”“Anyone who knows me knows that I’m always trying to bring people together. I’m against hate and divisiveness,” she added.“I hope this new year brings more focus on what connects us instead of what divides us.”Sweeney is considered an outside bet for an Oscar next year for her lead performance in Christy, David Michôd’sbiopic of the trailblazing boxer Christy Martin.She has mostly avoided the American Eagle ad in promotional interviews but has described Trump’s commenting on it as “surreal”.Explore more on these topicsSydney SweeneynewsShareReuse this content"

Their loving and feuding was spread across nine books and set against more than four decades of British history.Unlike Downton, the story features just the upstairs lot. They have come a long way from their Dorset farming descendants and are not the best sort of people: they hold money paramount with a need to “possess things”. Adapted by Shaun McKenna and Lin Coghlan, who previously adapted the story for radio, we see how this entitlement manifests in love, marriage and betrayal.There is plenty of human drama and the focus is on female experience across both parts, the first involving Irene (Fiona Hampton) and her marital rape at the hands of proprietorial husband, Soames (Joseph Millson) in the Victorian era. The second is that of Fleur (Flora Spencer-Longhurst), the daughter of Soames and our sometimes narrator, taking place after the Great War. It is less reliant on familiar melodrama and is more alive for it, featuring a star-crossed romance between Fleur and Irene’s son, Jon (Andy Rush), who are on either side of a family schism. We see strong-headed Fleur regarding love as an entitlement (like father, like daughter?). “You’re mine,” she repeats, proprietorially. Jon is a more passive, pallid, character compared to Irene’s lover, Philip Bosinney (also played by Rush).The first part is a kind of War and Peace Lite, showing how the fortunes of family members are shaped or constricted by the time in which they live, although the greater historical gyrations seem distant, with the briefest of talk about the Boers in South Africa and Queen Victoria’s funeral, but without being blended in the human drama. The post-war generation of the 1920s speak of life as a comedy and bear a hedonistic nihilism in Part 2 but this is repeatedly stated rather than felt.View image in fullscreenWar and Peace Lite … Fiona Hampton as Irene and Andy Rush as Philip Bosinney in a production photo from The Forsyte Saga Part 1.Photograph: Cam HarleSoames, the villain of the piece in Part 1, becomes the vulnerable father who must stand and watch his daughter repeating his mistakes. Irene, whose beauty seems to be anobjet d’artfor younger Soames, to possess alongside his art collection, captures the contained anguish and strangled options of a woman living in an age that renders her powerless as a wife, however privileged she might look from the outside. In some respects she is a British Anna Karenina, although she proves herself a survivor.This production’s initial run was in the intimate, fringe, space of the Park theatre, in London, where it was staged, innovatively, with an expertly spare set, consisting of little more than layers of velvet curtain. All the wealth of this family had to be imagined by the audience. It is the same in thisRoyal Shakespeare Companystaging but it has a different effect. It seems less experimental, more a slick Merchant Ivory-style costume drama that does the job of hooking you in.Still, it is realised with wit and pace by director Josh Roche. The minimal set design is striking in its red velvet opulence. Premium is on sound, composed and designed by Max Pappenheim, which is crisp and vivid (cooing wood pigeons, clopping horses, etc).There is a fluidity in switching of scenes that adds a psychological undertow: characters from the last scene stand watching the next, as if eavesdropping, or they loom, like spectres in the mind. Several performances involve the adept juggling of characters. But this imaginative form of storytelling is hemmed in by a familiar story of rich scions being typically rapacious and beastly. It is essentially a posh soap opera that slips down easily enough across five hours (if you see them both) but it is not exactly penetrating in character or story.At Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 10 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But a new edition has made his final thoughts on his opera performable again, andOpera Raraand the BBC Symphony Orchestra got to do the big reveal.The standard version of La Rondine, performed at the premiere in 1917, ends with Magda – the “migrating swallow” of the title – nobly leaving her lovelorn Ruggero so that he can find someone more marriageable. Yet Puccini’s 1921 revision – his third version of the opera, the one he was finally happy with – has Ruggero angrily sending Magda away. It’s a big change, making the opera’s aftertaste bitter where it used to be sweet. There are lots of other differences too, notably some extra merrymaking for the chorus and orchestra in the second act.Few people got to hear this version when it was new – its premiere happened a few months before Puccini’s death, by which time he was too ill to advocate for it – and then in 1943 the score and orchestral parts were destroyed in the allied bombing of Milan. Now, though, thanks to reconstruction work by the musicologist Ditlev Rindom and some new orchestrations by Martin Fitzpatrick, opera companies have a choice of which version to use – and if a case needs making for this version, the recording this team has just finished making should do just that.The changes fell seamlessly into place here. Puccini’s music turns on a dime – so much flirting and dancing, yet so much wistfulness – and Carlo Rizzi’s conducting kept the sparkling orchestra on its toes, while the BBC Singers provided all the energy and precision needed in the expanded nightclub scene. The cast sang from behind music stands but did a decent job of acting nonetheless. Ermonela Jaho is a stage animal and her beautifully sung Magda drew us in even if her glowing soprano didn’t always outdo Rizzi’s orchestra. The supporting cast, including Juan Francisco Gatell as the wry, charming poet Prunier and Ellie Neate as the maid Lisette, was outstanding from top to bottom, but the tenor Iván Ayón-Rivas was first among equals here, his ardent Ruggero, complete with vibrant, beefy top notes, marking him out as a real rising star.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicBarbicanGiacomo PuccinireviewsShareReuse this content"

The feed stations along the route were crammed with packets ofMeli honey wafflesandMeli honey cake. I ate so many that I suffered withdrawal symptoms after finishing the last of them at the end of the 167-mile route.On return visits to Ghent, my first port of call is any local supermarket to buy a couple of boxes of the sweet treats. After stocking up, I head to theTierenteyn-Verlentmustard shop on the Groentenmarkt. The 19th-century interior is like an old-fashioned apothecary filled with the soothing aromas of the spices and herbs used in the mustards they make fresh each day in wooden vats on the premises.From there, it’s a short hop toMokabonon Donkersteeg, a 1950s cafe that has seemingly been preserved in aspic with all the original sleek features, including a beautiful wooden bar, red walls and small round tables. At the front of the cafe is a small counter where they sell home-roasted coffee beans (they’ve been roasting since the late 1930s) that they then package in distinctive yellow and red paper bags.Oh, and on that first visit, I also came home with a Belgian bike.Andy PietrasikFrance: ‘Artfully arranged shelves are a siren call to drool’View image in fullscreenThe Bonne Maman jam section in a French supermarket.Photograph: Andy PietrasikThe middle aisle of my local Lidl has nothing on French supermarket booty. I once bought six big saucissons in ahypermarchébecause they each came with a free Laguiole-style steak knife. Eventually, even the dog started turning his nose up at dried sausage treats.You know what they say about French style; well, it carries on through to the shelves of French supermarkets, each brand artfully arranged with labels facing forward and issuing a siren call to linger and drool.There’s the perfectly aligned Bonne Maman jam section offering typically Gallic flavours such asmirabelle intense,coings(quince),figues violettes(fig) andreines-claudes(greengage). Identifying the different types of fromages blancs, crèmes fraîches and creams could qualify as a specialist section on Mastermind. Then there are the cheeses: there are countless varieties from Normandy, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.But my favourite aisles, aside from the wines, are the tins and terrines:terrine de sanglier(wild boar),terrine de lapin(rabbit),pâté du dimanche(pork and duck liver); cassoulet made with duck and Toulouse sausages; and my all-time Proustian taste – confit de canard. Then a quick dash through the snack section reaps armfuls of Lay’s crisps,paysannetapenadeflavour (only in France);galettes au beurre(buttery biscuits); and Haribo Pik Dragibus sweets.APItaly: ‘I have a weakness for sugared jellies and lemony beer’View image in fullscreenA confectionery shop in Florence.Photograph: John Bracegirdle/AlamyAs a child, I went on holiday abroad just twice – both times to visit family in Italy. That was the start of my love affair with Italian sweets. This is a country that loves a little something sugary and all shops, from big supermarkets to localalimentari,offer an Aladdin’s cave of candies. I have a particular weakness for fruit jellies and the joy of the Italian supermarket is that you can buy huge bags of them (my favourites areDufour’s Big Frut range), each individually wrapped.View image in fullscreenI also never leave Italy without several boxes ofBaci chocolates. There is something so beguiling about these “little kisses”, the mound of nutty filling encased in dark chocolate with a whole hazelnut popped on top and then wrapped in silver and blue paper with a message of love tucked inside. Don’t even think of buying them at the airport, where they mysteriously triple in price; instead, find a Prix, which is super cheap, or, for more choice, the big supermarket chains such as Coop and Conad.If you’ve driven to Italy, then a supermarket sweep will lend itself to armfuls of groceries worth bringing back – olive oil, pasta, balsamic vinegar and don’t forget the porcini mushrooms – but make sure you leave room for a couple of packs ofBirra Moretti Limone. While you may be tempted to scoop up a bottle of limoncello, everyone knows it never tastes as good once you get it home. Much better to get that citrusy hit in a beer. Basically, it’s an Italian shandy made from lager and Sicilian lemon juice, making it low alcohol – and delicious. Turns out those tangy, citrusy notes are the perfect accompaniment to a delicious bag of sugared jellies.Max BenatoIreland: ‘Skip the Taytos and get tortilla chips made in Tipperary’View image in fullscreenSmoked wild Atlantic salmon from the Woodcock Smokery, Skibbereen.Photograph: Paul Sherwood PhotographyFor Irish expats on a trip home and international tourists alike, it is almost mandatory that you stock up on Barry’s tea and Tayto crisps before leaving the country. They won’t let you through airport security on your way out if youdon’thave at least one big red box of teabags and a few jumbo packs of salted potato snacks crammed into your suitcase.Fine as these exemplars of Irish marketing ingenuity are, I’m here to tell you that other great products do exist; it’s just that sometimes you need to dig around a bit to find them. Most Irish supermarkets supply a range of farmhouse cheeses such as Gubbeen and Durrus, which are wonderful, but I’d go the extra mile for Boyne Valley Bán, a magnificent hard goat’s cheese available atSheridans cheesemongers, which has shops and concessions around the country.I’d also track down a big jar ofHarry’s Nut Butter(the original paprika flavour with the shades-wearing elephant on the label) and White Mausu’s dangerously addictivepeanutrāyu– both easy to find in delis and some supermarkets too (SuperValu usually has a good selection of small Irish producers).I might lose my passport for saying this, but I’d skip the Taytos and grab a bag ofBlanco Niño tortilla chips, made in the very un-Mexican county of Tipperary but no less spicily delicious for it. And be sure to pick up some smoked fish –Burren Smokehouseis good, and widely available, but Sally Barnes’sWoodcock Smokery, though harder to come by, is the gold standard.Killian FoxGermany: ‘I head for in-store bakeries and deli counters’View image in fullscreenGerman bakeries sell a huge variety of breads.Photograph: Jurgen Wiesler/AlamyOne of the things I miss when I’m travelling away from Germany is the fantastic bakeries. Most of the big supermarket chains – such as Edeka and Rewe (which tend to be pricier than Aldi and Lidl) – have in-store bakeries selling everything from pastries to pretzels.But few things say “home” to me more than the aroma of freshly bakedBrötchen. I don’t even know what the proper translation would be – bread roll? Bun? Bap? – but you can get them in many different varieties, with sunflower or poppy seeds, made from sourdough, or as a soft pretzel roll. Fill them with cream cheese, cheese or meat from the deli counters for a good value lunch or breakfast.Germany’s highly federal system is reflected in its regional cuisine – which is sometimes represented in the fresh counters, too. If you’re in Bavaria, please try a pretzel and white sausage with mild mustard, or in northern Germany a bread roll with battered fish or pickled herring. And if you’re longing for a sugar hit, Hamburg’s finestFranzbrötchenwith butter and cinnamon should do the trick.From the confectionary aisle I would stock up on Ritter Sport chocolate and vegan gummy bears or liquorice fromKatjes, one of Germany’s largest sweet makers and a pioneer in using plant-based ingredients and natural flavourings.However, the thing I miss most about German supermarkets when I’m abroad is the good old deposit system, calledpfánd, where you return plastic bottles and cans to the supermarket and get up to 25 cents each. They then get recycled. Throwing them in the bin just does not feel right.Anna EhlebrachtExplore more on these topicsShopping tripsFood and drinkEurope holidaysShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Because, since its creation in the UAE in 2022, apparently to satisfy chocolatier Sarah Hamouda’spregnancy cravingsfor pistachio and pastry, this bar has taken over the world. Though food (among those with the luxury of choice, at least) has never been immune to the absurdities of fashion, the internet has supercharged and globalised the process, so much so that pistachios, which back in January weredubbed “the new pumpkin spice”by this very newspaper, are now everywhere, from Starbucks lattes to Aldi mince pies.View image in fullscreenOnly Ravneet Gill uses dark chocolate in her Dubai bar. All inset photographs by Felicity Cloake.The thing is, however, that whatever your thoughts on green, sugary, coffee-adjacent beverages,Hamouda’s Dubai chocolatedeveloped for Fix Dessert Chocolatier has triumphed, because it really does taste as good as it looks: crunchy pastry, sweet chocolate and rich, slightly savoury nut butter are an incredibly satisfying combination, so a big bar of it is guaranteed to impress under the Christmas tree. Experience demands that I suggest you wrap it in a pet-proof box, however –emergency vet billsare no one’s idea of a great present.The pistachiosThis is the key flavouring – and, probably more importantly as far as the internet is concerned, colouring. The price of pistachioshas surgedsince Dubai chocolate went viral, with the Financial Times reporting in April that global kernel prices had risen by a third “as demand for viral cream-filled bars strains supplies”. Given they weren’t cheap to start with, this isn’t an ideal choice of gift if you’re making presents for reasons of economy; that said, it’s still better value than a scarf they’ll never wear, or some novelty gin they’ll just give to the PTA raffle.View image in fullscreenThe Kitchn’s ‘green-tinged white chocolate is the work of minutes, yet looks surprisingly impressive’.Many recipes call for pistachio cream, or crème as British supermarkets aspirationally style it, an Italian product that caters for the Italian sweet tooth. Not only are many wincingly sugary, but I’ve come across at least one that’s as little as 10% pistachio, so check the label if you’d like to save time by subbing in a ready-made paste here. Just mix it in with the pastry – you’ll need about 350g – and don’t be swayed by the colour, because most are dyed. I used one that was 45% pistachio, but it was sold behind the counter because it was £10 a jar, so you do get what you pay for in this department.Though I use it in both US websitethe Kitchnand Swiss grocery giantMigros’ recipes, I come to the conclusion that it’s both better and cheaper to make your own. However, that’s only if you have a food processor to hand –Good Housekeeping,Rama,the creator behindIndicious Kitchen, and our very ownRavneet Gillall start from scratch.Toast the nuts first, as Rama suggests – in side-by-side comparisons, my testers all remark how much nuttier hers tastes, though this may also be because she uses five times as many nuts as Gill does. That said, I do end up with a lot of leftover filling, so in reality it’s probably more like three times as many. As the pistachios are the point here, I’ve also been generous with them on the basis that there’s little point investing if you don’t use enough actually to taste them.View image in fullscreenGreen genie: skinned homemade pistacho butter (left) versus unskinned (right).Rama is also the only person to bother skinning as well as shelling her nuts, which is annoying, given that she uses so many. But it really does make a difference to the colour of the end result, which compels me to recommend you do the same. You can buy vivid green, skinned nutsonline, but at a cost, so to start with I’d advise going for the greenest nuts you can find (the ones I buy from Waitrose are greener than the smaller nuts from the Mediterranean food hall I visit in a fruitless search for skinned ones). Then, rub off as much skin as you have the patience for (I wouldn’t blanch them to loosen the skins, unless you’re also committed to drying them out properly afterwards; moisture is the enemy of crunchy pastry.) Rama whizzes her pistachios to a smooth cream, much like the one bought in a jar, while Good Housekeeping and Gill both stick with a coarser rubble of ground nuts, which I prefer – again, it’s all about keeping as much of the pistachio in there as possible, and that goes for texture as well as flavour. For the same reason, I’ve included a few roughly chopped salted nuts, too, but that’s very much not in keeping with Hamouda’s original sweet and velvety version, so feel free to leave them out,.Though Rama makes absolutely everything else from scratch, she is refreshingly unapologetic about artificially enhancing the colour of the filling. You may shy away from this (though if you’ve admired a Dubai chocolate bar that’s green, rather than beige inside, be aware it’s probably not entirely natural). But bear in mind that the first bite is with the eyes, and a few drops of dye are unlikely to be the naughtiest thing you eat thisChristmas. (Note: to make a cheaper alternative, you could use peanut butter, or indeed another nut butter of your choice, and adjust the sugar as necessary.)The creamView image in fullscreenMigros’s Dubai chocolate features homemade pistachio cream.Chopped nuts and crunchy pastry would make for a very dry mouthful indeed, which is why, even if eschewing the jarred creams, it’s imperative to add a few more ingredients to the filling. Gill and Good Housekeeping bind it with melted white chocolate, with the latter also adding double cream, an ingredient that sets off alarm bells in my head. I remember the words of Raphael Bachmann, owner of Confiserie Bachmann in Lucerne, on the Migros website: “It is important to use a high-quality [pistachio] cream containing plenty of pistachios … If the cream contains a lot of water or oil, the ‘angel hair’ will quickly become soft.” Even double cream is more water than anything else, so this is best avoided, yet white chocolate is, inevitably, very sweet. Again, the best solution comes from Rama, who uses milk powder (which gives the rich creaminess of dairy without any of the water) and icing sugar, allowing her to control the sweetness. Depending on what sort of chocolate you use, you may want to add more than I’ve suggested below, but don’t omit the pinch of salt: it’s key to bringing out the savoury flavour of the nuts.The original bar also contains tahini paste, which brings both creaminess and a bitter edge that helps to stop it tipping over into sickly territory. As this is my version, however, I’ve decided I don’t want anything to muddy the flavour or colour of the nuts I’ve just spent time peeling. So, inspired by Bachmann, who mentions using a neutral oil instead, I’ve replaced it with flavourless coconut oil:, as this is solid at room temperature, it’ll help keep the filling firm enough to slice. Up to you.The crunchKataifi, which looks like vermicelli, has a similar snappy texture to filo, but is made in strands that are perfect for soaking up syrup in dishes such asknafehandbaklava. If you have a specialist grocers nearby, they’ll probably have it in the fridge. Or you can buy it online, or even make it yourself, as Rama does – unless specifically noted otherwise, it’ll require toasting first to crisp it up. You could do this in a hot pan, as in the Kitchn’s recipe, but baking it, as Gill does, makes much more sense; not only does it cook more evenly without constant babysitting, but it can be done at the same temperature and therefore time as the pistachios. I have added butter to the baking tray, however, because, though not strictly necessary, it does taste nice.If you can’t find kataifi, Gill and Good Housekeeping both mention Shredded Wheat as a substitute, which makes sense given they’re both made from wheat and come in long thin strands. Not being a big consumer of breakfast cereal, however, it’s not until I open the packet that I realise even dry Shredded Wheat is more chewy than crunchy, which makes Bachmann’s cornflakes a better choice, despite the difference in flavour.The chocolateView image in fullscreenRama of the Indicious website tempers her chocolate before putting it in the mould.Everyone but Gill uses milk chocolate, in obedience to the original FIX bar. Oddly, though I think I’ll prefer her dark version, it does threaten to overpower the filling, so, if you go down that route, don’t go too high with the cocoa content.Only Rama tempers the chocolate – the process by which, after disrupting them with heat, you rearrange the crystals in a more orderly fashion than just allowing them to solidify haphazardly. I’ve included instructions below, though personally I wouldn’t bother, because all anyone is really interested in here is what’s inside the bar. You may consider it worthwhile. (It also has the benefit of keeping the bar firmer at room temperature, though if yours is melting in December in the UK, you’ve got the heating on too high.)It’s easier to decorate the top of the bar to disguise any imperfections; the Kitchn’s green-tinged white chocolate is the work of minutes, yet looks surprisingly impressive once set into the rest of the chocolate.The formView image in fullscreenGood Housekeeping’s take on Dubai chocolate comes in individual ball form; ‘Simple to make, even easier to eat.’Deep chocolate moulds are easily found in cookware shops and online, but if you don’t have one, or would prefer to give a box of chocolates rather than one oversized bar, Good Housekeeping have you covered with their little Dubai chocolate balls (see the end of the method, if you’re tempted by those). Simple to make, even easier to eat. Otherwise, you’ll need a 25cm x 13½cm x 2cm chocolate bar mould.Perfect Dubai chocolatePrep20 minCook1 hr(assuming you’re skinning the pistachios, which takes about 20 minutes)Set3 hr+Makes1 large bar, or 18 individual chocolates1 tbsp butter, or neutral coconut oil (optional)100g kataifi pastry, roughly chopped, or cornflakes, roughly crushed200g shelled raw pistachios20g white chocolate, chopped (optional)Green food colouring(optional)160g milk or dark chocolate2 tbsp neutral coconut oil, melted, or tahini35g milk powder20g icing sugar, or to tasteA pinch of salt20g shelled salted pistachios, peeled and roughly chopped (optional)25cm x 13½cm x 2cm chocolate bar mould(optional; see the final step if making individual filled chocolates)Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and, if using kataifi, melt the butter or oil on a shallow rimmed baking tray.Roughly chop the kataifi, toss it in the melted butter, then bake, stirring every 10 minutes so it colours evenly, for about 30 minutes, until golden.View image in fullscreenRemove and leave to cool.

Roughly chop the nuts.View image in fullscreenIf using white chocolate, melt it in a heatproof bowl set over but not touching a pan of simmering water, then stir in a couple of drops of green food colouring, if using (be sparing, because if you add too much, the chocolate will seize).View image in fullscreenSpoon or drizzle the white chocolate mix over the base of the chocolate bar mould, then put it in the fridge to set while you melt the remaining chocolate (put the mould on a board or baking tray to keep it level).Chop the milk or dark chocolate (a bread knife is useful here). If you’re tempering it, melt 110g of the chocolate as above, to 40-45C for milk and 46-48C for dark, then stir in the remaining 50g until melted. Cool to 26C for milk and 27C for dark, then heat back to 29C (milk) or 31C (dark) before use. (Alternatively, just melt all the chocolate at once.) Tip just enough of the melted chocolate into the mould thoroughly to coat the white chocolate base, then chill for about 30 minutes until set firm.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, whizz the chopped pistachios in a food processor or blender until they’re fairly finely ground and beginning to look slightly oily and to clump together, then add the coconut oil or tahini and whizz again to combine.

If using salted pistachios, roughly chop them, then stir in.View image in fullscreenOnce you’re ready to fill, stir the kataifi into the pistachio mixture until well combined, then spoon into the chocolate shell and level the top, leaving a small gap around the edge; run a butter knife around the edge to help do this.View image in fullscreenRe-warm the remaining melted chocolate, then pour it all over the top.

Dip the balls in chocolate to coat, then return to the fridge to set.

At home or in a restaurant? It’s at this juncture of the year, withChristmasdinner hurtling towards us, that you may well find yourself muttering: “Well, we could always go out!” Who could blame any home cook for wanting to shove this great burden on to someone else’s back, especially since every culinary TV show, magazine article and advertising break since mid-November has hammered home what a colossal faff Christmas dinner actually is. No, it’snotjust a slightly posh Sunday roast with a few more guests.Christmas dinner in the UK these days is more like a cross between dinner at Balmoral and 4 July at Mar-a-Lago. The table has to be heaving with holly-embossed crockery, the carrots must be bejewelled in star anise and Himalayan pink pepper, the turkey has to be brined in aromatic salt water and your roasties shaken in polenta and smothered in duck fat. If you’re the designated martyr organising proceedings, field-marshalling everything and cooking this tinsel-strewn palaver, it is common to try instead to divert it all to the local pub, where they’re doing “turkey and all the trimmings” for £79 a head (and including a cracker and a pre-dinner “glass of something sparkly”).After several attempts at spending Christmas “out”, however, I’m still on the fence as to whether or not it’s really worth it. Chances are, if you’re the designated cook, as I often am, you’ll also find yourself equally burdened as the designated table-finder, taxi-booker and exasperated berk trying to get Aunt Agnes up to the Queen’s Head by 3pm, mainly because she won’t on any account miss the king’s speech, won’t eat turkey without bread sauce and would ideally like herJim Reevescassette played over the pub’s sound system.Agnes’ demands will be paltry compared with those of your vegan cousin, however, or your father with Alzheimer’s who may or may not keep his trousers on for the entire meal, and, of course, the teenager in the family, who will go missing on Christmas Eve and slink in the next day at 7pm with a love bite and hot rock burns down their Christmas jumper.I once paid the same price as a holiday in the Algarve for a two-person Christmas Day lunch at a fancy five-star hotelTen years ago, I shepherded the Dent flock to a local pub in the Lake District for a twinkly table beside a log fire, where a traditional big bird and figgy pudding-type menu was served. The cooking was passable – soggy parsnips, dry turkey, over-sweet cranberry and a drought of gravy delivered in stingy jugs – and the service was just about sanguine, bearing in mind that not one hospitality person in history has ever truly wanted to work on the 25th. Perhaps that’s the rub with Christmas dinner service: anyone working clearly drew the short straw.One year, I paid the same price as a short holiday in the Algarve for a two-person Christmas Day lunch at a fancy five-star London hotel. The dining room was classily decked out in twinkly lights, all gold and bronze, and there was nothing so naff as a Christmas tree, of course, but rather posh, frankincense room fragrance and crackers that cracked expensively, didn’t have jokes but did have posh prizes such as silk scarves inside. The room was filled with unhappily married trophy wives, all plodding their way through turkey ballotine with fragments of cranberry sap – just one of 11 courses – and they kept us there for so long that the meal started eating into Twixmas. When we left, London was in a huge traffic jam , because thousands of people had driven in to see the lights, and I spent Christmas evening in a gridlock on the Holloway Road, instead of eating aPaxosandwich while lying horizontal and watchingThe Vicar of Dibley.This year, meanwhile, I have already made two reservations for Christmas dinner and cancelled them both. That’s mainly because I can’t quite commit to taking Charles out to our local bistro for the annual blowout, despite being exhausted after filming MasterChef right up to the wire, because, well, I know that, by that stage of the festive delirium, there will be nowhere quite like home.The truth is, despite moaning about cooking Christmas dinner and the raggle-taggle bunch of family and friends who will inevitably appear with demands for a beef option because they don’t like turkey, vegan roasties and something chocolatey and stacked high with gold leaf because they don’t eat Christmas pudding, well, it turns out that I actually quite enjoy the kitchen carnage. It’s a rare moment, when the plates go down and 10 dirty pans are coped with all at once, that I feel like a grown-up, and that I’m doing something my mother, if she could see me, would be proud of – not least because I am carrying on the long line of angry matriarchs who, despite the odds, got Christmas done. You can let someone in a white hat take the strain with your sprouts and spare your angry tears, but where’s the fun in that?Explore more on these topicsFoodGrace Dent on restaurantsRestaurantsChristmasChristmas food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
