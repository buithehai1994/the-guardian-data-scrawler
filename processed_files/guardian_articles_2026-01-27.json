We used to have a name for thisMarina HydeTruly, I am the country’s biggest fan. But in the spirit of free speech its leaders apparently love, here’s a few things the rest of the world needs them to knowTue 27 Jan 2026 08.43 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareWe in the rest of the world have had to hear a lot –sucha lot – about what this US government and its hardcore fanbase thinks about us. So you know they’ll be super-relaxed and free-speechy about hearing some thoughts about how they look from the outside. Let’s use last Saturday as a single snapshot. In Minneapolis, they had the shooting by ICE agents of a protesting nurse who posed no threat – an event promptly, provably and blatantly lied about at the highest level by Donald Trump’s politburo. Then that evening in Washington, a lot of those same politburocratsturned out for the White House premiereof a ridiculous propaganda film about the president’s wife, also attended fawningly by bloodless Apple oligarch Tim Cook. And he’s not even the oligarch who paid an insane amount for the film. Top line, guys: all this makes you look like what your president likes to call a “shithole country”. Sorry! I assume it’s fine to use officially licensed vocabulary?Obviously, it’s not a proper shithole country until the soft-skinned puppetmasters in the presidential palace cut some grizzled local warlord off at the knees for following orders, so it’s good to learn overnight that border patrol “commander at large” Gregory Bovino has beenpulled out of Minneapolis, possibly locked out of his social media accounts, and may soon “retire”, presumably a fall guy for the likes of stage 4 homeland security tumour Stephen Miller. Bovino’s the guy who’s literally got the same haircut and outfit as the Sean Penn character in One Battle After Another. But hey, at least he wears a uniform. Again, what are international outsiders to make of the spectacle of ICE’s federal officers coming masked and frequently dressed in civilian clothes, while images from protests across the States show resisting civilians increasingly drawn to military-style clothing? Can Trump’s storm detachment not at least be issued with matching shirts? They don’t have to be brown, but Maga chic desperately needs to make even a first step to getting itself together. In the entire history of the movement, only one follower –the QAnon shaman– has ever had true style.With death threats being the sign of a deeply articulate and sophisticated political culture, I have cleared my inbox to make space for them. But I should say I have always truly loved America. I’ve visited 38 of its great states in my time, and always dreamed of completing the set, but … not currently, let’s be honest. I note US tourism is currentlyexperiencing a downturnin visitors from previously enthusiastic markets. Who among us can imagine why? Still, no doubt numbers from Nato countries in Europe will rally if Trump (a five-time draft dodger) continues topiss on their military graves. Reminder: Nato has activated its collective defence clause precisely once since its inception – at the request of the United States, in the wake of 9/11. Our troops fought and died in all their stoopid wars – but now, apparently, we have to listen to Trump’s whiny little rants about how nobody really put themselves on the line.Anyway, back to the events of Saturday and their fallout. Hard to pick the most mindboggling reaction to the shooting of Alex Pretti, who never produced the gun he was carrying, for which he had a licence, before it was taken off him. But there’s a strong argument for going for the statement from the National Rifle Association, which reacted to all the Maga zealots saying Pretti was always likely to have been shot for legally carrying a gun he had a licence for bythundering backthat carrying a licensed gun is famously constitutionally allowed, and calling for a full investigation into the killing. Maybe Trump’s base are now more rightwing than the NRA? Or more leftwing, I can’t tell. Are Maga now too woke on gun control for the NRA? Such are the sentences one can end up typing when we’re this far through the looking-glass.Speaking of the political upside-down, Saturday’s other notable event was the Melania premiere at the White House, which, though flowing with champagne, was in some ways as grotesquely down and dirty as the scenes in Minneapolis. Consider the guests, which included the usual regime stalwarts but also, intriguingly, Tim Cook. Days before, Cook had been posting on one of the other oligarchs’ platforms about Martin Luther King’s “commitment to justice”, only to watch videos of Pretti’s execution proliferate across that same platform, but still pop on his bow tie and toddle off toclink glassesat the premiere. Melania is the forthcoming “documentary” about the president’s wife, for which she serves as executive producer and has been paid an unspecified sum, while the entire thing has been bought by Jeff Bezos’s Amazon for $40m (£30m) – a sum so staggeringly beyond whatsuch a film should cost, by so many orders of magnitude, that it can only be read as a naked gift to the regime. A further $35m has been spent on marketing for its preposterous theatrical release.But I guess that as the OGs in Russia have shown us, oligarchs have to take their turn to do expensive things, just so they can stay in the gang. At least they’re getting something out of it. Much more tragic are the ordinary-folks footsoldiers dutifully coming out to defend the ICE shooting. I can barely think of anything more beaten than spending the day typing variations on the theme of “it is good that law enforcement officers in my country shoot civilians who are no threat”. What a bunch of bootlickers. They might be too far gone to see it, but much of the rest of the world can.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionTrump administrationUS politicsMinneapolisTim CookMinnesota ICE shootingscommentShareReuse this content"

Probably not. Even if there had been, it almost certainly didn’t mean all that much. But that’s the way of the modern game: an extremely protracted clearing of the throat before the real business begins.Uefa will proudly tell the world that only six teams have nothing to play for in the final round of games on Wednesday, but whether it was worth 126 games to get to the mild peril of Napoli or Club Brugge possibly going out, or the questionable thrill of finding out whetherTottenhamor Atalanta will have to endure the playoff round, is debatable.That the reward for finishing in the top eight is not to have to play two further games is itself telling, an admission that there is too much football and that having to play a couple of extra games is now regarded not as a revenue-raising exercise but as an imposition.Champions League permutations: who needs what from final night of fixtures?Read moreAs tournaments have expanded and proliferated, so fatigue has become a defining force. It perhaps explains why, as Tariq Panja observed this week on the Libero podcast, only Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain of the game’s elite seem better now than they were five years ago. And it probably explains why Premier League teams are so dominant at this stage of the Champions League but win it relatively rarely.One image perhaps stands out from the group stage, which is that ofMicky van de Ven running the length of the fieldto score Tottenham’s third goal in their 4‑0 win against Copenhagen in November, opponents hanging off him like Lilliputians trying to bring down Gulliver. That was an extreme case, but there were plenty of examples across the group stage of Premier League sides bullying physically smaller European opponents: Newcastle did it to Athletic, Arsenal did it to Atlético, Liverpool did it to Real Madrid and Chelsea did it to Barcelona.To an extent, of course, that’s been true for at least 20 years, a reinvocation of the late 70s and early 80s, but with the advent of Long-Throw Britain, as English football has moved away from the Guardiola paradigm, it has become especially pronounced. Because Premier League clubs, en masse, are so much wealthier than the rest of Europe, they can buy the best players for their preferred model of play. That’s why, heading into this final round of games, there are six Premier League teams in the top 11, with onlyManchester City outside the top eightwho will skip the punishment round.View image in fullscreenLiverpool topped the group stage last season but lost to Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAGiven that level of domination, though, why have English clubs won only three of the past 10 Champions Leagues? A clue is perhaps offered by the experience of Italian clubs in the 90s, when Serie A was the dominant league in Europe. The situation was slightly different in that, barring the European champions, leagues were limited to a single participant until 1996-97, but between 1992 and 1998 there was an Italian team in the final every season.Only twoof them won.In part, of course, that’s the nature of knockout competition. There is a degree of randomness. But perhaps it was also the case that, come the final in May, the Italian team had been wearied by the exertions of the Serie A season in the way that, say, Ajax or Borussia Dortmund had not been by a season in the Eredivisie or the Bundesliga. That’s the issue English clubs now face.It was striking last week how straightforward Spurs found their Champions League game against Dortmund compared with the Premier League matches against West Ham and Burnley that fell either side of it.On the one hand there’s something viscerally thrilling about Djed Spence, pressed into service as a winger, tearing past Yan Couto every time he got the ball, but on the other it doesn’t feel quite right.A lower mid-table Premier League side shouldn’t be able to treat the second-best team in Germany like a sixth-former playing against third‑years. Which is not to say that Dortmund in the Premier League would be in danger of relegation, rather that the expansive way of playing that works for them at home leaves them horribly vulnerable to the intensity of even a struggling English side.When the quarter‑finals are played in April, though, Premier League teams are exhausted from a season of playing against other Premier League teams. That makes them vulnerable against the very best of the rest of Europe. It was notable that in the most recent Deloitte Football Money League, released last week, although there were six Premier League teams in the top 10, none of them is in the top four.Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain are able to compete financially with the best of the Premier League and by the business end of the Champions League, they have a significant advantage of freshness. That perhaps explains why last season Arsenal beat PSG comfortably in the group stage, but thenlost against them in the semi-finals.That example, of course, only underlines the futility of this stage of the Champions League. So long as a team get through, the group stage means very little.Liverpool didn’t benefitfrom topping the league last season, and it didn’t harm PSG that they finished 15th. All of this is essentially filler until we get to the real business of Euro giants against exhausted English clubs in the quarter-finals.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

First, know your constituency boundaries. Sometimes easier said than done. On Tuesday morning,Lee Andersonwas to be found doing a photo op for the Gorton and Denton byelection by posing outside the Stanley hotel. Which just happens to be in Angela Rayner’s constituency. Shame that someone pointed out Anderson’s mistake. He could happily have spent the next four weeks knocking on the wrong doors.Not that Lee was in any way apologetic. He quickly tweeted that the photo he had posted clearly showed he was in the right place. Go figure. Maybe it was just the camera that moved. In any case, Reform are happy bunnies these days. Thrilled with the defections ofNadhim Zahawi,Robert Jenrick,Suella Bravermanand … er,Andrew Rosindell. It’s almost as if they have no quality control. All failed Tories. They also can’t believe their luck that Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham arelocked in a death spiral. A three-way marginal seat had just become a whole lot more winnable.All that was left was to announce the Reform candidate. Which is why Anderson could be found in a Denton bistro just after lunch. This was one of Lee’s first solo gigs. Normally he is only allowed out under the supervision of Nigel Farage, Richard Tice or Zia Yusuf. Maybe discretion was the better sense of valour. The last thing the residents of Gorton and Denton wanted was to be told what was good for them by someone up for the day from London.Lee walked to the microphone and started talking. He had been the very first Reform MP. It had been lonely on the opposition benches, squeezed in between George Galloway and Jeremy Corbyn. But things were soon on the up. Come the general election there were five MPs. Though no one in Reform mentions Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock any more. Then there wasthe byelection win. Who could have guessed that what Runcorn really wanted was a woman inSarah Pochinwho can’t handle seeing too many black and brown faces in the same place. Now Reform are eight along with the recent defections.What Gorton and Denton really needed was a local man, said Lee. Nadhim’s pitch to the area, that you can pay what you want to HMRC, was too much even for Nige. Though he did sympathise. Sadly, though, Reform didn’t have any local people who were suitable. So this part of GreaterManchesterwas going to have to do with someone who had lived there a while ago. Someone who had left his job at the University of Kent and retreated to London to be a media gobshite for GB News. Step forward, Matt Goodwin.The first reaction from most journalists was that Reform must be having a laugh. In a constituency where nearly half the population identify as coming from an ethnic minority, Nige had decided to stand arguably the most openly racist adjacent candidate they could find. On occasions he has even gone too far for Reform and it had seemed as if they were trying to sideline him away from the main action. The family embarrassment. But no. He was considered to be safe in the streets. Fine to say that being born and brought up in the UKdid not meanthat people from immigrant backgrounds were always British. That should go down a storm with Nadhim and Suella.It also must be said that Matt is a committed conspiracy theorist. There is no rabbit hole he won’t go down, no audience that is too far-right for him not to give a speech. He was last seen on the utterly dysfunctionalLiz Truss Show, her YouTube channel where she talks to people as mad as her about her pet theories. To be on her show is the nadir of anyone’s career. Just desperadoes. And a fantasist as well. Goodwin still tries to pretend he attended Donald Trump’s inauguration last year. He flew to Washington to watch it on TV. Living the far-right dream.Matt desperately wanted to shore things up. He was the right man for the job, he insisted. He didn’t know why. Just that he was. It wasn’t that he hated all immigrants. It was more that he couldn’t exactly explain which ones he did like. Given that almost all immigrants were doing something wrong, it was reasonable to think that most black and brown faces were crims. And even if they weren’t, you would be doing them and the country a favour by locking them up as it would prevent them from turning into one of Keir Starmer’s team of pet rapists. Win-win.I am one of you, he said. He wasn’t a member of the Westminster blob. He wasn’t a career politician. This got to Matt’s inner sadness. Because in reality he is part of the elite. Making his money by seemingly grifting racism and division as he was rejected by academia for being an unserious university lecturer. He longed for the acclaim of his erstwhile peers and only got derision and rejection. Matt has nothing to offer but hatred. If Matt does get elected, his constituents won’t see him for dust.There is an emptiness to Matt that borders on the pathetic. He is a man incapable of empathy. This next adventure was all about him. You get the impression that he doesn’t much like other people. Prefers his own solipsistic company. Has yet to find any side of an argument in which he is wrong. His would-be constituents are just satellites of his ego. Go through the motions of looking as though he cares. There again, Gorton and Denton’s last MP didn’t like his constituents either. Andrew Gwynne sent messages in which he hoped that a 72-year-old woman would croak and a cycling campaigner would get mown down by a bus. So perhaps Reform are on to something.Come the questions and Goodwin was soon out of his depth. He was the right man to become the MP because Matt was always the right man for everything. His ecosystem just gets smaller and smaller. A couple of local reporters asked him what he would do to make the constituency better. Matt hadn’t a clue. He hadn’t been to this part of Manchester for years. Until today. If you tipped him out of the bistro he would have no idea where he was. All he could say was that anything that was good for him would be good for Gorton and Denton.Sensing that Matt was dying on his feet, Lee decided to wrap things up early before all journalists got to ask their questions. An act of damage limitation. Time to get Matt outdoors, where he was easier to control. Now to try to find the constituency.Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe politics sketchLee AndersonByelectionsManchestercommentShareReuse this content"

The man pulls his partner towards him but she spins away, landing face to face with another woman. Now the two women dance and everything is different: bright and playful as their eyes meet. It ends in a clinch behind a bookcase. The great love is not between the woman, Mariana, and her husband, but between Mariana and Anne Lister, also known as Gentleman Jack.I’m watching this play out in a rehearsal room at Northern Ballet in Leeds, where choreographerAnnabelle Lopez Ochoais in the midst of creating a ballet version of Gentleman Jack, as popularised inSally Wainwright’s hit TV series(Wainwright is a consultant on the ballet). Lister was a 19th-century landowner running her family’s estate in Halifax, but is better known for the diaries that revealed her passionate lesbian love affairs and for boldly living an unconventional life for the times.The teacher turned around and said to me: ‘You with your big mouth – you’re gonna get into trouble’Lopez Ochoa, who is Belgian-Colombian and lives in Amsterdam, had never heard of Lister when the ballet was proposed to her, but after binge-watching the series she said yes. “The woman, I mean, she’s a force!” says Lopez Ochoa. “She is audacious. She is in her power. She’s unafraid, inspiring. There is a little bit of edge to her. She’s not very kind, she’s not a hero – but that’s what makes her interesting.”The ballet focuses on the two most important women in Lister’s life. Mariana Lawton was Lister’s great love across 20 years, but she followed convention (and financial security) and married a man. Later came Ann Walker – she and Lister took holy communion together, in an act of commitment before God they considered a “marriage”, and lived together until Lister’s death in 1840.View image in fullscreen‘She used her brains to get what she wanted’ … Suranne Jones in the TV version of Gentleman Jack.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyWhat Lopez Ochoa appreciates about Lister is her smarts: “How she behaved around men to get what she wanted. She really used her brains. This I could relate to, in this male-dominated choreographic world, where I had always the feeling that I had to prove myself.”Lopez Ochoa could also relate to not being “conventionally” feminine. As a child, she would wear her brothers’ clothes, and people often thought she was a boy. “The kids of the neighbourhood were trying to feel my crotch to check,” she says. “So I was sent to ballet – because I did not behave nor look like a girl.” You can see in photos, she says, how after two years of dancing her body had changed. “The physiognomy of my face, everything – I looked more feminine.” She lifts her chin in a balletic pose.Lopez Ochoa didn’t lose her assertiveness, though, and nor did people stop telling her to change. She remembers being 17, in a ballet class, and saying out loud that the choreography was uncomfortable. “The teacher turned around and said, ‘You with your big mouth, you’re gonna get into trouble.’” But Lopez Ochoa got into choreography instead. “Nothing can really change you,” she says. “I’m still the tomboy. I just don’t look like it. But your thought process stays the same.”Over the last two decades, she has created more than 100 dances for companies around the world, including ballets based on the lives ofFrida Kahlo, Coco Chanel and Eva Perón, so she knows about making portraits of strong and complicated women. In terms of creating Lister through dance, Lopez Ochoa says it came step by step as they developed the work, rather than being decided in advance. The dancers cast in the lead role (Gemma Coutts, Amber Lewis and Nida Aydinoğlu) are women who “dared to take up the space”, says Lopez Ochoa. “They were fearless, and not afraid of being ‘ugly’ in classical ballet terms.”View image in fullscreenNo pointes … Annabelle Lopez Ochoa in rehearsals.Photograph: Colleen MairIn the same way that the real Lister wore men’s clothes, the dancer playing Lister will wear flat shoes rather than pointes (except for in the communion scene), which means she can be more grounded when partnering the other women. The women can’t do the same big lifts a man would, so they’re having to work out other ways to create climactic moments.Romantic female pas de deux are a rarity in ballet and Lopez Ochoa is aiming to avoid cliche, including the acrobatic splits you often see in passionate duets. “It’s just going to be different, curvier, more sinuous,” she says. Do they kiss? Not yet, she says, there are movements to express love better, but perhaps after the “wedding” scene. Are the dancers cool with it? “Yeah, I thought they were going to be much more reserved,” she says, “but I came here last year to workshop with them and they were like, ‘Let’s get raunchy!’”The TV series has an ardent fanbase. It has even beenlife-changing for some womenwho’ve realised – or made peace with – their own sexuality after hearing Lister’s story. Lopez Ochoa hopes the same thing could be true for ballet, where there are many out gay men but, for example, a lesbian dancer Lopez Ochoa knows still feels she can’t widely come out. “When I told her I was doing Gentleman Jack as a ballet,” says Lopez Ochoa, “she was bawling.”Gentleman Jack is atLeeds Grand theatre, 7-14 March; thentouringExplore more on these topicsDanceBalletNorthern BalletSally WainwrightTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In January last year, the MP for Fareham and Waterlooville visited the pub, offered to help the owners with removing a protected tree that was damaging the property, and posted photos with the staff on her Facebook page and for local media.Jewell has not heard back from her since. “I’ve sent emails saying ‘we need support here’ and never received a response. Not even an acknowledgment,” Jewell said.At a Reform UK event in London this week, Braverman made a surprise appearance andannounced her defectionfrom the Conservative party. “I feel as if I’ve come home,” she told the audience.Jewell said he had no interest in Braverman’s future endeavours. “I don’t want her in my pub. She’s not helped us at all,” he said.View image in fullscreenJamie Jewell at the Golden Lion in Fareham town centre.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianBraverman, who was Rishi Sunak’s home secretary from 2022-23 and gained a reputation as an opportunistic political operator with a keen sense of how to get traction on the right, has been the MP here since 2015.Fareham is a market town north-west of Portsmouth harbour, inHampshire. The constituency has been a Conservative stronghold since its creation in 1885. It was reformed into Gosport and Fareham in 1950, and again into Fareham and Waterlooville in 2024, when Braverman last won her seat.Roy Gillingham, the owner of Fareham Wine Cellar, said he was “not surprised at all” by Braverman’s decision. “She’s very much more in tune with what Reform is doing.” He said Braverman regularly bought wine from his business for Conservative party meetings. “She stands good and hard for local people. That’s more important than what party she belongs to.”View image in fullscreen‘She stands good and hard for local people,’ says wine seller Roy Gillingham.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianHe voted for Braverman in 2024 and would do so again. “The fact she’s gone over to Reform makes no difference. She’s still the same person. We can all change. I might vote Labour next time, I might vote Conservative. You vote for the person,” Gillingham said.Elsewhere in Fareham, reaction to the defection was mixed. Graham Cull, 68, has always voted Conservative and was disappointed by Braverman’s choice, but he said: “I can understand why she’s doing it. TheConservativesare in disarray at the moment.”Sue Cox, 70, said it was “quite alarming”. She believed Braverman had made a “gut reaction” due to her unhappiness with the Conservative party. “But is the alternative the right alternative?” she said. “That is the biggest worry, if you vote somebody in who’s an unknown. And let’s face it, Nigel Farage changes his tune like the weather, doesn’t he?”View image in fullscreenSue and Mick Cox in the town centre.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianPaul Holmes, a neighbouring Conservative MP to Braverman’s constituency, said his working relationship with Braverman had faded since the 2017 general election. After her defection, “I wouldn’t pick up the phone to Suella,” he said. “She hadn’t told any of her colleagues, her staff, her constituency association, which I think is highly disrespectful and discourteous.”Holmes said he had received several messages from constituents asking him not to switch to Reform as well. “We’ve had a couple of new party members since Suella left, stating they didn’t like the politics of Suella.”In a statement, the local council leader, Simon Martin, said the defection was “understandably disappointing, especially after very recently providing assurances to me that this would not happen”. He said: “We feel let down not only with the defection, but also that no prior indication was given to the Conservative group of her intentions. This lack of consideration particularly hurts the many team members who canvassed on her behalf as a Conservative.”Manuel Martins, the chair of the Fareham and Waterlooville Conservative association, said the move had come as “both a surprise and a huge disappointment” because of “assurances and recent reassurances” from Braverman.View image in fullscreenDave Acheson: ‘There should be another byelection.’Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianDave Acheson, 37, does not vote Conservative. When he saw the news on Bluesky, he said, he found the move “nakedly self-interested” and predictable. “I just thought it’s another rat leaving the sinking ship. Let’s hope she’s going to another sinking ship.”He added: “I despise her and everything she stands for, and the way she uses demonisation to get ahead in politics. I just think it’s sickening.” He believed Braverman should have stepped down as MP after switching loyalties. “There should be a rule that says if you change parties, there should be another byelection.”His brother Michael chimed in: “Churchill famously switched parties and had to stand for a byelection. So there’s historical precedent.”“Suella Braverman is no Churchill,” Dave replied.Explore more on these topicsSuella BravermanReform UKConservativesLocal politicsHampshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He will meet China’s president, Xi Jinping, and the premier, Li Qiang, in Beijing on Thursday for talks.Starmer has faced criticism at home for pursuing a thaw in relations with China while the country remains a national security threat to the UK, with a decision to greenlight a newmega-embassyin London last week angering opposition politicians.China has also been accused of trying torecruit informants in parliament,harass Hong Kong pro-democracy activistsin the UK, suppress criticismby an academic at a British university, andengage in cyber-attacks.Downing Street said Starmer would maintain “guardrails” on national security, while discussing economic ties with China’s leaders. But they said he would not trade one for the other, and would raise areas of disagreement, including human rights abuses.The prime minister has argued the UK cannot afford to ignore the economic opportunities presented by China – the world’s second largest economy and the UK’s third largest trading partner, supporting 370,000 British jobs.As he becomes the first UK leader in eight years to visit Beijing, he promised to take a more pragmatic stance. “For years, our approach to China has been dogged by inconsistency, blowing hot and cold, from golden age to ice age. But like it or not, China matters for the UK,” he said.“As one of the world’s biggest economic players, a strategic and consistent relationship with them is firmly in our national interest. That does not mean turning a blind eye to the challenges they pose – but engaging even where we disagree.”The Conservatives have said that Starmer should not be travelling to China. The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, said: “The evidence is overwhelming that China poses a serious threat to our national security and it is clear Keir Starmer is going to China without any leverage. He lacks the backbone to stand up for Britain and is bending over backwards to appease Beijing.“Starmer has already surrendered to the CCP [Chinese Communist party] over their plan for a spy-hub super-embassy in the heart of our capital, and agreed to hand over British sovereign territory and £35bn of taxpayers’ money to an ally of China with his Chagos deal.“Britain cannot afford for him to make any more concessions, or for him to stay silent on China’s repression of dissidents like Jimmy Lai or the CCP’s attempts to undermine our democracy.”But a No 10 source said: “Sticking our heads in the sand and refusing to engage would be a staggering dereliction of duty. It would make the British people less safe, cut us off from opportunities, and weaken our ability to manage global challenges in areas like health and climate.”They pointed out that Trump met Xi in October and planned to visit China in April. Since early 2018, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has visited China three times while German leaders have visited four times but during the same period no British prime minister has visited China.Starmer will be accompanied on the three-day visit to Beijing and Shanghai by a delegation of about 60 British businesses and cultural organisations, including HSBC, GSK, Jaguar Land Rover and the National Theatre.The business secretary, Peter Kyle, who will also be on the trip, said: “For a decade, there has been a lack of serious engagement needed to capitalise on the opportunity of a better relationship with China.“We want to see trade flourish between us. From financial services to advanced manufacturing and the global energy transition, the UK’s strengths increasingly align with the rapidly evolving Chinese economy.“The first duty of government is security, and we protect ourselves best through active engagement and pragmatic cooperation, not by shutting the door.”After his trip to China, Starmer will travel to Tokyo to meet the Japanese prime minister, Sanae Takaichi.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerChinaTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

He just doesn’t know why… | John CraceRead moreGoodwin refused to answer the Guardian’s questions as he posed for photographs alongside the Reform MP Lee Anderson at a bar in Denton.Anderson, the Reform chief whip, described Goodwin as a “fearless” activist who would “debate anybody at any time”.Lucy Powell, Labour’s deputy leader, said Goodwin’s politics sought to “drive a wedge between communities in Manchester” and that Reform offered “division, animosity and hatred – not the unity and pride which our city stands for”.The Green party leader, Zack Polanski, alleged that Goodwin had “a track record of anti-Muslim bigotry” and that his candidacy was an insult to constituents.Polanski, whose party is the bookies’ favourite to win, has characterised the byelection as a fight between Reform and the Greens.On a rally on Tuesday evening he described the contest as “a battle for the soul of our country”.Referring to recent defections to Reform by Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman, he said: “Reform is a party pretending to be anti-establishment that’s made up of former Conservative cabinet members. They’re just the worst bits of the Tories rebranded.”Reform is trying to overturn Labour’s 13,000-vote majority and gain its ninth MP, after thedefectionof the former Conservative home secretary Suella Braverman on Monday.View image in fullscreenGreen party leader Zack Polanski at a rally  in support of the party’s Gorton and Denton byelection campaign.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe Green party is also challengingstrongly for the seat, which has a significant left-voting population and whose voters sent a Labour MP to Westminster for decades before the boundary changes in 2024.Goodwin’s selection as the Reform candidate has surprised some commentators, given his outspoken views on British nationality and Islam.Only three weeks ago, he wrote that Britain’s “ruling class” was “silencing” debate about Islam in “one of the most serious assaults on free speech and free expression Britain has ever seen”. More than one in four voters in Gorton and Denton identify as Muslim.Asked for his message to the thousands of minority ethnic voters in the constituency, Goodwin told reporters: “My message to everybody in this seat is [that] if you are working hard, paying taxes, contributing to this economy, you should be as concerned by what’s happening in No 10 Downing Street as I am.“We have got a government under Keir Starmer that is clearly not in touch with the people in this seat. It’s not about what your religion is, it’s not about what your race is, what your ethnicity is.“It’s about whether or not you play by the rules, whether or not you feel that you’re being respected, you feel the system is being fair to you … I don’t view it in those divisive terms. I think lots of people in this seat are going to be saying we’ve had the [Labour] party in this constituency for all of our lives and what’s changed?”Anderson, a former Conservative MP, said Reform would focus its byelection campaign on crime, the decline of the high street, and houses of multiple occupancy – which he claimed were home to “upwards of four or five single young men, creating all sorts of mayhem, committing crimes, terrorising neighbourhoods”.Goodwin and Anderson referred several times in the 30-minute press conference to the issue of child grooming gangs, an issue that is most potent in nearby Rochdale and Oldham council areas.Goodwin described Reform’s lead in the polls as “the most significant insurgency since the rise of the Labour party 100 years ago when it replaced the Liberals. This is a seismic political revolution that we’re all living through.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKByelectionsRaceGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Surgery for cruciate ligament disease – a common procedure for dogs – can cost up to £5,000, and occasionally more.The CMA has been investigating the sector since 2024 andpublished its provisional findingsand remedies in October, with its final report due in February or March this year. The Defra announcement suggests ministers are keen to move swiftly, with many of the government proposals the same or similar to those put forward by the markets watchdog.Under the Defra plans, vet businesses will have to disclose who owns them so pet owners know if their local practice is part of a larger chain or is independent. It said this would increase competition and bring down costs over time.Meanwhile, every vet practice will need an official operating licence – similar to GP surgeries and care homes – and there are plans for an easier and more effective route for customers to raise concerns and complaints.Other proposals include introducing regulatory oversight for veterinary businesses, not just individual vets, and updating the processes for vet registration and “fitness to practise”.Specific measures proposed by the CMA in October included capping the cost of providing prescriptions at £16, prices in writing for treatments costing more than £500, and pricing breakdowns for pet care plans in an attempt to improve value for money. It also proposed creating a comprehensive price comparison website.Martin Coleman, the chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: “We welcome the government’s consultation … Our vets investigation is ongoing, but we have already set out our strong concern that the current rules are not fit for purpose.”Defra said clearer pricing “will help pet owners compare costs and shop around, saving families money”. Some of the measures will involve updating the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 “when parliamentary time allows”.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsPetsCompetition and Markets AuthoritynewsShareReuse this content"

The change also affects YouPorn and RedTube, explicit websites operated by the same Cyprus-based company, Aylo.The move comes after Pornhub said in October that its traffic was down 77% in the UK since July, when the age checks came in and began to be enforced by Ofcom, the communications regulator.In a statement, the company said that it would “no longer participate in the failed system” created as a result of the OSA.Alex Kekesi, vice-president of brand and community for Aylo, said: “Our sites, which host legal and regulated porn, will no longer be available in the UK to new users, but thousands of irresponsible porn sites will still be easy to access.”She added: “We believe this framework in practice has diverted traffic to darker, unregulated corners of the internet, and has also jeopardised the privacy and personal data of UK citizens.”Pornhub remains the most popular porn site in the UK, according to the web traffic analyst SimilarWeb. Last month, Ofcom said visitor numbers to Pornhub in August were 9.8 million, a decline of 1.5 million compared with the same period in 2024, but the fall appears to have continued since.Meanwhile, use of specialist software, such as VPNs, to dodge viewing restrictions has increased. VPN usage more than doubled in the wake of age checking being introduced, rising from 650,000 users to a peak of more than 1.4 million in mid-August and falling back to 900,000 in December.The OSA, which came into effect in July 2025, requires pornography providers to carry out “highly effective” age checks to protect children from accessing explicit videos. These checks can be made through facial age estimation technology, credit card checks or other methods.But Kekesi said Pornhub’s data and experience suggested that effective enforcement of the OSA “is not possible, circumvention is rampant, privacy is compromised, and new, unregulated sites quickly fill any gaps left by responsible operators.”He said: “Users are turning to sites that do not have uploader verification measures and do not moderate content, leading to an increased risk of exposure to dangerous or illegal content.”An Ofcom spokesperson said: “Porn services have a choice between using age checks to protect users as required under the Act, or to block access to their sites in the UK. There’s nothing to stop technology providers from developing solutions which work at the device level, and we would urge the industry to get on with that if they can evidence it is highly effective.”The regulator said its job was to enforce the rules as they stand and its age assurance rules were flexible, proportionate and resulted in widespread adoption.As of this week, 68 of the top 100 pornography services in the UK have deployed age checks.“We’ve taken strong and swift action against non-compliance, launching investigations into more than 80 porn sites and fining a porn provider £1m, with more to come,” the spokesperson said. “We will continue our dialogue with Aylo to understand this change to its position.”Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyPornographynewsShareReuse this content"

Who do you think you are?”The official day of remembrance of Soviet troops’ liberation of the few surviving prisoners of Auschwitz in 1945 from the clutches of their Nazi German captors is 27 January. It was declared the official German day of remembrance in 1996, and officially adopted by the United Nations in 2005.At the Auschwitz memorial site 24 former prisoners braved freezing temperatures to lay wreaths at the “death wall” where German soldiers killed mainly Polish political prisoners. Polish president Karol Nawrocki later joined survivors for a ceremony at nearby Birkenau, the huge site to which Jews from across Europe were transported to be murdered in gas chambers.View image in fullscreenCandles were placed at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin.Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/ReutersAbout 1.1 million Jews were murdered at Auschwitz alone, as well as Poles, Roma and others, including people persecuted for their religious or sexual orientation.At the snow-covered Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in central Berlin, a sea of grey concrete blocks built as an indelible symbol of Germany’s contrition, candles were lit and white roses laid on the slabs.Elsewhere events were held at museums, schools and railway stations across the country while informal gatherings took place in towns and cities across Europe at Stolpersteine, small brass plaques cemented into pavements marking former residences of Jews who were deported to concentration camps. Present-day inhabitants laid candles and flowers on them.In Terezín, site of the former Nazi concentration camp Theresienstadt in the Czech Republic, where thousands of Jews were collected and died or were sent from there to Auschwitz and other death camps, a candlelit procession was due to take place on Thursday evening.The Netherlands marked its national Holocaust memorial day on Sunday with a silent procession through Amsterdam’s Jewish quarter.In Ireland, the government announced more funding for Holocaust education in schools after a survey found 15% of young people had never heard of it and 10% of those aged between 18 and 29 thought it was a “myth”.An estimated 196,600 Jewish survivors are believed to still be alive globally, compared to the 220,000 estimated to have been alive a year ago, according to the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.View image in fullscreenHolocaust survivor Tova Friedman.Photograph: Markus Lenhardt/dpaFriedman,who is due to address the Bundestag on Wednesday, was five when she and her mother were deported from their home in Gdynia near Gdansk inPoland, to Auschwitz-Birkenau. She likely survived due to a technical malfunction of the gas chambers and, during death marches in January 1945, hid among corpses.“I represent one and a half million children who were murdered and who are not here to speak for themselves,” Friedman told German media. “My story is representative of all their stories because we all had similar experiences. I was simply luckier than them, because I survived.”Together with her grandson, Aron Goodman, 20, who also accompanied her to Berlin, Friedman has a TikTok account called “TovaTok”, in which the two talk about her experience and warn against the growth of antisemitism.Goodman is one of a growing number of surviving relatives choosing to take on the vital task of telling the stories of their parents and grandparents.Friedman, who emigrated to the US where she became a successful therapist, warned against the rise of the populist far-right in Europe. She said she would directly address the AfD, which is up for election in five states this year and is predicted to do well in at least three of them.The anti-immigrant party, which backs policies such as the mass deportation of non-naturalised citizens, has repeatedly called for an end to what it calls “Schuldkult” or a “culture of guilt”, to describe the perpetuation of the memory of Nazi crimes.View image in fullscreenHolocaust survivors and former camp prisoners lay a wreath at Auschwitz.Photograph: Jarek Praszkiewicz/EPA“I want very much to face up to them, not to hide away from them,” said Friedman.Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s top diplomat warned that antisemitism was more rampant than at any time since the Holocaust, and was “taking on new and disturbing forms”. She also warned of AI-generated content which was being deliberately created “to blur the line between fact and fiction, distort historical truth and undermine our collective memory”.The Frankfurt-based Anne Frank Educational Centre drew attention to a “flood” of AI-generated content being used like propaganda, in which the victims were ridiculed, with the aim of denying or trivialising them.Representatives of the Jewish community across the world, including Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, urged people to show “civil courage” and stand up for democracy at a time when there was a considerable and growing swell in favour of “pushing us as a Jewish community out of public life”.“These forces will continue to grow stronger if society fails to stop these threatening developments,” he warned.Police said they were investigating who was behind the weekend vandalism attack of a memorial in front of the remains of the synagogue in the northern port city of Kiel, which was destroyed in the state-sanctioned attacks on Jewish property in November 1938. Flowers and candles laid at the site were crushed and scattered, local media reported.Explore more on these topicsHolocaustAntisemitismSecond world warNazismAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)GermanyThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Thescuppering ofAndy Burnham’s return to Westminster has therefore brought renewed attention to other potential successors to Keir Starmer. That is in turn likely to involve renewed scrutiny of Angela Rayner.Starmer’s former number two and housing secretary has been quietly loyal sinceshe resignedas a minister nearly five months ago after what she said was the inadvertent underpayment of stamp duty on a flat in Hove.Rayner has resurfaced on occasions to try to nudge policy in areas she views as her legacies, notably by holding ministerial feet to the fire on workers’ rights legislation, and throughsome lobbyingon the just-announced changes to the leasehold system.It is no secret that she would like a return to cabinet, and equally that Starmer would welcome this – not least because the prime minister hassaid so publiclymore than once.While a slightly unlikely duo, they remain in touch and on good terms, according to senior Downing Street sources, and there is a shared view that they are an effective political team, despite some residual mistrust on Rayner’s side about some of those around the PM.It will, nonetheless, not happen immediately, and for two reasons. The most obvious is that there is currently no vacancy, and after Starmerreshuffled his cabinetso thoroughly in the wake of Rayner’s departure, he is unlikely to create one soon, with the earliest date mooted so far being after May’s Scottish, Welsh and local English elections.Burnham accuses No 10 sources of lying about byelection decisionRead moreThere is also the matter of an ongoing investigation into Rayner’s tax underpayment by HMRC, which could result in a fine, a reprimand or no action at all.None of the outcomes would be expected to block her return, but for now she simply has to wait for the tax authorities to respond – a source of deep frustration for Team Rayner.View image in fullscreen‘Angela says she took the scars for Jeremy Corbyn (pictured with Rayner), she took the scars for Keir Starmer, and so the next time she takes the scars it will be for herself.’Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThis is, of course, only one half of the story. Allies of Rayner say that while she has no plans to openly challenge Starmer, if this were to happen or if he stepped down she would definitely compete for the top job.She is understood to be frustrated at repeated reports linking her to being the deputy and left-leaning ideological ballast in a possible leadership bid by someone else, not least because these stories generally portray her as once again being second banana to a man.“Angela says she took the scars for Jeremy Corbyn, she took the scars forKeir Starmer, and so the next time she takes the scars it will be for herself,” one senior Labour figure told the Guardian.That said, Rayner is also known to be aware that she can be a divisive figure for some voters, and that any leadership bid would be firmly based on the idea of her leading a team, with a key role for a steady, understated chancellor – perhaps someone like John Healey or Pat McFadden.With the bulk of her legislative priorities finishing their route through parliament, Rayner is thinking about what direction she would want to takeLabour, with the broad conclusion that there would need to be a change in policy as well as in the person at the top.Curious as it might sound to outsiders, one hiccup sometimes raised in relation to a Rayner candidacy is her partner.He is Sam Tarry, a former Labour MP who was unceremoniously deselected before the last election in a process he views as deeply unfair and orchestrated byWes Streeting.Such internal Labour divisions run deep and bitter, and some observers worry that Rayner could suffer by association. For their part, Rayner’s team would prefer that she was granted more privacy – both over her relationship and, especially, her children.In terms of who may back Rayner in a potential contest, she would hope to get support fromthe recently revivedsoft-left Tribune caucus, particularly among female MPs.For now, however, the extent of her base remains unknown, and any path to the leadership deeply uncertain. What does seem sure is that if someone like Streeting hoped to engineer a coronation, they would instead have a battle on their hands.Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerWes StreetingLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

How did she feel about playing the blond gamine in some of cinema’s best loved scenes?Jonathan RomneyTue 27 Jan 2026 11.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareRichard Linklater’s latest film Nouvelle Vague is not so much a re-enactment of cinema history, but a celebratory tribute act – joyously reliving the spirit of the early French New Wave, as it re-imagines 1959 Paris and the chaotically innovative shooting of Jean-Luc Godard’s epoch-making Breathless (A Bout de Souffle). Most of the cast are newcomers, but there’s one familiar face: American actor Zoey Deutch. She plays Jean Seberg, already a Hollywood star when Godard cast her as expat student and newspaper vendor Patricia. Seberg’s stroll with Jean-Paul Belmondo on the Champs-Elysées, in T-shirt, slacks and ballet flats, is one of the legendary duets of French cinema.Deutch has Seberg’s style down impeccably: her awkward American-accented French, her balletic bounce in that scene, her exuberant shout of “New York Herald Tribune!” On a Zoom call from Los Angeles, Deutch – Seberg’s blond gamine cut now grown out into symmetrical black bangs – admits that when Linklater first suggested she might play the role, she knew nothing about Seberg, or about Breathless. That was way back in 2014, when they were shooting Linklater’s college baseball comedy Everybody Wants Some!! “I was 19,” says Deutch, “and I know there are plenty of 19-year-olds who are cinephiles and know a ton about that world, but I didn’t.”The FBI planted false rumours in the press that Seberg was pregnant by a Black PantherNouvelle Vague is in French: Deutch spent two years learning the language, and perfecting Seberg’s distinctly transatlantic delivery. But on first watching Breathless, Deutch admits, she didn’t quite get what was so extraordinary about the film, since its innovations – its improvisatory openness and staccato rhythms – had long been absorbed into the language of mainstream cinema. “I was mystified. I don’t think I understood how punk rock it was at the time.” If anyone still doesn’t understand, she suggests, they should watch Godard’s film alongside Linklater’s as a double bill: “You get how different and bold Breathless was when you watch it with ours.”Iowa-born Seberg was discovered as a teenager and, inexperienced though she was, twice played lead for the notoriously demanding Otto Preminger. She was Joan of Arc in his 1957 Saint Joan, for which Seberg said she was “burned at the stake by the press”, then starred in Bonjour Tristesse, in which her ingenue energies impressed critics, including Godard’s comrade-in-arms François Truffaut.View image in fullscreen‘Different and bold’ … Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo stroll through Paris in Breathless.Photograph: Nana Productions/SIPA/ShutterstockLinklater’s film shows Seberg at a turning point: living in Paris, sceptical about Godard’s potential as a director, but eager for new possibilities. In Nouvelle Vague, Deutch’s Seberg may be mystified and infuriated at Godard’s unpredictability and gnomic pontifications, but she gives as good as she gets, mischievously deflating him, often to his delight.“She acknowledged his genius,” says Deutch, “and was so grateful for this opportunity that changed her life. But she said in later interviews that he really viewed her more as an idea than a person, ‘He wasn’t interested in who I was, just in what I could represent.’ I think that’s very deep – and certainly the experience of a lot of young women in this business.”Seberg’s post-Breathless career was busy but variable, most famously starring in 1964 melodrama Lilith, as a patient in a mental hospital who becomes the object of obsessive desire for a staff member, played by Warren Beatty; and appearing with Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood in the 1969 musical Paint Your Wagon. She also made two features directed by her second husband, French novelist Romain Gary, which both objectified her cruelly, 1968’s Birds in Peru making her the centre of a tawdry concoction of Euro-erotica.View image in fullscreenBegan acting at the age of five … Deutch.Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock for ASTRA AwardsHer later life was depicted in the 2019 biopic Seberg, starring Kristen Stewart. When she died at the age of 40 in Paris in 1979, it was presumed to be suicide, after a brutal harassment campaign by the FBI in response to her support of the Black Panther Party. At a press conference afterwards, Gary said the FBI had planted false rumours in the press saying that Seberg’s pregnancy by a Mexican revolutionary called Carlos Navarra in 1970 was actually by a Black Panther.Deutch studied much of this, although none of it fed directly into Nouvelle Vague. “I always want to look at the big picture,” she says, “but Rick [Linklater] was very insistent in reminding us that we were depicting a moment in time.” The director would say to Guillaume Marbeck, who plays Godard: “You’re not an icon yet – these people are just young, ambitious, kooky artists doing their thing. They are not who we know them to be now.”When Deutch worked with Linklater on Everybody Wants Some!!, she had the only significant female role in (unusually for the director) an aggressively male film, about college baseball players raising hell and “chasing chicks” in early 80s Texas. “I think he got a vibe that, at 19, I would be able to hold my own with all these macho dudes – like no one would push me around.”You can well imagine that Deutch would be no pushover, as a Hollywood insider from birth. Her father, Howard Deutch directed the beloved Pretty in Pink; her mother is Lea Thompson, who starred as Lorraine in the Back to the Future trilogy. Thompson was also in Howard the Duck, a notorious flop based on the cult Marvel Comics character, a cigar-chomping, wisecracking waterfowl from another planet. When I joke that perhaps there was a family ban on mentioning that at table, Deutch plays scandalised: “Absolutely not! There’s justpure embracingof Howard the Duck.”View image in fullscreenShe gives as good as she gets … Deutch as Seberg and Guillaume Marbeck as Godard in Nouvelle Vague.Photograph: Jean-Louis Fernandez/Courtesy of NetflixShe remembers being very protective of her mother. “You have to imagine being a little kid and there’s strangers coming up, thinking that they know her and saying really inappropriate things, having no boundaries. And then also really lovely people who are just big fans and appreciate her work – but as a kid, you can’t separate the two.” She has continued to back her mother up, including professionally: in 2017, she and her elder sister Madelyn co-starred with their mother in Thompson’s directing debut The Year of Spectacular Men. A comedy-drama about a young woman navigating post-college adulthood, it was written by Madelyn and produced by Zoey.There’s a brief interruption – a scratching at the door and: “Mabel, stop! Mabel!” Mabel, out of shot and otherwise inaudible, is Deutch’s dog. “Mabel is the star of my life,” Deutch says. Or one of them, at least: last September, she announced her engagement to actor, comic and YouTuber Jimmy Tatro.Deutch, now 31, has had no shortage of roles since her debut at 15, in Disney’s kids-on-a-cruise-ship sitcom The Suite Life on Deck, although so far only a few have caused major ripples. Well established as a romcom stalwart, she has increasingly collected harder-edged roles: notably, in period gangster drama The Outfit, with Mark Rylance, and in Clint Eastwood’s courtroom thriller Juror No 2. She also made her Broadway debut in Thornton Wilder’s 1938 ensemble classic Our Town, the New York Times praising her “apple-cheeked and wild-souled” Emily. “I have loved this play so much that it stood on my nightstand for my whole life,” she says. “There are certain texts in all of our lives that just ground us. This was one of them.”Then there was one of her tougher movies, last year’s Anniversary, with Polish director Jan Komasa. Given her sheer insouciance in Nouvelle Vague, Deutch’s ferociously intense breakdown scene here comes as quite a shock. Anniversary is a bleak dystopian parable about the emergence of a new authoritarian America. And indeed, this week in Sundance, where she is premiering a new comedy, Deutch spoke out against the brutality of ICE and expressed solidarity with the people of Minnesota: “I feel so proud to be an American, seeing the way communities and people are coming together during this time. But I feel so ashamed at the same time to be an American, seeing how our government is handling things.”View image in fullscreen‘She acknowledged his genius’ … Seberg and Godard.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesNouvelle Vague has every likelihood of pushing Deutch definitively into the limelight. Seberg, playing Joan of Arc at 18, might not have been prepared for fame, but Deutch has been practising since the age of five, when she started acting classes. She was encouraged rather than pushed, she says, but admits it was her mother’s idea to enrol her for “kid improv”.Deutch says: “At a young age, I learned that if you say ‘No’ to adults, they have to explain things to you. So ‘No’ got me more communication and more of an opportunity to be treated like an adult. And then my mother said, ‘What’s the opposite of no? Yes –yes and!’ So she put me in improv and it totally changed my life. I have ‘Yes’ actually tattooed on my foot, so that I can look down and say ‘Yes’ to the world.”By way of illustration, Deutch hauls her foot into the Zoom frame to display it. After Nouvelle Vague, perhaps it’s time to get the other one tattooed with a bold “Oui!”Nouvelle Vague is in cinemas 30 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmRichard LinklaterJean-Luc GodardfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s rather a lot to ask of a key-grabbing hand, a dancing parasol and some melting iceEddy FrankelTue 27 Jan 2026 12.51 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 12.53 ESTShareOne of the worst things contemporary art can make you do is think serious thoughts about stupid things. Sure, sometimesa urinalis beautiful,a shedis interesting, andan empty roomis a container of countless ideas. But sometimes, it has no deeper meaning worth seeking out. Sometimes it’s just a bit silly.Brazilian conceptualist Laura Lima would rather call it absurd. Her show at theICA– her first solo presentation in the UK despite decades of international exhibitions and biennale appearances – is filled with surreal encounters, all of which are meant to jostle you out of your mundane, staid mental rut (“our habitual modes of attention”) and find meaning in the unexpected.How unexpected you find a life drawing class in an art gallery depends on your expectations, obviously. Quite expected, I’d imagine. But this one is different: not only are you allowed to participate, but everything is on wheels. Crazy. The easels and models are all placed on moving wooden platforms, which autonomously meander around the room, making you crane your neck and spin your noggin to see the model.View image in fullscreenSomewhat random … Parasol Deux at Laura Lima: The Drawing Drawing.Photograph: Anne TetzlaffIt’s all about randomness and chaos, says the handout, but how random and chaotic is it really? All the references to chance, unpredictability and “Epicurus’s atomist theory” are undermined by the fact that the platforms are all giant roombas with sensors. They spin around a predefined area in a preprogrammed way. It’s only chaotic and unpredictable if you don’t actually think about it.And if the idea instead is to make you look at things from different perspectives, I’d argue that doing it by making you sit at a giant spinning easel is pretty heavy-handed.There are a set of keys on the floor in the next room, with a human arm poking out under the wall trying to grab them. At first it just about works: it’s absurd, funny. But then you start looking for the meaning that’s meant to be hidden in the periphery and it just falls apart. Is the idea that meaning is just out of reach, there but ultimately ungraspable? Then why does the hand eventually reach the keys, grab them and then chuck them back out? All it’s saying is that meaning is only out of reach because you’ve made it bloody difficult for yourself.View image in fullscreenDifficult to grasp … Ascenseur at Laura Lima: The Drawing Drawing at the ICA, London.Photograph: Anne TetzlaffUpstairs, a red parasol on motorised wheels dances around the gallery. Next door a fridge holds images frozen in ice which you’re meant to take out and defrost in order to see. It’s not hugely worth it.Lima is big on making you find significance in the unexpected without nudging you towards any actual substance. But that’s a convenient way of making meaningless work while telling viewers they’re just not looking hard enough.If she said “Hey, this is just absurd, surreal and poetic”, it would be fine. But the whole show is so heavily loaded with half-baked philosophy and shoddy conceptualism that you don’t get to enjoy it for what it is. It’s all meant to be about process and discovery. I don’t have a problem with the form of any of it, I just don’t think it means much, says anything – or looks that good.I sat there watching people on giant roombas drawing a naked bloke with an umbrella and tried to think about Epicurus and atoms and chance. I stared at the spinning parasol, I defrosted some trays of ice. I really tried to figure it out, to find meaning and beauty. I thought serious thoughts, but only found silly art.Laura Lima: The Drawing Drawing is at the ICA, London until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtInstallationDrawingICAreviewsShareReuse this content"

Word soon got out, particularly among gen Z, about its “swicy” (sweet and spicy) appeal, and the product has “gone a bit crazy over the last couple of years”, according to Laurence Edwards, owner ofBlack Mountain Honey, which has seen its hot honey sales shoot up.View image in fullscreen‘It’s a bit of an accolade’ … Walkers Hot Honey crisps.Photograph: WalkersLike salted caramel, its forebear in the world of food trends, hot honey – generally made by adding or infusing chilli to honey –now seems to be everywhere. Not only can you buy supermarket own-brand versions, but products such as hot honey Jaffa Cakes, hot honey Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut cereal and, most recently, hot honey flavoured Walkers crisps, have now come into existence.“It’s a bit of an accolade being on a Walkers crisp packet,” Edwards says. He hopes hot honey’s moment in the spotlight will mean that beekeepers like him will benefit from “some of that mainstream attention” and see a rise in interest in their industry and products.Ben Lippett, chef and co-founder ofDr Sting’shot honey, is less optimistic: “Are we reaching peak hot honey? Maybe we are,” he says. “I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make me slightly nervous when I see larger businesses and corporations using hot honey.” He’s concerned that the market will become flooded with lower-quality versions of hot honey, which could put people off it. “When anything becomes popular, people will make the product and try to cut corners to get a better margin,” he says. “And I can tell you from experience that making money selling honey is very difficult because it’s a very high-cost raw ingredient” – hence a 280g bottle of Dr Sting’s retailing at £8.99.View image in fullscreenLethal drizzle … hot honey pepperoni pizza.Photograph: LauriPatterson/Getty ImagesCutting corners in honey production has been a point of contention in recent years, with the prevalence of “fake honey” bulked out with sugar syrupexposed by the European Commissionin 2023. But while pure honey is covered byhoney regulations, meaning it should be “free from organic or inorganic matters foreign to its composition”, flavoured honey is not. “You can be less certain of what’s in hot honey,” says Diane Drinkwater, president of the British Beekeepers Association (whose personal view is that “by adding chilli you’d be ruining [honey’s] natural deliciousness”).Edwards is aware, too, that the influx of hot honey products could lead to more “fake honey”, and he “would just advise anyone to do the checks” by reading the ingredients list to make sure they’re getting hot honey made with proper honey, “because it is a much better product”.View image in fullscreenTaking the biscuit … McVitie’s Hot Honey Jaffa Cakes.Photograph: Martin Berry/AlamyWhether or not people go for the premium or budget versions, Lisa Harris, co-founder of Harris and Hayesfood and drink consultancy, doesn’t think we’ll be seeing the back of hot honey any time soon – she believes it will just become ubiquitous and begin to plateau.“Now when I see salted caramel on a menu, it doesn’t excite me,” Harris says. Hot honey is heading in the same direction, she says: a tried and tested staple of gastropub menus and pizzerias, that, once upon a time, seemed exciting. No doubt innovative chefs and food companies are already searching for the next viral flavour combination – but for now, swiciness reigns supreme.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFoodFood & drink industryBeesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The grotesquely trigger-happy immigration officers of ICE are shooting people dead on US streets and this ugly fiasco is giving us a horribly familiar-looking new figure.ICE’s Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, achieving mayfly media stardom at the very moment that he is effectively relieved of his command in Minnesota, has a worryingly familiar buzzcut, sneer and swagger, and of course, like all Maga placemen and apparatchiks, he is submissive to the leader. He has a distinct echo of Sean Penn’s jarhead military tough-guy in One Battle After Another, who is tragicomically flattered when a masonic cabal of Wasp leaders invite him to join their club.As for cinema’s other intersections with the headlines, there are Bafta nominations in the non-English anguage section for Jafar Panahi’s It Was Just an Accident, about Iranian theocratic tyranny, and Kaouther Ben Hania’sThe Voice of Hind Rajab, about the little girl in Gaza killed by the IDF. This category also contains Brazilian film-maker Kleber Mendonça Filho’s magnificent The Secret Agent, about a dissident scientist pursued by the authorities in 70s Brazil. I can’t however agree with the saucer-eyed critical love for that other nominee in his category: Óliver Laxe’s preposterousSirāt, with its Pythonesque explosions.View image in fullscreenExtravagant romantic fantasy … Jessie Buckley  and Paul Mescal in Hamnet, which has 11 Bafta nominations.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyJosh Safdie’s aspartame-rush ping-pong comedy Marty Supreme, featuring Timothée Chalamet, reaffirms its awards-season prominence with 11 nominations, alongside Hamnet, Chloé Zhao’s extravagant romantic fantasy about the origins of Shakespeare’s great tragedy of the Dane. This excellent film has been the subject of backlash, an annual awards-season tradition as unvarying as the state opening of parliament – this year from commentators who have declared that they do not believe Shakespeare’s Hamlet was inspired by the death of his son Hamnet. I don’t believe it either, but that isn’t the point of this speculative rhapsody of grief.Guillermo del Toro’s supersized, super-emoted Frankenstein has eight nominations, level with Joachim Trier’s much admired cinephile family drama Sentimental Value and there are five for Yorgos Lanthimos’s absurdist eco-nightmare Bugonia with Emma Stone. They are good movies, though not each director’s best.But what about British films? Two very good ones are getting their due at these Baftas. Kirk Jones’s I Swear has five nominations, including a best actor nod for its excellent male lead Robert Aramayo, who plays John Davidson, the activist trying to educate the world about Tourette syndrome, which he has had since his teens. It’s a generous and open-hearted movie which has struck a chord with voters – and it is good also to see a supporting actor nod for the estimable Peter Mullan, as the community centre manager who gives John a chance.View image in fullscreenIntensely British … Tim Key in The Ballad of Wallis Island, which is nominated for three Baftas.Photograph: Focus Features/PAThen there is my favourite British film of the year: The Ballad of Wallis Island, which has three nominations: outstanding British film, adapted screenplay (it was expanded from an earlier short) and best supporting actress for Carey Mulligan. It is such a lovely, tender film about an eccentric lottery winner and widower, marvellously played byTim Key, who tries reuniting an indie folk-rock duo whom his late wife loved for a private gig on his island. It is a sweet and charming work in the tradition of Local Hero or even I Know Where I’m Going!.Perhaps Key also deserved a place in Bafta’s important “outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer” list – a category that can mean so much to the nominee. But this list does include Akinola Davies Jr’s vivid and mysterious Nigerian coming-of-age drama My Father’s Shadow and the uproarious BDSM comedy Pillion, taken from an Adam Mars-Jones novel. There is also a snub for Harris Dickinson’s outstanding film about homelessness,Urchin, which really deserved some Bafta attention.Otherwise, the outstanding British film list has top-quality entrants including Tim Mielants’s Steve with Cillian Murphy, Lynne Ramsay’s Die My Love and Philippa Lowthorpe’s deeply felt H Is for Hawk, any of which is a plausible winner. But I can’t help hoping Tim Key will be invited up to accept his Bafta for the intensely British The Ballad of Wallis Island.The 2026 Bafta awards ceremony is on 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsBaftas 2026One Battle After AnotherTim KeyICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Awards and prizesLeonardo DiCapriocommentShareReuse this content"

People are groping about in the darkness, waiting for their eyes to adjust, though most give up and start navigating by the light of their smartphones, trying to find Pierre Huyghe’s new work without quite realising they are already in it. Huyghe’s Liminals is more than just a film projected on a towering screen in a gutted power station. It is a quantum experiment, a mythological journey and a terrifying vision, set to a shifting thrum of gut-wobbling vibrations, a sizzling aural rain of dancing particles and sudden ear-splitting crackles which ricochet everywhere. You can’t always tell what’s happening on the screen and what’s happening in the cavernous space around you.View image in fullscreenDistances are hard to gauge … film still from Pierre Huyghe’s Liminals, at Halle am Berghain, Berlin.Photograph: Pierre Huyghe. Photo  Andrea Rossetti © VG BildI could feel the vibrations even on the street outside, looking up at the brooding hulk of the defunct 1950s power and heating plant that once serviced the socialist paradise of postwar East Berlin. Now the home of the world’s most famous techno venue,Berghain, it also hosts a queer sex club, dark spaces and bars, while the plant’s former boiler room, the Halle am Berghain, with its columns and suspended coal chutes, has currently been taken over by theLAS Art Foundationto stage a number of exhibitions, including Huyghe’s Liminals.Light comes and goes on the screen, never quite enough to let you sense the volume of the space you have entered. Distances are hard to gauge. A delicate hand emerges on the screen, not quite in colour, not quite in black and white. There’s a body here that’s almost human, in a bleak, desiccated landscape utterly devoid of life. It might as well be Mars. A female face with short cropped hair appears: except there is no face, just a yawning dark cavity scooped out between chin and brow. This is more than disconcerting. Suddenly everything tilts and there’s a roaring, flickering abyss opening up, and we see the same figure tiny and distant on the rim of an even greater, all-consuming void. Globs of light turn in space and are gone again. There is a great deal of aural and visual interference and everything hangs for a moment on the brink of total collapse. These anomalies and glitches in space and time are to do with Huyghe’s engagement with quantum mechanics, and the conversations he has been having, through the LAS Foundation, with physicists and philosophers. Artists often read or misread philosophy or science – whether it isMartin HeideggerorWerner Heisenberg– as if it were poetry, and there’s nothing wrong with that.View image in fullscreenAll too human … film still from Pierre Huyghe’s Liminals, at Halle am Berghain, Berlin.Photograph: Pierre Huyghe/VG Bild-Kunst, BonnWatching Huyghe’s more or less human character navigate an entirely indifferent world is a painful experience. They seem all too human, as the camera homes in on their dirty hands and mottled skin, their cuts and grazes, their breasts and a caesarean scar, their vulnerable nakedness, made somehow more awkward and unsettling by being coded female. Sometimes going on hands and knees, sometimes walking purposefully, sometimes as inert on the ground as a beached fish, sometimes furrowing the ground with their head, or hitting their forehead against the earth, sometimes sitting and contemplating their hands with the eyes they don’t have; the sounds of scurrying and crawling, of granular sifting and the displacement of small stones make the whole thing both believable and extremely abject. Is this a person or an avatar? At one point they approach a gnarly outcrop of rock and penetrate the void in their head with it, moving back and forth, a cyclical, rhythmic motion that is both bizarre and awful to watch. Is this to do withHeisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle? Search me. At another point the figure’s hands become unnaturally malleable, their fingers curling and twisting the wrong way and becoming peculiarly attenuated.The camera dwells on shapes in the rocks, on shadows and silhouettes. I see a human profile here, a pair of lips and a whole face there, accidental gargoyles staring back, not unlike Willem de Kooning’s sculptures, or Francis Bacon’s painted heads. Seeking out expressions, we project them on to the inanimate. Something else shimmers in the murk, but it is less likely gold than a turd. I also thought of Samuel Beckett’s How It Is, and of endlessly crawling through mud, and good old-fashioned existential dread. Speaking with Huyghe after spending an hour in Liminals, he said it was good to take one step towards cliche, but never two.View image in fullscreenGlobs of light turn in space and are gone again … film still from Pierre Huyghe’s Liminals, at Halle am Berghain, Berlin.Photograph: Pierre Huyghe/VG Bild-Kunst, BonnSo much of this new work relates to earlier sculptures and films by the French artist. I thought of the macaque monkey, dressed as a waitress and wearing a female, human mask in his 2014 filmUntitled (Human Mask), set in an abandoned restaurant near the Fukushima nuclear exclusion zone, and the concrete replica of a 19th-century reclining nude sculpture byMax Weber, with its head encased in a live beehive, as part of Huyghe’sUntilledat Documenta 13 in 2012.What’s on the screen and what’s happening in the space around me get confused. What is happening in the here-and-now of Liminals relates back to Huyghe’s earlier work, an entire world becoming more rounded with each new work. This is deliberate on Huyghe’s part. For all the talk of quantum mechanics, of the collapse of the wave form, of waves and particles (which is how we’ve always been thinking about light) what seems to me to matter here is a kind of porousness, between past and present, things and images, insides and outsides. One of the reasons the artist wanted to show at Berghain was to echo the activities elsewhere in the building, the bodies dancing, people desiring and craving and losing themselves in music and in sex, in spaces that are both limitless and bounded. Liminals has lodged in my head, and won’t go away. How alive it all is, how unhinging.Pierre Huyghe: Liminals is at Halle am Berghain, Berlin, until 8 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtBerlinreviewsShareReuse this content"

And they’re more recent.Go on, when did they begin?OK, so first let’s introduce Gabriella Carr.[Waves] Hi Gabriella Carr.In September last year, Ms Carr posted on TikTok andInstagram…Where else!Other platforms are available. Anyway, Carr posteda video of her goals and dreams for 2026. They included professional goals (she’s a video creator and actor), reading more books, gaining more followers …So far, so not very different from anyone else’s goals and dreams.She also held up a red notebook on which she’d written “The 1000 Nos of Gabriella Carr.”Nos as in …Yes, or rather the opposite of yes. Rejections. In her little red book, she lists jobs she’s applied for, roles and brand influencer campaigns she’s put herself up for, and been turned down.Why is she doing it, to keep a tally?“I know I’m delusional, but you kind of have to be to chase your dreams,” she said. “I’d rather try to fail than never try at all.”Almost turning a negative into something … if not positive, then some kind of achievement? I like it, I think.So do others.

        "Content": "Composite: Guardian Design/Getty ImagesInnocent people are being frozen out of basic banking services – and it all traces back to reforms rushed through after 9/11ByOliver BulloughTue 27 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareHamish Wilson lives a few miles away from me, in a cosy farmhouse in the damp hills of mid Wales. He makes good coffee, tells great stories and is an excellent host. Every summer, dozens of Somali guests visit Wilson’s farm as part of a wonderfully wholesome project set up to celebrate their nation’s culture, and to honour his father’s second world war service with a Somali comrade-in-arms.Inadvertently, however, the project has revealed something else: a deep unfairness in today’s global financial system that not only threatens to ruin the Somalis’ holidays, but also excludes marginalised communities from global banking services on a huge scale.The origins of the story lie in 1940, when the then 27-year-old Capt Eric Wilson led a doomed stand against an Italian invasion of the British colony of Somaliland. Suffering from malaria, massively outnumbered and under heavy artillery fire, Wilson and a small band of Somali comrades – like the Spartans at Thermopylae, but wearing khaki shorts rather than leather drawers – held off the Italians for an astonishing five days.After their position was overrun, Eric was presumed dead and was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross – which came as a nice surprise when he was liberated from a prisoner of war camp a few months later. It was an extraordinary honour, the highest a British soldier can receive, but he was always troubled by it. Why had he been recognised, while his sergeant – an old friend called Omar Kujoog who had died in the battle – received nothing?Wilson, my neighbour in Wales, inherited his father’s passion for east Africa, and spends a lot of time there himself. He and his friends, who included Kujoog’s son and grandchildren, became increasingly concerned that young Somalis in the UK were losing touch with their traditions, and only learning about their homeland from the media’s negative coverage of it.So, before Eric’s death in 2010, they sold the Victoria Cross and bought the farm to create a centre for Somalis to learn about their nation’s culture, as well as to commemorate the ties between the Wilson and Kujoog families. They called itDegmo, the Somali word for an encampment used by nomadic herders.Every summer, groups of people come to stay here, each chipping in a bit of money to a charity established by Wilson so he can pay the bills. His Somali visitors camp in gleaming bell tents and eat in dome-shaped pavilions. Wilson arranges activities around the farm – the kids round up sheep, walk through the woods and lie under the stars looking for meteorites – while old Somali women amaze their grandchildren by being able to effortlessly milk goats or move stock, and gain a new audience for stories about what Somalia was like in their youth.It is a lovely project, but in some ways, it is not a particularly unusual one. Farmers often earn extra income by hosting city-bred campers. What is unusual, however, are the problems that Wilson has with his bank. “They phone me up and say, ‘I need to ask you some questions about your account,’ and they go through the charity account and ask me questions about the source of every amount of money that went in or out,” Wilson told me. “Every time they ask the same questions, and I say, ‘Well, look, I told you this two or three weeks ago when you spoke to me,’ and it is always another half-hour of my time.”The problems he has are nothing compared with those of his guests. One community leader from Birmingham – accompanied by her daughter, who helped to translate some of the more technical language – told me how hard it had been to bring a few dozen Somalis to the countryside for a weekend. It’s only a two-hour drive, so the logistics are straightforward, but the finances had been a nightmare. She had assumed that paying Wilson for the food and accommodation would be easy. Other Somalis could transfer money to her account, then she would pass it on, which would allow her to keep track of who had paid and how much.About £4,000 had moved through her account between July and September the year before, and that’s when the problems started. Bank compliance officers summoned her to meetings and went through every transaction, demanding to know who these people were that were sending her money, how long she had known them and where the money had come from. “It almost made me feel like we were doing something wrong, almost like we were money laundering,” she said, with disbelief in her voice.And that was just the start of it. She had planned a trip to Somalia to see relatives, and transferred money to her sister so they could buy plane tickets together, but then the bank froze the money, making it impossible to buy anything. She set up a savings club with friends, with the idea that they would each put in £200 a month, then take out £2,400 once a year; but the bank froze that account too.The tiniest things set off the bank’s suspicions. If she writes a payment reference for an online transfer in Somali rather than in English, the transaction is blocked. If she moves more than £250 at a time, the transaction is blocked until she explains the origin of the money.“A lot of people in our community are struggling with this but they prefer to leave it alone. The worry is that if you complain there will be even more questions,” said the Birmingham community leader. “The days when I have to go to the bank are the worst days. I never want to go to the bank.”Just like most people who holiday in this part of Wales, the campers are British citizens; they live in the UK and they use British bank accounts. So, what is it exactly about people who come to Wilson’s farm that is different from the campers at other farms?“It doesn’t matter that I’m a British citizen, it’s just that I’m poor – and there’s this,” said the community leader, tracing a circle around the edges of her hijab with her finger, before giving a shrug and a rueful smile.The uncomfortable reality is that, unlike most campers in this part of the world, the community leader and her friends are Black and Muslim. And people who are Black and Muslim are some of the primary victims of a system that was set up after the attacks of 11 September 2001 to stop terrorists from moving their money around. It’s a system that has failed to achieve its primary aim – terrorists are every bit as widespread now as they were two decades ago – while making life much harder for millions of innocent people.View image in fullscreenSomali children on holiday at Hamish Wilson’s farm in mid Wales.Photograph: Hamish WilsonAfter 9/11, officials wanted access to every tool that might help them save lives, and they thought tracing financial movements could be one of them. Within days, the UN security council demanded that all countriesestablish a systemfor freezing terrorists’ assets. In October 2001, the US president, George W Bush, signed theUSA Patriot Act, which expanded anti-money-laundering rules to cover terrorists. That same month, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to craft a global approach to money laundering, published recommendations for a “basic framework to detect, prevent and suppress the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts”.The FATF had been created at the height of the “war on drugs” to stop criminals hiding their earnings. The organisation spent the 1990s persuading, bullying and cajoling every country in the world into adopting common standards on regulating the financial system. Its primary weapon was to demand that professionals report suspicious transactions to the authorities, thus allowing governments to stop dirty money at source, with large fines and criminal prosecution for non-compliance.On one level, since the FATF was the place that knew about dodgy money, it made sense to deploy its expertise against terrorist financing too. On another level, it made no sense at all. Money launderers take large volumes of dirty money and wash it through the financial system to make it look clean; terrorists take small amounts of clean money and – by using it to fund violence – turn it dirty. Why should mechanisms designed to catch one be able to pick up on the other?And there was another problem: terrorists’ money only becomes criminal after they’ve committed their atrocities. For banks to be able to block it preemptively, they needed to have an insight into something they couldn’t possibly know: their customers’ future plans. Without that knowledge, they’d have no idea what they were looking for. Richard Gordon, a lawyer who worked for the International Monetary Fund at the time, says he tried to warn participants that they were acting too hastily. “To say that banks have to figure out on their own what’s terrorism finance, that’s lunacy, and I said that too. Didn’t matter, I was overruled,” he told me.So the FATF’s proposals were adopted. No banker wanted to be caught moving money for terrorists, mainly because they were appalled by what had happened on 9/11, but also because the consequences for them and their employer would be so costly if they did. In 2004, family members of the victims of a Hamas attack in Israelsued Jordan’s Arab Bankin a US court, alleging that by holding bank accounts for members of the organisation it had assisted in the murder of their loved ones. The case was settled, but the payout was vast, even though Hamas was not an illegal organisation in Jordan. Arab Bank warned that the case “exposes the banking industry to enormous liability for nothing other than the processing of routine transactions and the provision of conventional account services even if all governmental requirements are followed”.It was a tough position to be in. Banks had no idea what terrorist fundraising looked like, and yet faced huge fines if they were complicit in it. Desperate compliance officers scoured official documents for even the tiniest suggestions of what to look for and, in guidance published by the FATF in 2002, they found a useful hint. “Often such fundraising is carried out in the name of organisations having the status of a charitable or relief organisation, and it may be targeted at a particular community.”It is true that some charities – or non-profit organisations (NPOs) – had been used in raising funds to support terrorist groups, but so too had businesses, criminal gangs, wealthy individuals and more. But that didn’t matter; banks now had something to look out for: a “charitable or relief organisation … targeted at a particular community”. That dog whistle was loud enough for even the deafest compliance officer to hear.In the decades since, humanitarian, charitable and cultural organisations run by Muslims, focusing on Muslim beneficiaries, or targeting their efforts at Islamic countries have been stripped of their bank accounts – “debanked” is the usual term, although “de-risked” is also used – to an astonishing degree. This has happened throughout the world, including in Muslim countries, where bankers are just as concerned about being fined as their counterparts in Europe or North America, if not more so. And it gets almost no attention.A poll conducted in 2022 in the US showed that more than a quarter of Muslim respondents reported having problems with their bank, such as being refused an account or having one suspended, which was more than three times as high as the rate for White evangelicals. While the reasons given to other members of the general public for their banking problems tended to be related to their credit score or overdrafts, Muslims reported that they’d been cut off because of international transactions, because they’d sent or received funds from an unfamiliar person, or been flagged for “a key word”.It is that last point that seems to explain what happened in July 2014 in the UK, whenHSBC wroteto a whole group of Muslim-focused NPOs on the same day to inform them they were losing their bank accounts. The Finsbury Park mosque in London, the Cordoba Foundation thinktank, the Ummah Welfare Trust, as well as others, all received the same letter: “I am writing to inform you that HSBC Bank has recently conducted a general review of its portfolio of customers and has concluded that provision of banking services … now falls outside of our risk appetite,” the letters stated. “I am sorry we are unable to continue to provide you with banking services, but do thank you for your custom to date.” There was no possibility of appeal, no explanation and no warning, just two months to find another bank account.View image in fullscreenThe Finsbury Park mosque in north London, which was ‘debanked’ by HSBC in 2014.Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPAAnd that was just one bank. In 2016, the Co-operative Bank cut off Friends of Al-Aqsa, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and 25 other pro-Palestinian groups. Four years earlier, Islamic Relief Worldwide, Britain’s largest Muslim NPO, which operated in more than 30 countries, was blocked by UBS. Walid Safour of the Al-Amal Foundation, and formerly of Human Care Syria, lost his personal bank account (as did his spouse), as did all his fellow trustees, with no explanation given.The same thing happens all over the world. In 2006, FBI agents raided a Muslim-run humanitarian organisation in Michigan. No charges were ever filed, but it lost its accounts. In 2019, a Canadian NPO was cut off after a manager was charged with terrorism offences in Pakistan. The manager was acquitted, but it lost its bank account anyway.This is more than an inconvenience. Charities rely on regular donations to keep operating, but if bank accounts are closed, donors will need to set up their donations again. How many of us get around to doing that? And the stigma is contagious, so the problem persists. “Once you’re flagged, it’s very difficult to find another bank that will be willing to do business with you,” one NPO director told the authors of a US report into debanking.The director spoke anonymously, as does almost everyone affected by this problem (you’ll notice that, in this article, I’m quoting almost no one by name). “This is fundamentally a story about shame. It is shame that has kept this story shrouded in obscurity so long,” wrote the author of a report published by the National Council of Canadian Muslims, which quoted representatives of five different NPOs. “They all asked to be anonymous for this report. That’s because the shame and social stigma of getting ‘debanked’ remains to this day.”Iam not underestimating the importance of fighting terrorism. I reported for years on atrocities committed by militants fighting for an independent Chechnya. I saw the huddled bodies of young people murdered outside a concert, the scraps of flesh in the snow after a suicide bombing, rows of dead children whose only crime was to turn up to school on the wrong day. A good friend died in a bombing, and I miss him still. Terrorism is grotesque. But you don’t fight terrorism by ostracising blameless people, or by alienating whole classes of the population.“Can we speak of racism here?” asked Mohamed Ibrahim, director of the London Somali Youth Forum. Banks all strenuously deny that they are targeting Muslims specifically because they are Muslims, and I’m sure they’re telling the truth. So what is the mechanism by which this is happening?It derives, I think, from compliance systems that rely on databases that gather media publications from all over the world so they can be searched for “adverse news”. If there are negative news stories about you, you might be a terrorist, and no bank wants to take the risk of being prosecuted, so you get debanked.Muslim names are distinctive, and they are often shared by many different people. It’s not hard to imagine that searching for someone by name in a database will throw up multiple news reports. In that case, a bank would have no idea if the individual mentioned is their client or someone else, but may close the account rather than take a chance on it. One researcher told me she’d seen an organisation flagged because it was in the same office block as a mosque. They were completely unconnected and three floors apart, but they shared an address and that was enough to raise suspicions.In 2007, the FATF sought to correct the situation by introducing what it called the “risk-based approach”, which instructed financial institutions to focus on individual account holders, rather than on whole classes of people. Banks should not, for example, debank someone just because their organisation has the word “Syria” in the title, but rather because it supports terrorist groups in Syria. Some 14 years later, the FATF chided banks for their failure to heed this clarification in a report called Unintended Consequences, which claimed that wholesale debanking is “by definition inconsistent with a proper application of the risk-based approach”.This report may be one of the more foolish publications I have read in a career that has involved reading many foolish publications. Not only was it two decades too late, but it drew completely the wrong conclusion. If you instruct people to do something, but all of them do something else, it would surely be wise to at least ask if the fault might lie in the original instruction rather than in everyone’s interpretation of it.The place the FATF should have started was with that word “risk”, and what it meant to different people. For the FATF, the risk in question is that of moving suspect cash, whether it belongs to criminals or terrorists. But for financial institutions, the risk is of being fined. And that makes perfect sense. They are profit-making businesses, and anything that might stop them making a profit is something they need to be wary of. Banks might say they care about moving dirty cash, but in reality they care about losing money. And once you look at the problems created by the post-9/11 financial architecture from that perspective, everything makes sense.In short, banks have been asked to take on a policing role, but they’re refusing to do it. Why? Because it’s expensive. One European bank told researchers for the Norwegian Refugee Council that 40 or 50 employees were required to check just one client’s attempt to send funds to Afghanistan. How long would any business keep doing that before deciding that it’s not worth their while? If maintaining one bank account requires the services of dozens of compliance officers and bears the risk of a billion-dollar fine if money leaks out to the wrong recipient, it is entirely rational to shut it down. “We are kind of in a ping-pong match between financial inclusion and avoiding regulatory scrutiny, and we are the ball,” said Pamela Dearden, managing director for financial crimes enforcement at JPMorgan Chase.Between 2016 and 2022, the number of accounts being closed annually in the UK rose from 45,091 to 343,350, and I suspect other countries will show a similar pattern. I’m sure bankers don’t take these decisions lightly, but their priority remains the bank, not its customers.A British parliamentary report quoted a small company that built solar-powered water pumps in India for customers in Africa, with support from the UK and US governments. In 2020, its bank said it would be closing the company’s account. The company received no explanation, but its leaders suspected the bank’s suspicions originated from the fact it was receiving funds from Nigeria, which is considered risky for both money laundering and terrorism reasons. They wanted to explain the misunderstanding, but that proved nearly impossible. “It was like dealing with a black hole. The bank didn’t want to listen and, seemingly, didn’t care,” the report quoted the company’s chief executive as saying. “It felt very automatic. Computer says no. It was a very scary time.”When prospective replacement banks heard why the company needed a new account, they naturally refused to provide one. Eventually, in desperation, the company’s chief executive asked his MP to contact the bank’s chief executive, who abruptly – and again without explanation – reversed the decision, and allowed the account to stay open.The situation feels completely capricious, with decisions made by anonymous compliance officers on the basis of unknown information, unless you’re lucky enough to find someone who can reverse the decisions, again with no apparent logic behind it.It hardly needs saying, but this post-9/11 system has not achieved its goals. Not only did the campaign to deprive terrorists of financial support fail to stop them, but militant groups have spread across much of the Middle East, central Africa and elsewhere. The Taliban are back in control of Afghanistan.For years, campaigners have sought to explain to politicians that the system they’ve created is causing a huge amount of damage, without doing much good. Interventions by the FATF have failed, not because they’re not well intentioned, but because they don’t get to the heart of the problem.This is, above all, a political failure. Because banks operate for profit, asking them to be a police force is inherently corrupting. There’s a reason that civilised countries don’t use bounty hunters. If the bounty is too low, the crime won’t be solved; and if a defendant is rich, he’ll buy his freedom and the crime won’t be solved either. By asking banks to police terrorist financing, we end up harming the poorest people because they can’t pay off their own bounties, and letting off the richest ones, because they can. Banks get fined if they’re caught breaking the rules, but that just means they ensure their fees are sufficient to fill the hole.And unlike a proper criminal justice system, there is no appeal against the banks’ decisions. Some debanked people have tried to sue their banks for discrimination, and there have been isolated examples of them winning small amounts of compensation. But in general, banks have no obligation to keep providing a customer with a bank account. As long as they comply with the terms of their customers’ contracts, they can do what they like.For those who lose their bank account, there is one option still open, however. The catch is that it’s only available to a select few.In November 2022, the “wealth reputational risk committee” of Coutts, a private bank in the UK that provides services only to very wealthy customers, decided to debank Nigel Farage. According to internal documents, the bank made the decision because Farage was a “significantly loss-making” client, but it also took into account that some of his more divisive political positions might threaten the bank’s reputation.Farage did not take this decision well. In June 2023, he revealed what had happened, and accused the bank of punishing him for his political beliefs – something the bank struggled to deny, since the documents he obtained did indeed show they had considered his politics while making their decision.Farage’s friends in the media and in politics spun this as a financial version of “cancel culture” and eventually forced Coutts to reverse its decision. It was a telling episode. Politicians and journalists presented this as an isolated and troubling incident that demanded immediate political intervention. It seemed that they were entirely unaware of how normal it is for banks to close customers’ accounts because of who they are. What happened to Farage was exactly what had been happening to British Muslims for decades. The difference was that he had high-profile allies who had questions asked about him in the House of Commons and articles written about him in the press which embarrassed his bankers into changing their minds.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage, who had his bank account cancelled by Coutts in 2022. The bank later reversed its decision.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersA similar episode occurred in the US after the Treasury Department in 2013 launched an anti-fraud campaign calledOperation Choke Point. After a series of high-profile financial scandals – particularly the Bernie Madoff and Allen Stanford pyramid schemes – officials were looking to find ways to stop banks moving the proceeds of fraud. They decided to target “choke points” in the financial system, and particularly the payment processors that handle transactions for merchants. It was entirely in line with decades of anti-money-laundering practice, but it had the misfortune to be opposed by some lobbyists working for banks, and to have been given a sinister name.Those lobbyists, in looking for a way to oppose the operation, found a document laying out the categories of client that bankers should consider to be high risk. Most of the list was understandable – people running escort services or Ponzi schemes, for instance – but it also included “firearms and ammunition manufacturers and retailers”, and that was their opportunity. Campaigners presented the operation as a political assault by Barack Obama’s White House on the constitutional right to bear arms. “Operation Choke Point is an affront to the freedoms and liberty that millions of Americans have died to protect,” insisted Texas congressman Roger Williams. It was, he continued, “one of the most abusive government overreaches in our nation’s history”. Administration officials and media commentators tried to explain that the operation was completely normal, that no gun shops had been involved, that banks were just being asked to conduct their usual risk-based assessments. It didn’t matter. The operation was cancelled in 2015.‘Is this justice?’: why Sudan is facing a multibillion-dollar bill for 9/11Read moreThe success of the opposition to Choke Point, however, ensured that when cryptocurrency companies lost their bank accounts, their advocates decided to use the same tactics against Joe Biden’s administration. This was Choke Point 2.0, they said. The White House was seeking to use administrative back channels to protect banks from competition. This was nonsense. There were good reasons to be concerned that crypto companies were facilitating money laundering and fraud, since so many of them had done precisely that. Nonetheless, the idea that this was a politically motivated hit spread in the rightwing media until it became a widely held belief.“Basically, it’s a privatised sanctions regime that lets bureaucrats do to American citizens the same thing that we do to Iran,” said Marc Andreessen, a billionaire software engineer turned venture capitalist who became a vocal campaigner for Donald Trump’s 2024 reelection campaign, on the Joe Rogan podcast in November that year. “This has been happening to a lot of the fintech entrepreneurs, anybody trying to start any new kind of banking service because they’re trying to protect the big banks.”The way Andreessen explained it, the US Treasury secretary could just phone up a bank and demand that a political opponent be kicked out of the financial system, which explained why – according to him – only conservatives suffered.“So no one on the left gets debanked?” asked Rogan.“I have not heard of a single instance of anyone on the left getting debanked,” replied Andreessen.I loathe the tendency of wealthy, well-connected rightwingers to present themselves as victims, rather than as the spectacularly fortunate people they really are. It is cynical, annoying and misleading, and Andreessen’s explanation of how banks assess whether a client is politically exposed was either wildly ill-informed or deliberately wrong.However, despite myself, I am sympathetic to the arguments they’ve made around debanking. The reason that the defenders of Operation Choke Point, or indeed Coutts bank, struggled to mount a convincing defence of what they’d done is that the critics were right. It genuinelyissinister that anyone can be debanked simply because bankers consider them to be too expensive or risky to be worth the trouble. What is even more sinister, however, is that the only people who can get a fair hearing if they lose their bank accounts are those sufficiently well connected, rich or media savvy to make a successful fuss about it.This an adapted extract fromEverybody Loves Our Dollars: How Money Laundering Wonby Oliver Bullough, published by W&N on 29 JanuaryListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readRaceBankingReligionIslamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For ‘doomsayers’ like us, it is the ultimate vindicationTue 27 Jan 2026 11.52 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 11.55 ESTShareIknow it’s almost impossible to turn your eyes away from the Trump show, but that’s the point. His antics, ever-grosser and more preposterous, are designed to keep him in our minds, to crowd out other issues. His insatiable craving for attention is a global-threat multiplier. You can’t help wondering whether there’s anything hewouldn’tdo to dominate the headlines.But we must tear ourselves away from the spectacle, for there are other threats just as critical that also require our attention. Just because you’re not hearing about them doesn’t mean they’ve gone away.Why are they not salient? Partly because countries – and not just Trump’s – seem determined to keep us in the dark. The most important document published by the UK government since the general election emerged last week only through a freedom of information request. Thenational security assessmenton biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse was supposed to have been published inOctober 2025, but the apparatchiks in Downing Street sought to make it disappear. Apparently there weretwo reasons: because its conclusions were “too negative”, and because it would draw attention to the government’s failure to act.When the report at last appeared, thanks to an FoI request lodged by the Green Alliance, The Timesreported thatit had been significantly “abridged”, I expect by the same goons. Some of its starkest conclusions had been omitted. Even so, the assessment – believed to have beencompiled by the joint intelligence committee(on which the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ sit) – is not exactly reassuring.It echoes warnings some of us have made for years, only to be dismissed as nutters, doomsayers and extremists. It tells us that “ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions. Every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse (irreversible loss of function beyond repair).” This presents a threat to “UK national security and prosperity”. It says “the world is already experiencing impacts including crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks. Threats will increase with degradation and intensify with collapse.” The results will include geopolitical and economic instability, increased conflict and competition for resources. “It is unlikely the UK would be able to maintain food security if ecosystem collapse drives geopolitical competition for food.” It also warns that “conflict and military escalation will become more likely, both within and between states, as groups compete for arable land and food and water resources”.It provides a powerful vindication of certain messages that, whenvoiced by environmentalists, have been greeted with hatred, fury and denial. For example, it tells us that “food production is the most significant cause of terrestrial biodiversity loss”, that “animal farming at current levels is unsustainable without imports” and that “the UK does not have enough land to feed its population and rear livestock: a wholesale change in consumer diets would be required”. I’d be lying if I wrote: “I hate to say, ‘We told you so.’” After years of insults and abuse, I say it with pride.But what was cut from the report is, according to The Times, even graver, including a warning that the shrinkage of glaciers in the Himalayas, causing declining river flow, would “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, leading to the possibility of nuclear war. Again, some of us have beentrying to persuade governmentsto focus on this threat with little success.It’s almost reassuring to know we’re not alone in being stonewalled. If even the security services are gagged when they tell the government what it doesn’t want to hear, perhaps our communication style, or our modes of protest or our dress sense, are not, as we keep being told, the problem. The report, notably shorter than most of its kind, gives every appearance of having been hastily and crudely truncated.I wonder whether the full assessment might also have named some other pressing security threats. One is the way in whichfossil fuel, meat andlivestock producershave been funding far-right movements, to stifle environmental protection measures that would reduce their profits. Such funding is a major driver of the fascistic politics that we now witness in the US.It’s not hard to see how inconvenient this report is for Starmer’s government, which has repeatedly sought toinvent a conflictbetween prosperity and environmental protection. Its war on the living world (a world it reduces, according to the “cauldron principle”, to bats, newts, spiders and snails) is a major element of its appeal to the “hero voters” on which it believes its success depends. Never mind that these votersmight not actually exist: we’ll bring our ghost army back from Reform UK by attacking wildlife, which everyone in Britain famously hates. That’s bound to work. So when the security services say that environmental protection is in fact essential to prosperity, their report must be suppressed.Against the assessment’s advice that tropical forest ecosystems are crucial to the UK’s security, our government has decided so farnot to investone penny in theTropical Forest Forever Facility, despite helping to establish this global funding mechanism. But rest assured: it tells us it’s “incredibly supportive” of the initiative. It seems determinedto dumptheinternational climate finance programmethat the Tories established – to help poorer countries protect themselves and halt the collapse of ecosystems – when the current fund expires this year. Let’s ignore not just those eco-loons but the former military leadersarguingthat climate finance is an essential element of national security.At home, the government appears to have quietly given up on the target set by the Conservatives of “30x30”, which means 30% of our land and sea protected for nature by 2030. The national security assessment lists this as one of the essential measures needed to avert catastrophe. Labour’s new target? 30xnever.And, as the Office for Environmental Protectionpoints out, Starmer’s government is on track to miss even the dismal, risible targets for protecting and restoring wildlife established in the 2021 Environment Act, when George Eustice was environment secretary. Yes, the situation is actually worse than in the darkest days of Tory rule.I know this government exists only to disappoint us. But its environmental failures are even more striking than its failures on other issues. When the ruling party compares unfavourably with the one that brought us Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, it’s worse than a betrayal. It’s a threat to our survival.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionBiodiversityConservationWildlifeKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

But so too can getting a blow-by-blow account of your partner’s day – as I know all too wellTue 27 Jan 2026 09.23 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 13.04 ESTShareApsychologist has – at long last –shared the three signs you’re “overcommunicating” in your relationship.Overcommunicating. This is a somewhat revolutionary concept, as we’re consistently told communication is the key to a successful long-term union. But, whaddaya know? Turns out you can have too much of a good thing.The revelation, courtesy of Mark Travers PhD, provides much food for thought generally but, more importantly, gives me a chance to utter those three little words you can never say often enough to your partner: told you so.Travers writes in Forbes magazine that, as we’ve been led to believe thus far: “To a large extent, research agrees that open, honest communication predicts higher relationship satisfaction, deeper trust between partners, and longevity of their shared bond.” However, he says, there’s nuance within that. “A truth that might startle most couples is that more communication is not always better communication.”He explains that discovering this doesn’t mean now resorting to playing games or withholding feelings: “Instead, they should try to focus on learning the difference between healthy expression and over-processing”.Overprocessing sounds extremely familiar, because I am married to Mr TMI. This man tells me what hemighthave for lunch tomorrow – and to be honest, I would struggle to be interested even if it was a definite plan. He narrates his life to me as he lives it, his every musing, plan and idea, keeping me up to date with any changes to the schedule, like a breathless rolling-news reporter. He cannot understand why I don’t make sure he’s similarly informed. Why I insist on my bathroom habits being what he calls “secret” and I call “private”.My husband supplies a running commentary as he unpacks the dishwasher, discusses queries he’ll probably Google later, ensures I’m thoroughly well-versed in the fortunes of Arsenal football club, their chances for future success, and what, in his opinion, they should do to guarantee it. He’ll tell me about somewhere he nearly went, but ended up deciding not to. That he saw somebody who looked like his friend, but wasn’t. He won’t just say he’s going to the supermarket, he’ll run through each item on his shopping list, and if he’s unable to buy any of them, I’m the first to hear about it. It’s as though, when he heard about couples sharing their lives, he assumed it meant absolutely literally, incessantly, relentlessly.This would probably be fine if I had nothing to do other than be enthralled by his antics, but unfortunately there’s the inconvenient little matter of my own life, and there only being a certain number of hours in a day. Of course I’m invested in his storyline, but not to the exclusion of all else. I care how he is feeling, the top line of what he thinks and feels, but not about every notion that occurs to him on a second-by-second basis. I also worry about retaining a slight air of mystery, which I’ve always thought is healthy for a relationship – and that’s not entirely a euphemism for keeping what happens in the smallest room to yourself, but it also isn’t not that. There has to be a line, doesn’t there? A limit. As Travers says, “Partners feel safest not when everything is discussed, but when they trust that important things will be discussed”.Those three signs of overcommunicating to watch out for are: you’re seeking reassurance in your relationship, not clarity; you process every feeling out loud in your relationship before you even understand it; and you talk so much about your relationship that the attraction starts to fade. In fairness to my husband, our relationship is probably the one topic he doesn’t verbally liveblog. We’ve learned over the years that it’s better to talk openly about issues or disagreements, which we do, but then we move on. That we have each other’s backs is mostly unspoken. Maybe I should count myself lucky that our marriage isn’t constantly under the microscope – just every single other aspect of his life.And, who knows, perhaps this is the slickest double bluff of all time. If it turns out he’s had a secret second family all along, I’ll actually be quite impressed.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsMarriageOpinionRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

After two months of damaging headlines, Rachel Reeves has granted pubs a 15% discount on bills, worth £1,650 on average in the next tax year, then a two-year freeze in real terms, with the promise of a change in methodology in time for the next revaluation in 2029. Live music venues get the same deal. The package is not insignificant, especially as it was the year-three escalation in bills that was causing the most angst.Yet it would be a mistake to think the government’s troubles on business rates end there. First, and most significantly, the rest of the hospitality industry got nothing extra in Tuesday’s announcement beyond a similar pledge to rethink valuation methods for hotels in future.Those restaurants, cafes and hotels represent six out of seven of the 3.5m jobs in the overall hospitality sector, and some figures cited by the employers’ trade body, Hospitality UK, for average increases in business rates over the next three years were truly exceptional – try 115% for a hotel in England. If dire warnings about closures and job losses are correct, Reeves may have to suffer the embarrassment of fiddling again with business rates in her autumn budget.Second, this saga will intensify the complaint from one corner of the business world that the government is interested only in the eight “high-growth” sectors within its modern industrial strategy and that everybody outside the tent is an afterthought.Certainly, the Treasury seems to have failed to anticipate thecries of outrage from the hospitality sector. Perhaps it didn’t model the impacts in sufficient detail. Reeves managed to annoy everybody by boasting about creating the “lowest rates since 1991” when she was referring solely to the so-called multiplier applied to rateable values, which is only one of three critical inputs into the formula. The multiplier reduction was genuine but was overwhelmed in many cases by increases in rateable values themselves from depressed pandemic levels, plus the withdrawal of temporary Covid-era relief.We can probably agree that Covid support had to go at some point, but you can’t blame publicans and restaurateurs for being interested in their overall bills rather than the calculation mechanics and tapers. The backdrop, after all, is increases in other fixed costs in recent years – energy, wages,employers’ national insurance contributionsafter the 2024 budget, and so on. Those separate cost pressures are the reason why this row exploded out of all proportion to the significance of business rates themselves. The Treasury should have seen it coming. MPs should look into how the shambles happened.Then there’s the fact that Labour, in its manifesto, promised to replace the whole business rates system on the grounds that the current set-up “disincentivises investment, creates uncertainty and places an undue burden on our high streets”. In office, however, it has continued with the current structure with adjustments aimed at helping smaller premises. The tweaks may be well intentioned but they do not add up to the promised switch to a fairer regime.In the government’s defence, it inherited a mess from successive Tory governments that opted for sticking-plaster fixes, as Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, would do better to admit. Change is also technically hard: business rates raise serious money (a projected £37bn in 2026-27) that central and local government needs. Every revaluation in the three-yearly cycle causes aggro of some form – outcomes too often feel arbitrary.But the solution is to model sector-by-sector impacts precisely, spot problems before they arise, avoid overselling the changes you are making and recognise the wider trading environment. Better still, get on and do the fundamental reform you promised.Explore more on these topicsBusiness ratesNils Pratley on financeHospitality industryRachel ReevesTax and spendingEconomic policyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

This will be the first trip of this kind by a British prime minister since Theresa May’s three-dayvisit to Beijingin 2018. Since then, relations between London and Beijing have become increasingly fraught, caught between growingsecurity concernsand deep economic interdependence. Allegations of espionage and influence operations have sharpened political and public suspicion in the UK, even asdeep trade linksand supply chains on which the country depends make disengagement unrealistic. As fierce debate about the recentapproval for the new Chinese embassyhas shown, there are strong opinions about how to best manage relations with Beijing – as well as what, precisely, constitutes a threat and what is an opportunity. The result is an uneasy balancing act in which caution and cooperation coexist, often uncomfortably.These security concerns are grounded in recent experience. In December, the Foreign Office disclosed it had been the target of asustained cyber-attacktwo months earlier that was suspected to be the work of a Chinese group known as Storm 1849. This followed investigations into alleged espionage involvingparliamentary researchersand repeated warnings from security agencies about technology transfer and data exposure in sensitive industries.Starmer will surely need a stiff drink on the plane to Beijing as he works through what cards he has to play. For all the current mood of malaise and low confidence, the UK is still a key part of the global geopolitical architecture. As a permanent member of the UN security council, a state with nuclear capability and a G7 country (even if at the bottomwith regards to total investment), it retains significant clout.China, however, also arrives at the table with formidable leverage: it isthe world’s second-largest economyand a central hub in global manufacturing and supply chains, giving it weight on issues ranging from the climate crisis to financial stability, and making cooperation with it unavoidable. Moreover, Beijing’saims are clear: securing a more predictable and less adversarial posture from the UK and Europe, limiting criticism of its internal and regional policies, maintaining access to British financial markets and deepening cooperation in education, research, green technology and investment.For the past 30 years or so,Chinahas worked systematically to build its own networks around the world by investing heavily in infrastructure, energy and transport, often in places where western capital has been reluctant to go. In Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America, China has paired finance with diplomacy, trade and development assistance, presenting itself as a partner focused on growth rather than governance or political reform. Over time, this has translated into influence: access to markets and resources, diplomatic support in international forums and a stronger voice across much of the global south.History does not always count for much, but it counts for something if you can create a narrative that explains the benefits of cooperation and how to build for the future.That is at heart of what Starmer needs to be thinking about when he touches down in Beijing. What do China and the UK have in common, and what are the areas where we can, or cannot, collaborate? Perhaps most importantly, how does the UK sees its place in a changing world: as a gateway to Europe, a sop to the US or a country that is in decline and “decaying” (asDonald Trump has called Europeas a whole)?View image in fullscreenDemonstrators gather outside the Royal Mint Court in London to protest against plans to open the new Chinese embassy, January 2026.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesThe beliefthat the west is volatile, unreliable and imperialistic is one reason that China has worked hard to embed itself in global supply chains, while reducing its own dependencies on others at the same time. It has done so by targeting strategic sectors: ports and railways, energy, mining, telecommunications and manufacturing, using state-backed finance to place Chinese companies at key points in trade and logistics. This has expanded its access to markets and resources abroad while strengthening its ability to insulate itself from external pressure at home.While the UK has long agonised over its own energy strategy – and paid the price for being dependent on global markets – China set about solving the problem of relying onoil and gas from the Middle Eastand elsewhere by fostering a cradle-to-grave ecosystem that has created a near monopoly on photovoltaic cells, wind turbines and batteries. Clean energy is good for the environment, of course. But the incentives to dominate these technologies were also underpinned by the desire to ensure self-sufficiency in an age that Beijing considered to be one of rising geopolitical turbulence long before Trump’s first election.With similar steps taken across a host of other sectors, including rare earths, biotechnology, data analytics and artificial intelligence, China’s emphasis onopen-source modelshas helped accelerate adoption and diffusion at scale, strengthening its position globally. For countries such as Britain, this matters because Chinese companies now sit deep inside supply chains that underpin everything from energy transition and manufacturing to consumer goods and digital infrastructure.All this, then, means that others need China more than China needs others.That much is clear from the most recent trade data. It shows that this year, China is on course torecord a trade surplusof $1.19tn. This is in spite of Trump’s attempts to throttle Beijing byimposing tariffsas well as restrictions on the export of a slew of products. These have beensidestepped by shipping throughcountries such as Mexico and Vietnam, or by dumping cheap goods in other markets, including those in Europe.For Britain, the implication is stark: reliance on China directly constrains policy choices. Decisions on security, human rights or technology are weighed not only on their merits, but against the risk of disrupted trade, higher costs for consumers and businesses, and retaliation against key sectors. Like the US under Trump, Beijing is willing to use coercive tools to settle scores: it imposed tariffs of up to 42.7% on the EU dairy industryjust before Christmas in response to Europe protecting its car industry at the expense of Chinese manufacturers.This all makes China a formidable competitor and means that Starmer needs real clarity of vision to work out what he wants from China and what he can offer in return. That is complicated by an age in which the UK’s national security is at its most vulnerable since the end of the second world war.How Starmer navigates the opportunities and challenges of this visit will not define his premiership. But it is part of the wider question of what precisely the prime minister’s vision is for the UK at a time of change. Many are still waiting to see what that is. The Beijing trip offers the chance to articulate it.Peter Frankopan is professor of global history at the University of Oxford.

Could VB not just have laid claim to ‘Posh’ instead?Tue 27 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 06.06 ESTShareAs a sidebar to the civil war in the House of Beckham, it emerged at the weekend that Victoria hastrademarked all her children’s names. A lot of people think this is a peculiar parenting move, and a lot of other people think this a perfectly natural thing to do, for someone who has built a global brand from just their name and raw talent – but I thought, wait a second: my daughter is also called Harper and my dog is called Romeo, and even though neither of them has imminent plans to launch a perfume, I still should have been consulted on this.My Harper was born two years before the Beckhams’, and therefore by any reasonable metric, Posh copied me. But – see brand-building, above – by the time my Harper was four, even her own father couldn’t remember which one had come first. No such excuse for Romeo the dog, who started out 14 years younger than Romeo BeckhamTM, but is now 46 years older, thanks to dog years. The name clash couldn’t be helped: he came from a themed litter (featuring Rogue, Rebel, Ricky, Ross and Raoul) and he was the most loving. You can’t mess with that kind of nominative determinism.The law is pretty clear that, once you become an adult, your parent can no longer own your name or any domain thereto associated, although the law can say what it likes; I still think of my kids’ fingernails as basically mine.An expulsion, a smirking leader and now a defection: it’s episode one, series one of the Farage/Jenrick show | Zoe WilliamsRead moreAnyway, it turns out that the keyword in all this legal apparatus is “Beckham”, so any Harpers, Romeos or, for that matter, Brooklyns who want to continue calling themselves that can go right ahead, including the New York borough, the beer and thesad novel.It would have been good if Victoria had also trademarked “Posh” and all traits of poshness, including but not limited to having a Rolls-Royce but no central heating, using an outdoor voice when you’re indoors, and having an ineradicable yet formless and fragile sense of superiority. She could have excised those traits from society by simply asking everyone to apply to her before they used them. At least, I think that’s how trademarking works.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fans would miss out on seeing the sport’s pinnacle in their home towns (or somewhere nearby). Cities and businesses small and large would lose the financial benefits they had banked on. It would be a logistical and political nightmare on an international scale, the likes of which have never been seen before in sports. It would be eminently sad. And it would be entirely justified.It brings me no pleasure to say this. The United States has been eager to host a men’s World Cup for more than a decade and a half. The desire survived and even grew after 2010’s failure to out-bid Russia and Qatar (in public and behind closed doors) for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. With hosting rights for 2026 later secured alongside Canada and Mexico, the US soccer scene prepared to show off that the sport is now part of the nation’s fabric, 32 years after hosting the tournament for the first time in 1994. Soccer’s growing popularity in America has helped inspireother US sportsto try new formats, encouraged us to engage more fully with the world in a sporting context, and has been at the center of conversations about our society and culture. The 2026 World Cup was seen as the best chance for the world to fully experience not just how much the US has improved at soccer, but how much soccer has improved the US.Sepp Blatter suggests fans should not travel to US for World CupRead moreI have not been immune to this Pollyannaish outlook. Much of my career covering American soccer has been predicated on the idea that the sport will continue to growin the US. The 2026 World Cup is central to that hope. I can admit that I have a vested interest in this tournament’s success. As a lifelong fan, the World Cup landing here was a dream come true. As a professional, I hoped it would create millions of new North American soccer fans who will want to read and watch and listen to journalism about the sport for the rest of their lives.Perhaps I was naive. The tournament may create some of those fans, but at what cost?Exorbitant ticket priceshavecut outthe game’sgrassroots.Onerous demandson cities have siphoned public money. Fifa hasboostedanopenly corrupt administrationat every turn. Nowwanton federal violencehas made it difficult to justify having the World Cup here at all. Safety, justice, freedom, the continued functioning of society – these are all under threat. Even to many soccer fans in the US, the game once called “the most important of the least important things” now seems just plain unimportant.Federal agentshave killed two innocent peoplein Minneapolis in the last three weeks. Neither was threatening the paramilitary forces who shot them. We know these things because we have seen them play out on video after sickening video, from multiple angles, slowed down and refocused and analysed. Yet the most senior governmental figures want us to believe that Renee Good and Alex Pretti were “domestic terrorists”. That they were, in fact the aggressors – in cold contrast to the mountain of available evidence. It would be reasonable to assume that those who disregard the truth so blatantly can also not be trusted to host a safe and secure World Cup.And then there is the wider picture.Thirty-two people diedin US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2025 alone.The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to tracking US gun violence, reports that immigration officers shot at people 19 times since the start of the crackdown – figures it assumes are an undercount. These include three killings in 2025, now up to at least five with the Minnesota deaths. Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has resulted inmore detentions of people with no criminal recordthan any other category – despite its stated aim of ridding the country of criminals and claimed successes in doing so. The raids resulting in all of this have largely targeted Democratic-leaning metro areas – which 10 of the 11 US World Cup host cities are (the Dallas metroplex being the one outlier). Yet “the most important message that football can convey right now is one of peace and unity,” Fifa president Gianni Infantino said last year.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino holds the World Cup trophy as he attends the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersHow can soccer do that when its showpiece event is in a country led by an administration intent on division? A country that has captured a foreign leader,possibly in violation of international law. A country thathas threatened supposed allieswith military action over control of a foreign territory. A country that has picked seemingly endless fights, including with its World Cup cohosts – the very countries it’s meant to be standing alongside and welcoming the world’s soccer fans.Are these the actions of a safe country, prepared to handle an influx of foreign visitors? Is this the kind of place you’d expect someone would want to spend many thousands of dollars to visit, even before they’ve ponied up for the games themselves? I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but Isympathise with Sepp Blatteron this one.There have beendiscussions of a boycottin some form; a mild clamor, if that. If that actually happens among enough countries, Fifa’s hand could be forced. But as justified as that would be, that’s hard to even imagine. Holding World Cups in autocratic or destructive countries is nothing new. A boycott would mean revenue lost and a schedule that will be near-impossible to reconfigure. And there’s a feeling at soccer’s highest levels that, no matter which government Fifa cosies up to, the sport itself will escape unscathed.“With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them,” Concacaf president Victor Montagliani said last year at a conference. “Football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.”But in the meantime, football’s main event is at least partly under this administration’s control. Trump himselfsaid last yearthat if cities are deemed to be too dangerous, or otherwise unfit for hosting, “We’re going to move the event to some place where it’s going to be appreciated and safe.”Trump, of course, meant moving World Cup matches to other US cities. But it would be hard to argue if the World Cup was moved out of the US entirely.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A reframing of the debate is urgently neededTue 27 Jan 2026 13.52 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 15.08 ESTShareThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s latestreporton poverty in the UK, published this week, should be read first and foremost as an indictment of all Conservative governments between 2010 and 2024. During almost a decade and a half of Tory rule, the JRF estimates that no progress at all was made in reducing overall levels of relative hardship. No surprise perhaps. Through wide-ranging, ideologically driven welfare cuts, ministers actively sought to make life harder, not easier, for many of the least well-off.The grim legacy of that approach is that in 2023-24 – the last dataset available – about one in five people were in relative poverty,definedas less than 60% of median income. But it also turns out that 6.8 million people were struggling to survive on far, far less than that, having effectively been economically cut adrift. Some 3.8 million people experienced destitution in 2022. As the JRF’s chief analyst, Peter Matejic,putsit: “Poverty in the UK is still not just widespread, it is deeper and more damaging than at any point in the last 30 years.”Tory austerian-in-chief George Osborne and his imitators have a lot to answer for. But Mr Matejic’s chastening observation is also directly relevant to today’s political debates. Much of the Westminster bubble appears to be in thrall to thenotionthat Britain’s welfare budget must be cut substantially in the age of Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, in order that the nation’s resources can be diverted towards security spending. As this report starkly underlines, millions of the poorest people in the country – many of them in work – would not be in any position to weather such a storm. They are already being forced to go without food, deep in debt and unable to pay their bills.The moral bankruptcy of “guns versus butter” arguments will not stop the likes of Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage making them,supplementedby bogus talk of fostering “personal responsibility”. But having belatedly scrapped the two-child benefit cap, it ought to become the Labour government’s vocation to make a different socioeconomic case between now and the next election.After being plunged into penury by spiralling food, energy and housing costs, a substantial section of the population is unable to do more than live from day to day. Subsistence-level basic benefits and prolonged wage stagnation have compounded the crisis. A shaming number of families are routinely hungry, tired, stressed and isolated, and in no position to make a bigger contribution to the rest of society.This is a scandal, of course. But in solely economic terms, the doom loop of despair is also a colossal waste of available human capital. Such squandered potential will not be accessed through welfare cuts that circumscribe impoverished lives even further. Nor will rearming at the expense of the least well-off do anything for social cohesion at a time when far-right forces are successfully exploiting a crisis of faith in politics.From thegreat crash of 2008to the cost of living crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Britain’s economy stagnated and its poorest citizens got even poorer. As the JRF points out, a more adequately resourced welfare state would act as a catalyst for growth by restoring economic agency to those who need it most. A reframing of the welfare debate is overdue. When will the penny drop at Westminster?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Her white paper aims toredraw the policing map of England(though policing is devolved, the other nations will feel the effects). If she succeeds, the current patchwork will be replaced by a multi-tier system. The 43 existing police forces, most serving a single county, will be abolished and replaced with a smaller number of bigger organisations.Above all this will sit a newNational Police Service– likened to a British FBI – that will take over responsibility for counter-terrorism from London’s Metropolitan police, and for serious and organised crime from the National Crime Agency set up under David Cameron. It will also take over major fraud investigations, as well as functions of the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the College of Policing. Training, standards and leadership will henceforth be under one umbrella. The leader of this organisation will be the country’s most senior officer.Ministers know that while some violent crime has fallen – with London’smurder rateat a decade low –shopliftingand phone thefts are driving a public sense that crime is rising, a feeling exploited by the Tories and Reform UK. With this in mind, new local police areas will have to keep bobbies on the beat busy and visible. Police and crime commissioners will be scrapped and replaced by local boards. Policing by consent must remain central.This is anambitious, sprawling package, which, due to its long timelines, will need cross-party support. It is also incomplete, with proposals for mergers between forces still being drawn up. Of its disparate elements, the case for a new, national force is most clearly made and will be most easily grasped by voters. The Met’s national role in counter-terrorism is a peculiarity, and online and organised crime obviously do not sit cleanly within force boundaries. Indeed, sending young people across them is how “county lines” drug dealers got their name.But while it is easy enough to see a role for a beefed-up national body, how such an organisation will maintain the local connections that underpin policing by consent is worryingly unclear. Recent events inMinneapolisprovide a chilling warning about how centralised and unaccountable law enforcement can operate under certain conditions. Labour must address the fact thatincreased powers for the home secretarybring risks as well as benefits. Operational independence must remain sacrosanct, with strong checks and balances.Efficiency gains are, as ever, presented as the prize of reorganisation. Lack of detail on the inevitable costs is one concern about the plans. Another is whether progress is really possible whilecourt backlogsremain a huge obstacle in the wider criminal justice system. Ms Mahmood also needs to explain her view that bigger forces are better, since this is not supported by data on crime clear-up rates. New targets also require close scrutiny, given previous examples of the way they can skew priorities. Warnings that forces can “hit the target and miss the point” must be addressed.Ms Mahmood is among the government’s more effective explainers and it suitsLabourpolitically to attack the last government’s record on law and order by announcing sweeping change. But overhauls of public services often disappoint. An intensive period of scrutiny and challenge must come next.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The problem is that that is not how the decision of the Labour party’s national executive committee will be read. And this is now a pattern.Kicking off with the foolhardy acceptance of luxury goodies fromLord Alli, fast followed by the removal of pensioners’ winter fuel payments and going on to a failure to read the runes over the grooming gangs and many other depressing own goals, this government has demonstrated a quite astonishing lack of self-awareness.Keir Starmer is now beginning to resemble, of all unlikely people, Boris Johnson in his seeming inability to grasp how badly some of his decisions – and subsequent reversals – reflect on him. Good government is not simply a matter of making rational decisions; it is an art, and requires a competence and a finesse and a degree of sophistication which the Starmer government has now irredeemably demonstrated that it lacks.Salley VickersLondonWell, that is the final straw for me.Labourvalues of equality of opportunity, wealth redistribution, fairness in society and equal justice were something I have passionately believed in all my life, so I have always voted for the party. When it was elected in 2024 with a landslide I celebrated, believing that at last we had a strong, sensible leader and enough political heft to produce real societal change. I was wrong.Keir Starmer is a manager (and not a very good one), certainly not a visionary leader, and – if there were any doubt – he has just ably demonstrated his (and his political machine’s) fear and weakness in blocking a proven effective leader,Andy Burnham, from returning to parliamentary politics in case he challenges him. Pathetic. If the Labour party is too fearful to accommodate someone of Burnham’s proven talents, it is no longer the party for me.Dr Pam MeldingSt Helens, MerseysideNeal Lawson writes in favour of Andy Burnham’s wish to re-enter parliament as soon as possible (Labour can reverse its decision to block Andy Burnham. Here is why it must, 25 January). He fails to ask why Burnham has chosen now to do it.He could have stood down at the last mayoral election in 2024 or he could wait until 2028, when the next election is due. This would have meant much less fuss, probably a smooth handover and considerably less expense.If he wanted just to be a constituency MP, either of these options would have made much more sense than jumping ship now. It is clear that his real ambition is to be prime minister, and take advantage of the mess that Keir Starmer finds himself in, and he is afraid that if he doesn’t go for it now, either Starmer will have steadied the ship or someone like Wes Streeting will have taken over.By choosing the course of action that he has, Burnham has shown himself to be a chancer not deserving of anyone’s support.Gordon GlassfordCorby, NorthamptonshireLabour’s national executive committee had no other option. Andy Burnham has clearly been positioning himself as a potential successor to Keir Starmer in the event of a leadership contest. Having him in parliament would be a gift to Reform UK, the Conservatives and the rightwing press, and would clearly undermine Starmer’s authority.In the grand scheme, winning or losing the byelection is immaterial. We are 18 months into a five-year term, and Starmer deserves a proper chance to carry out his project.By the end of Burnham’s mayoral term in 2028, he and we will have a clearer idea of whether the government has succeeded in turning things around. To those who have already given up on Starmer: remember where Margaret Thatcher was in the polls at the same point in her first premiership.Nick ShackletonMaulden, BedfordshireSorry, but Andy Burnham is in the wrong. To try to return to parliament, where he could launch a leadership bid, and expect everyone to clear a path for him is irresponsible, disruptive and disloyal – not to say arrogant. In the words of Lyndon B Johnson, quoted in your editorial (23 January), he should stop being “outside the tent pissing in”. Yes, Keir Starmer must change or go, but we need someone who is fresh and dynamic. If not Wes Streeting, someone else who can bring genuine change.Tim OelmanChichesterWhile it is disingenuous of Andy Burnham to pretend his primary motive for seeking a seat in parliament is not driven by blind ambition, Keir Starmer’s allies have seriously misread the optics of their decision. It looks like a beleaguered autocrat suppressing opposition and we know how this often ends. This may not be accurate, but across the country Starmer will be seen as lacking the self-belief to see off a leadership challenge. Labour is once again focusing on putting the ball into their own net rather than in the opposition’s. And to think we waited 14 long years.Bill DhadliLondon“Now is not the time for a Labour leadership election” said the headline on a Polly Toynbee article on 18 November. Now, barely two months later, she thinks Keir Starmer should be replaced and argues that “it’s now clear to all that he’s not the one to lead that fight” against Nigel Farage (Here’s the lesson of the Andy Burnham saga: Labour needs a new leader – fast, 26 January). All? Or just those who up until now have defended him to the hilt? If the latter have now deserted him, then Starmer really is toast.Derrick CameronStoke-on-TrentGood to know that Labour’s decision to prevent Andy Burnham from resigning as mayor is based on sound financial reasoning (‘Huge mistake’: Labour in turmoil as Burnham blocked from byelection race, 25 January). Has Keir Starmer considered the possibility of cancelling the next general election on the basis that it will cost too much?Ron JacobLondonMay I please remind Labour party MPs and members of the howls of outrage they produced when the Conservative party changed leaders repeatedly? May I also remind them that nothing is calculated more to infuriate voters, and send them into the arms of other parties, than secret backroom machinations, eagerly leaked to the press, about leadership?Pamela GuyattGunnislake, Cornwall“I would be there to support the work of the government, not undermine it,” said Andy Burnham in hisletter to the chair of Labour’s national executive committee. And they say northern comedy has died out.Peter BrookerWest Wickham, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Before Piggott’s Manor was sold to George Harrison, it was the preliminary training school of St Bartholomew’s hospital in Smithfield, London, where 18-year-old would-be nurses spent three months before being let loose on real patients – learning how to bandage, give bed baths and change bed sheets with the “patient” still in it (practising on each other), give injections (into oranges), present food in an appetising way and – most importantly – to clean.Following this three-month period, we spent the next two-and-three-quarter years on the wards (as a form of apprenticeship) doing actual nursing work of greater complexity and responsibility. A far cry from the major cultural shift of today’s nurse training spent in universities and on placements.Dr Liz Rolls-FirthCheltenham, GloucestershireExplore more on these topicsNursingHealthNHSGeorge HarrisonThe BeatleslettersShareReuse this content"

Plus a letter fromElizabeth BelcherTue 27 Jan 2026 12.19 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 15.08 ESTShareSimon Jenkins is right to point out the growing feasibility of older people choosing to work into their 80s (Mary Berry, and now Prue Leith. Retiring in your 80s is the new 60s, 23 January). As he says, older people are far healthier than they used to be and continuing to be economically active is generally good for one’s health.But I feel that he, and successive governments, have missed a trick. He states that “the idea of Britons becoming useless at 60 was increasingly unreal”, yet as soon as retirement age is reached, one ceases to pay national insurance (NI). I was astonished when I no longer paid NI after the then retirement age – yet I would not have missed it in my extra two years of teaching. It would have simply been a continuation of what I’d already been paying.With work and pensions records online, why is it not possible for older people to continue to pay NI, adding to their pension pot and contributing to the public purse at the same time, pro rata their working hours and salary? Change the rule to: if you are working, you pay national insurance, regardless of age.Anne AyresHuthwaite, NottinghamshireAs Simon Jenkins writes, there are indeed “unquantifiable virtues that come with age”. But as a mentally and physically active man in his 70s, I can’t help noticing that ageism remains widespread in business, government, news media, comedy and everywhere else – explicitly or implicitly.Contrary to the insulting common view, we are not sitting in slippers and cardigans, listening to Vera Lynn on our gramophones and bemoaning the “good old days”. Many of us are still active and still trying to make the world a better place – our “unquantifiable virtues” remaining intact, perhaps even enhanced over the years.Brian CooksonChair, Active LancashireScenario: travelling by train through gloomy London.

It’s through humour. That’s another area of why he’s going to be a great leader because he has that side to him as well.“He showed his calmness, his clarity under pressure. He also showed humour as well. Hopefully, it’s received in the right way. Definitely no malice behind it. He’s just trying to have a bit of a joke with his teammates.”Root hailed Brook’s captaincy after Sri Lanka got off to a rapid start in their chase of 358. “They got off to an absolute flyer in that second innings and he was very calm and knew what he wanted to do,” the 35-year-old said. “A team’s throwing a few punches at you and to be able to stay calm, keep in control of everything was another example of why I think he’s going to be an excellent captain.”The pair had worked closely together in the nets on Monday and brought their work to the middle, their unbeaten partnership worth 191. “We were just talking about angles, using our sweeps, being able to pull the ball from different lines, maybe slightly unconventional to what you do in England or other parts of the world, that can be really effective here.“When you’ve got his ability and his skill level he can put it into practice straight away and it’s just phenomenal to see him take that from yesterday into today. And that’s what we want from any team, you want to be sharing ideas and experience and if there’s anyway you can add to the guys around you and help them that’s your role as a senior player within the team.“I enjoyed watching it from the other end and I’m sure everyone enjoyed watching it in the stands and on the TV as well.”Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamJoe RootHarry BrookCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Regulations state they must receive a minimum “contact time” of 20 hours a week excluding matchdays and mealtimes. For players aged 23 and over, the minimum salary is £26,900.The first Women’s Champions Cup: what is it and should we pay attention?Read moreUnder UK law, any employee aged 21 or over must be paid at least £12.21 an hour, which equates to £23,810 a year based on a typical working week of 37.5 hours. An 18-year-old, on the national minimum wage of £10 an hour, should be paid £19,500 if working 37.5 hours a week. Thereal living wageof £13.45 an hour equates to £26,227 a year on a 37.5-hour week. In London the figure is £14.80 an hour.Holly Murdoch, the chief operating officer of WSL Football, said when the minimum salaries were announced in September: “We wanted to make sure that they could focus on being a footballer, not focus on a part-time job.”The minimum salaries are a marked enhancement on previous seasons, when for example Blackburn were reportedly paying some players £9,000 a year. The Lancashire clubwithdrew from the second tierbefore this season, saying the “demands placed on second-tier clubs have become unsustainable”.It is understood many WSL2 clubs are comfortably exceeding the minimum salaries and that the vast majority of WSL2 players aged 18 to 20 are at least 15% above the floor level.The minimum amounts were put in place after consultation with the Professional Footballers’ Association and have largely been welcomed as a step forward. Sources with knowledge of the discussions said a careful balancing act had to be struck to ensure long-term financial sustainability. A significant proportion of lower-paid WSL2 players were reliant on having second jobs before this season.In the top tier, the minimum salaries for WSL players are higher: £42,500 for players aged 23 and over, £34,700 for 21- and 22-year-olds and £26,900 for 18- to 20-year-olds.“This initial floor establishes a baseline and it’s a foundation we are fully committed to building upon,” a WSL spokesperson said. “There was no salary floor for players up until this season, and minimum salaries have been implemented as the result of an 18-month consultative process involving key stakeholders. The floor is higher than the minimum wage for an equivalent age, based on 20 hours per week.”There are also salary-cap rules in place this season. These state that the player wage bill must not exceed the two following figures combined: 80% of the club’s revenue, plus up to £4m or a further 25% of the club’s revenue (whichever is higher). It means a cash-rich WSL2 owner can spend £4m of their money on player wages without breaching the cap.For most clubs, £4m is substantially more than 25% of their revenue.Deloitte saidonly Arsenal (£22.2m) and Chelsea (£22m) among WSL clubs had revenue of more than £16m in the 2024-25 season, with Manchester City next on its list with £11.2m.Any club found in breach of the cap could face a fine and points deduction, it can be revealed. A top-flight team can have a point deducted for every £100,000 of overspending, with a deduction of 10 points or more for an overspend of more than £900,000. In WSL2, one point can be deducted for every £50,000 of overspending.On Tuesday, the company running the WSL and WSL2 published its first accounts since the leagues started being run independently of the Football Association. They show an operating loss of £8.2m between 24 April 2024 – when the company was incorporated – and 31 July 2025, much of which is attributed to the costs associated with building a new business, and is said to be “in line with the business plan”. The accounts showed a cash balance of £10.7m.Revenue totalled £17.4m and has climbed this season, such that as of earlier this month, commercial revenue is understood to have trebled since the split from the FA.The company drew down £6.1m from £20m loan from the Premier League, which will not start to be repaid until the 2030-31 season. A further £4.4m has been drawn this season, and the accounts reveal the Premier League will be repaid at an interest rate 2% above the Barclays Bank base rate at the time of the drawdown.The highest-paid director, who is not named but is expected to be the chief executive, Nikki Doucet, was paid £531,000 including pension contributions. The directors and senior management team combined earned £1.37m.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballWomen's Super League 2Women's Super LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

However, the host union wants to move it to a neutral venue to maximise the revenue they receive from gate receipts.The Breakdown | So much at stake and Six Nations just the start in ‘massive year for rugby union’Read moreSteve Borthwick’s side had originally been scheduled to play Fiji in South Africa before travelling to Argentina to play the Pumas for their final summer fixture on 18 July, but the Fiji Rugby Union is understood to have asked permission from the Nations Championship organisers to switch it to England.World Rugby, the Six Nations and Sanzaar have all given their blessing on the proviso that the game is not held at England’s home ground of Twickenham for integrity reasons.While the contract has yet to be signed, Everton’s new stadium is understood to be the preferred option for all parties, with negotiations over the terms of the agreement still ongoing. There are relatively few other options available, as Wembley, the Emirates Stadium and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium all have gigs booked during July, while neither Manchester United or City have been approached.England games away from Twickenham are relatively rare, and the Rugby Football Union is privately delighted at being given an unexpected opportunity to take the national team on the road. England played a World Cup warm-up match at Newcastle’s St James’ Park in 2019, and a pool game in the 2015 competition against Uruguay was held at the Etihad Stadium.World Rugby is understood to have sanctioned the switch due to the lack of suitable venues in Fiji and a desire to help the financial growth of the smaller unions. The venues for Fiji’s other notional Nations Championship home games this summer against Wales and Scotland have also yet to be announced.Everton have moved quickly to establish Bramley-Moore Dock as a leading multi-sport venue since the 53,000-capacity stadium at the start of the season. A rugby league Ashes Test match between England and Australiaattracted a sell-out crowd in November, the sport’s Magic Weekend involving all 14 Super League clubs will take place there in July, while Scotland this week announced it as the venue for an international friendly against Côte d’Ivoire on 31 March as they prepare for this summer’s World Cup. Everton and the Six Nations declined to comment.England’s preparations for the upcoming Six Nations have suffered a setback with the announcement that second-choice loosehead Fin Baxter must undergo foot surgery.Baxter was set to travel to Girona for the squad’s pre-tournament training camp before their opener against Wales on 7 February after being included on a list of five players who were to undergo rehabilitation for injuries in the hope they would recover in time for the opening rounds. However, no date for Baxter’s return has now been set.Senior tighthead Will Stuart had already been ruled out of the entire Six Nations because of a ruptured Achilles while Asher Opoku-Fordjour is also unavailable for the campaign after undergoing shoulder surgery.Harlequins back row Jack Kenningham has been added to England’s training squad for the trip to Spain with Ben Curry staying at Sale as part of his rehabilitation from injury.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionNations ChampionshipEngland rugby union teamFiji rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Fortunately, he is OK and did not sustain any serious injuries,” read a team statement. “In general, as a team we would like to urge fans on bikes to always put safety first. For both your own and others’ wellbeing, please allow riders to train and give them as much space and peace as possible.”Jay Vine recovers from kangaroo crash to win Tour Down Under for second timeRead moreVingegaard’s crash came to light after amateur cyclist Pedro García Fernández posted on his Strava account that he had followed the Dane, and also posted pictures of his own descent behind the 29-year-old. Fernández wrote that Vingegaard had “crashed while trying to drop me on the descent of Fuente la Reina” and, after stopping to check on the two-time Tour de France champion, said that Vingegaard “got angry with me for following him down the hill”.Fernández said in his post: “You can be a professional, but you can also be humble. He was going fast to drop me and ended up on the ground. I don’t make a living from this, and I’m just an amateur like most people, so I don’t understand his anger as a professional about it.”Another amateur cyclist claimed to be a witness to the aftermath of the crash. A Strava user named S.Enduro, commenting on Fernández’s post, claimed that he had found Vingegaard with a bleeding face on the side of the road.“You both passed me coming down, and as I was almost at the last bend, I found Jonas by the guardrail, his face bleeding in two places,” read the comment. “He must have hit it hard to drag his face along the ground. I stopped too and asked him if he needed help, and he told me no, to go away, very angry. Now I understand.“It’s clear he’s the professional and responsible for how he goes up or down, but I also think that people like him, who are professionals and have so much at stake, should be given their space and respected. They risk their lives, their salaries, and the livelihoods of many people around them. It seems to me he felt a bit pressured and went down faster than he should have on a road he doesn’t know well.”Incidents involving professional riders and amateur cyclists are common, especially in an age where amateurs attempt to film video content on the road. Last week, Vingegaard was seen on the roadwarning amateur cyclist Artem Shcherbyna about a blind corneron a two-way road as Shcherbyna tried to take a video of the Visma-Lease a Bike rider in training. Mathieu van der Poel, another huge name in cycling,narrowly avoided a nasty crashin December after agreeing to a sprint race with amateur Anatole Leboucher.Despite his crash, Vingegaard seems likely to recover for his season opener at the UAE Tour in mid-February. Vingegaard has already confirmed that he will race at this year’s Giro d’Italia in May for the first time in his career, as the Dane – winner of the Tour de France in2022and2023andVuelta a España champion last year– aims to become the first cyclist to win a career Grand Tour hat-trick since Chris Froome completed the feat in 2018.Explore more on these topicsCyclingJonas VingegaardnewsShareReuse this content"

Heavily disadvantaged by his 82kg (181lb) weight – far heavier than his rivals – poor eyesight and the small matter of being entirely self-funded, he became Great Britain’s first Olympic ski jumper. He finished 67th and last at the 1987 world championships but managed to hit the qualifying standard to secure the sole British spot for Calgary. At the Games, he finished last in the normal hill (70m) and large hill (90m) events. In the normal hill, he scored 69.2 points from two jumps of 55m, while the winner Matti Nykänen scored 229.1 points from 89.5m jumps. Despite the last-place finishes, his enthusiasm captured global media attention but also lead to the “Eddie the Eagle Rule” which was introduced to tighten entry requirements and prevent similar “Olympic tourists”.View image in fullscreenEddie Edwards soars above the slope as he makes his second jump of the day during the 90m ski jump competition at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.Photograph: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images2Ledecka’s double gold shock, Pyeongchang 2018Ester Ledecka made headlines in her native Czech Republic not once, but twice, after becoming the first athlete to win gold in two different sports at the same Winter Games. Known primarily for snowboarding, she entered the Super-G Alpine skiing event and, starting with the late bib number 26, snatched the gold medal by 0.01sec over the defending champion Anna Veith. Before the upset, Ledecka’s highest World Cup finish in the Super-G had been 19th. A week later, Ledecka returned to her primary sport to comfortably win gold in the parallel giant slalom snowboarding.View image in fullscreenEster Ledecka (centre) was stunned to win in the 2018 Super-G.Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters3Nigeria’s Winter pioneers, Pyeongchang 2018History was made in Pyeongchang by the four women who formed Nigeria’s firstWinter Olympicsdelegation. The two-woman bobsleigh squad of Seun Adigun, Ngozi Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga finished 19th out of 20 sleds after four runs (the Russian team was disqualified for doping). Joining them to represent Nigeria at the Games was the skeleton racer Simidele Adeagbo, who finished 20th in her event over four runs. The three bobsledders, former track and field athletes, crowdfunded their journey and trained using a makeshift wooden sled built in Texas, United States. Their participation marked the first time any African country had been represented in the sport of bobsleigh at the Winter Games.View image in fullscreen(From left) Seun Adigun, Akuoma Omeoga, Ngozi Onwumere and Simidele Adeagbo talk to the media after the welcoming ceremony at the 2018 Winter Olympics.Photograph: Eric Seals/Imagn Images/Reuters4Keshavan’s lifelong journey, Nagano 1998 to Pyeongchang 2018Debuting at Nagano 1998 at just 16 years old, India’s Shiva Keshavan became the youngest luger in the history of the Winter Olympics. Over two decades, he represented his country in luge at six consecutive Games. In 2002, the Italian luge team offered their resources in exchange for competing under their flag, which he refused. That same year he was forced to hitchhike to the Games in Salt Lake City from Montreal. While a medal remained predictably elusive – his best finish was 25th in Turin 2006 – his perseverance was remarkable given the lack of infrastructure in India, often necessitating training on dangerous, makeshift Himalayan tracks and self-funding his costs. Keshavan did achieve regional success, however, setting an Asian speed record of 134.3km/h and winning two Asian Luge Cup gold medals in 2011 and 2012. He retired after Pyeongchang 2018, finishing 34th out of 40 in his final men’s singles event.5Bradbury’s calculated fluke, Salt Lake City 2002Steven Bradbury’s gold medal in the men’s 1000m short-track speed skating remains one of the greatest flukes in Olympic history and Australia’s first Winter Olympic gold. In the chaotic five-man final, Bradbury stayed far back and at the last bend watched as all four leading skaters – Li Jiajun, Apolo Ohno, Ahn Hyun-soo and Mathieu Turcotte – collided. While they slid on to the ice, Bradbury, the only man left standing, glided over the finish line with a time of 1min 29.109sec. The then 28-year-old instantly became an Australian icon (and meme). He is now a motivational speaker who teaches others – unsurprisingly – the benefits of persistence and resilience.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Steven Bradbury crosses the line ahead of the USA’s Apolo Ohno (centre) and Canada’s Mathieu Turcotte to win gold.Photograph: Gero Breloer/EPA6Boit’s embrace, Nagano 1998In the 10km classical cross-country skiing event at Nagano 1998, Philip Boit made history as Kenya’s first Winter Olympian. The former middle-distance runner, who had switched to skiing only two years prior, finished in 92nd, the last man over the line. His finishing time was nearly eight minutesbehind the second-to-last finisher, and nearly double the time of the winner Bjorn Dæhlie’s 27min 24.5sec. Despite the vast difference in performance, the Norwegian gold medallist waited at the finish line to greet Boit with an embrace. This act moved Boit so much that he later named his first son, Dæhlie Boit, in honour of the champion. “All my friends and family said he had to be a very good-hearted man because he waited for me in Nagano, and that I should keep his name in my family,” said Boit.View image in fullscreenBjorn Dæhlie waits to greet last-placed finisher Philip Boit.Photograph: AlamyExplore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsThe joy of sixWinter Olympics 2026SkiingBobsleighSpeed skatingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While tests are still to confirm the prognosis there is concern the Dane has a hamstring problem that will cause him to miss several weeks, with some reports stating his absence may be more than two months.Carrick’s cult of common sense gets Manchester United believing againRead moreDorgu has been a key factor in United’s upturn, scoring in each of Carrick’s opening two matches. His goal against Arsenal came after an equally important one inUnited’s 2-0 victory over Manchester Citythe previous weekend. He also scored the winner in the 1-0 Boxing Day victory over Newcastle, making it three goals in his last seven appearances.It is understood United could decide go into the transfer market to cover Dorgu’s absence, with Kader Meïté of Rennes among the names being monitored. The 18-year-old striker, who is also of interest to the Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, has scored three times in Ligue 1 this season and was called up for France’s Under 21 squad last year. United are believed to have made contact with Meïté’s representatives but have not decided whether to step up their interest as they assess whether to sign a No 9 or winger.United next host Fulham on Sunday, before which the supporters group the 1958 will stage its latest protest against the club’s ownership. After their previously targeting the Glazer family, who have been majority owners for approaching 21 years, Sunday’s action will also be directed at Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the chief executive of the chemicals firm Ineos and United’s largest single minority owner.A spokesperson from the 1958 said: “Recent results are down to Michael Carrick and the players and they have come in spite of our inept ownership, not because of it. This club continues to fumble from one calamity to the next. Fans should not be fooled by two good results. We have been here too many times before. Our protest has never been about performances on the pitch. Not now, and not once in the last 21 years. We are judging a dysfunctional ownership model that has repeatedly failedManchester United.“Jim Ratcliffe is a successful and wealthy businessman. But in a football sense, for many he comes across as a clueless clown, making one poor decision after another, with no cohesive plan. For us, this club is being dragged through chaos by clown ownership, capped off by a circus stadium design [for a new venue] that perfectly symbolises how far standards and ambition have fallen. We feel United is broken and Ratcliffe cannot fix the mess that started with the Glazers and he is adding to. We have no confidence in him or Ineos. They all need to go along with the hated Glazers. They have turned United into a laughing stock.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The area remained under a flood alert on Tuesday evening.Devon and Cornwall policeurged people not to travelin Exeter and east and mid-Devon unless they urgently needed to. Devon and Somerset fire service rescued people from 25 vehicles stranded in flood water, with a spokesperson confirming there were no casualties.View image in fullscreenWaves hit the Cornish village of Kingsand during Storm Chandra.Photograph: Mark Passmore PhotographyThe leader of Devon county council, Julian Brazil, told the Guardian the floods demonstrated how vulnerable the region was. “We feel a bit cut off down here. The south-west feels let down.”He said a good illustration was the rail network. Services between London and south-west England on Tuesday were cancelled, delayed or involved bus transfers because of flooding on the line between Taunton and Exeter.“We feel we’re being left behind,” Brazil said. “We’ve seen billions pumped in [to rail services] up north, and that’s about just shaving a few minutes off the times getting to London. What we’d like is to actually be able to get to London on the train at all.”His complaints echoed those of people in Cornwall this month, many of whom wereleft without power, waterand internetafter Storm Goretti.View image in fullscreenA flooded road in Helston, Cornwall.Photograph: Jory Mundy/Getty ImagesRichard Foord, the MP for Honiton and Sidmouth in Devon, said people were having a “horrendous” time and he predicted the number of properties flooded would increase.The Devon Wildlife Trust expressed concern for thebeaversthat live in and around the River Otter. A spokesperson said: “Despite being semi-aquatic mammals, rapidly rising and rapidly moving water is a threat to them, especially young, less experienced animals. Floods will overwhelm their burrows and lodges, the sheer force of the water can be too much for them to swim against and submerged debris represents a threat.”Residents of the Somerset Levels, a low-lying area very vulnerable to flooding, feared their homes could be at risk again. TheFloodingon the Levels Action Group (Flag) claimed the authorities had not funded maintenance of the waterways sufficiently. It also expressed concern that earlier this month, as heavy rain fell, a pumping station that removes water from the area was not operating because of planned electrical works.Flag’s spokesperson Bryony Sadler said there was concern homes could be flooded. “We’re tentatively starting to move stuff. I’ve rung neighbours this morning to tell them to move animals out,” she said.Extreme rainfall is becoming more common and more intense in many parts of the world because of human-caused climate breakdown. This is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding is also affected by human factors such as the existence of flood defences and land use.The Met Office said 105mm (4.13in) of rain fell on parts of Dartmoor in Devon in 12 hours. The strongest winds recorded were 75mph gusts at St Bees Head in Cumbria and 63mph at Machrihanish on the west coast of Scotland.By late evening on Tuesday there were 96 flood warnings in England, meaning flooding was expected, and more than 250 alerts, meaning flooding was possible, with heavy rain falling on already saturated ground. There were three flood warnings and 17 alerts inWales, with eight warnings and eight alerts in place across Scotland.View image in fullscreenWorkers assess the situation near an abandoned car in flood water near Fenny Bridge in Ottery St Mary.Photograph: Brook Mitchell/Getty ImagesThere was significant travel disruption because of rain, wind or snow in northern England and south Wales.Domestic flights were cancelled on routes serving Birmingham, East Midlands, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heathrow, Leeds Bradford, London City, Manchester and Southampton airports on Tuesday.Yellow weather warnings have been issued for ice on Wednesday morning covering much of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and southern and central Scotland.A yellow weather warning for rain is also in place for South West England on Thursday, with the Met Office saying that further rain could bring more flooding and transport disruption.In Devon, one man, Billy Vernon, described how he and his sons, 14 and 17, were trapped by flood water upstairs in a house close to the River Axe and he had to wade through waist-deep water to fetch supplies.He said water began coming into the house at 4am on Tuesday. “It was frightening. My son came running in panicking saying that the house was filling up with water. All of the furniture is destroyed and the walls are going to have to be redone.”The rail operator GWR said that after Storm Ingrid at the weekend a large sinkhole had appeared in Devon and would need to be filled, leading to a closure of the line between Exeter St Davids and Newton Abbott overnight on Wednesday and into Thursday.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherDevonCornwallHampshireDorsetFloodingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The influx followed a bloom of bluebottles that washed up on Victorian beaches in December.jellyfish floating in waterTheir presence ebbed and flowed with the wind and waves, although numbers appeared to have declined from a week ago when the arrival of a “massive smack” of jellies caused the closure of one Melbourne beach.‘I’ve never watered it’: how an Australian groundskeeper achieved the world’s ugliest lawnRead moreMost of the current lot were about the size of a peach, he said, with “quite long tentacles” stretching up to about a metre, sometimes more. Some could reportedlygrow up to a metre across, however.“The joys of an Australian summer!”said Bayside city councilon social media, noting jellyfish sightings and strandings were a natural and seasonal occurrence.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterThe council, with coastline stretching from Brighton to Beaumaris, advised beachgoers to take care when swimming, walking barefoot on the sand, or with dogs.Their sting could be painful, and potentially dangerous for young children, older people and those with allergies.View image in fullscreenA lion’s mane jellyfish below Frankston pier in Melbourne, Friday 23 January 2026.Photograph: Jay Kogler/AAP“If you can see jellyfish in the shallows, don’t swim,” a Life Saving Victoria spokesperson advised. “Stick to patrolled beaches and always swim between the red and yellow flags. Don’t touch jellyfish on the sand as they can still sting.”“If you’re stung, get out of the water and seek help from a lifesaver or lifeguard if present,” the spokesperson said. “Rinse with seawater, remove any tentacles carefully, use hot water for pain relief, and call 000 if there are any serious symptoms.”The species,Cyanea annaskala, is native to south-eastern Australia, but their recent unusual numbers close to shore is thought to be linked to warm water, nutrients and onshore winds.Jellyfish expert Dr Jonathan Lawley said lion’s mane jellies were “not very good swimmers”, and tended to drift with the current and the wind.“We often only observe them when the tide and currents bring them to shore – that’s when we see these huge numbers.”View image in fullscreenA jellyfish near the shore at Sandringham beach in Melbourne, Friday 23 January 2026.Photograph: Jay Kogler/AAPThe jellyfish stage was only a temporary part of their life cycle, he said. Larvae, called polyps, lay at the bottom of the sea until the right conditions triggered them to “strobilate” – dividing into dozens of tiny baby jellyfish.The trigger might be a change in temperature, Lawley said, or other factors like rainfall or food availability could play a role.There was little evidence to support sensationalist fears of a looming “jellygeddon” due to climate change, he said. Some species may be increasing in response to global heating, while others were thought to be in decline.Jellies were often viewed negatively due to their risk to the public, he said, but they performed an important role in the food web and the environment. Some fish appeared to use jellyfish swarms as protection against predators.Blooms could persist for days or weeks, he said, until the adults spawned and died, or were eaten by other marine animals.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentAustralian climate and environment in focusOceansWildlifeMelbourneVictoriaShareReuse this content"

Ministers are understood to have overruled the cuts, it emerged after the Guardian contacted the department.The Department for Education (DfE) is also planning cuts to PE from its own budget before changes in the next curriculum review. It is hoped that the changes – which will guarantee at least two hours of PE – will involve partnerships with sports bodies that will deliver some efficiencies.But Whitehall sources had said the proposed cuts from DHSC and DfE combined had threatened the plans and would undermineKeir Starmer’s public commitments to more access to sports for schoolchildren.A proposal seen by the Guardian said the DHSC, run by the health secretary, Wes Streeting, would end its entire contribution of about £60m from 2026/27. The DfE is understood to be proposing cutting its own budget by a further £60m. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister, is expected to mediate in the row over the coming days.The DHSC contributes about a fifth of the funding for PE, with the rest from the DfE, apart from a small contribution from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.The proposed cuts came despite growing concerns about inactivity among children contributing to obesity and lasting health inequalities. Sporting bodies including Sport England have been highlightinga growing problem with inactivity among children, with fewer than half of children meeting thechief medical officer’sguidelines.Government figurespublished last year confirm a significant decline in the number of hours allocated to PE in secondary schools, down nearly 4,000. The most significant drop in hours has affected 11-14-year-olds – the group that is also experiencing the fastest growth in obesity.The Youth Sport Trust warned last yearthat nearly one in five students have had PE lessons cancelled this academic year and 71% of young people surveyed said they wanted to be more active at school.In the days beforethe Lionesses went to the Uefa Women’s Euro 2025tournament, Starmer stressed how important access to sport was for schools and young people. He said the government would ensure there was “equal access to high quality PE and sport” and said schools should publish their PE and sports offerings.“I’m delighted we are delivering on your call to ensure they have the opportunity to go on and play – maybe even forEnglandone day,” Starmer said.The changes to PE from next year proposed by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, will replace the sports premium with a PE and school sports partnership network from the next academic year, mandating two hours a week of physical activity and building partnerships with schools and local sports clubs.It will also require schools to advertise their sports offering publicly to parents and is intended to address regional disparities in sports offerings.In November last year, Streeting said his department was committed to helping schools tackle childhood obesity. “This government will not look away as kids get unhealthier and critics urge us to leave them behind.Obesityrobs children of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions,” he said, reacting to new childhood obesity figures.“Today’s figures show the extent of the problem and the need to act now, which is exactly what we’re doing – in schools, on sports pitches and online – to make healthy choices the easy choices.”A government spokesperson said: “This government’s mission is to break down barriers to opportunity ensuring every child benefits from high-quality PE and sports education.“Too many young people remain inactive and the quality of school sport and physical activity on offer is not consistent across the country.“Our new partnerships programme will put an end to this, bringing together schools, local clubs and national governing bodies to target funding and support where it is needed most – including supporting more disadvantaged pupils and those with Send.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenObesityEnglandHealthLabourSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs posted online showed at least two carriages ablaze next to a snow-covered rail bed.Ukraine war briefing: Nato chief warns of ‘harshest winter’ in a decade as Russian attacks cut power in KharkivRead more“In any country, a drone strike on a civilian train would be considered in exactly the same way – purely as terrorism. There is not and cannot be any military purpose in this,” Zelenskyy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.He said the latest bombardment undermined peace efforts and urged allies to step up pressure on Moscow to end the war.“Every such Russian strike erodes the diplomacy that is still ongoing and undermines the efforts of partners who are helping to end this war,” he wrote on social media.Prosecutors said one drone struck the train and two more hit an area alongside it.In his post on Telegram, Zelenskyy said train was carrying more than 200 passengers, including 18 in the carriage that was hit.Prosecutors had said earlier that 155 passengers were on board the train. The deputy prime minister, Oleksiy Kuleba, had described the attack by three drones as a “direct act of Russian terror”.Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, chief of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine’s national railway, thanked rescue teams and fellow passengers who helped evacuate people, and pledged that trains would keep running.“Keeping things moving is becoming more difficult,” Pertsovskyi wrote on Facebook. “We are regrouping. There will be additional strict security measures in some places, but even on those most frightening days, we cannot give up.”A barrage of more than 50 Russian drones killed three people and wounded more than 30 in the southern city of Odesa, regional officials said.The Black Sea city, key for Ukrainian exports, has been routinely pummelled by Russian forces since they invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago. Regional governor Oleh Kiper said a woman, who was 39 weeks pregnant, and two girls were among the wounded.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The chasm continues to widen, raising fears it could swallow the town’s historic centre.“This is a dramatic landslide,” Massimiliano Conti, the mayor of Niscemi, a town in the south of the island, said in a video on social media, while urging people living beyond the cordoned-off areas to “stay home”.“I don’t want anyone to take this event lightly,” he added. “Fortunately there were no injuries, only damage to homes.”Images and videos show homes on the verge of collapse. Salvatore Cocina, director general of Sicily’s civil protection authority, said on Monday night: “All homes within a 50-70 metre radius will collapse.”Schools remained closed on Tuesday and a road connecting Niscemi with the coastal city of Gela has been closed.Niscemi has a population of about 25,000. Many of those evacuated were staying with relatives, although hundreds have spent the past two nights sheltering in a local sports arena.In an interview withLa Repubblicapublished on Tuesday, Conti said: “There’s no denying it – we’re scared.”He said the landslide had dropped by another 10 metres earlier on Tuesday morning. “And from aerial images, it was shocking to see our Niscemi collapsing,” he said. “The situation is dire, especially since the creaking continues, and the rain isn’t helping either the relief operations or the technical surveys.”A serious concern is that the town could be cut off, added Conti. “We’re monitoring the situation non-stop, because the situation could change at any moment.”The Italian government on Monday declared a state of emergency for southern regions battered byCyclone Harrylast week. The powerful storm brought relentless rain and waves as high as 9 metres, wreaking havoc in Sicily, Calabria and Sardinia as it destroyed roads and coastal defences, sweeping away beach resorts. The cost of the damage is estimated at more than €1bn (£870m).The government has set aside an initial €100m to cover the immediate needs of the hardest hit areas. The civil protection minister, Nello Musumeci, said in a statement: “In the coming days, the government will adopt a new interministerial measure to allow the restoration and reconstruction of the damaged infrastructure.”Sicily alone has suffered about €740m worth of damage, although the island’s president, Renato Schifani, warned the final amount could be double that.Explore more on these topicsItalyExtreme weatherLandslidesEuropeEurope weathernewsShareReuse this content"

While it will not halt global climate efforts, experts say it could significantly complicate them.First announcedon his first day back as presidentlast January in a stadium in front of supporters, the US’s departure comes as theTrump administrationhas launched a sweeping assault on domestic climate policy. This month, it also announced it will leave the UN framework convention on climate change, under which the Paris treaty was adopted. Together, the moves amount to a wholesale withdrawal from climate governance.“It’s almost like they’re saying, we don’t care what you want from us, we will be the bad guys, and you cannot challenge us on it, because that’s exactly what we said you should expect from us,” said Basav Sen, climate justice project director at the progressive thinktank Institute for Policy Studies.The US retreat from climate action has not halted all global emissions-cutting efforts.Investment in low-carbon energyis far outpacing spending on fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources accounted for more than 90% of new power generation capacity last year and, in much of the world, are now the cheapest source of new electricity.‘A colossal own goal’: Trump’s exit from global climate treaties will have little effect outside USRead moreChina is increasingly shaping the green transition. Though it remains the world’s top coal consumer, its emissionsappear to have peakedlast year. This month, the Chinese electric vehicle makerBYD surpassed Tesla in electric vehicle sales, while Chinese firms now produce more than 80% of the world’s solar panels and about 70% of wind turbines, giving them dominant control over clean energy supply chains.Trump’s policies risk pushing the US to the margins of the global climate effort – and slowing momentum elsewhere, say experts.“Yes, the real economy is moving in the direction of renewables, clean energy, etc, but there’s still a role for the global regime in terms of sending political signals and nudging that real economy along,” said Sue Biniaz, a former deputy climate envoy under Joe Biden. “Now, that ambition is going to fall behind.”In September, for instance, China committed to cutting its greenhouse gas output by 7-10% within a decade. Experts widely criticized the pledge as insufficient.“The US abdication on climate allows fossil advocates in China more voice to slow down the energy transition,” said Jeremy Wallace, professor of China studies at Johns Hopkins University. “A pro-climate president in the White House would push China to be more ambitious.”Other countries may also use the US’s lack of climate ambition to justify their own, Biniaz said.“I think other countries are looking at the fact that the US is departing … from the international climate regime and using that as a reason to do less,” she said.Some countries may also follow the US’s departure from Paris: Israel is reportedlyconsideringsuch a move.Yet US disengagement is also prompting some countries to take bolder climate action, Sen said. At last year’s Cop30 talks in Brazil, Colombia and the Netherlands announced plans to host the first-ever international talks focused on phasing out fossil fuels, alongside Pacific Island nations.“I have to believe that the reactionary position of the US acted as further impetus for those countries to step up,” he said.Still, any rise in emissions driven by Trump’s fossil fuel expansion will be felt worldwide, making Paris targets harder to reach even for the most ambitious countries, Sen warned.“If the domestic market in the US continues to be dominated by fossil fuels through the fiat of an authoritarian government, that will continue to have an impact on the rest of the world,” he said, particularly as the administration fast-tracks production to meet soaring energy demand from artificial intelligence datacenters.By leaving Paris, the US, which is the world’s richest country, has also removed itself from global efforts to help poorer nations transition away from fossil fuels, Sen said, pushing climate finance goals further from reach.“It will be that much harder for low-income countries, who are very dependent on fossil fuel production and exports, to be able to make their transitions with the US saying that we won’t fund any of it,” he said.The withdrawal also reinforces perceptions of the US as an unreliable partner on global policy,say experts.“I’m not sure if the United States has any credibility left to lose in the eyes of the world, but withdrawing from Paris for a second time does not help,” said Wallace.Trump’s formal withdrawal from the Paris agreement comes as the planet barrels through record heat, worsening disasters and mounting economic losses tied to the climate crisis, Biniaz noted.“Every scientific report tells us things are worse than we previously thought and that more action needs to be taken,” she said. “It’s the wrong time to be pulling out of the key agreement that’s dealing with the issue.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationParis climate agreementUS politicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t long before they received a check that covered four months of living expenses.Then the process bogged down. Like many homeowners, they imagined that since they had suffered a total loss they could collect on the full value of their coverage. Instead, they had to negotiate over the value of each of their lost possessions with a claims adjuster, only to have to start again with a second adjuster and then a third – a process they believe was expressly designed to deter them from moving forward.Months went by with no discernible progress. They felt they were being shortchanged on item after item, and when they attempted to challenge the valuations State Farm was offering, they struggled to get anyone to respond.‘People saw dollar signs’: a year after devastating wildfires, an LA community is fighting displacementRead moreThey questioned, for example, why the company thought their Waterford crystal collection would have lost more than 50% of its value when they had owned it for just two years. The insurance company asked for photos to check its condition and appeared unmoved when the Conkles said their photo collection had burned up, along with everything else.“It was all delays and denials,” Jessica Conkle, a public education administrator, said. “It felt like someone was training these people not to answer our questions.”It was a similar struggle with the cost of rebuilding. State Farm’s first offer was significantly below the market rate, the Conkles said, and they spent months haggling to increase it. To this day, they said, the money is in an escrow account, out of their reach pending a settlement with no provision for architects’ fees or the cost of city planning permits, without which they could not start the rebuilding process.“We’re at a real breaking point,” said Jessica. “It’s consuming all our time … and it’s exhausting, having to fight for what should be a relatively straightforward transaction. The way they are treating people who have lost everything is literally inhuman.”View image in fullscreenSome homes being rebuilt in Pacific Palisades, on 9 January.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesFire survivors seeking to collect on their insurance policies in other fire-ravaged neighborhoods across the LA region report similar frustrations. Recent reports by Department of Angels, a non-profit set up by government experts in the wake of the fires,echoedthe Conkles’ experience, as almost eight out of 10 surveyed homeowners reported a variety ofobstaclesincluding multiple adjusters, lowball estimates, fights over property lists, and poor communication. People whose houses were damaged reported even more severe frustrations with their insurance companies than those who lost everything.It’s a sign of how Los Angeles’s post-fire recovery has exemplified a much broader crisis facing the insurance industry in an age of climate volatility, raising troubling questions about the stability of home ownership and housing affordability – the bedrock of the American middle class.Insurance companies citing the increasing risks and costs of climate-driven natural disasters – including fires, hurricanes and tornadoes – have lobbied state regulators into granting steep premium increases, squeezing all but the wealthiest homeowners and leaving many under-insured, if they canfind insurance at all.Many providers have scaled back coverage in high-risk areas or stopped writing new policies altogether, leaving many consumers in the hands of state-sponsored emergency insurance plans that tend to offer inferior coverage and often struggle to stay afloat financially. In California, reliance on this last-resort option known as the Fair planhas soared.At the same time, the insurance companies themselves have never had it better. The US industry generatedrecord profits of$169bnlast year and is on target for another bonanza year in 2025, despite the Los Angeles fires and other natural disasters. The bulk of these profits come from companies investing premium income in the financial markets, which have been booming.This disparity in fortunes between the insurers and their customers infuriates fire survivors like the Conkles and is now fueling a movement, acrossCaliforniaand beyond, to demand an end to the industry’s lobbying grip on state regulators and lawmakers, and a more equitable solution that spreads the undeniable risks associated with the climate crisis more broadly.The Los Angeles wildfires were ‘the perfect storm’. Is the city ready for the next one?Read more“We need regulators who are willing to fight for consumers, and around the country including here in California the regulators have responded with deference to insurance companies,” charged Douglas Heller, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America. “That’s a mistake, and we’re paying for it.”Fighting for claims all the way to the topNot all insurance companies have attracted the same anger. The bulk of complaints from LA fire survivors, documented both by Department of Angels and local activists in the affected areas, have been directed at State Farm, the region’s largest writer of homeowner insurance, and at the Fair plan.“Delays, lowball offers and outright denials,” is how one activist, Joy Chen of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network in Altadena, characterizes the obstacles her members have faced from their insurance providers.The insurance industry itself insists it is working diligently to process its claims. State Farm says it has paid out more than $5bn on about 13,500 claims between Altadena and the coastal communities of Malibu and Pacific Palisades and expects that figure to reach somewhere between $6bn and $7bn. “Insurance claims can be complex, especially after disasters,” the company says. “We are committed to clear communication, listening to customer needs and addressing concerns promptly.”State Farm offered no response to questions about the Conkles’ criticisms of their claim process or any other specific complaint about its performance.View image in fullscreenPeople enjoy the beach alongside homes destroyed by wildfire, in Pacific Palisades on 11 August.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPAAt the same time, insurance industry advocates bristle at what they describe as over-restrictive price controls, and say if they cannot increase premiums to cover catastrophic climate-related losses, they cannot remain profitable.When State Farm and others stopped writing homeowner insurance in fire-prone areas in 2023, citing what State Farm calls a “lack of alignment between price and risk”, they spooked state officials into granting a major rate increase.But the insurance cancellations continued regardless. And a provision that supposedly obliged insurance companies to keep writing policies in “distressed” areas at 85% of the rate it wrote them elsewhere proved to be largely hollow. A New York Timesinvestigationfound that the definition of these “distressed” zip codes was so broad it allowed the companies to fulfill their obligation with properties outside fire zones, while they continued to drop their highest-risk customers.Consumer advocates accuse insurance companies of over-emphasizing fluctuations in their income based on the difference between premiums and claims, when in fact they make the bulk of their revenue – and profits – in the markets.“At every regulatory meeting, they ask, how can you expect us to sell policies when we have a loss on our underwriting in your state or community?” Heller said. “The truth is, the insurance industry has had underwriting losses in nine of the last 15 years, but in every one of those years the industry has been profitable because of investment income.”The regulators have responded with deference to insurance companies … That’s a mistake, and we’re paying for itDouglas Heller, Consumer Federation of AmericaHeller also challenged the notion that California’s system of price regulation was an obstacle to industry profitability. He pointed to other, far less regulated states in the midwest and south where insurance companies have imposed dramatic price increases and still canceled policies at an alarming rate. Wildfires turn out to be a relatively modest industry concern, accounting for about 5% of catastrophic claims, according to industry data. Hurricanes account for about 12%, while tornadoes and other convective storms, increasingly common across the midwest, account for a staggering 40%.Another target of popular outrage has been California’s department of insurance, the state’s industry-regulation arm seen by its critics as a classic case of an agency “captured” by the corporate interests it is supposed to police. Consumer advocates give particularly low marks to the current commissioner, Ricardo Lara, who acknowledged last summer that his department had allowed itself to be “bullied” by the industry into climate change-related accommodations, including steep rate increases.Consumer advocates as well as fire survivors accuse the department of failing to enforce existing California law or to impose meaningful new regulations in the wake of the fires to ensure fair treatment of homeowners who have paid for coverage and should now be receiving it.“This crisis isn’t inevitable. It’s a failure of leadership and enforcement,” says Chen, who has been at the forefront of calls for Lara’s resignation. “Our recovery can’t wait another year without insurance benefits being paid out. And California can’t afford another year of an insurance business in collapse.”Lara’s office did not respond to a Guardian request for comment.One effect of the LA fires is that aggrieved consumers are paying far closer attention to both the insurance industry and the state officials it lobbies. Chen, the Eaton fire network’s hard-charging leader who has a rich background in state and local politics, realized early on that insurance companies are obliged to use the same claims-processing criteria with all customers. Simply by cataloguing everyone’s experiences on a spreadsheet and noting the differences, her organization could start to put pressure on the industry.Chen noticed one particularly troubling recurring problem: that State Farm and other companies were either failing to test smoke-damaged homes for carcinogens and other toxins, or declaring those homes to be safe for habitation, whereas subsequent independent testing came todramatically different conclusions. For years – until its approach was declaredillegalin court – the state Fair plan had a policy that said if you couldn’t see or smell smoke damage, then a home was by definition safe.The LA wildfire survivors still living in toxic homes: ‘We have nowhere else to go’Read moreAfter trying and failing to get Lara to address this and the other claims-processing issues, Chen switched gears and brought her evidence to Los Angeles county officials, who are not under the same sway of industry lobbyists and soon announced amajor investigationinto State Farm’s “failure to comply with various state insurance laws and regulations”.The county’s consumer protection division demanded a full documentary record of the company’s fire-related work and threatened to impose fines for any instance of wrongdoing it uncovered. Chen said that as soon as the county announced its investigation, State Farm unblocked claims that had been in limbo for months and started cutting checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars.State Farm is yet to respond to any of the specific charges listed by the county, saying only that the investigation will be a “distraction from our ongoing work in California to help our customers recover from this tragedy”. Asked whether payouts had accelerated in the wake of the investigation starting, a company spokesperson offered no response.Insurance in an age of climate extremesBehind all this wrangling lies the obstinate fact that catastrophic events have become more common and are likely to become dramatically if not exponentially worse as global temperatures increase.Last year, according to the risk-management firm Aon, the global insurance industry saw$145bnin underwriting losses from natural catastrophes, a figure that exceeded the 21st-century annual average by a staggering 54%. Lossesin 2025 were greater than $100bnin the first half of the year alone.As private insurance companies across the US become more leery of taking on risk, state-sponsored emergency funds like the Fair plan are playing a bigger role – a Band-Aid solution, experts and government leaders say, that is neither financially sustainable nor sufficient to cover catastrophic losses when they occur.Dave Jones, who served two terms as California’s insurance commissioner in the 2010s and now leads a climate risk thinktank at the University of California in Berkeley, agrees with the insurance industry that the surge in natural disasters is very far from business as usual but sees the crisis as too big and too complex to be tackled through industry-based solutions alone.“We’re not going to price-increase our way out of a climate crisis … and we’re not going to deregulate our way out of a climate crisis,” he said.Jones argues that insurance companies should use their clout as institutional investors and divest from, and even sue, the fossil-fuel companies that have driven the climate crisis.At the same time, Jones believes consumers need stronger protections to ensure they have access to insurance in the first place, and to credit them for actions they take to protect their home from the risk of wildfires or other catastrophes – something that does not often happen now.He also believes homeowners should be given regular, realistic updates on the cost of rebuilding in the case of a total loss so they do not go under-insured. That’s been a problem for many wildfire survivors including the Conkles, who are insured for about $400,000 less than the $1.4m they believe it will cost to rebuild their house. Jones said insurance companies are increasingly turning to algorithms to calculate replacement costs, and those calculations tend to skew low, further exacerbating the problem.That said, even the most enlightened regulatory framework and more responsible industry behavior are not going to tackle the problem at its root, as Jones sees it. “We’re marching toward an uninsurable future because we’re not doing enough or going fast enough to transition from fossil fuels and other greenhouse gas industries,” he said. “The background of climate change is overwhelming and will continue to overwhelm price increases and other regulatory changes. The news is not good.”Jones foresees a future of much higher prices and dramatically scaled back coverage in high-risk areas, with state governments possibly stepping in to provide home insurance subsidies to lower-income families along the lines of healthcare insurance subsidies offered by the Obama-era Affordable Care Act.None of that grim outlook has prevented insurance companies from seizing opportunities to make money in the short term, whether through investment income or lobbying efforts that have allowed them to squeeze consumers with higher rates and slow payout schedules.Chen sees that as an inexcusable form of opportunism at a time when people and communities are suffering, and she expects insurance companies to do a lot better.“We’re not against the industry,” she said. “We are simply against illegal conduct.”Explore more on these topicsInsurance industryLos Angeles wildfires: one year laterCaliforniaCalifornia wildfiresWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For decades, the environmentalist had warned that replacing native trees in the Andes mountain range with highly flammable foreign pine was a recipe for disaster.In early January, flames raced down the Pirque hill and edged closer to his home in the Patagonian town of Epuyén,Argentina, where he had lived since the 1970s. Thirty people with six motor pumps fought for hours, hoses stretched for kilometres, but “there was no way”.“We had to throw all our equipment into the stream and get the hell out of there,” he says as he recalls fleeing as the inferno engulfed his house. “The dragon chased us until we crossed the river, and we had to speed between two fire columns along a trail barely a kilometre wide.”View image in fullscreenExperts say the replacement of native tree species with a highly flammable foreign pine monoculture has contributed to the spread of wildfires.Photograph: Maxi Jonas/APSince 5 January,more than 36,000 hectares(90,000 acres) of native forests, grasslands, villages and tourist resorts in Patagonia have been ravaged by wildfires, mainly in the southern Argentine province of Chubut, according to the Federal Emergency Agency (AFE). Greenpeace says the affected areaexceeds 40,000 hectares.You’ll see some bougie guy, all muddy, carrying a motor pump in a spectacular 4x4 truckLucas ChiappeWildfires are also hitting Chile, with at least 18 people killed this month. Environmental groups and workers blame extreme weather, whichscientists link to the climate crisisand cuts to national fire-prevention budgets.“There was a confluence of many climatic factors,” says Andrés Nápoli, director of theEnvironment and Natural Resources Foundation(Farn). “This year has not had enough snowfall; there are low humidity levels and a high accumulation of combustible elements in the forest” – a reference to monoculture pine plantations, which act as “powder kegs”.Recent rainfall and the firefighters’ efforts brought momentary relief, but outbreaks reactivated after a prolonged heatwave and strong winds.President Javier Milei’s government has systematically defunded theNational Fire Management Service(SNMF), resulting in a reduction of81% on last year’s budget.View image in fullscreenFirefighters battle flames in Epuyen, 11 January. Communities are forming their own brigades to work alongside the official ones.Photograph: Nicolas Palacios/APPrevention efforts, such as building firebreaks and community engagement, have been hampered, with firefighters forced to work in poor conditions and for low salaries.Alejo Fardjoume, a representative of the national parks’ union, says monthly salaries for firefighters range from 650,000 to 850,000 pesos (£336-£440). According to government statistics, the poverty line for a family of fouris 1.3m pesosa month.The budget cuts, says Nápoli, also affect early-warning systems and aerial support, with firefighting aircraft flight hours being cutfrom 5,100 to 3,100.Communities in the area are forming their own firefighting brigades to work alongside the official ones. “We use chainsaws, rakes, hoses, motor pumps – everyday objects,” says Diego Calfuqueo, a raspberry farmer.‘The forests are going up in flames – so is the rule of law’: Argentina’s climate of fearRead moreChiappe says solidarity takes precedence over bureaucracy and social classes. “You’ll see some bougie guy, all muddy, carrying a motor pump in a spectacular 4x4 truck,” he adds.Last week, Milei – who did not travel to the affected area – postedan AI-generated imageof himself shaking hands with firefighters on Instagram, calling them “heroes”. “It’s a little hypocritical and cynical,” says a local firefighter, Hernán Mondino, adding that many of his colleagues have to take on other jobs to make ends meet.According to Hernán Giardini, forests coordinator at Greenpeace, government policy now aligns with Milei’s claims that a human-made climate crisis does not exist.View image in fullscreenThe community firefighters use everyday objects such as chainsaws, rakes, hoses and motor pumps to help tackle the blazes.Photograph: Matias Garay/Reuters“He defunded the forestry law, which is part of the funds allocated to the provinces for the care of native forests, used by the Patagonian provinces for many related issues, such as wildfires,” he says. “Argentina ranks among the 15 countries that deforest the most worldwide.”View image in fullscreenMauro Millán, a Mapuche leader of the Pillan Mahuiza community.Photograph: Nicolas PalaciosThe crisis has ignited unfounded theories and scapegoating, with the government pushing the narrative that a group of Indigenous people in Chile and Argentina, theMapuches, are to blame.Last week, the national security ministeralleged on Xthat “preliminary evidence suggests that these crimes are linked to terrorist groups calling themselves Mapuche”.“If one people is defending their territory and setting limits on this extractivist capitalism, it is the Mapuche people,” says Mauro Millán, a Mapuche leader from the Pillan Mahuiza community, near Los Alerces national park, which was also affected by the wildfires.Millán says the government was “rehashing the absurd theory of the arsonist Mapuche”, but that “nobody believes them any more”. Last year, he says, police raided his community due to similar allegations, but the case was dropped.Mapuche communities are not the only ones being blamed. Some politicians and media pundits haveblamed Israeli citizensand even the Israeli government, reviving an old antisemitic conspiracy theory, the “Andinia Plan”, which claims that Jews want to establish a state in Patagonia.View image in fullscreenBurned trees in El Hoyo, Chubut province, which has suffered the worst losses from the wildfires.Photograph: M Levicoy/AFP/GettyFacundo Milman, a specialist in Jewish culture, says the theory was created by Nazi sympathisers, including the sons ofAdolf Eichmann, one of the architects of the Holocaust who was captured by Israeli agents in Buenos Aires in 1960. Milman says that discourse had long been confined to far right circles, but is now also used by people who oppose Milei.Carlos Díaz Mayer, the prosecutor investigating the wildfires, confirms that the working hypothesis is that at least some of the blazes were not “natural”, adding: “We found accelerants in the place where the fire likely started.”‘Making Argentina great again’?

They do not correlate with anything in reality,” says Giardini.The consequences of the fires, according to Nápoli, are evident and will be long-lasting. “We are talking about an extremely biodiverse area, with places that have even been designated as protected sites for the preservation ofthe huemul deer,” he says, highlighting that the local population’s housing, jobs and health will be seriously affected.“The trees will remain standing,” he says, “but the land will be left as ashes.”Explore more on these topicsArgentinaSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanWildfiresChileIndigenous peoplesAmericasClimate crisisTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The proportion of non-drinkers increased in both genders compared with previous years.The survey also indicated regional variations in alcohol consumption. The West Midlands and London had the highest proportions of non-drinkers, at 27% and 26% respectively, compared with north-east England’s 17%.Jem Roberts, head of external affairs at the Institute ofAlcoholStudies, said that although it was “encouraging” that fewer people were drinking at a higher risk level, this “should not distract from the scale of alcohol harm in England”.‘There is a moment of clarity that life would be better without alcohol’: what we can learn from addiction memoirsRead more“Millions of people are still drinking at levels that significantly increase their risk of serious harm, from alcohol-related cancers to life-changing injuries and long-term illness, and we have seen record high alcohol deaths in recent years,” Roberts said.He added: “The alcohol industry will inevitably portray this harm as being confined to a small minority and argue for ‘targeted’ interventions. Decades of robust evidence show this approach does not work.“The most effective way to reduce the record number of alcohol deaths we are seeing is through population-level measures such as minimum unit pricing, clear health warnings on alcohol labels, restrictions on alcohol availability, and comprehensive bans on alcohol marketing – which we know drives drinking among children and young people.”The figures follow previous reporting by the Institute of Alcohol studies, which found that alcohol abusecosts the health service £4.9bn a year, of which more than £3bn is spent on alcohol-related A&E visits and hospital admissions.Not keen on feeble nolo wine? Try these insteadRead moreAmong those who did drink, the survey found that 51% of men and 60% of women drank at levels that put them at lower risk of alcohol-related harm.More men (27%) than women (15%) drank at increasing or higher risk levels, equating to more than 14 units per week. Meanwhile, 5% of men drank more than 50 units a week and 3% of women drank more than 35 units a week, both classed as higher risk. The survey also found people aged 65 to 74 were twice as likely to drink at risky levels (29%) as those aged 25 to 34 (14%).Other striking statistics revealed by the survey included that 27% of adults were inactive by participating in less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, 46% of adults had at least one longstanding illness or condition, and 10% currently used e-cigarettes or vapes.The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAlcoholEnglandBritish food and drinkAlcoholismnewsShareReuse this content"

They accused ministers of having “suffocated employment opportunities” and said the decision to focus help just on pubs was “simply outrageous”.Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, which represents nightclubs, restaurants and bars, said the support amounted to “little more than a drop in the ocean when set against the reality of the current tax system and the cumulative damage inflicted by the last two budgets”.He said his sector had “been savaged by rising business rates, VAT, alcohol duty, employment costs and licensing fees”, asking: “This limited, narrowly targeted relief raises a serious question: what will this actually do for the hospitality and night-time economy as a whole?”UKHospitality, which represents thousands of restaurants, pubs, hotels and cafes, said: “The rising cost of doing business and business rates increases are a hospitality-wide problem that needs a hospitality-wide solution.”Its chair, Kate Nicholls, said: “The reality remains that we still have restaurants and hotels facing severe challenges from successive [chancellor’s] budgets.”She said that without “substantive solutions that genuinely reduce their costs” those businesses would face “increasingly tough decisions on business viability, jobs and prices for consumers”.Henry Gregg, the chief executive of the National Pharmacy Association, which represents 6,000 independent community pharmacies, said the increase in rates for its members would push some “to the brink of collapse”.“It’s simply outrageous that the government should offer business rate relief to pubs but ignore pharmacies that play a vital health role on thousands of our high streets,” he said.Gyms and other sports operators were also concerned at being left out. Huw Edwards, the chief executive of the trade body ukactive, said: “Gyms, pools and leisure centres are the driving force of physical activity in the UK, with over 600 million visits in the last recorded year – taking pressure off the NHS and fuelling consumer spending, employment and high street renewal.“Instead of supporting this industry success story, the government has done the opposite and made these essential community facilities absorb two regressive budgets that have piled on operational costs and suffocated employment opportunities.”He said business rates for some of its members would rise by as much as 60%, forcing many “to increase prices for consumers at a time of growing health inequalities”.Nicolas Denby from the independent gym Sleven Fitness in Vauxhall, who works with 150 independent gyms, mostly in London and the south-east, on the GymSync fitness competition, said their average uplift in business rates bill this year was expected to be 145%.“That’s ridiculous. It has to be paid if the business does well or not. It’s a really difficult situation,” Denby said.While many large retail chains,including Waterstones,have said their bills will not rise overall, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, James Lowman, said: “Local shops will feel neglected and dismissed by this government today as they are passed over for additional support.“For those facing rates increases in April of thousands of pounds, difficult decisions will have to be made about investment, employment opportunities and the services that are provided to customers.”The government was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryTravel & leisureLocal governmentTax and spendingMusic industryEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been organised by the ex-Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell.McDonnell said: “There are real worries that the US/UK deal will result in significantly higher drug costs, which will in turn result in resources being drawn from the investment in NHS services.“The government has a responsibility to publish a full impact assessment of the deal on the NHS budget and services.”He wants ministers to commission a separate “open and transparent independent” impact assessment of the deal, to ensure that full details of the potential implications become public.The cross-party group of MPs will also discuss seeking a Commons debate and vote on the deal and inviting the Commons health, science and business select committees to undertake an inquiry into how the deal was reached and its potential consequences.The Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC) and Liz Kendall, the science, innovation and technology secretary, have insisted that the deal will cost only an extra £1bn between 2025/26 and 2028/29. They have admitted that the costs will rise after 2028/29, but have not given any estimates of that.However, ministers have declined to put any figures on the costs involved beyond 2028/29 or which government department will foot the bill. They have not provided those details when answering parliamentary questions from Liberal Democrat and Conservative MPs or in correspondence with the science, innovation and technology committee.As part of the deal, the government has committed to doubling the UK’s spend on new drugs from 0.3% of GDP to 0.6% by 2035, which will entail continued increases in spending between now and then.Last week, in its response to a freedom of information request by campaign groupGlobal Justice Now, the DHSC refused to provide information on long-term costs or provide copies of correspondence it had had with Kyle and Kendall’s departments. The information sought was exempt under freedom of information legislation, it said.Tim Bierley, Global Justice Now’s policy and campaigns manager, who submitted the FoI request, said: “The government is refusing to give the public or MPs any useful information about the true costs of this deal, despite being forced to admit the financial burden will grow year on year. With all this secrecy, you have to wonder: what have ministers got to hide?”The “landmark” deal will safeguard UK patients’ access to medicines, boost pharmaceutical investment in Britain and keep UK drug exports to the US free of tariffs, ministers stress.What will be the cost of Keir Starmer’s new medicines deal with Donald Trump? British lives | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, strongly criticised ministers’ refusal to disclose key information about the deal, which he last month called “a Trump shakedown of the NHS”.“This is an act of surrender by Keir Starmer, who refuses to stand up to the most corrupt US president in history. His weakness means that NHS spending is being set by a foreign regime, not the British people,” said Davey. “It’s an insult to patients suffering on crammed hospital corridors, who have been told time and time again there is no money for the improvements they need.“The government won’t even tell us what the impact will be on health services, or on our economy. It is clearly just a desperate ploy to placate Trump.”A DHSC spokesperson said: “The deal is fundamentally about putting patients first. For patients and families facing serious illness, this represents new hope and the possibility of treatments that could transform and save lives.“Total costs over the spending review period are expected to be around £1bn. Over a longer term, costs will clearly depend on which medicines Nice decides to approve and the uptake of these. This deal will be funded by allocations made at the spending review, where frontline services will remain protected through the record funding secured.“It is a vital investment that builds on the strength of our NHS and world-leading life sciences sector to increase access to life-saving medicines without taking essential funding from our frontline NHS services.”Explore more on these topicsNHSPharmaceuticals industryTrump tariffsTrade policyTariffsHealthDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The state alleges they show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”, the attorney general said in the filing. Meta announced last week that it had removed teen access to AI companions entirely, pending creation of a new version of the chatbots.US tech workers call on CEOs to demand Trump remove ICE from citiesRead moreIn the communications, some of Meta’s safety staff expressed objections the company was building chatbots geared for companionship, including sexual and romantic interactions with users. The artificial intelligence chatbots were released in early 2024. The documents cited in the state’s filing Monday don’t include messages or memos authored by Zuckerberg.Andy Stone, a Meta spokesperson, on Monday said the state’s portrayal was inaccurate and relied on selective information: “This is yet another example of the New Mexico attorney general cherrypicking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture.”Messages in the filing showed safety staff had special concern about the bots being used for romantic scenarios between adults and minors under the age of 18, referred to as “U18s”.“I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” wrote Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy, in January 2024.In reply, Antigone Davis, Meta’s global safety head, agreed that safety staff should push to block adults from creating underage romantic companions because “it sexualizes minors”. Sinha and Davis did not respond to requests for comment.According to one February 2024 message, a Meta employee whose name was redacted relayed that Zuckerberg believed that AI companions should be blocked from engaging in sexually “explicit” conversations with at least younger teens and that adults should not be able to interact with “U18 AIs for romance purposes”.A summary of a meeting dated 20 February 2024, said the CEO believed the “narrative should be framed around … general principles of choice and non-censorship”, that Meta should be “less restrictive than proposed”, and that he wanted to “allow adults to engage in racier conversation on topics like sex”.Stone said the documents did not support New Mexico’s case. “Even these select documents clearly showMark Zuckerberggiving the direction that explicit AIs shouldn’t be available to younger users and that adults shouldn’t be able to create under 18 AIs for romantic purposes.”Messages between two employees from March 2024 state that Zuckerberg had rejected creating parental controls for the chatbots, and that staffers were working on “Romance AI chatbots” that would be allowed for users under the age of 18.We “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off – but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision”, one employee wrote in that exchange.Nick Clegg, who was Meta’s head of global policy until early 2025, said in an email included in the court documents he thought Meta’s approach to sexualized AI companions was unwise.Expressing concern that sexual interactions could be the dominant use case for Meta’s AI companions by teenage users, Clegg said: “Is that really what we want these products to be known for (never mind the inevitable societal backlash which would ensue)?” Clegg did not respond to a request for comment.Meta’s AI chatbot policies eventually came to light, prompting a backlash in the US Congress and elsewhere.A Wall Street Journal article in April 2025 found that Meta’s chatbots included overtly sexualized underage characters and that they engaged in all-ages sexual roleplay, including graphic descriptions of prepubescent bodies. Reuters reported in August that Meta’s official guidelines for chatbots stated that it is “acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual”. In response to the report, Meta said it was changing its policies and that the internal document granting such approval had been in error.Explore more on these topicsMetaMark ZuckerbergnewsShareReuse this content"

But the exercise appeared designed to display the US ability to project force into the region as tensions withIranhave escalated.Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?Read moreCENTCOM announced on Monday that a large US naval deployment led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln had arrived in the region on Monday. The aircraft carrier, which has several dozen fighter jets and nearly 5,000 sailors, was accompanied by several guided missile destroyers that carry air defences to protect the carrier strike group.The US has also moved a squadron of F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jets to the region, according to the Washington Post, which come from the same unit that participated in strikes on Iran in April 2024. The UK has also moved Typhoon jets to the region in a “defensive capacity.”It was the first time that an aircraft carrier had been stationed in CENTCOM since the USS Gerald Ford was deployed to the Caribbean in October in the run up to the US operation to remove Venezuela’s strongman leader Nicolás Maduro.The carrier is “is currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability”, CENTCOM said in a statement on Monday.Trump in an interview with Axios this week said that the US has a “big armada next to Iran. Bigger than Venezuela”.But he also suggested that the US was open to talks, adding that Iran “wants to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions. They want to talk”.Trumpthreatened to attack Iran if the country carries out mass executions or killings of demonstratorsduring the protests that broke out over the devaluation of Iran’s currency in December. But he later appeared to pull back from that threat, at least temporarily, claiming that “the killing has stopped”.Trump stepped down his rhetoric on launching strikes against Iran earlier this month after he claimed that the country had reversed a decision on hanging 800 detained protesters. But as of last week, he had suggested that strikes could still take place, with the carrier strike group being sent to the region “just in case”.“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won’t have to use it,” he said.The US-based Human Rights Activists news agency has estimated that nearly 6,000 people have been killed, while the Iranian government has admitted to just over 3,100 deaths.Other activists have estimatedmore than 30,000 deathsin the government crackdown, but censorship and a nationwide Internet blackout have made details on the scale of the death toll difficult to confirm.CENTCOM has said that it would conduct the drills in partnership with nations in the Middle East and also announced plans to partner with Bahrain in a defensive drill that would include practising capabilities to down drones, a potential counterattack threat in the event of a US attack on Iran.But the deployments have also upset key US allies in the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates foreign ministry has said that it would not allow its airspace, territory or territorial waters to be used for an attack on Iran, saying that it would maintain neutrality and seek to promote regional stability.The US air force would “conduct all activities with host-nation approval and in close coordination with civil and military aviation authorities, emphasising safety, precision and respect for sovereignty”, the statement read.Explore more on these topicsUS newsIranDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Hoath has argued that his “political views, activities, or communications” should not have been considered by police.Australia’s strongest gun reform since the Port Arthur massacre has become law. Here’s what you need to knowRead moreThe tribunal heard Hoath was a member of thenow-disbanded NSNfor about 18 months and attended a number of demonstrations, prior to April 2024.He acknowledged the group was a neo-Nazi organisation, but told the tribunal he had joined up “for the social aspect behind the group and the fitness activities performed as well as the adventures of travelling to new places for the set activities”.In March 2024, police searched Hoath’s property and found 16 firearms and ammunition.They also found “a number of items of interest” including “not one, but two copies of Mein Kampf” in a bookshelf with other fascist publications, the tribunal heard.Police tendered photographs to the tribunal that included an A4-sized framed photograph of Hoath being “embraced by a person identified as the Queensland leader of the NSN, Gabriel Seymour”. The framed picture had been on Hoath’s bedside table.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe tribunal also heard that Hoath had a number of other framed pictures of media articles about neo-Nazi events. One of these had the words “14” written in the corner, apparently a reference to a common white supremacist slogan.Hoath told the tribunal he had “attended a number of marches, or protest-type events”, including a protest at Ipswich after thekilling of Vyleen White. After the event, police identified Hoath as a member of another white supremacist group, the European Australian movement.This led to the weapons search. Police then revoked Hoath’s firearms licence, declaring he did not meet the “fit and proper person” test under Queensland law.Hoath has only one matter on his criminal history – a $400 on-the-spot fine issued in New South Wales during an Australia Day protest march in 2024. He told the tribunal the fine was for “wilfully interfere[ing] with comfort or safety of others”.Hoath’s appeal makes a number of assertions, including that “in accordance with the Australia Constitution [sic] and High Court of Australia decided case law I have an implied right to freedom of political communication”.He argues he has a right to freedom of assembly and association under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and that “as a citizen of Australia, my implied right to freedom of political communication extends to all matters of public affairs and political discussion”.“My implied right to political communication exists as an indispensable part of the system of representative and responsible government created by the constitution.”As the grounds of Hoath’s application relate to the interpretation of the constitution, the tribunal adjourned the matter so that federal and state attorneys general could be advised as they may choose to intervene in the proceedings to provide submissions on the constitutional issues.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandGun controlAustralian police and policingnewsShareReuse this content"

The San Francisco Chroniclereportedthe mountain lion had been tranquilized and will be released into the wild.The mountain lion was first spotted on Monday morning by aSan Franciscoresident who took a video of the animal and alerted authorities.“It was so big … not just a regular cat,” Madrey Hilton told the San Francisco Chronicle. The lion, which “just looked like it was minding its own business”, scaled a wall and headed into Lafayette Park, she told the newspaper.Mountain lion sightings are rare in San Francisco, where coyotes abound in the city’s many parks, but cougars have been spotted wandering city streets before.In 2020, a young mountain lion was spotted sleeping in a planter box along a normally busy street and looking at his reflection in the glass of an office tower in downtown San Francisco. The animal was later safely captured and released into the wild.Experts say the animals come up along the Pacific Coast from the hills south of the city, but eventually find their way back to the wilderness.Explore more on these topicsSan FranciscoWest CoastCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, the company published an 80-page “constitution” for Claude in which it set out how it wanted to make its AI “broadly safe, broadly ethical”.Amodei co-founded Anthropic in 2021 along with other former staff members from OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT. A prominent voice for online safetyknown for warning consistentlyof the dangers of unrestrained AI development, he wrote that the world was “considerably closer to real danger” in 2026 than it had been in 2023, when the debate over existential risk from AIraced up the political agenda.He alluded to the controversy over sexualised deepfakes created by Elon Musk’s Grok AI thatflooded the social media platform Xover Christmas and the new year, including warnings that the chatbot wascreating child sexual abuse material.Amodei wrote: “Some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualisation of children in today’s models, which makes me doubt that they’ll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models.”View image in fullscreenCEO and co-founder of Anthropic, Dario Amodei.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe Anthropic CEO said powerful AI systems that could autonomously build their own systems could be as little as one to two years away.He defined “powerful AI” as a model that was smarter than a Nobel prizewinner across fields such as biology, mathematics, engineering and writing. It could give or take directions to or from humans, and although it “lived” on a computer screen it could control robots and even design them for its own use.While acknowledging that powerful AIs could be “considerably further out” than the two-year timeframe, Amodei said recent rapid progress made by the technology should be taken seriously.“If the exponential continues – which is not certain, but now has a decade-long track record supporting it – then it cannot possibly be more than a few years before AI is better than humans at essentially everything,” he wrote.Last year, Amodei warned that AI couldhalve the number of entry-level white-collar jobsand send overall unemployment rocketing to 20% within the next five years.In his essay, Amodei cautioned that the economic prize from AI, such as productivity gains from eliminating jobs, could be so great that no one applied the brakes.“This is the trap: AI is so powerful, such a glittering prize, that it is very difficult for human civilisation to impose any restraints on it at all,” he said.However, Amodei stated he was optimistic about a positive conclusion. “I believe if we act decisively and carefully, the risks can be overcome – I would even say our odds are good. And there’s a hugely better world on the other side of it. But we need to understand that this is a serious civilisational challenge.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingTechnology startupsTechnology sectorProductivitynewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of people were employed in heavy industry in the postwar years, but this dwindled by the 1980s.Photograph: Michel Setbourn/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesVergriete said Dunkirk, the site of thehuge allied evacuationin the second world war, was “a fairly good representation of what deindustrialisation has been like in western Europe”, with thousands of jobs in heavy industry in the postwar years down to just a few hundred by the 1980s.“Not many regions in western Europe have done this: aligning around the same goal and the same vision, betting on the energy and ecological transition to redevelop the industrial region,” he said.While Portsmouth and Dover were attempting to overcome physical barriers to growth, and were then hit by Brexit, Dunkirk – seen as a poor cousin of Calais – set about redefining its future. It harnessed the opportunities of being a maritime port but also the transition to decarbonisation, starting with Verkor’s car battery factory, which opened in December, and the French company’s partnership with the Renault Alpine sports car brand to work on developing a hydrogen fuel car at the Dunkirk site.At the same time, the steelmaker ArcelorMittal is pressing ahead with the switch from blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces in Dunkirk, a move supported by €850m in French subsidies.View image in fullscreenDunkirk is at the forefront of industrial revitalisation efforts in France, the Institut Montaigne said.Photograph: Dunkerque Port“Dunkirk is at the forefront of industrial revitalisation efforts inFranceand, more broadly, in Europe with decarbonisation on the one hand and the establishment of new, related industries on the other,” said a report on the town by Institut Montaigne in December.At the centre of the transformation is a €1.7bn industrial revamp of a contaminated swathe of land once occupied by a refinery destroyed by the Germans in the second world war that was later reopened but eventually closed in 2010.After the completion of a five-year clean-up of the soil, a French company, Technip Energies, will now move on to the land to open a battery factory and biofuel for aviation production plant alongside specialised import-export terminals to be run by the local Tepsa logistics site.At the same time, Dunkirk port is expanding routes and tying in with a new €25m rail terminal to help the shift from truck to train and further reduce carbon emissions.The Scottish route would initially involve one ship sailing to France three times a week from Rosyth, north-west of Edinburgh. It was previously reported that the route could be rebooted as early as this spring, but it is now expected later this year and could be run by the Danish-headquartered operator DFDS.Freight-only services between Rosyth and Zeebrugge in Belgium ended in April 2018. Passenger services stopped in 2010, with Scottish travellers’ nearest option for ferries in Newcastle, which has daily 16-hour crossings to Amsterdam.Daniel Deschodt, the deputy chief executive of the port of Dunkirk, said he hoped the route, which could involve a 20-hour sailing, would be popular with Scottish rugby fans, including for the Six Nations tournament early next year.Plans for the revival of the route have been discussed for some time but require newpost-Brexit border facilitiesfor veterinary checks to be built as well as passport controls.View image in fullscreenDunkirk port is attracting investment from private and public sources.Photograph: Dunkerque PortThe Scottish agriculture minister, Jim Fairlie,announceda consultation in November to restart the route, with a plan to dock EU imports in Rosyth and carry out checks 20 miles away in Grangemouth.The extra ferry route to Scotland is among several new routes planned at Dunkirk, including services to the Nordic countries and expansion of business with South America. One in four pineapples and bananas in France already come from Colombia via Dunkirk.Dunkirk is also developing a hub that will capture and liquefy carbon emissions from industry all over Europe for export to stores, potentially including facilities in Scotland.Explore more on these topicsBusinessShipping industryEnergy industryInternational tradeScotlandFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, Marty Supreme and Hamnet are close on their heels with 11 nominations each, and Frankenstein and Sentimental Value have eight nods apiece.Bafta has caught the zeitgeist with One Battle After Another, but let’s hear it for The Ballad of Wallis IslandRead moreBritish Tourette comedy I Swear earned a surprising five nominations, including a best actor nod for Robert Aramayo; there were also three nominations each for British musical comedy/drama The Ballad of Wallis Island and the Bromley-set BDSM biker romance Pillion.Shock snubs were largely absent from the announcement, in part because Bafta’s acting shortlists number six, rather than the Oscars’ five – allowing space for names such as Hamnet’s Paul Mescal – and because loins had already been girded for high-profile shut-outs such as Wicked: For Good.In fact, the blockbuster sequel did not fare as badly as it did last Thursday, when it came home from the Oscar nominations empty handed, instead picking up nods for costume design and hair and makeup, but there was no love for either Cynthia Erivo or Ariana Grande.Other A-listers who failed to make the cut include Jennifer Lawrence for Die My Love, George Clooney for Jay Kelly, Sydney Sweeney for Christy, Dwayne Johnson for The Smashing Machine and Julia Roberts for After the Hunt.While Leonardo DiCaprio remains the second favourite to take best actor, after Marty Supreme’s Timothée Chalamet, his seventh mention in the category does mean he now shares an all-time Bafta record with Michael Caine, Daniel Day-Lewis, Peter Finch, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Lemmon and Laurence Olivier. And, given his age and work rate, DiCaprio also appears the most likely of that number to break the record.Aramayo is the dark horse in the category, but the nomination will significantly boost the profile of the 33-year-old previously best known as the young Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. In I Swear, he plays pioneering Scottish Tourette syndrome campaigner John Davidson. Kirk Jones’s much-lauded biopic – which also proved a moderate box office hit – is additionally up for outstanding British film, original screenplay, supporting actor for Peter Mullan and casting.Actor Robert Aramayo: ‘Like anybody who hasn’t had the education, I thought Tourette syndrome was all about swearing’Read moreThe success of that film, Bafta chair Sara Putt told the Guardian, was testimony to public appetite for “moving and authentic stories of lived experience which really resonate”. Meanwhile the continued dominance ofSinnersand One Battle further suggests audiences are eager to find points of connection in “a fractured and confused world”.“Those two films are also a triumph for cinema,” she said. “What you see on the big screen today is an elevation of genre film-making to something that is instructive, moving and thought-provoking – while also being a big, popcorn-movie blast.”This year’s nominations skew slightly in favour of homegrown films, even outside the outstanding British film and debut categories, with nods for Emily Watson and Carey Mulligan for supporting actress and Pillion and Wallis Island in the adapted screenplay category.But save for Aramayo, none of this year’s leading acting nominees are British, and nor are any of the six directors up for that award. Only two of these – Coogler, and Hamnet’s Chloé Zhao – are not white, and Zhao is the only woman.This result, said Putt, “shows there’s still a journey to go on for female directors, and demonstrates the importance of us retaining intervention at the longlist stage”. As part of Baftas’ huge backstage overhaul in 2020, the organisation introduced measures including quotas to ensure gender parity for directors in the initial selection.This marks the Oscars’ first year introducing some of its own version of such innovations, including an award for casting as well as mandatory viewing in order to be able to vote in a second round category. The Baftas’ insistence that voters watch 15 randomised films continues to bear fruit in terms of the spread of titles in contention: 46 in 2026, up four from 2025.Deputy chair of the film committee Anthony Andrews added that he was encouraged to note that more than half of this year’s documentary shortlisted films had female directors.This year’s Baftas take place in a ceremony on 22 February, hosted by Alan Cumming, taking over from David Tennant. The Oscars follow three weeks later, on 15 March, hosted by returning MC Conan O’Brien.Explore more on these topicsBaftas 2026BaftasOne Battle After AnotherSinnersnewsShareReuse this content"

But one faithful stood out for her quiet determination, despite a ceaseless onslaught of suspicion and accusation. That person was Jade Scott, and I wasn’t at all surprised when, quite early on in the series, she revealed she was a keen gamer.“Minecraft was my way in, when I was 15,” she says. “I made loads of friends at school playing that.” From this innocent introduction, however, she moved on to darker titles: the first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and the multiplayer battle-arena game Dota. “That’s where my interest in strategy gaming really kicked in,” she says.The Traitors is, after all, a game in a way that other reality TV shows aren’t. It’s heavily inspired by the parlour game variously known as werewolf or mafia, in which participants use social deduction skills to identify a murderer in their midst. Indeed, the original version of the show, the Dutch series De Verraders, emerged after the first Covid lockdown, during which hundreds of thousands of people had discovered the multiplayer online game Among Us, in which a group of players have to carry out menial tasks on a spaceship while working out which of them is a killer. So a video game player would have an advantage in The Traitors, right?View image in fullscreenSurvival adventure … Project Winter.Photograph: Other Ocean InteractiveIn the year up to appearing on the show Scott had been playing two indie games based around social deduction: the survival adventure Project Winter and the office satire, Dale & Dawson Stationery Supplies. Both require groups of players to carry out a range of tasks in a high-tension environment, while a select few are there to sabotage progress. The honest workers must discover and unmask the miscreants before it’s too late. She was, effectively, in training to be a faithful.“I always wanted to go in as a faithful,” she confirms. “My opinion has changed on this since leaving the castle, but I always thought the game was way harder for the faithfuls and I like playing games on a harder setting. As a faithful you’re trying to solve who the traitors are, but as a traitor, I thought you lost out on that puzzle-solving aspect. My strategy was to go in and immediately garnersomesuspicion, because that way you’re protected from murder … I just didn’t realise how much suspicion I would get!”Indeed, Scott was a constant target of accusations and suspicion. It was difficult. With gaming, you sit behind a screen, and communicating via Discord, so you just start talking and build friendly relationships with people, but with The Traitors, you have nothing to hide behind. It was a very different environment in which to think about strategy and how I communicate with people.”So did the tactics she’d learned playing games such as Project Winter and Dale & Dawson immediately fall apart? “I was quite good at defending myself at the roundtable,” she says. “A lot of that came out of the practice I got with social deception games. The second you approach the table with some logic and reasoning, and say, ‘I understand why you think that, but I have done nothing to suggest it’, they have nothing to argue with. I also didn’t feel I had anything to prove to anyone – I think, when you’re on the defensive, it makes it worse if you go around and try to mingle. I was thinking, if I go up and speak to this person does it just look like I’m trying to get in their good books?”View image in fullscreenConstant target … Jade Scott (third from left, top) at the roundtable in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAOne aspect Scott definitely took from playing strategy sims was observing the mechanics of the game and making notes. “I had different formats,” she says. “Every day I had a sort of traffic light system of how I felt about each person. Green indicated who I thought was a faithful, although you’re never 100 per cent sure – and inevitably those people would just get murdered! Red was who I was more convinced was a traitor at that point. I also wrote everyone’s names on a piece of paper and then I’d draw lines between them, based on who I saw having conversations – a bit like those cork boards TV detectives use, with the red lines between photos. I’ve alluded to this previously, but I’d stare and stare at that page and the only contestants I hadn’t drawn lines between were Rachel and Stephen. I was so busy working out ways to defend myself … you just miss the obvious, don’t you?”The Traitors to get ‘bold and surprising’ adaptation for stageRead moreSince leaving The Traitors castle, Scott says she hasn’t played a social deduction game – perhaps she’s done with fielding other people’s suspicions. Now she’s moved on to games such as Outer Wilds and Blue Prince, which pitch you against strange puzzling environments rather than other human beings. There’s been another interesting effect of her time on The Traitors, though. Currently studying for a PhD, she thinks her experiences at the sharp end of the roundtable have been extremely useful for one particular aspect. “Something I’ve been really apprehensive about, and I think a lot of PhD students are the same, is the viva,” she says. “You literally sit in a room with examiners and have to defend your thesis. Well, I’ve really learned how to defend myself and argue a point!”Explore more on these topicsGamesTelevisionThe TraitorsSimulation gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take a bow, Ugly Naked Guy …Stuart HeritageTue 27 Jan 2026 06.06 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 11.17 ESTShareWhen you think of television characters, chances are you remember the ones you can actually see. But this is a wildly unfair slight on a small but powerful minority: the characters who remain staunchly offscreen. For decades – mostly in comedies, with a handful of dramatic exceptions – these invisible workhorses have more than earned their keep, and they deserve their props. Here are the 10 best characters whose faces you have never actually clapped eyes on.10. Ugly Naked Guy, FriendsView image in fullscreenButt of the joke … David Schwimmer as Ross, with Ugly Naked Guy in Friends.Ugly Naked Guy (formerly Cute Naked Guy) was a nudist who lived across the street from Monica and Rachel. He never closes his curtains, and sleeps in a hammock beside the window. At one point, the gang thought Ugly Naked Guy had died, and tried to poke him with a long-range device made of chopsticks. Ugly Naked Guy ranks so low here because he was actually seen on camera three times across the duration of Friends, but only from behind. Fans speculated for years about the identity of the man who played him; an internet sleuth eventually worked out it wasan actor named Jon Haugen.9. Erica, BoJack HorsemanNobody knows what Erica looks like, how she dresses or even what species she is. However, across the six seasons of BoJack Horseman’s run, she was referred to endlessly, largely by Mr Peanutbutter. All we know about her can be pieced together by his exclamations, which included: “Erica! How are you looking so beautiful? I’m furious!”, “Erica! Is that you? Who let you out of the burn ward?” and “Erica! What are you doing here with a child-sized coffin?”.8. The prime ministers, The Thick of ItView image in fullscreenDoSAC calling … The Thick of It.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWe never actually meet any of the men who run the country in The Thick of It – those looming menaces who dictate much of the chaos that unfolds. But we know enough about them to guess their characters. The first is a legacy-obsessed Tony Blair-alike, the second a Gordon Brown stand-in whose acolytes are referred to as “nutters”, and the third a posh Conservative coalition leader who is still in when the series ends, four years before he presumably invented Brexit.7. Vera Peterson, CheersView image in fullscreenA powerful minority … the single sighting of Norm’s wife, Vera Peterson, in Cheers.Photograph: Public domainAlmost all we know about Norm’s wife comes from his (often insulting) descriptions of her. However, one of the things that made Cheers special was that this never tipped into outright hostility; when the time came, Norm made it clear that he and Vera were in love. Fun fact: Vera appeared on screen once, but her face was obscured by a pie that had been thrown at her. Another fun fact: the few times we heard Vera, she was voiced by George Wendt’s real-life wife, Bernadette Birkett.6. Carol, I’m Alan PartridgeView image in fullscreen‘Not my words, Carol, the words of Top Gear magazine’ … Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge.By contrast, there was no love lost between Alan Partridge and his ex-wife, a woman he met in a Norfolk cafe in the 1970s and who would eventually leave him for a fitness instructor. Still, she remains on his mind, especially in I’m Alan Partridge, where he drunkenly phones her to mock the sluggish acceleration of her new lover’s Renault Mégane.5. Bob Sacamano, SeinfeldThe unseen neighbour of Kramer, who talks about him endlessly. He made his fortune by coming up with the idea of attaching balls to tennis rackets with elastic bands, but now works at a condom factory. His synapses are so large that he is immune to electroshock therapy. He has an unusually high voice after a botched hernia operation. He has rabies. You get the picture.4. Sheridan Bucket, Keeping Up AppearancesView image in fullscreenA prodigal son … Clive Swift as Richard and Patricia Routledge in Keeping Up Appearances.Photograph: Peter Brooker/RexThe love of Hyacinth’s life, her son Sheridan is the only member of the Bucket family to live up to her lofty social ideals. He attends university (“the Poly”), although it is revealed that he dropped maths to study tapestry design and advanced needlework. He has fine taste, going on extravagant holidays and wearing silk pyjamas. He lives with his best friend, Tarquin. He is the apple of Hyacinth’s eye, although he only ever contacts her when he needs money.3. Mrs Columbo, ColumboView image in fullscreenPeter Falk in Columbo.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyFor most of her time, Mrs Columbo lived only through his descriptions of her (“She has a proverb for every situation”; “Well, my wife, she says I’m second-best, but she claims there are eighty fellas tied for first”; “She’s mad at everyone”), making her as beloved as her husband. However, she can only make this list if we promise to ignore Mrs Columbo, the short-lived NBC series where Kate Mulgrew played the character as an intrepid crime-fighting news reporter from 1979-80. It’s probably for the best that we do that.2. Sue Mucklowe, This CountryThis Country’s greatest character was heard – loudly – but never seen. Voiced by Daisy May Cooper herself, Sue only made herself known through the angry nonsense she shouted at her daughter from her upstairs bedroom. “You know what would be a random act of kindness? You wiping your arse properly so I don’t have to spoon shite out of your knickers every time I do a bloody wash!” she screamed down at her daughter in one episode.1. Maris Crane, FrasierView image in fullscreenThe gold standard … David Hyde Pierce as Niles Crane (right), in Frasier.Photograph: Channel 4The all-time gold standard of unseen television characters, Maris has been described so thoroughly (often by her unhappy husband, Niles) that it often feels like you know her. She is supposedly 4ft 10in tall, has an aversion to food and lacks any pigmentation in her skin. She comes from a wealthy family, but is wan and tires easily. She has many allergies and cannot produce her own saliva. The last anyone heard from her she was hiding on a private island after killing her boyfriend in self-defence. What a woman.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFriendsFrasierfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps realising we might be in desperate need of an uplift, the festival has given usa cartoonish dom-sub romance,a killer Barney horror,a pop star mockumentary,a Weekend at Bernie’s art world caperanda film where Olivia Colman shags a man made of wicker. But those films are all pretty stern-minded in comparison to David Wain’s disposable, dopey comedy Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass, a film without a single serious moment, driven by the sole purpose of making us laugh.Frank & Louis review – moving drama of dementia and caregiving in prisonRead moreIt succeeds in fits and starts – I laughed more than I have at many a comedy in the past year – but its wild, scattershot humour is so hit and miss, too many jokes going nowhere, that it’s not quite the rousing win I wanted it to be. Wain has previously toyed with more conventional studio comedies like Wanderlust and Role Models (which for me was one of the best examples of the form in the 2000s) and spoofs, targeting 80s sex comedies with Wet Hot American Summer and romcoms with They Came Together. Gail Daughtry belongs in the latter group but it doesn’t have quite as direct of an aim, a Wizard of Oz-inspired, Hollywood-set action comedy about marriage, fame, espionage and the burning desire to have sex withJon Hamm.He’s the celebrity Gail (Zoey Deutch) would most want to sleep with if she was allowed to, a topic she’d never even thought about before, a small-town woman with small-town dreams. But when her fiance has sex with his pick Jennifer Aniston at a book-signing event for her absurdly simple cookbook, Gail is determined to get her own back and heads to Hollywood with her closest friend Otto (Miles Gutierrez-Riley). After a briefcase mix-up, their quest intersects with a sinister megalomaniac (Sabrina Impacciatore, doing her thing) and her unspecific nefarious plan.Along the way Gail and Otto pick up an ambitious but incompetent wannabe agent (Ben Wang), a has-been paparazzo (Ken Marino) and an out-of-work John Slattery (John Slattery) as they hunt down Hamm while running from goons.It’s all deeply, knowingly silly and inconsequential, the kind of film that feels like it was cobbled together last minute as a lark between friends (Wain stuffs his film with actors he’s worked with before) and one imagines the laugh quotient might be considerably higher for those considerably closer to Wain’s world. But it’s so fast and frantic, leaping along from a so-so joke to a far better one, that it’s hard not to have some low-level fun watching it. There’s a scattering of genuinely amusing bits involving Hamm’s assistant, played by a standout Tobie Windham, and his bizarre backstory, threats to make people feel “very sick” and the repeated slam of a foot in the door, an eventually paid-off gag about Elizabeth Perkins, an all-hands-on-deck head in a soup gag and a hotel receptionist’s ridiculous tourist recommendations.But the rushed feel of the film, which looks like it was shot with the budget of a mid-awards show sketch, means that there are so many lines or often extended sequences that feel a few drafts away from something far funnier. I wanted more detail to some of the asides or some more effectively absurdist silliness, so often the choices feeling lazy or underdeveloped. Without a clearer target, other than a goofy riff on The Wizard of Oz or maybe a poke at the many awful action comedies of the last decade or so, there’s an aimlessness to it, a parody that’s not really parodying anything in particular.Everyone is committed to the bit though, whatever the bit might actually be, and the fun that they’re all having is infectious enough to sweep us along too. It’s been a big Sundance for sex comedies, from the good (Olivia Wilde’s hilarious couple-swapping comedyThe Invite) to the mid (Gregg Araki’s Gen Z vs millennial rompI Want Your Sex) to the bafflingly generic (Iliza Schlesinger’s dreadful by-the-numbers misfire Chasing Summer), and Gail can proudly be named the silliest. She’s just about worth tagging along with although it’s probably a journey you’ll forget you ever went on.Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Tape is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewJon HammComedy filmsSundance film festivalComedyFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But why does Gary Barlow twiddle his bandmates’ earlobes so much?Sarah DempsterTue 27 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 12.07 ESTShare‘Idon’t like cauliflower cheese,” says Howard Donald (57), prodding at a hillock of cheddar-festooned florets as he tackles an otherwise inoffensive backstage repast during Take That’s 2024 stadium tour. Gary Barlow OBE (55) is aghast. “You don’t like cauliflower cheese?” he splutters between mouthfuls of pie. “What’s wrong with you?”“Cheesy,” mumbles his carefully bearded bandmate. “It’s too cheesy.”“Whaaaaaaat?!” gasps Barlow, his award-winning vowels slowing to a thunderstruck crawl. “What’s wrong with cheese?”The question is of course rhetorical. This is, after all, Gary Barlow. And that is Howard Donald. Alongside elfin retainer Mark Owen (not present during the above transaction but presumably close to hand – possibly frolicking in a nearby woodland glade) they are Take That. They of the Barry Manilow cover versions and crop-topped Lulu “collabs”. They of the oiled thighs, be-jumpered ballads and A Million Love Songs (“Here I am, just for you, girl!”). Cheese is the very least of it.View image in fullscreen‘Here I am, just for you, girl!’ … Take That.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix“What’s wrong with cheese?”would in fact make a fitting subtitle for Netflix’s excellent three-part documentary about the veteran boyband, a weighty wheel of narrative camembert that takes in the last 35 years of the Take That experience. It’s all here: the early-90s teen hysteria, the record-breaking string of No 1 hits, the behind-the-candelabra rivalries, the perpetual pendulum swings between pop magnificence (Pray) and po-faced naffery (Babe), the soul-searching, the bum cheeks and, ultimately, the bogglingly successful “circle of life” manband reunion that has, against considerable odds, proved to be about far more than merely nostalgia.That said, there is not much in the way of revelations. There are fleeting admissions of anxiety (Howard), creaking knees (Mark) and discomfort at the ongoing demands of success (Howard again). But there is little here we don’t already know, and certainly nothing to rival the emotional emetic that was former band member and on/off frenemyRobbie Williams’ 2023 Netflix series, in which the Rudebox hitmaker grumbled about fame for four hours while sitting on a bed in his pants. (Tellingly, neither Williams nor Jason Orange, who left Take That in 2014, have contributed to this series, the spoilsports.)Instead, we get a straightforward and refreshingly unembittered retelling of the band’s story, from their bewildered early performances in gay clubs (“I absolutely hated the outfits,” guffaws Barlow over punishing archive closeups of his chainmail codpiece) to their unprecedented second coming, a decade after they imploded in a hail of double denim (“Fame, for me, is still a real struggle,” sighs poor old Howard, off-camera, who sounds as if he’s phoning in from the passenger seat of his Ford Mondeo).View image in fullscreenThe manband today … Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald in Take That.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixIt’s hugely enjoyable stuff. Directed by David “Bros: After the Screaming Stops” Soutar and told through new, off-screen interviews with the three remaining Thats, the series is replete with archive footage, acres and acres of the stuff, brilliantly edited and much of it previously unseen. There are early, excruciating gigs at school assemblies and there are many candid youthful hijinks, the latter revealing a startling reliance on shoulder pads and the young Barlow’s peculiar penchant for twiddling his bandmates’ earlobes, like a silverback relieving subordinates of fleas. (“I don’t think as a person that Gary could see how he was, or how he behaved,” says Williams in an old interview and yes, we think, as we watch the noted tax innovator pawing at Owen’s dimpled cheeks,quite.)Everything in the first episode is bathed in that faintly depressing low-grade greyishness that is the preserve of stuff shot prior to the late-90s. It’s as if Britain had been put in the wash with a pair of Jason’s pleather chaps and emerged the colour of a Crimewatch UK reconstruction. Later episodes take on a brighter hue, but there is still a pleasantly woozy wistfulness to proceedings, with footage even of recent concerts heavy with the memory of Exclamation body spray.Ultimately, Take That (the series, not the band) offers a view of Take That (the band, not the series) that is only possible from a vantage point of middle-age. We’ve grown up with them, they’ve grown up with us and, despite our ups and downs, we’re all now of an age, concludes the documentary, where we can appreciate how difficult and (occasionally) magical the whole process has been. Three cheers for all of us, frankly, and pass the cauliflower cheese.Take That is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTake ThatTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Once again, he’s not the protagonist but a sinister figure first met literally in the shadows, making ominous pronouncements in that posh-boy accent. When finally revealed, he is dipping his chin and looking up with those uncannily blue eyes like a vogue dancer catching the spotlight. If he keeps at it with roles like this, he could be the Peter Cushing of modern horror, but with catwalk-queen hair, or the goth equivalent of the young Ralph Fiennes in his rent-a-villain era. What’s not to love?View image in fullscreenJamie Campbell Bower as Alexander Babtiste in Witchboard.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyWhen Campbell Bower’s creepy antiquities expert Alexander Babtiste isn’t around, though, Witchboard reverts to its cheap and doleful resting form, in which B- and C-list actors play doltish young people bewitched by a proto-Ouija board that summons the spirit of a 17th-century French witch (Antonia Desplat). Somehow, the board has found its way to today’sNew Orleans, where main girl Emily (Madison Iseman) finds it in the forest while foraging for mushrooms with her hipster-chef boyfriend Christian (Aaron Dominguez). At the urging of Christian’s slinky ex-girlfriend, Brooke (Mel Jarnson), who crashes their party, Emily tries out the board, and is soon having flashbacks to a life she never lived.Tacky as all this is, the fact that the flashbacks are in French adds a slight tang of authenticity, as do the scenes in Christian’s kitchen, where he and his crew prepare for their restaurant to open. (Someone on the production did some research, or at least watched a few seasons of The Bear.) Much less convincing are the shots involving a malevolent maine coon that attacks a drug dealer and turns into a blur of fake cat and visual effects. But the moment is so gloriously cheesy and ridiculous that on its own it almost makes this something worth paying for.Witchboard is on digital platforms from 2 FebruaryThis article was amended on 27 January to correct the star rating.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsNew OrleansreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s all great, but if you want to see how impactful Dunbar’s playing was on the sound, head straight to the title track. The beat he plays is complex, a world away from the “one-drop” rhythm that had predominated in reggae: so complex, in fact, that Dunbar claimed other drummers initially refused to believe he’d actually played it, assuming some kind of studio trickery was involved. “Then everybody started trying for that style,” he added, “and it soon become established.”Sly Dunbar, reggae drummer and producer with Sly and Robbie, dies aged 73Read moreJunior Murvin – Police and Thieves (1976)The sound of Sly without Robbie – the bass here was played by veteran reggae artist Boris Gardiner, alas best-known in the UK for his fairly drippy 1986 No 1 I Wanna Wake Up With You. With astonishingly tight fills, Dunbar drumming provides a solid foundation beneath Murvin’s eerie, careworn falsetto and a backing track that seems to shimmer with echo. Dunbar also said he played drums on Bob Marley’s PunkyReggaeParty, a song inspired by the Clash’s cover of Police and Thieves.Culture – Two Sevens Clash (1977)Sly played drums on Culture’s Two Sevens Clash, unequivocally one of the greatest roots reggae albums ever made. It’s packed with incredible songs – I’m Alone in the Wilderness, Black Starliner Must Come, Calling Rasta Far I – but the greatest of the lot is the title track, which prophesises an apocalyptic event on 7 July 1977 “when past injustices would be avenged” according to the sleeve notes, and is sung in full belief that the world was about to be transformed. It wasn’t, but the sheer force of Culture’s faith – their sweet harmonies interrupted by singer Joseph Hill’s shouts and imprecations – can still knock you backwards.Grace Jones – Pull Up to the Bumper (1981)You can honestly take your pick of any of the tracks Sly and Robbie recorded withGrace Jonesas part of Compass Point Studios’ house band – from their surprisingly funky reinvention of the Normal’s Warm Leatherette to the fabulously tough Nipple to the Bottle – but let’s plump for the most famous. The genius of the music on Pull Up to the Bumper is the way it exists in a space bordered by dub, disco, electro-pop and post-punk, but that is ultimately entirely its own: it just doesn’t sound like anything else. And Sly’s drumming is magnificent, from the bursts of martial snare that open the track to the implausible humid-sounding groove he conjures up, that marries a hint of reggae lope to an insistent dancefloor pulse.Bob Dylan – Jokerman (1983)As sessioneers, Sly and Robbie were incredibly adaptable, so their discography is nothing if not eclectic – it takes in everyone from Bunny Wailer to Britney Spears. But nonetheless, there’s something pretty unexpected about their period as Bob Dylan’s rhythm section (they were, apparently, recruited at Dylan’s own suggestion). On the opening track of 1983’s Infidels, they gently infuse the biblical imagery with Jamaican spirit: it’s done so beautifully, with such a light touch, that it feels organic and natural, the opposite of the clumsy lunges at reggae made by a lot of rock artists in the 70s and 80s.Gwen Guthrie – Padlock (1985)Sly and Robbie produced Gwen Guthrie’s early albums – and Dunbar programmed the drums on Guthrie’s big hit, Ain’t Nothin’ Goin’ on But the Rent, but the Padlock EP, featuring Larry Levan’s remixes of tracks from her album Portrait, is the real jewel among her Compass Point All Stars-assisted work. Its title track is just magnificent: it was a superb song to start off with, and Levan’s mix clearly bears the influence of dub, stripping the music back, drenching everything in echo and foregrounding Dunbar’s unshowy, but supremely funky drumming, a decision that seems to be reflected on the sleeve, where Sly’s name appearsabovethat of the singer.Sly and Robbie – Boops (Here to Go) (1987)Sly and Robbie’s biggest UK hit as artists was both supremely cool and utterly irresistible: featuring a splendidly laconic rap by Shinehead, it wasn’t hip-hop, although, with its interpolations from both Rossini’s Barber of Seville and Ennio Morricone’s theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, it definitely felt at least slightly adjacent to the sample-heavy collages of Double Dee and Steinski. And the rumbling funk of the rhythm track is fantastic.Chaka Demus and Pliers – Bam Bam/Murder She Wrote (1992)Sly and Robbie were all over Tease Me, the album that briefly turned dancehall duo Chaka Demus and Pliers into mainstream stars: largely co-produced and co-written by Shakespeare and Dunbar, it spawned five UK Top 20 singles. It was a concerted push for crossover pop success but that didn’t preclude experimentation: both the cover of “Toots” Hibbert’s reggae standard Bam Bam and Murder She Wrote use a riddim that features Sly alone – there’s no bass at all, just a beat that bears the audible influence of Indian tabla playing – and which subsequently turned up on countless reggae tracks in 1992.Explore more on these topicsReggaePop and rockGrace JonesBob DylanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t read music, but that’s no hindrance to reimagining great classical worksFolk duo Pound & Stevens have transformed, and added to, Holst’s The Planets Suite and tour the new work this week with Britten Sinfonia. Will Pound explains why playing by ear is his greatest strengthWill PoundTue 27 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareI’m a harmonica and accordion player and one half of folk-classical duo Stevens & Pound. As a multi-instrumentalist I am rooted in a folk tradition that is oral, aural and communal. Music and song are passed down by ear, either through recordings or – more fun – traditional music sessions. Here, players and singers get together to share, swap and play tunes, drawing from a repertoire that is always evolving. While collections of tunesare certainly notated, their scores act as a skeleton – providing the basic architecture of pitch and rhythm but rarely offering explicit guidance on how the music should be played.Delia Stevens and I are about to head out on tour, performing with the Britten Sinfonia andRobert Macfarlanein a new work called The Silent Planet, a recomposition of Holst’s Planets suite. It’s the culmination of 18 months of rehearsals and revisions, and the score for this 60-minute work, orchestrated by Ian Gardiner, totals 165 pages and includes Earth, an entirely new composition.View image in fullscreenRobert Macfarlane has written new words for Earth, part of the Silent Planet, Stevens & Pound’s ‘recomposition’ of Holst’s The Planets.Photograph: Mark WormaldI have co-written this piece, but have never read the score; in fact, I do not read music.I am hardly alone in this. The non-reader tradition boasts a star-studded cast, including Paul McCartney, Hans Zimmer, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix andTaylor Swift. No one could claim these musicians have been held back by their inability to read music.Aural mastery can be just as potent a force as visual literacy.For me, reading music was a skill that simply never took root, compounded by my challenges with dyslexia. I spent years believing that this was a permanent barrier, locking me out of engaging with complex scores or longer pieces of music. After all, a classical work by a composer such as Bach or Handel is conceived as a comprehensive blueprint – the notation, often layered with Italian performance terms, explicitly tells the performer how to approach dynamics, tempo, articulation and expression. It is a full instruction manual.The challenge is intensified in large-scale collaborations. My early experience with the brilliant Sinfonia Cymru brought this into sharp focus.We were rehearsing a project that included my work The Reckoning and Stevens & Pounds’ arrangements of Ralph Vaughan Williams’The Lark Ascending, which toured last year across Wales. I found myself adrift when the conductor used terminology that was unfamiliar to me. I had to be clear with the ensemble that I was a beginner in this new language of tuttis and legatos, and they could help me out by replacing or translating classical terms. That said, the gap in jargon works both ways. The folk world has its own detailed lexicon of terms: jigs, hornpipes, slip jigs, reels, slides and polkas to name a few. These distinct tune types are differentiated primarily by their rhythm and time signature, and they correspond to various regional folk and céilidh dances, often possessing nuanced sub-classifications essential to a deeper understanding of the repertoire.View image in fullscreen‘Aural mastery can be just as potent a force as visual literacy’… Will Pound.Photograph: No creditI like to think of Stevens & Pound, the duo classical percussionist Delia Stevens and I formed in late 2022,as multilingual in spirit. Since then we have been on a mission to rethink major classical works. Our goal is not simply to play cover versions, or compensate for my lack of reading, but to lean into the dynamism and freedom that playing by ear brings. Taking The Planets, The Lark Ascending and other pieces into the sub-genre we have created recreates them in unexpected ways. We intentionally reimagine familiar works, whether they’re from the classical canon or other genres, because it gives the audience an immediate point of connection before we take them on a completely fresh, transformative musical journey.The Lark Ascending was our first foray into this territory. Its meditative, improvisatory nature made it a relatively safe starting point, and it was here that we developed our system for re-engaging with the original scores, based on voice-note recordings from Delia that I learn by ear.Perhaps lulled into a false sense of security, we decided to follow this up with Holst’s monumental masterpiece.This has proved the biggest test yet for our system – and my brain. The technical demands are so great that I had a wide range of custom harmonicas built by Seydel, Suzuki and other harmonica companies, so rather than just playing the work on a chromatic harmonica I gained different timbres, techniques and sounds to bring the pieces to life.The same goes for my accordion: I had to develop new techniques and learn different scales and chord progressions that wouldn’t usually be played on a diatonic instrument. Even more daunting than the technical hurdles was the psychological obstacle of tackling such a complex score without the ability to read it.Yet learning by ear and resisting the explicit instructions of a score has become my greatest strength: it forces me to approach the music laterally, bringing my own sound world and a unique, personal voice to the work – a voice that is not confined by the dots on the page.View image in fullscreenBritten Sinfonia at Saffron Hall, Saffron Walden in 2024.Photograph: Tom LovattThis is not a question of right or wrong: I’ve always challenged the notion that classical players can’t play folk, or folk musicians can’t play classical. Whether you call our tour dates gigs or concerts, the two genres are far more interlinked than we have been led to believe.Two amazing composers who recognised and embraced these connections feature in the first half of our programme: Percy Grainger and Benjamin Britten. Despite their mutual admiration – Britten dedicated his Suite on English Folk Tunes to Grainger – the pair only met once: at Cecil Sharp House in London, the headquarters of theEnglish Folk Dance and Song Society.

Shaky fingers caress the keys of an accordion to create an uncanny tone; clustered chords cry out, subdued but mighty, before scuttling back into dreamy nothingness.This 88-second elegy has always been overshadowed by another song on Drukqs, the Disklavier instrumental Avril 14th, which alongside Windowlicker is the Cornish producer’s best-known track. But QKThr has become a weird breakaway success, featuring on nearly 8m TikTok posts, adorning everything fromcute panda videostolightly memed US presidential debates, and a fail video trend dubbed “subtle foreshadowing”.Aphex Twin has even overtaken Taylor Swift in monthly YouTube Music listeners, with 448 million to her 399 million. Electronic music DJ and producer RamonPangnoticed the milestonelast week, and credits the uptick to QKThr. “It really puts in perspective how popular Aphex Twin’s music is in short-form content,” he tells me. “It’s not like there was a cultural shift and everyone’s suddenly listening to ambient techno over the grocery store speakers. The actual shift has been way smaller: Aphex Twin’s back catalogue is having a renaissance through gen Z.”Those QKThr posts are just a sample of gen Z’s apparent addiction to Aphex. Whether it’s Dagestani menjoyfully line dancingto Pulsewidth from Selected Ambient Works 85-92,corecore edits– the wistful internet trend that processes post-Covid melancholy through video collage – set to Avril 14th, or even afart remixof Alberto Balsalm from I Care Because You Do, Richard D James’s music has become the backdrop to life online.Chloe Saavedra, an LA-based musician and drummer for the band Chaos Chaos, who has also played with Lee Ranaldo, Caroline Polachek and Conan Gray, has been an Aphex superfan since the 2010s, and often postsdrumcoversof his songs to TikTok. She describes his largely programmed music as “not written for humans to play”, and its unpredictability as key to his appeal. “Learning his song Flim on the drums made me really appreciate his beats: there will be a couple bars where everything will feel super on the grid and super mechanical, but then he’ll throw in a swung rhythm, or do something on a triplet beat, or go completely off the grid.”Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Digital culture journalist Kieran Press-Reynolds says that hearing Aphex over, for example, a banal get-ready-with-me video of a person showing off that day’s outfit “added an immense poignancy to what you were seeing”. A cynic might say that spooky affect arises because his outsider-ish music has become so prominent on platforms associated with commerce and personal branding. But it’s also there in the way his songs are so often used in posts ofpicturesqueviews, or “nostalgiacore”videos, the combination of sound and visuals gesturing towards feelings or locations far away from the insular experience of scrolling.View image in fullscreenMade for scrolling … Aphex Twin making a rare public appearance  closing Field Day festival in London in 2023.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianPress-Reynolds, RamonPang and Saavedra also all agree on the appeal of the Aphex aura: the swathes of lore about him owning a street-legal tank, or allegedly living in the glass structure on a roundabout in south London; the inscrutable aliases, including Polygon Window and the Tuss; the endless rabbit holes and Soundcloud dumps. The trickiness of pinning down his identity and motivations is innately countercultural and offers a liberating, non-prescriptive form of fandom and discovery: Saavedra calls him “anti-pop” in a world where most young listeners experience music being “rammed down our throats”.‘This is so creepy!’: the Taylor Swift vinyl haunted by Britain’s weirdest musiciansRead moreTo RamonPang, Aphex’s youth appeal lies in the freakish, timeless wonder of it all, from the “alien looking sigil” of his logo to the mischievous “ghastly face” seen in his videos for Come to Daddy and Windowlicker, and childlike, emotive sound worlds: “I like to think the younger generation finds all of that completely fascinating and digs deeper.”Some older listeners might balk at the idea of Aphex Twin’s esteemed catalogue being “reduced” to the algorithmic equivalent of background music. But it’s always had a utilitarian aspect: 1992’s Digeridoo was originally written to clear people away from Cornish beach raves at dawn. His otherworldly music, the best of it a good three decades old, has the sort of rare, ever-renewing appeal that means each generation finds new resonances in it and tries to claim him as their own. “He’s one of those artists that you feel like a lot of people will try to flex,” says Saavedra – namely claim as a marker of alt-ness and questing music taste.Aphex’s refusal to ascribe meaning to most of his music also keeps the slate blank for endless reinterpretation. When it comes to QKThr, “he probably just felt like writing some dreamy and lush shit one day,” says RamonPang, “and then decided to do it because he doesn’t care what anyone else thinks”.Explore more on these topicsAphex TwinYouTubeTaylor SwiftInternetTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the Seasonal Quartet playfully anatomised the social fracture of post-Brexit Britain, and immediate predecessorGliffdealt with the violence of the securitised state, Glyph, in its explicit engagement with the Israeli government’sapartheidandgenocidein Palestine, raises the ethical stakes decisively. To engage in a Smithian pun – this is Art in the Age of Mechanical Mass Destruction.As with most Ali Smith novels, Glyph’s primary power comes from its commitment to excavating the sediments of language; its etymological resonance and inference. For example, the primary relationship of Petra and Patch is lightly drawn: playful, delicate and tender. But it was their names rather than their characterisation that lingered with me long after reading. Petra, from the Greek for stone, with its echoes of scale, solidity, authority; contrasting with Patch, meaning to repair, with its echoes of care, survival, persistence. In a novel so actively engaged with one of the “longest and deadliest military occupations in modern history”, their names provide a perpetual and deeply affecting drumbeat, stark and dissonant.In Glyph we see a major British writer answering the call of the day when so many others have equivocated or turned awaySimilarly, two of the central images of the novel draw their potency directly from the everyday horror of expansionist slaughter. The two sisters hear a story from the second world war, about a young soldier flattened by a tank whose body is left to rot in the road. Later they begin to half-seriously communicate with his ghost, calling him Glyph. On the one hand, Smith is playing with the question of what makes a character “flat” versus what makes one three-dimensional. On the other, especially when many readers will haveimages and reportsof similar deaths in Palestine so firmly in mind, Smith is raising ethically substantive questions about representations of the dead, about who gets to speak and who is decisively silenced. When Patch’s teenage daughter watches a distressing video of a horse trapped under tons of rubble, she notes that it was “probably Gaza”; as readers,we are left in little doubt.Nor are we in any doubt when we encounter exasperated, despairing descriptions of thethousands of people killed in Gaza while seeking “aid”: “did you hear about the people queueing for food and the snipers shooting at them and how the snipers doing this aren’t just shooting at people randomly, they are also playing a kind of shooting game? So some days they shoot people in the hands, some days the heads?”That quote continues on, listing various other body parts; an incredulous, horrified, breathless tumble of words. Smith’s tonal skill as a writer is also used to great effect when dealing with the bureaucratic, authoritarian absurdity of the British state. Patch’s daughter, presumably keen that the government do something other than write a strongly worded cheque in response to Israeli war crimes, is arrested for waving a scarf “aggressively”. Her mother is later informed that “scarf waving is not in itself a specific criminal offence unless the waving of a particular scarf relates to a proscribed organisation … it was thought that the scarf waved like a flag by your daughter could have been said to be in tacit support of a newly proscribed organisation and officers at the scene must now consider any gesture toward this new proscription in this light”.It is a bold move to be so morally unflinching, especially in the face of a perceived aesthetic orthodoxy that so often privileges distance and irony, but in Glyph we see a major British writer answering the call of the day when so many others have equivocated or turned away. There is also something about Smith’s relentless focus on language that makes her particularly well suited to the task. As Orwell reminded us: “political language ... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind”. Smith’s sensibility is fine-tuned to grapple with the avalanche of passive-voice headlines, asymmetric categorisations, outright linguistic inversions and semantic absurdities that have accompanied the increasingly desperate attempts to justify the unjustifiable.Glyph is described as “family” to its predecessor, Gliff, connected mainly by a mood and a homophone. It is typical of Smith that from the title onwards, we are drawn in by a playful flourish, a pun, only to have the heart of the matter revealed to us once we engage fully with the language itself. Gliff, a vernacular Scottish word meaning to glimpse briefly, or to be startled suddenly, sits alongside Glyph, which means to carve, mark or engrave. From the outset, then, we are in no doubt: we have moved from the fleeting to the permanent, from the passing image to the inscribed and the indelible. We have moved from observers to witnesses. No matter the darkness, we can never say we did not see.Glyph by Ali Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton (£20). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Both raised by the sea in Busan, they studied in Seoul before entering the city’s famously brutal rat race, Sunwoo as a fashion journalist, Hana as a copywriter. They shared the same taste in music and books, and importantly, both had rejected marriage. No wonder. In South Korea’s stubbornly patriarchal culture,women in dual-income families spend nearly three hours more a day on household chores than men. Instead, Sunwoo and Hana joined thelarge numberof South Koreans living alone. At first, independence felt exhilarating. By middle age however, loneliness was beginning to gnaw, and their boxy studio apartments felt oppressively small.Two Women Living Together, a 2019 South Korean bestseller that spawned a popular podcast, charts Sunwoo and Hana’s decision to buy a sunlit house together and live not as a romantic couple but as friends. Across 49 warm, chatty essays, they invite us into the life they share with four cats, reflecting on everything from the food they love to their retirement fantasies.Like any couple, theirs is a life of quiet joys and outsized irritations. Hana is a minimalist; Sunwoo, like a “crow that collects shiny things”, owns so many clothes her wardrobe breaks. They bicker about laundry protocols, New Year rituals, whether the house must be ruthlessly tidied before a big trip (of course it must!). Much is amusingly recognisable. After one argument, Sunwoo retreats to her room scrolling property apps and fantasising about leaving. Only when she realises she cannot face the hassle of uprooting herself does she slink out to make amends. Yet, as Sunwoo writes, we “may be stuck in an endless cycle of disappointment and forgiveness, but we never stop pinning our hopes on each other”.Beneath the warmth lies a radical proposition: that their partnership should be treated like any family. When Sunwoo is hospitalised for surgery, Hana becomes her “primary guardian”, yet is ineligible for the free flu vaccine offered to employees’ families at Sunwoo’s workplace. Their relationship is invisible on official paperwork. “If only there were an option that connotes greater responsibility and trust than ‘friend’,” they write – “‘life companion’, perhaps.” In South Korea, where same-sex marriage is not recognised, those living in households with friends or as unmarried partners do not have access to equal tax benefits, welfare support, authority in medical emergencies or even the right to act as “chief mourner” at funerals.In 2025, progressives introduced a billto secure rights for cohabiting partners and friends, arguing that widening the definition of “family” could address the effects of the plummeting birthrate, including an epidemic of loneliness and a care-gap. The conservative government blocked it. Still, there are green shoots:a recent changeallows census respondents to describe themselves as “cohabiting partners”, a victory for LGBTQ+ groups that nevertheless leaves people like Sunwoo and Hana unrecognised.The book is not without its frustrations. Some essays feel like filler. A proud cat-owner, even my patience was tested by the pages devoted to their pets. As a portrait of friendship, it is generous and witty; as an examination of a growing social phenomenon, I wanted more context. Is there a tradition in South Korea of unmarried, divorced or widowed women living together for mutual support, as happenedin Britain and Europe for centuries? How do neighbours respond? Do people assume it’s a same-sex relationship? Are single men making similar choices, or is this kind of cohabitation even more taboo for them?Interest in “platonic partnerships” is growing worldwide, as people try to cope with soaring housing costs and the unravelling of family-centred care. In France, cohabitating friends and couples can already enter aPacte Civil de Solidaritéoffering legal protections. Germany’s previous government proposedVerantwortungsgemeinschaft(“responsibility companionship”) allowing up to six non-related people to pledge mutual care, though the new coalition is unlikely to pursue it. In the absence of legal recognition, stories like Sunwoo and Hana’s matter, making visible the growing number of people turning to friends as their primary source of stability, companionship and care, and demonstrating all the many ways of being a family.Two Women Living Together by Kim Hana and Hwang Sunwoo, translated by Gene Png, is published by Doubleday (£16.99).

Traditionally, international tourists start to arrive with the blossoms in spring – but thanks to the opening of Pokémon’s first ever amusement park on 5 February, this year, they are likely to come earlier.Unlike the rollercoaster-filled thrills of Tokyo Disney Sea or Universal StudiosJapanin Osaka, PokéPark Kanto is essentially a forest populated by models of the creatures from the perennially popular games. Nestled in the quiet Tokyo suburb of Inagi, half an hour from the city centre, the park is a walkable forest with more than 600 Pokémonin it. Where the Mario-themed Super Nintendo World slots neatly into the massive Universal Studios Japan, PokéPark Kanto is hidden in the back of the less glitzy, funfair-esque Japanese theme park Yomiuri Land.Taking up 26,000 sq metres, the family-friendly attraction is divided into two main areas: Pokémon Forest and the plaza-esque Sedge Town. Tickets for the park are bought via a lottery system – and currently sold out for the next three months – ranging between ¥7,900 (£38) for a standard adult ticket and ¥14,000 (£66) for a queue-skipping priority pass.The park’s creative direction has been overseen by one of the original Pokémon creators, Junichi Masuda. Visitors roam a series of explorable habitats, littered with endearingly lifelike statues of hundreds of Pokémon, arranged in fun tableaus where various species are interacting with each other. Walking through PokéPark Kanto feels akin to becoming a Pokédex-clutching David Attenborough, a re-creation of what it would be like to observe these fantastical creatures in the wild. Beaver-esque Bidoofs use their two front teeth to cut down a real tree. Worm-like Diglett burrow above the soil to greet a smiling Eevee.Each Pokémon is presented in full scale too, making the larger creatures especially awe-inspiring. From a lorry-sized re-creation of the rocky behemoth Onix to a herd of rhinoceros-sized Rhyhorns lining the main path, each habitat is a joy to behold, with hidden creatures dotted throughout the trees and grass as a reward for eagle-eyed kids.View image in fullscreenEach Pokémon is presented in full scale … PokéPark Kanto.Illustration: PoképarkIn many ways, it’s surprising it has taken this long for a permanent Pokémon theme park to be erected. With Pikachu and pals celebrating their 30th anniversary this year, Pokémon is still comfortably the highest-grossing media brand in the world: its total estimated lifetime revenue of $150bn comfortably surpasses Disney properties such as Star Wars and Marvel. The Pokémon company’s profit rose to ¥70.3bn in the year ending February 2025 – roughly £337m – and with a range of new games, merchandise and the new theme park, its profits in 2026 are only likely to increase.After clearing the Pokémon forest, visitors are greeted by a Pokémon parade in Sedge Town square, where there are also Pokémon-themed versions of fairground games such as ring toss, Pokémon-themed food, and an Eevee-themed carousel. Visitors can also walk into a real-life Pokémon Centre (an iconic building from the games and anime) and grab a seat at a gym where they can watch a live Pokémon battle that blends human performers with cutting-edge animatronics.The Pokémon Company has numerous Pokémon Centre shops all over Japan selling exclusive merchandise. PokéPark Kanto will continue this lucrative trend, selling plushies and clothing that people will have to travel there to own. Video games are huge business in Japan, one of the country’s main cultural exports – but theme parks based on the country’s virtual stars are a newer phenomenon. Since Super Nintendo World first opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in 2021, it has been transplanted to Universal’s parks in Hollywood and Florida, with all locations helping to drivemulti-billion dollar quarterly revenues.Thanks to a weak yen post-pandemic, recent years have seen tourists flock to Japan. While it has been a boon to the economy, the flood of incomers has led to tension. Fromphone-camera-weilding influencers behaving badly, to overcrowded streets inconveniencing locals, the 42 million visitors who arrived in Japan in 2025 have come alongsidea notable nationwide rise in anti-foreigner sentiment. Newly appointed prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is already doubling down on anti-tourist legislation. It’s safe to say that PokéPark Kanto, with its family-friendly international appeal, will only increase visitors to Japan’s overcrowded capital.Explore more on these topicsGamesPokémonTheme parksJapannewsShareReuse this content"

He spent his formative years on Windward Road in east Kingston, and by the age of seven had relocated to Waterhouse, a former sugarcane estate in western Kingston that had become a low-income housing scheme in the aftermath of Hurricane Charlie in 1951.View image in fullscreenSly and Robbie in London, 1988.Photograph: Mike Prior/RedfernsObsessed with the Skatalites songs he heard on a jukebox during his lunch breaks while a student at Trench Town comprehensive high school, Dunbar would relentlessly pound the rhythms on his desk and decided to pursue music professionally at 13 after Ken Boothe and the Gaylads performed at the school.He soon began approaching local acts to try to gain experience. After receiving pointers from the Wailers drummer Carlton Barrett and Mikey Richards of Now Generation, he joined the fledgling act the Yardbrooms, and after sitting-in on a rehearsal with the RHT Invincibles he began recording with the keyboardist Ansel Collins, his debut session generating a sprightly organ instrumental called The Night Doctor, which became popular with skinheads in Britain after Collins licensed it to Lee Perry’s Upsetter label in 1969.Dunbar then briefly joined the Supersonics, playing onJustin Hinds’s Say Me Say. A subsequent session for the producer Winston Riley featuring Collins and the vocalist Dave Barker yielded the frantic dance grooveDouble Barrel, which topped the British pop charts in 1971.The guitarist Bertram McLean then drafted Dunbar into the Volcanos, the resident act at the Colony Club in Discovery Bay on the north coast of Jamaica, where he received the nickname Sly due to his veneration of the American funk actSly and the Family Stone. Once the Colony Club went into receivership, the band regrouped in Kingston as Skin, Flesh & Bones, which by 1974 became the resident act at the Stables nightclub on Red Hills Road, a few doors down from Evil People, where Shakespeare was playing in Big Relation.Shakespeare was also active in the Aggrovators, the recording unit regularly employed by the producer Bunny Lee, and after Shakespeare saw Dunbar backing Cynthia Richards, he asked Lee to recruit Dunbar for an upcoming session at the Channel One studio, where Dunbar drummed on John Holt’s adaptation of the Chi-Lites’Too Good to Be Forgotten.At the same time Dunbar was reconfiguring the dominant reggae beat as leader of the Channel One house band, the Revolutionaries, and another early collaboration came in 1976 when Shakespeare played the piano on the popular Revolutionaries instrumentalMPLA.The pair bonded more concertedly when Shakespeare included Dunbar in the lineup of the Word, Sound & Power band that would back Peter Tosh on an overseas tour in 1977. Performing to foreign audiences and being on the road together for an extended period resulted in an exchange of ideas between the two, leading them to employ the funk, soul and disco undercurrents that would define their joint productions. But first Dunbar recorded two largely instrumental solo albums for Virgin, Simple Sly Man (1978) and Sly Wicked and Slick (1979).View image in fullscreenDunbar performing at the Jazz Cafe, London, in 2005.Photograph: Richard Ecclestone/RedfernsSly and Robbie’s Taxi label subsequently enjoyed considerable success with Gregory Isaacs and Black Uhuru; the latter were signed to Island Records in 1979, and Sly and Robbie’s presence helped them to become the most popular reggae act in the world in the aftermath ofBob Marley’s death, culminating in the Grammy-winning album Anthem (1983).The “Rhythm Twins”, as they became known, performed a similar function for Jones at the heart of the Compass Point All Stars, the house band that Chris Blackwell assembled for his studio in Nassau, Bahamas, where Dunbar’s complex patterns gave striking rhythmic hooks to Jones hits such asPrivate Life(1980),Pull Up to the Bumper (1981)andMy Jamaican Guy(1982).Gwen Guthrie’s self-titled debut album (1982), Dylan’s Infidels (1983) and Herbie Hancock’s Future Shock (1983) showed the ease with which Sly and Robbie switched between genres in the early 1980s, and when Jamaican production values shifted mid-decade, Dunbar became one of the most sought-after electronic rhythm builders, using drum machines and synthesisers on significant hits for rising dancehall artists, including Chaka Demus & Pliers’Murder She Wrote(1992) andTease Me(1993).A cover of Isaacs’sNight Nurse with Simply Redwas another chart success in 1997, and following the Grammy-winning Sly and Robbie album Friends (1999), in 2001-02 they co-produced two No Doubt singles,Hey BabyandUnderneath It All.Dunbar continued touring until Shakespeare’s death in 2021, and remained active in the studio until recently. He was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government in 2015.He is survived by his wife, Thelma, and their daughter, Natasha.Sly (Lowell Fillmore) Dunbar, drummer, born 10 May 1952; died 26 January 2026Explore more on these topicsReggaeSoulPop and rockJamaicaobituariesShareReuse this content"

Being ugly is a lot easierDave SchillingThe internet has enabled a golden age of techno-vanity. But hating your looks is a time-honored traditionTue 27 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 11.03 ESTShareTake a second before you read this to look in the mirror. Go on, it’ll be worth it. I’ll be here when you get back.OK, how’d that go? Did you like what you saw? Probably not. Feeling a bit puffy? See a zit in a conspicuous area? Did you want to punch yourself for the sin of experiencing the natural course of ageing? These feelings are normal. Being disappointed in how you look is a time-honored tradition; it’s just that now, we have the means to fix all that. GLP-1s mean you can lose weight quickly, without doing much more than shoving a needle in your bum a few times a month. Plastic surgery, Botox, fillers, Turkish hair plugs. We live in the golden age of techno-vanity, where “self-improvement” can be had for a few bucks (and days and days of living in bandages like a hipster mummy). The odious trend of “looksmaxxing” is the natural nadir of our collective obsession with not being ugly.Within the fetid petri dish that we call the internet, looksmaxxing has taken hold with a subsection of otherwise functioning individuals. To be a looksmaxxer is to purposefully carve up your face, inject steroids into any willing orifice, and occasionally using crystal meth to suppress your appetite. This is not as appealing as it sounds, folks, because it also comes with a healthy dose of racism!It’s bad enough that someone is compelled to smash their own jaw to look likeBruce Campbell in the movie Escape from LA, but doing it because you want to embody some fictional European ideal is the cherry on top of the turd. Don’t be surprised if a feature of extreme physical manipulation ends up being eugenics. It’s not just about racial homogeny, though. It’s also about heights of bodily perfection that require, again,using crystal meth.One of the most prominent influencers in the looksmaxxing community is 19-year-old Braden Peters, who refers to himself unironically as “Clavicular”. Remember when nicknames sounded cool? What happened to all the “Dukes” or “Jimbos”? I would take a “Clem” any day of the week at this point.Peters referred to Vice-President JD Vance as “subhuman” (don’t blame me, I didn’t say it) on a recent Daily Wire podcast. Peters, who only recently became old enough to vote, claimed he’d vote for Gavin Newsom over Vance in the 2028 presidential election because Newsom is tall and classically handsome. I sort of understand the perspective. I voted for John Edwards in the 2004 primary because of thecrossing-guard helmet he called his hair.Besides the obvious absurdity of this phenomenon, there’s the very depressing idea that anyone is listening to what a19-year-oldhas to say about anything. It’s been said that the children are our future, but the operative word is “future”. The future is not right now. It’s hopefully at least 20 years from now, when I’m even older and uglier.The attention economy of the internet has meant that people are taking advice from someone too young to rent a car. I have an eight-year-old and I don’t ask him for advice on anything. He only eats chicken nuggets and wears Crocs every day. He can’t even tie his own shoes, but if I gave him a YouTube channel and he got 500,000 subscribers, he might convince an entire generation to walk around barefoot.I do wonder what all this digital insanity will do to my kid’s brain one day. Will he start demolishing his own jawline in order to better resembleDolph Lundgren? Will he hand out meth at cocktail parties? I suppose the best I can do is model a different sort of masculinity for him – a masculinity that involves being the naturally hideous troll that we are all destined to become. We are given one life to live, and I don’t intend to spend it chasing a mythical sense of aesthetic perfection. I’d rather read books, see films, go bald and gain weight in all the worst places. Realuncbehavior.Being ugly is also easier. Trying to chase perfection is difficult, requires thousands and thousands of dollars of disposable income, and hurts quite a bit. Plus, it’s unfulfilling, because that sort of perfection is not actually possible. It also seems to involve more drugs than I’m willing to experiment with. Life is frustrating enough without adding someone taking a hammer to your face on a semi-regular basis to the regimen. It seems the only benefit to all of that effort is getting attention on social media, a pursuit I outgrew along with my skinny jeans and the music of the Arcade Fire. Besides, history shows us that ugly people have been in control of the world for most of its existence. No one was asking Napoleon to pose for the “Dictators of the Month” calendar. Churchill looked like a bald mole that just saw sunlight for the first time. All the energy spent making yourself conventionally attractive could be better spent making positive change in the world, creating great art, and also sleeping.This is the legacy I want to pass down to my child: loving, living, and periodically passing out in front of the TV because you ate a very heavy sandwich. That form of perfection is a lot closer than you think.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsFashionOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Chanel, the most famous fashion house in the world, with annual sales of almost $20bn (£14.6bn) and a designer lineage that includes Coco Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld, is an intimidating prospect for a 41-year-old Belgian designer who, untilhis appointment last year, was little known outside the industry. But this haute couture debut, his third collection for the house, confirmed that Blazy is off to a dream start.The show concluded with a standing ovation from the audience, which included Anna Wintour, Nicole Kidman and Dua Lipa. Backstage, veteranChanelpersonnel were high-fiving each other – a remarkable display of giddiness in an industry where cool is all. In the Grand Palais venue, transformed into a willow wood of sugar-pink trees and fairytale giant mushrooms, clients tossed sable coats to the ground and clustered for grinning selfies. By every metric, approval ratings for the new-look Chanel are off the charts.View image in fullscreenA boxy suit in tissue-thin mousseline led the way, with the chain that weights the hem glittering under the lights.Photograph: Aurélien Morissard/APThe show opened, of course, with a boxy suit, but in tissue-thin mousseline instead of traditional tweed, so that the chain traditionally sewn into the hem of Chanel garments, weighting them so they fall correctly, glittered under the lights and danced in the breeze. A slip dress with ropes of gems for spaghetti straps was glimpsed under a transparent jacket. A birdcage earring enclosed a tiny pearl. A perfectly neat little black dress turned to reveal a racer back framed by crimson feathers at the shoulder blades.The clothes are chic and the craftsmanship heroic, but what sets Blazy’s Chanel apart is a warmth for the women who wear them, seen here in multigenerational, diverse casting. “Women who are more mature bring a completely different dimension to my clothes,” the designer said backstage after the show. “They are not just beautiful; they have lived, they are anchored, they have seen the world. I think it gives another dimension for the women who are going to buy the clothes, the idea that they can recognise themselves in something they see on the runway.”View image in fullscreenBlazy asked each model to choose something personal to be woven into their outfit.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPABlazy said he had wanted his first haute couture show to be light and joyful (“an adventure … I think the world is harsh”) and to include the stories of the women who would wear the clothes. He asked each model to choose something personal, to be woven into their outfit. “Some chose initials, the birthdate of someone they love, or they brought in a love letter or a line of poetry.” He mostly declined to give details – “they are intimate!” – but said that one model had chosen the word “kindness”. Lesage, Paris’s premier embroiderers, stitched these messages inside the garments, or on to fabric notes tucked into the pockets of quilted handbags.The teaser trailer for the collection, with animated Snow White bluebirds dipping over Paris rooftops, had raised a few eyebrows before the show – Coco did not do cutesy – but Blazy pulled off a grownup magic trick. The trompe l’œil winks that were his signature at Maison Margiela and Bottega Veneta continued, with denim jeans that at close quarters revealed themselves as painted mousseline – “I love a tank top and jeans”, said Blazy, who was wearing a Chanel quarter-zip sweater – and a raven-inspired dress with feathers crafted from leather. So far, the new Chanel is in a fairytale era.Explore more on these topicsChanelHaute couture showsParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The older I get, the more I know it. When I was 20, I could sleep anywhere: a friend’s floor, a filthy sofa – even a phone box one night. These days, I won’t get a single one of 40 winks if I’m not lying on a decent mattress. Comfy but firm, cosy but breathable, and with loads of cool spots for my feet.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Gone are the days when your biggest decision was between a sprung double and a sprung king-size. Pocket springs are still around, but they face stiff – well, medium-firm – competition from hybrid mattresses that combine springs and memory foam to provide that all-important balance of comfort and support.The in-vogue bed brands tend not to have showrooms, so you can’t normally try out their mattresses before you buy. Instead, they vacuum-shrink them in the factory for delivery to your door. These bed-in-a-box mattresses come with long trials, but you’re still buying blind. I’ve tried to shed some light on which are the best by trying them out for you.The best bedding brands interior designers use at home, from luxury linen to cool cottonRead moreI, along with a panel of my family members, tested 12 bestselling bed-in-a-box mattresses – including three in this latest update. Among them were three pocket-sprung models, one all-foam model and several bed-in-a-box hybrids (which combine springs with layers of memory foam), covering various degrees of firmness, features and price. Here’s how we got on with our top picks, including the one my dad gave up on and the one my niece didn’t want to give back.At a glanceBestmattress overall:Otty Original HybridDouble, £569.99 at OttyBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProDouble, £1,199 at SimbaBest budget mattress:Ikea ValevågDouble, £219 at IkeaBest sustainable mattress:Woolroom Standen WoolDouble, £1,476.30 at WoolroomWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades testing products, frommattress topperstoheated clothes airers, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically improve our lives by buying their stuff. I also have a solid background in napping, insomnia and swearing at alarm clocks, so I welcomed the chance to sleep on the job.How I testedView image in fullscreenBalancing a glass of water on the mattresses tested their motion isolation abilities.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFirst, I needed some sleepers. I wanted a broad range of feedback from people of varying sizes who sleep in various positions. I asked my dad (85), my niece (22), my sister and our husbands to join my mattress panel. We each spent at least a fortnight (and sometimes months) sleeping on an allocated mattress.Before we divvied them up, my panel assembled to offer their impressions of every mattress on test. I turned my house into a mattress showroom, invited everyone over and asked them to sit, bounce and lie down on every test sample, alone and together. This enabled us to compare the mattresses side by side and get an overview of their pros and cons. I collected scores out of 10 for everyone’s assessment of firmness and other factors such as breathability, motion isolation and overall comfort, then worked out our average score for each mattress.We then divided the mattresses and began the sleeping tests. To quantify sleep quality, I used thePittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which uses a questionnaire to assess factors such as how long it takes to nod off. I used this as the basis and added questions such as whether they experienced back pain or woke up in the night. Some of us also used our smartwatches to gather sleep-tracking stats.View image in fullscreenWeights measured any sinking of the mattresses.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOther factors were easier to test on my own. I used dumbbell weights to measure how far each mattress sank under various weights, while an infrared thermometer and heat pad revealed how fast they could cool under a warm body. A glass of water on the surface gave an idea of how well the mattress would absorb the movement of a restless partner (motion isolation).Environmental credentials were another important consideration. Mattress makers are secretive about the life cycles of their products, but I discovered what I could about the materials used, their manufacture and their potential for recycling. I also checked verified reviews from paying customers and excluded any mattresses for which delivery and customer service received significant negative feedback.Read on for my guide to the best mattresses, based on these thorough tests.The mattresses sourced for this article are being donated to two charities: Southampton-based poverty support groupScratchand Hampshire-based survivors’ advocacy organisationStop Domestic Abuse.To dive deeper in to my testing process, readhow I tested mattresses for comfort, cost and sustainabilityThe best mattresses you can buy in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Wonderfully breathable’: the Ikea Valevåg.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBest mattress overall:Otty Original HybridOttyOriginal Hybrid£569.99£569.99 at OttyWhat we loveA robust and supremely comfortable hybrid at a good priceWhat we don’t loveAs with all foam mattresses, it will feel less supportive over timeNote: Otty customers have been experiencing delivery issues recently.

We will update this page once we have more information.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £569.99 at OttyOtty’s flagship offering is a firm but cosy and supremely comfortable mattress that helped me sleep fantastically from the first night of testing. The only other one that managed this was the Simba Hybrid Pro, which is hundreds of pounds more expensive.Why we love itThe Otty has an outstanding balance of support, cushioning and breathability. My husband and I slept on it for two months and were sad to see it go. It feels ergonomically supportive from edge to edge, with no dip in the middle, even after several weeks.It’s not too hard for comfort, though. As a small side sleeper, I get lower back pain on very firm mattresses, but this didn’t happen with the Otty. My sleep tracker also revealed that I woke up briefly in the night (“microarousals”) less often than usual. The surface felt breathable and cooled down faster than most other hybrids in my heat-retention tests.When I asked my family to dive in, they put the Otty fourth overall on firmness – squarely at the firm end of the wide medium-firm spectrum – and gave it the highest rating for overall comfort, with an average of 8.3/10.It’s a shame that …the firmness we loved won’t be welcomed by everyone. If you’re upgrading from a well-used pocket-sprung mattress, the strong, flat surface of the Otty may take some adapting to.Suitable for:anyone who wants to upgrade to a hybrid without forking out four figuresType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium-firm, panel rated as 8/10Depth:25cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first 12 months, then every three monthsTrial period:100 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40Sustainability credentials:foam is CertiPur- and Europur-approved for environmental standardsTo find out more, read our fullOtty Original Hybrid mattress reviewOttyOriginal Hybrid£569.99£569.99 at OttyWhat we loveA robust and supremely comfortable hybrid at a good priceWhat we don’t loveAs with all foam mattresses, it will feel less supportive over timeBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProSimbaHybrid Pro£1,199£1,199 at SimbaWhat we loveMotion isolation stops you being disturbed by a restless partnerWhat we don’t loveSupport is less consistent than you’d hope for the pricePhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £1,199 at SimbaThis sumptuous mattress also had me sleeping soundly from the off. It’s expensive, and won’t be firm enough for some, but its wonderfully comfy surface makes you feel like you’re sleeping on a cloud – and it may even bring peace if you share your bed with a fidgety partner (or the dog, or the kids).Why we love itThe medium-firm Simba Hybrid Pro is supportive enough for most people, but it has a cosy, yielding feel that may be down to its upper layer of natural wool. The overall effect is luxurious and decidedly soporific.The Hybrid Pro had the best motion isolation in my test. The mattress doesn’t completely lack bounce, especially on a slatted base, but its foam layers absorb movement so well that it genuinely helped my husband and me sleep through each other’s tossing and turning.Temperature regulation was less impressive, and I wanted to disown my armpits a few times after waking up. The mattress also softened noticeably in the middle after several weeks of testing, but this is common with hybrids and may be welcomed by sleepers who like the way foam adapts to our bodies over time.Our panel’s collective firmness score was 7/10, and our comfort average was an excellent 8.1/10, although my husband and sister found it a bit too soft.It’s a shame that …the price tag is chunky, especially for a mattress that may not maintain its support consistently enough for firm-bed fans.Suitable for:couples who crave a bit of peace (but still want to share a bed)Type:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium-firm, panel rated as 7/10Depth:28cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first three months, then every three monthsTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£50Sustainability credentials: Simba is B Corp certified and aiming for net zero by 2030.

You’d be forgiven for thinking it’s a hybrid, but it avoids that label principally because its pocket springs are wrapped in only slim layers of polyfoam for cushioning. It feels much less robust than its pricier rivals, but it’d be a great choice for the kids or the spare room.Why we love itSimplicity has its benefits. The Valevåg expanded to full size faster than the hybrids and was much lighter. Finally, a mattress I could lift and manoeuvre by myself, including up and down stairs.For similar reasons, Ikea’s mattress is wonderfully breathable and may feel cooler in summer than a hybrid. With no memory foam to trap heat, it cooled down faster than any other mattress in my temperature-control test. Hi-tech open-cell foam is all very well for letting the air circulate, but plain old springs do the same for a lot less cash.My 22-year-old niece, Alex, slept on the Valevåg for two months and was energetically reluctant to give it back. She said it felt supportive enough without being “solid like some of the others”.It’s a shame that …the Valevåg doesn’t hide its cheapness. Our average firmness score was 6.8/10, which barely qualifies for “medium-firm” (although Ikea does make a “firm” version). The bounce of the springs also means motion isolation is poor.Suitable for:young buyers starting out, or for a guest roomType:pocket sprungFirmness:advertised as medium-firm, panel rated as 6.8/10Depth:24cmCover:not removableTurn or rotate:not neededTrial period:365 nights (exchange only)Warranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40 via theMattress Recycling PeopleSustainability credentials:2025 target of 20% recycled content in all Ikea mattress foamsTo find out more, read our fullIkea Valevåg mattress reviewIkeaValevåg£219£219 at IkeaWhat we loveThis breathable, lightweight mattress is a genuine bargainWhat we don’t loveIts bounciness makes sharing it a distracting experienceBest sustainable mattress:Woolroom Standen WoolWoolroomStanden Wool£1,476.30£1,476.30 at WoolroomWhat we loveComfortable, supportive and helps control temperatureWhat we don’t loveHeavy and expensivePhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £1,476.30 at WoolroomWoolroom’s mattress is a masterpiece. The “regular” (medium) edition I tested supported my body confidently without ever feeling too firm, and cushioned me without sinking like foam can. It even smelled delicious. This mattress improved my sleep, proving instantly comfortable and never disappointing me over three months of golden slumbers.What we loveFirmness preference is subjective, but everyone in my family was wowed by the Woolroom’s perfectly balanced, supportive cosiness when I invited them to try it. (You’ll note that I did not invite them to sleep-test this one for me.)The springs are supportive but with a lovely degree of flexibility, so the mattress never feels hard. As a small side-sleeper, I need some “give” to cradle my hips, knees and shoulders so that my spine can align – essential for good sleep and long-term spinal comfort, as explained in our guide tochoosing a mattress for back pain. The Woolroom achieved this every night for three months of testing, and there was never any fear that I’d have to “wear it in”, as is often the case with the more supportive foam mattresses.This is a traditional-looking mattress, with a classic tufted ticking made from breathable natural fibres that helped keep my night sweats at bay. Under the bonnet is a sophisticated system of calico-encased pocket springs (1,400 in the king size) and 12 (12!) layers of traceable British wool, silk, cashmere and cotton – six layers on each side. Strictly speaking, this isn’t a “hybrid” mattress because it doesn’t contain any foam, but it has more layers of material than most of the hybrids I’ve tested.Woolroom’s sustainability credentials helped me sleep even more soundly. It manufactures its mattresses in the UK, recycles 100% of all returned mattresses, and holds numerous certifications, including the Wool ID traceability scheme.If this mattress weren’t quite so pricey (the double I tested normally costs £2,109, although it was discounted to £1,476.30 at the time of writing), it would have replaced the Otty as our best mattress overall. However, price is a big consideration, so the Otty retains its crown – even though the Woolroom matched it in being immediately comfortable and giving me some of the best sleeps of my life.It’s a shame that …it costs more than many will want to pay for a mattress, although its RRP is nearly 10% cheaper than the Tempur below. Another downside it has in common with the Tempur – and many other high-end mattresses – is its chunky weight. The 40kg double was too heavy for me to turn on my own.Type:pocket sprungFirmness:advertised as regular, Alan rated as 8/10, I rated as 7.5/10Depth:29cmCover:not removable, but you can pay extra for a zippable coverTurn:“regularly” for 12 weeks, then every 3 monthsTrial:100 nightsWarranty:15 yearsOld mattress recycling:£50Sustainability:certifications include Wool ID, Global Organic Textile Standard and Oeko-Tex Standard 100 for no harmful chemicals; worked with Bangor University’s Bio Composites team to ensure no VOC emissionsWoolroomStanden Wool£1,476.30£1,476.30 at WoolroomWhat we loveComfortable, supportive and helps control temperatureWhat we don’t loveHeavy and expensiveThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Outstanding temperature regulation and motion isolation’: the Origin Hybrid Pro.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianMillbrook Wool Luxury 4000MillbrookWool Luxury 4000from£615.94£615.94 at Mattress Online£619.02 at B&QWhat we loveLuxuriously comfortable and naturally breathableWhat we don’t loveToo heavy to turn solo, and too bouncy for restless sleepersPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £615.94 at Mattress OnlineDouble, £619.02 at B&QBest for:keeping cool on hot summer nightsA layer of UK-sourced wool just below the sleeping surface of this pocket-sprung mattress adds a slightly spongy feel, but there’s no foam in here, and the mattress is double-sided. Once it starts to soften, which happens fairly quickly, you can flip it to get the fresh, cool firmness of the other side.I tested this mattress for six weeks from early May 2025, when the nights were still chilly, until mid-June, when conditions approached 24/7 mugginess. Initially, I loved its robust, traditional feel and liked the way its tufted surface allowed the air to circulate in the way modern hybrids often don’t. I often struggle with night sweats, and the breathable surface and wool layer genuinely helped me dial down the sogginess.The Millbrook doesn’t offer much in the way of motion isolation, however. Its bounciness amplified my husband’s and my tossing and turning – we’re both hit-and-miss sleepers. Another issue to emerge over the weeks was a surprising level of softening, even on my side of the bed (strange considering I’m smaller than your nan). Flipping the mattress made it feel lovely and supportive again, but we were disappointed to have to do this so soon and so frequently.It didn’t make the final cut because …initially, this mattress offers plenty of support, but it needs flipping every week for four months, which isn’t easy given its above-average weight. It’s also a little too bouncy for couples who want to sleep in peace.Type:pocket sprung;firmness:advertised as medium to firm, we rated as 8.5/10 then 7/10;depth:28cm;cover:not removable;turn:“regularly”;trial:60 nights (exchange only) at Mattress Online;warranty:10 years;old mattress recycling:£35 with Mattress Online if you buy a new mattress;sustainability:Millbrook Beds uses fabrics and fillings “from sustainable sources”; no memory foam or chemical treatments used; Planet Mark certifiedTo find out more, read our fullMillbrook Wool Luxury 4000 reviewMillbrookWool Luxury 4000from£615.94£615.94 at Mattress Online£619.02 at B&QWhat we loveLuxuriously comfortable and naturally breathableWhat we don’t loveToo heavy to turn solo, and too bouncy for restless sleepersOrigin Hybrid ProOriginHybrid Pro£687£687 at OriginWhat we loveCooling, supportive – and absorbs tossing and turningWhat we don’t loveToo firm for smaller side sleepers, too deep for most sheetsPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £687 at OriginBest for:couples who both love a firm orthopaedic mattressOrigin claims its Hybrid Pro is “medium-firm”, but it is nothing of the sort and instead came top in all my measures of firmness. If, like my sister Maeve and her husband, Ben, you crave the strong pushback of a solid mattress, you will love it. Lucky for them, they got to test it for two months.This gigantic, heavy hybrid also delivers outstanding temperature regulation and motion isolation. Maeve and Ben reported that the “silky surface with long dents” kept them cool without feeling cold, and after years on a pocket-sprung mattress, they declared its movement-absorbing powers to be “life changing”.It didn’t make the final cut because …this level of firmness is too hard for many, including me.

Oh, a lotof support. This is the firmest mattress I tested, and despite liking the way that felt when I first lay down on it, I soon had to concede defeat when my back ached after a few nights. Over time, it may have developed more cushioning to accommodate my pipsqueak frame and foetal sleep position, or my back might have grown used to it (commonly needed with firm mattresses), but I passed it on to my sister and her husband.“I love this one: it’s the firmest bed I’ve ever tried, but it’s not at all like sleeping on the floor,” said Ben. “I spend hours sitting up in bed reading, and most mattresses are too soft for that. This is perfect.” Maeve agreed on the sitting up part, but found it too firm for sleep. “My hips had nowhere to go,” she said. “I want to love this mattress, but my back didn’t quite feel right.” It’s important to say here that Maeve and I are small, and a larger person would benefit much more from the Sealy’s orthopaedic firmness.Its seven-year guarantee is shorter than others in my test, but this feels like a mattress that will last a decade, with superb edge support and a robust piped-edge design. It’s also a good year-round choice, with temperature-regulating fabric casing and excellent results in my heat-retention test, where it cooled down faster than most mattresses containing foam. Just a shame you can’t remove the cover for washing.It didn’t make the final cut because …you may have to head for your nearest bed superstore to buy this mattress.

It has a solid central section that’s firmer on one side than the other, so you flip it (with a little effort) to select your level of firmness. You then zip on a thick, spongy “comfort layer” – much like a mattress topper – on whichever side you choose.My weight tests and family feedback revealed the two sides to be disappointingly similar. Both were too soft for Maeve and Ben, who slept on this mattress for a fortnight before switching to the much firmer Origin. Their daughter Alex tried it out and also found it too soft, as did my husband.I liked the Wunderflip much more than my family did. Its supportive base layers provide strong, consistent pushback beneath the cushioned top layer, especially when you choose the “firmer” side. The foamy cushioning is brilliant at absorbing movement, and it all feels extremely robust.It didn’t make the final cut because …the “flip for firmness” idea doesn’t really work, because both sides are similarly soft – perhaps because the removable “comfort layer” is so soft. The hulking weight (more than 50kg for a double) makes it tricky to manoeuvre. Better to pick a side and stick with it.Type:hybrid;firmness:advertised as medium on one side and firm on the other, panel rated as 4.3 and 6.5 respectively;depth:28cm;cover:not removable;rotate:once a month for first 12 months, then every three months;trial:200 nights;warranty:10 years;old mattress recycling:£50;sustainability:foam is CertiPur approved and CFC/PBDE-free; cover is Oeko-Tex certifiedEveWunderflip Premium Hybrid£999£999 at EveWhat we loveIts squishy memory foam is a wonderful motion absorberWhat we don’t loveThe zip-off memory foam layer is decidedly soft – and heavyPanda Hybrid BambooPandaHybrid Bamboo£799£799 at PandaWhat we loveAdaptive support suits a wide range of peopleWhat we don’t loveInitially too firm for smaller side sleepers, but softensPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £799 at PandaBest for:couples who sleep on their sides, and anyone who overheats at nightThis fabulous-looking hybrid excels at motion isolation and temperature regulation, and its naturally hypoallergenic bamboo yarn cover may help limit morning sneezes.

It felt too firm for me at first, too. But this mattress is a great illustration of why you shouldn’t judge memory foam too quickly.

My husband, an avowed fan of firm beds, said it was “like being sucked into quicksand” – but if you prefer a softer mattress, you won’t find much more luxurious examples than this.The plush tension of the SmartCool makes your body feel cradled in a way that can relieve pressure and help soothe joint pain. I asked my dad, Don, 85, to sleep-test it and report back on its impact on his recently injured hip and shoulder. He enjoyed the initial sense of weightlessness but admitted that the overall effect was too soft for his taste. The mattress is available in medium-firm and firm, too, but it’s worth noting that even the firmest foam softens within weeks, as I discovered when testing hybrids including theSimba Hybrid ProandPanda Hybrid Bamboo.I was impressed by the mattress’s cooling fabric cover, which gives the SmartCool its name and aims to offset foam’s tendency to trap your body’s heat. The mattress didn’t exactly cool me down during the roasting nights of July’s heatwave, but it felt surprisingly fresh to touch and didn’t greet me with a pool of sweat in the morning.It didn’t make the final cut because …the deep cushioning of “medium” tension Tempur foam is an acquired taste, which I’ve yet to acquire.

It has a fairly simple construction that combines supportive pocket springs with three layers of foam for cushioning. Previously called the Emma Hybrid Premium, the Original isn’t really a “premium” hybrid – it has 672 springs in the double mattress I tested, while the more expensive Simba Hybrid Pro, by contrast, has up to 4,800 springs in a king size.In our initial testing, my family and I found the Emma very comfortable. Its relatively low spring count and three upper layers of foam push it to the softer end of the medium-firm spectrum. I found it less comfortable to sleep on because it didn’t support my hips and lower back enough, but it may suit you if you prefer a well-cushioned surface with good pressure relief for sore joints. Its foam also does an excellent job of absorbing the movements of a restless partner – a key factor if you share your bed. I also like that the cover’s top section unzips easily for washing at a generous 60C (the bottom section will endure 40C), and the mattress’s relatively light weight makes it easier to rotate and manoeuvre than others I’ve tested.Emma’s delivery and customer service have received mixed reviews from customers in the past, so I bought my test mattress instead of requesting a sample. It was delivered by DPD, on time and with no problems.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t support my lower back as well as I’m used to.

Too cushioned, as it turned out. Alan and I tested this one ourselves, and we’re not heavy people, but we noticed that the foam layer had softened far beyond its supposedly “firm” rating after a month of sleeping on it. Our tests with weights bore this out, revealing that the centre of the mattress sank a centimetre (30%) further under 7.5kg than it had a month before. At £799.99 for the double we tested, I’d expect a more robust performance.That said, this mattress is cosy and will suit those who like the way foam yields under the curves of their body. I loved the feel of the surface, with its blue and white pattern and lovely soft stretch-knit fabric, although sadly you can’t remove it for washing. The foam never trapped the heat of our bodies, either, although that may be because we tested the Slumberland on the chilly nights of November 2025.It didn’t make the final cut because …all foam softens in its initial months of sleeping, but in this case, it made the mattress feel less supportive or robust than I’d have hoped, given its price. The cheaperOtty Original Hybriddoes a much better job of retaining its support, despite containing multiple layers of foam.Type:hybrid;firmness:advertised as firm, Alan and I rated as 8.5/10 then 7/10;depth:26.5cm;cover:not removable;turn:rotate “on a semi-regular basis”;trial:40 nights;warranty:eight years;old mattress recycling:from £25;sustainability:packaging is made from minimum 50% sugar cane and 30% recycled plastics in line with Bensons’ net zero commitmentSlumberlandOrthopaedic Support Luxe£799.99£799.99 at Bensons for BedsWhat we loveThis adaptive hybrid is well cushioned and dissipates heatWhat we don’t loveCould be better at retaining its initial supportivenessWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenLeaving no stone – or mattress – unturned, in the name of quality sleep.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianWhat is a bed-in-a-box mattress?The bed-in-a-box industry has upgraded mattress delivery for the era of apartment living. Even the chunkiest delivery team would struggle to heft a king-size mattress to your sixth-floor flat, so the new generation of sleep companies, including Otty, Eve and Simba, vacuum-shrink their mattresses in the factory for delivery.As a house-dweller who goes through mattresses as frequently as a normal person goes through tubes of toothpaste, I can confirm that getting a mattress up a flight of stairs is significantly easier when it’s shrunk into a box.Not all mattresses can be delivered this way. The more conventionally constructed mattresses I’ve reviewed, including the Woolroom Standen Wool and the Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000, were delivered unshrunk. Mattresses that contain foam seem more likely to be delivered in bed-in-a-box format, but it’s not always the case: the eminently squishy all-foam Tempur Pro Plus SmartCool was delivered full-size.Are bed-in-a-box mattresses bad for the environment?Vacuum-shrinking a mattress, which is like using a vacuum storage bag for your winter coats and duvets but on a bigger scale, uses metres of plastic wrapping to prevent the compressed mattress from expanding en route to your door. So while it’s convenient, it means you’re left with an awful lot of packaging. I mean, ahideousamount. Your recycling collection may take the huge cardboard boxes, but in most areas (including mine), they won’t take the huge volume of plastic wrapping. You’ll have to take it to a household waste centre – unless you’re redecorating and need a dust sheet.On the upside, vacuum-shrinking means a single lorry can accommodate many more mattresses than if they were delivered full-size. It’s also worth noting that bed-in-a-box companies don’t tend to have showrooms, so they let you sleep on your new mattress for months before you have to decide whether to keep it. My experience of these trials has been fairly smooth, with Otty and Emma collecting mattresses and issuing refunds quickly. However, neither team was directly employed by the brands (only Ikea sent a branded van when delivering), and the Emma team didn’t know what they were collecting.No delivery team offered to take away my old mattress. Most brands offer to recycle old mattresses for a fee of about £50, but you have to organise that in addition to ordering your new mattress. It also seems expensive given that my local council’s recycling team collects mattresses for £20.Ultimately, the mattresses that are worst for the environment are the ones that are thrown out the fastest. Bed-in-a-box warranties typically cover 10 years, which is excellent. Just be careful that you don’t void your guarantee by, for example, standing on the mattress or using an electric blanket (as foam can soften and even crack under too much heat).How do I know it’s a good deal?It’sBlack Fridayall year round in mattress world. Bed-in-a-box companies seem to regard “sale” prices as the rule rather than the exception, andSimba,EmmaandDormeohave all been sanctioned by the Advertising Standards Authority for misleading marketing tactics.There are genuine deals to be found, however. If you’re looking at a mattress deal and wondering how legit it is, searchPriceRunnerto see its price history. Free appAnyTrackeris less quick but gives richer results, including alerts when your desired mattress meets your desired price.How to clean a mattressHere are a few stats to help you sleep at night: the average mattress contains between 1.5 million and 10 million dust mites, depending on whom you believe. These mites feast on dead skin cells, of which you shed up to 40,000 a minute, and thrive on moisture, of which you leak about a pint a night. “Up to 10% of the weight of an old pillow could be made up of dust mite faeces,” sayresearchers from UCL. Sweet dreams.The best pillows in the UK for every type of sleeper, testedRead moreThe war on dust mite poo begins with a good mattress protector and clean sheets, which you should change about once a week. A zip-off washable cover, as featured on many of our best mattresses, including theOtty Original HybridandSimba Hybrid Pro, is another key line of defence against grossness. Just make sure all these covers are fully dry after washing, because the last thing you want to do is get more moisture into the mattress. That will lead to mould – and you really do not want to share your bed withmould spores.With all the covers removed for washing, get out thevacuum cleaner. Vacuum every surface of the mattress, including the bottom if it’s one-sided, and get the nozzle into any nooks and crannies. While you’re at it, rotate the mattress from head to toe to keep it as sag-free as possible, or turn it if it’s two-sided. Now let your mattress air for a while, with an open window if the weather allows. You could even make like the Germans do and hang your duvet out to air for a few hours. Just remember that while fresh air can help dissipate smells, it also lets in allergens, so it’s worth vacuuming your mattress again before you put all the freshly cleaned elements back together.If there are no stains or spillages on the mattress, that’s as far as you should go. But if there’s been a bed-wetting accident or breakfast-in-bed mishap, use a dry, clean sponge to mop up as much liquid as possible. The aim is to ensure no moisture soaks in. Recent blood, sweat or urine stains can be tackled by dabbing with a little cold water and washing-up liquid (don’t rub; this can spread the stain). Don’t spray carpet cleaner on the mattress because it will damage the fabric, but upholstery cleaner is safe in small doses. If there’s a smell, sprinkle baking soda over the whole surface of the mattress and leave it for several hours, then vacuum it thoroughly.How often should you replace a mattress?Your mattress is likely to need replacing after seven to eight years, according to organisations including theSleep FoundationandBed Advice UK. “After that time, your mattress will have had around four bathtubs of sweat applied to it,” says Hannah Shore, head of sleep science atMattress Online. “Dust, dead skin cells and other matter will also collect in the mattress, making it unhygienic.”That may be true, but most of the mattresses we reviewed come with 10-year warranties, and two – the Woolroom Standen Wool and Origin Hybrid Pro – even stretch even stretchto 15, so seven years seems short. Do I smell a mattress industry trying to sell me a new bed before I really need it? Surely it’s more environmentally and financially responsible to hang on to a mattress until it’s falling apart? Maybe, but studies suggest it’s not good for your health or your sleep.The cocktail of bacterial sleep goo that leaches into a mattress under the weight of at least one human every night eats away at its springs, fillings and foam. The result is a lumpy surface that loses its comfort and support. Support is key whenchoosing a mattress– without it, you’ll suffer all manner of maladies, including back pain, aching shoulders and poor sleep. One US study tracked a cohort of men and women with minor sleep-related pain, and whose beds were an average of nine-and-a-half years old. Switching to new, medium-firm mattresses resulted in “significant improvements” in their back pain and sleep quality.The seven-year switch is not an exact science, though. Mattress durability varies widely, and some mattresses made using high-quality materials such as natural latex can have a lifespan of up to 20 years, according to UK mattress company Latex Sense. Rather than assume your mattress will need replacing in seven years, learn the signs to look for.Sagging and failing springs are the most obvious signs that it’s time for a new mattress. Others are that you wake up sneezing, feel your partner moving in bed more than you used to, and feel the bed giving way when you sit on the side. “One of the best signs is that you sleep better elsewhere,” says Shore. “If you sleep significantly better in a hotel bed, it’s probably a sign that your mattress at home needs replacing.”A few provisos, though. One thing I’ve learned from sleep-testing more than a dozen mattresses over the years is that a new bed can mess up your sleep for the first couple of nights, especially if you’re used to a much softer surface. Your body needs to adjust to being supported properly. Bear in mind that even the firmest foam layers soften quite a bit over the first few months, so give your new bed a chance – and take advantage of free trials if you don’t get on with it.Also, take mattress companies up on their recycling offers. At about £40-£50, these services cost more than kerbside council collections, but they guarantee your old bed will be disposed of responsibly and not simply chucked intolandfill.For more on sleeping in style and comfort from the Filter:The best mattresses for back painThe best duvets in the UK for every season and sleeperThe best pillows for every type of sleeperJane Hoskyn is aconsumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

To counterbalance the intake of cake, she tends to look for “something salty, spiced and crisp”, and, if time is on her side, that usually means homemade tortilla chips. “Chop corn tortillas into triangles, brush with olive oil and seasonings – flaky salt, za’atar, dukkah, garlic granules, or everything bagel seasoning, which is elite.” Bake until nice and crisp, then dunk into hummus. Her fellow Guardian regularGeorgina Haydenis also rarely found without a tub of that creamy chickpea dip, whether it’s homemade or shop-bought: “I usually drizzle chilli crisp oil over the top of my hummus, then scoop it up with crudites [celery, carrot, cucumber, say]. That’ssogood – andsoeasy.”If Hayden’s trying “to be fancy”, however, her attention turns to gildas, – “an olive, a little anchovy and a pickled green chilli on a cocktail stick – or just a lovely, salty, anchovy-stuffed olive”. You could, of course, thread any antipasti you have knocking around on to said stick: “Sun-dried tomato, artichoke heart or one of those gorgeous, marinated onions.” Having a batch of that in the fridge feels “like a treat, but less indulgent”, she adds.Our columnists often say cheese, too, whether that’s simply a cube (*waves at Ebuehi*) or, forRukmini Iyer, mixed into some homemade dough and baked: “I mean, it’s still a biscuit, but you can flavour it with whatever you want,” she says, be that with rosemary or sage, or nigella, fennel, caraway or cumin seeds. They’re easy, to boot: “Blitz cheese in a food processor, add spelt flour and butter, and blitz again into a dough. Roll into a log, wrap in baking paper and pop in the fridge.” Iyer usually does this prep in the evening, then, the next morning, she turns on the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, slices the cheesy log into slim discs, transfers those to a lined oven tray and bakes for 10 minutes, until golden. “You’ve then got freshly baked snacks for the day, which are as good for adults as they are for children.” In a similar vein, cheese pinwheels and straws are another hit chez Hayden: “Lay out a sheet of puff pastry, spread it with Marmite and a bit of butter, then grate over any hard cheeses you have in the fridge.” Cut into strips, gently twist each one into a spiral and bake: “Those last well, too.”Thomasina Miers’ tactic, meanwhile, is to go nuts: “Toast fennel seeds, then toss them with chilli flakes, sea salt and chopped rosemary. Toss that with some olive oil and honey, then use it to coat a mix of your favourite nuts and seeds.” Roast at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for about 20 minutes, until golden, and the job’s a good ’un. Alternatively, up your snack game with a savoury granola, which Ebuehi whips up by mixing nuts, oats, honey (“for a little sweetness”), sesame seeds and seasoning (“za’atar, garlic powder, chilli, for example”), then baking until golden. Eat by the pawful or sprinkle over yoghurt – no, it’s not quite a Hobnob, but it’s pretty damned good nonetheless.Got a culinary dilemma?

January is a time for turning on the oven and cooking without having to think too much, and this is the sort of dish that more or less looks after itself while you get on with your evening. The kitchen feels warmer, the smell changes and you know that dinner is sorted. This is simple, honest food, and not remotely trying to be clever. It’s just something to put in the middle of the table, cut into and share, which is exactly what you want when the days are cold and nights are long.Slow-roast celeriac with rosemary and crisp chorizoPrep5 minCook2 hr+Serves41 large celeriac2 sprigs rosemary, leaves picked2 garlic cloves, peeled1 tsp smoked sweet paprika2 tbsp olive oilSea salt and black pepper125g chorizo, chopped2 tbsp apple cider vinegar2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 small handful chopped flat-leaf parsley, to finishHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Wash and trim the celeriac, then pierce it all over with the tip of a sharp knife and put it in an ovenproof dish.Put the rosemary, garlic, paprika and olive oil in a mortar, add some salt and pepper, then crush to a coarse paste. Coat the outside of the celeriac with the rosemary mixture. Put a splash of water in the bottom of the dish, then cover the celeriac with tinfoil and roast for two to two and a half hours, until tender to the point of a knife.When the celeriac is cooked, put a frying pan on a medium heat, then fry the chorizo until golden and crisp. Pour the vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil into the hot chorizo pan and stir to combine and reduce.Cut the celeriac into 1cm-thick slices, then arrange these on a platter and spoon on the chorizo dressing.

Here, the Water of Leith river meets the sea, and on bright days, when pubs and restaurants spill out to the Shore area, there’s nowhere quite like it. I moved here 13 years ago, and it has been a joy to watch the area evolve and reinvent itself. Today it’s the city’s creative heart, full of artists, musicians, designers and startups, with a thriving food and drink scene. The arrival of the tramline from Edinburgh city centre in 2023 has given it a big boost too.View image in fullscreenThe Shore, Leith.Photograph: Robert Harding/AlamyAlthough the Leith immortalised in Irvine Welsh’s Trainspotting is long gone, to call it fully gentrified would be failing to pay attention. Two recent campaigns, both successful, have galvanised locals: one to stop Waterstones opening near the independent Argonaut Books; and the other to return the benches used by day-drinkers on the Kirkgate, which had been removed by the council. There’s space for both in Leith.What keeps me here is the strong, village-like community spirit, paired with the ever-changing energy of a city. One day I can get stuck into digging on the Community Croft; the next I’m immersed in art galleries, gigs and fine dining. For visitors, Leith offers a slice of real Edinburgh, with no bus tours, shops selling tartan tat, or out-of-tune bagpipes.Where to eat and drinkView image in fullscreenBarry Fish restaurant opened in early 2025Leith’s food and drink ranges from Michelin-starred restaurants to community cafes, old-men’s pubs to smart cocktail bars. Over the past few years there has been a flurry of openings that mirror the creativity of the area. “Leith has the perfect mix of old and new: places that have been here for decades, and new energy coming through,” says chef Barry Bryson. “It’s multicultural, rich and varied, and serves a community of diners, not just one demographic.” Bryson opened his first restaurant,Barry Fish, on the Shore in early 2025. Immediately it became one of my favourite places to eat. I recommend cosying into the calm green interiors and ordering the trout pastrami and lobster agnolotti.Chef Roberta Hall-McCarron and her husband, Shaun McCarron, opened the cafe-barArdfernin 2024, next door to their fine-dining restaurant The Little Chartroom. I’ve eaten there at every hour, enjoying lazy brunches, birthday lunches, early evening oysters and long dinners with friends. The hash browns are non-negotiable, most recently topped with sprout kimchi, fish sauce aioli and nori. “It’s inspiring to be part of a supportive, creative community,” says Shaun.View image in fullscreenA dish at Ardfern.Photograph: AwAyeMediaThat emphasis on community is echoed atDogstar, newly opened by chef James Murray along with Michael Lynch and Kyle Jamieson of Nauticus bar. After years cooking at the highest level and earning a Michelin star at Timberyard, Murray found an increasing sense of disconnect with the world of fine dining. “The next stage for me was wanting to live and work in my community, so choosing Leith was intentional,” he says. “There’s a pride to people down here. If it’s a Leith spot cooking for Leith people, they get behind you.” Sitting at the bar watching dishes spin in the kitchen, eating shellfish straight from the coals, and dunking warm focaccia into anchovy sauce, I’m certainly behind this restaurant.Cultural experiencesTo discover Leith’s artistic community, visitCustom Lane, a collaborative design space in the old Custom House building on the river, with artists’ workshops, galleries and an excellent cafe. Onsite,Bardis a gallery and shop designed to look like the home of a collector. Husbands Hugo Macdonald and James Stevens travel across Scotland bringing contemporary Scottish design to Leith, inviting the curious to explore the integration of high-end design in a domestic environment. Regardless of your interiors budget, it’s not to be missed.Across the river isBrown’s of Leith, the newest outpost of Custom Lane. This vast three-storey Victorian warehouse has been transformed into a multi-use creative space by GRAS architects. On the ground floor, three food businesses – ShrimpWreck shellfish bar, Haze for wine and top-tier snacks, and Civerinos pizza – share a relaxed dining area, with more residents, events and collaborations imminent. “At Brown’s we identified a need for spaces that genuinely support and celebrate creativity,” says architect Gunnar Groves-Raines of GRAS. The restaurateurs are equally enthusiastic. “Leith has a strong sense of identity: independent, creative and rooted in its history,” says Joseph Radford of Haze. “Our intention is to respond to that rather than overwrite it.” I visit early in the evening when the lights are low, the music perfectly pitched and the atmosphere a relaxed buzz. Soon our table is full of oysters, bowls of mussels and tinned fish on toast. It’s a lot of fun.View image in fullscreenGRAS architects at Brown’s of Leith, a Victorian warehouse that’s now a creative space.Photograph: Richard GastonFurther collaborative art spaces across Leith are also worth exploring. BetweenDrill Hall,The Biscuit FactoryandCoburg House Art Studios, there’s always something interesting going on. And there’s more to come – after years of tireless volunteer fundraising and campaigning,Leith theatrehas been awarded lottery funding to restore the beautiful 1932 art deco building to its former glory. Pop-ups in the space, including a past Edinburgh international festival residency, have offered a thrilling glimpse of the future.Where to shopLeith is home to some great independent shops.Argonaut Books, inside the old train station, is run by people passionate about reading, and has a lovely cafe and regular events. Arty gift shops includeLogan Malloch,FluxandHandselon Leith Walk – all sell work by local artists. For interesting wine, head to the tiny independentBludge.Don’t missTheRoyal Yacht Britanniaattracts hundreds daily, keen for a glimpse of how the monarchs holidayed. But I prefer thePort of Leith Distillery, an impressive-looking “vertical distillery” where whisky production takes place from top-to-bottom over nine storeys. Tours of the stills are fascinating and the views over the Firth of Forth to Fife from the cafe and bar are unmatched. Take a stroll along the Water of Leith path, perhaps followed by a visit to a taproom for a fresh pint. Leith has a flourishing craft brewery scene, andMoonwake,CampervanandNewbarnsall have welcoming taprooms.StayMalmaison Edinburghhas smart riverside rooms (from £77 room-only), or push the boat out (pun intended) and spend the night on boardFingal(cabins from £269 B&B), a former lighthouse tender turned luxury hotel, permanently moored in Leith.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh holidaysZoning inScotland holidaysCity breaksShort breaksFood and drinkShopping tripsUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The break is rarely clean enough to propagate, yet not detached enough to ignore. You are left with a drooping limb and a sinking feeling. People on Reddit swear by a first-aid kit of drinking straws and cinnamon – can it save the day?The hackA straw acts as a splint to hold a bent stem upright while it heals. Cinnamon is sprinkled on the wound as a natural antifungal, said to help keep rot at bay.The methodCut a drinking straw lengthwise so it opens up, dust the damaged area of the plant with cinnamon, wrap the straw around it, and secure it loosely with string. Add a stake if needed, and avoid disturbing the plant by moving it.Houseplant hacks: Can I reuse my potting mix?Read moreThe testI used the splint on a bent Monstera stem. After a few weeks, the damaged section had callused and firmed up, and I was able to remove the straw without the stem collapsing.

I am truly grateful for ​them bothAmy-Jane BeerTue 27 Jan 2026 00.30 ESTShareI’ve heard it said that birds come to people who’ve lost someone dear. It seemed a nice thing to believe, but I never really imagined it might be true. But neither did I imagine losing my only sibling at the age of 53. Nic’s childhood nickname, Twinkle, was apt. She was the brightest, kindest person I’ve ever known, and the ferocity of the cancer that took her in barely a month just before Christmas blindsided us all.A few days after she slipped away, we went with friends to watch a starling murmuration. It’s something we do most years, but never before have we seen a bird tumble from the throng and crash at our feet like a feathered meteorite. I scooped her into my hat. Sometimes all a stunned bird needs to recover is a warm, safe place to rest. But it wasn’t to be, and so now that impossibly beautiful body is buried* under our damson tree. Star. Sister. Bird. Blossom. All the same interchangeable stuff.View image in fullscreenA close-up of the starling.Photograph: Amy-Jane BeerThree mornings before Nic’s funeral, I was in bed reading, under two duvets, because my husband had flung open every window in the house to vent after a sledge-and-sleepover birthday party. Life does indeed go on, and 14 teenagers with wet kit generate quite a fog.Head down in my book, I glimpsed movement out of the corner of my eye, and there, perched at the end of the bed, was another a bird that I cannot help but associate with my sister, one that is brave, bright, confiding and always singing: a robin. She whirred from perch to perch, cocked her head as I spoke, and hovered in front of my face. Eventually I found courage to thank her for coming, and then to say it was OK to leave – and she did.I’m not suggesting that either bird exactly chose to come. But I can interpret and accept these visitations as gifts, the first giving me someone to bury, and the second someone to thank. And I think I needed a reminder that it’s good to open windows, both literally and metaphorically, even in January – perhapsespeciallyin January – because there are always things we need to let in, and others that need to be let out.*The bird was buried in line with veterinary advice on avian influenza, though infection was not suspected.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024, is available now atguardianbookshop.comExplore more on these topicsBirdsCountry diaryWildlifeRural affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His colleagues in local emergency wards were getting worried.All week, people had taken to the streets and had been met by police with batons and pellet guns. With treatment, their injuries should not have been too serious. But emergency room staff believed many wounded young people were avoiding hospitals, terrified that registering as trauma patients would lead to their identification and arrest.Quietly, Ahmadi [who remains anonymous due to fear of reprisals, but whose identity, credentials and presence within Iran during the unrest have been verified by the Guardian] and his wife began treating patients at a location outside Iran’s government hospital system. Alerted by a local whisper network, wounded young people flocked to them. Mostly, they brought superficial injuries – laceration wounds needing stitches and antibiotics. As Thursday evening wore on, more and more arrived to be patched up.The next day, everything abruptly changed. Protesters kept coming, but their injuries were close-range gunshots and severe stab wounds,typically to the chest, eyes and genitals. Many proved fatal.Ahmadi was shocked by the number being killed – more than 40 in his small town alone – butwith the internet blacked out, no one knew what the national picture was. To piece it together, Ahmadi assembled a network of more than 80 medical professionals across 12 of Iran’s 31 provinces to share observations and data, and to build a clearer picture of the violence.They’ve mass murdered people. No one can imagine … I saw just blood, blood and bloodTheir observations, shared with the Guardian and combined with accounts from morgues and graveyards across the country, begin to reveal the vast scale of violence inflicted on Iranians during the state’s crackdown. Ahmadi and his colleagues are hesitant to provide a figure for the toll but agree “all publicly cited death tolls represent a severe underestimation”. Comparing the number of dead they witnessed with hospital baselines, they estimate it could exceed 30,000, far surpassing official figures. This is based on the conclusion that “officially registered deaths related to the crackdown likely represent less than 10% of the real number of fatalities”.View image in fullscreenProtesters march behind a banner saying ‘Over 15,000 dead in 48 hours on Khamenei’s order’ in London, UK, on 17 January.Photograph: Martin Pope/Getty ImagesEstimates of the number killed vary substantially, hampered by the ongoing internet shutdown. The Iranian government has acknowledged more than 3,000 dead, and the US-based organisation HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency), whose figures have been reliable during previous crackdowns, says it has verified more than6,000 deadand has more than 17,000 more recorded deaths under investigation, giving a possible total of about 22,000. Other estimates from doctors based outside Iran range up to 33,000 or more.Testimony from morgues, graveyards and hospitals around the country reveal concerted efforts by authorities to conceal the true size of the toll: bodies being transported in ice-cream vans and meat trucks; piles of the dead being hastily buried; and hundreds of bodies apparently disappearing from Iran’s network of forensic facilities.The language Ahmadi uses is measured and clinical, but he is brought to tears describing the violence the doctors documented. “From a medical standpoint, the injuries we observed demonstrate a brutality without limit – both in scale and in method,” he says. Another doctor, who is based in Tehran, tells the Guardian: “I am on the verge of a psychological collapse. They’ve mass murdered people. No one can imagine … I saw just blood, blood and blood.”Across Iran inmorgues and cemeteries, the bodies piled up– overwhelming many hospitals and forensic units, which were forced to turn trucks filled with corpses away. Graveyard and forensic medical staff describe chaos, with reports of authorities pushing for fast, mass burials to conceal the number dead.At one morgue, staff say they were confronted with several trucks loaded with bodies, far exceeding the facility’s refrigeration and storage capacity. When staff protested that they could not process the volume of corpses, two trucks loaded with the dead were moved elsewhere – but when the morgue workers tried to track down where the bodies had been taken, they found none of the large forensic facilities in the region had received them. The doctors “expressed suspicion that this was linked todafn-e dast-e jam’i[mass burial]”.View image in fullscreenA still from a video shows bodies lying inside the Kahrizak forensic medical centre in Tehran, with what appear to be relatives searching for loved ones.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesAhmadi’s network found at least seven other colleagues from forensic facilities across four large provinces who reported similar experiences. Verified video from Kahrizak morgue in Tehran shows similar scenes, including what appear to be hundreds of bodies laid out in the street outside the facility.The Guardian also spoke to three witnesses who independently described a push for mass burials and piles of hundreds of bodies at a large graveyard (Behesht-e Sakineh) in the city of Karaj, 30 miles (50km) west of Tehran.0:46Bodies line the streets outside morgue in Tehran as protests continue – videoIn a written account shared with the Guardian, Reza*, a witness who says he was present at Behesht-e Sakineh, says: “On January 10 and 11, they brought in hundreds of bodies which were said to be unclaimed and unidentified.” Many of the dead, he says, were transported in small pickup trucks typically used for fruit and vegetables, and not all were sealed in body bags.“These vehicles make dozens of trips back and forth from storage facilities … I have seen bodies in these trucks so stuck together it required strength to pull them apart. The blood was still fresh and dried up when they overcrowded them in piles.”His description is echoed by Ahmadi and his network, who say they observed a pattern across multiple towns of “refrigerated trucks normally used for ice-cream or meat” that were “moving in convoys to forensic medicine facilities and hospital back entrances”.One witness at Behesht-e Sakineh, who was granted access to the site to look for the body of a friend, says he personally searched through hundreds of “stacked” bodies and was told by graveyard staff that they had “received thousands of bodies just in the past two days”.Staff told him that “the order was to bury these bodies in mass graves,” but many refused, afraid of reprisals. He relayed one staff member saying: “I am frightened to do that, because people … will eventually come looking for their missing family members and they will kill and bury me as being responsible for these mass graves.”Iran protest doctor: ‘In one street, I saw blood pooled in a gutter with a trail stretching several metres’ | AnonymousRead moreThe accounts from Behesht-e Sakineh form just one example of what appears to be a national pattern, with forensic medical staff around the country reporting similar scenes. Doctors and morgue staff emphasise that the types of injuries seen on patients and corpses indicate deliberate, systematic killing and maiming of protesters as opposed to random, chaotic shooting.In some cases, the killings bore the hallmarks of executions. Medical workers at forensic facilities in two different Iranian towns described receiving bodies with close-range gunshot wounds to the head that had been transferred from hospital morgues while still attached to catheters, nasogastric tubes or endotracheal tubes.“This is highly suspicious,” Ahmadi says. “As a rule, foreign medical instruments are removed after death. Their presence suggests that these individuals died while still under active medical care.”View image in fullscreenMembers of Scotland’s Iranian community hold a ceremony in Glasgow in remembrance of protesters killed, 22 January.Photograph: Cameron Scott/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThose accounts correspond to photographs verified by the Iranian factchecking organisation Factnameh, which show dead patients in body bags wearing hospital gowns, with catheters still attached, and what appear to be gunshot wounds to the forehead. The Guardian has not independently verified the photographs. A UK-based Iranian doctor who analysed the photographs said: “From a medical point of view, it appears the bodies seen with catheters and medical devices attached were shot directly in the head while under treatment.”Even as medical staff attempt to share their testimony and data, many fear that the true number of dead may never be known, concealed by an orchestrated national effort by authorities to obscure the death toll.“These mechanisms include discouraging hospital attendance, removing bodies from standard forensic pathways, relocating large numbers of corpses beyond documented facilities, and limiting the ability of medical staff to register causes of death,” the doctors’ observations conclude.Taken together Ahmadi says, “they form a system designed not only to suppress protest, but to suppress memory”.*Names have been changed to protect identities.Explore more on these topicsIranRights and freedomMiddle East and north AfricaProtestHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they split and the trauma floored her. Now she’s back with defiant paintings celebrating her punk past – and late-career motherhoodTue 27 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 10.35 ESTShareSue Webster is reminiscing about boozy 90s art openings. A hazy memory of Damien Hirst riding Leigh Bowery’s shoulders is surfacing, and a terrible fight with Jake Chapman at Charles Saatchi’s gallery. “It was a verbal thing but he was probably about to punch me. You’d get very drunk on the free champagne.”Webster, and her former partner in art, romance and general punk rockery, Tim Noble, hit London in 1992 as the YBAs rose to fame. Five years later, Saatchi stopped by their cheap-as-chips live-work space in Shoreditch and, with his taxi still running outside, snapped up a light sculpture called Toxic Schizophrenia and a “shadow sculpture” titled Miss Understood and Mr Meanor. The shadow sculptures were meticulously melded pieces of junk and detritus which, when lit from one side, projected self-portrait silhouettes onto the wall. Webster says she would sometimes cry when saying goodbye to an artwork after selling it. So what does an artist do when such a long and successful partnership ends? “I wanted to unravel my brain, and work out how I ended up here,” she says.Webster is from Leicester, and met Noble, from Gloucestershire, on the first day of art school in Nottingham. The pair, who made work as a pair for more than 30 years, stopped living together in 2012, divorced in 2018 and cut professional ties in 2020. Now, on the eve of her first institutional solo show, Webster refers back to “Tim and Sue” in the third person, “like it’s a brand and I’m dissociated, someone else made that work.”View image in fullscreen‘We have gone off in completely different directions’ … with Tim Noble in 2012.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWe’re in her studio atMole Housein London, which she built with architect David Adjaye behind the dishevelled facade of the home of the infamous “mole man” who dug tunnels under the streets from his basement, until eventually the road collapsed. Her cat luxuriates on the under-floor heating while she talks me through the new works. The show is organised aroundCrime Scene, a wall-filling, confessional piece linking hundreds of artefacts of her life, from her teenage years up. Siouxsie and the Banshees loom large, as does her obsession with all things German, from Adidas to the Nazis. There’s a paperback of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Munch’s Scream and an unopened 2016 packet of Walker’s crisps celebrating Leicester City winning the Premier League. Webster sees Crime Scene partly as an exorcism. “I spent half my life with Tim,” she says. “I’d never lived on my own. It was almost like a death. It was traumatic.”Dotted around the studio are smaller hand-written mind maps, first seen in Webster’s 2019 book I Was a Teenage Banshee, and which she says “helped me unravel who I was.” She was a Banshees-obsessed girl who hadn’t come from an arty background, although working for her electrician dad did come in handy later for wiring light sculptures. She likens her mind maps to wiring diagrams, too.‘Being escorted to the bathroom,’ she writes, ‘was often the only form of exercise I had’In 1980, aged 13, her “unconscious self-destructive side” came to the fore and she spent six months in a Leicester inpatient unit. Some aspects of life there shaped who she is. “I was like a small dog, a ball of muscle that needed to be walked twice a day,” she writes, “but being escorted to the bathroom was often the only form of exercise I had. Being poisoned by sedatives numbed any unwanted thoughts that may have otherwise occurred to me. As a result, later in life I have developed a vigorous training routine. I need to swim each morning or else box at my gym most nights of the week in order to exorcise the badness that seems to build up inside and that needs to be expelled at the end of each day.”Among the documents pinned to the wall in Crime Scene is a hospital letter from 2011 after she miscarried her baby with Noble. “I define that as being the turning point in our relationship,” she says. “It was coming to the end, but we were still living together and I found I was pregnant.” She was in her 40s. “And I said, well, I’m at an age where I’ve got no choice. I can have this baby on my own.” Then, inexplicably, her waters broke at 17 weeks but “the baby wasn’t formed enough to survive”, she says. “They said to me, go home. You’ve got to lie down and wait for the baby to come.I had to go into hospital and then take this terrible pill, almost like a suicide pill, which separates you from the baby and then they said you’ve got to sit and wait to give birth to the baby. It was one of the worst things ever.”After that, she says, Noble found someone else to start a family with. But now, staring defiantly out at us from the walls in the studio are paintings Webster has made of herself while pregnant with her five-year-old son Spider which inspired her new show’s title Birth of an Icon. In these larger-than-life works, her naked belly bursts gloriously out from a leather or a pinstripe jacket. She had Spider in 2020, when she was 52. She has said that she was proud to reverse the “age-old cliche” that only men can have children late in their careers, and says she didn’t experience any judgment over her having a baby in her 50s. “There was nothing but ‘this is what’s meant to happen’.” She had Spider on her own, via IVF, and it took four attempts. “So yes, there were more miscarriages, but now we have a healthy boy.”View image in fullscreenDefiant … Webster’s paintings of herself while pregnant with son Spider.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianWebster has spent the past few years doggedly refining her painting skills, and falling in love with oils (as opposed to the acrylics of her art school days). She watched YouTube tutorials and even sought advice from a man behind the counter at Atlantis, her local art materials shop. “I said: I’m trying to do a flesh tone and he said, ‘Oh, you need a titanium white, you need a rose red, you need a Naples yellow, you need a burnt sienna.’ He got this little bit of canvas, and mixed them into a flesh tone, and you can add a little bit of green.” And there it is, she shows me, along with the weasel-hair brushes a portrait-painter friend encouraged her to use.What does Spider make of the results? “He knows he’s in mummy’s belly,” says Webster. “He comes down and gives me a critique, ‘I like this one. I don’t like that one because it’s a bit messy, and that one’s not finished.’ And then he’ll say, ‘This is a 15 out of 20. This one’s a 17 out of five.’”Since the split, she has published her book, customised a series of leather jackets and exhibited her first, enormous, pregnancy self portrait for the 2023 Sarah Lucas-curated group show, Big Women. She’s happy to have reached this point, but there remains an entire show’s worth of unseen Tim and Sue work in storage. She believed the show they were about to open in Berlin in 2020 “was going to be the best fucking show in the world”. That was the moment, unfortunately, that she realised she couldn’t work with Noble any more, and then the world was swallowed up by the pandemic anyway.“It would be really weird to show it now, because I’m on a trajectory with my own work, so I can’t go back to it,” she says. “I’ve managed to separate myself from that work.” Her new output couldn’t be more different . “Tim and I have both gone off in completely opposite directions,” she says. “He’s gone off into his own mind. I’ve seen his work. I’m happy for him. I’ve gone off into my inner self as well. I’ve gone very introspective. I’m making the most personal work.” When she was part of an art duo, she says that anything personal she made on the side felt unimportant. “I’m happy for the opportunity to make the work that I’m making now,” she concludes. “It’s true to me. I didn’t feel comfortable with it before, but I do now. And I feel like the world’s ready to see it.”Sue Webster: Birth of an Icon is at Firstsite, Colchester, 31 January to 10 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtinterviewsShareReuse this content"

His future hung in the balance. How did he get from there to the top of UK politics?Tue 27 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 11.25 ESTShareIn 2019, whenSajid Javidwas home secretary, he spoke about growing up on “the most dangerous street in Britain” and said how easy it would have been to fall into a life of crime. Fortunately, he said, he managed to avoid trouble.But it turns out that Javid was being a little economical with the truth. He did get into trouble. Serious trouble.Now 56, he has just published his childhood memoir, The Colour of Home. It’s crammed with incident – arranged marriages, savage beatings and boys behaving badly. I think there’s one key moment in your story, I tell him. “What, just one?” he hoots. Javid is not lacking for confidence.Thirteen-year-old Sajid is sitting in a police station with his younger brother Bas, who went on to become one of Britain’s most senior police officers, after they’d been caught red-handed swindling an amusement park. It’s an astonishing Sliding Doors moment when you can see the future banker and politician becoming trapped in a life of scuzzy, low-level crime.View image in fullscreenEight-year-old Javid(left)in Rochdale with his cousin Rozina (8) and brother Tes (4).Photograph: Courtesy of Sajid JavidThey had discovered how to cheat fruit machines with a J-shaped piece of wire. Before long, Javid had opened a savings account with his ill-gotten gains. Eventually they were caught by the manager of an arcade in Weston-super-Mare. Javid describes the incident in the book: “‘Right, you little Paki bastards, I know you’ve been ripping me off,’ he crouched to get as close to our faces as possible. ‘You’ve been stealing from the machines. If you weren’t kids I’d kick the shit out of you, but I’ve called the police instead. They’re on their way and you’re going to jail, you little fuckers.’”The boys were arrested and held in a cell. They confessed, their winnings were confiscated, and the police gave them enough money for the bus back to Bristol. When they got home their father beat them.Two months later, the boys were ordered to attend a police station in Bristol with their father. Sajid could have easily been charged, Bas should definitely have been because he had already received a caution for theft. Their father, in tears, begged the officer for leniency. The officer eventually cautioned both boys, and said he was giving them a second chance.I never imagined Javid’s memoir would make me blub.What was the pleasure in stealing from the slot machines? Javid’s face lights up. “Oh, I loved it. Ilovedit. The pleasure was that you could make money from these machines.” He pauses. “Well, actually not make money,takemoney from these machines.” He says they justified their actions by telling themselves the owners were also acting unlawfully. “Bas and I thought that the people who operated these amusement parks shouldn’t be letting kids in anyway. You had to be 18. Bas was 11, I was 13. We were obviously nowhere near the legal age.”View image in fullscreenJavid with his mother at her home.Photograph: Courtesy of Sajid JavidJavid sips his black coffee. “You’re right to pick out that moment because it did change me a lot,” he concedes. What does he think would have happened if they’d not been caught? “I think we would have just continued till we got caught.” Would he like to see the police officer who didn’t charge them again? “I’d love to.” What would he say to him? I’d say thank you. You changed my life.”I meet Javid at his house in an affluent part of London. His wife, Laura, answers the door, and he is nowhere to be seen. She makes me coffee, asks where I’ve come from, chats about her keep-fit routine, tells me about the art on the walls. One of the pictures, a gorgeous still life of a jug and pear, was painted by their daughter Maya when she was nine or 10. Laura has a lovely easy warmth. As does their eldest daughter Sophia, who has just been for a jog, and Bailey their dog, a cavapoochon who nuzzles up to me in a chair.When Javid walks into the room, some minutes later, he is genial but more business-like. There’s little space for small talk. Bald and round-faced, he looked old for his years when first elected. Sixteen years on, unshaven and informal, he seems more youthful.“Read it all?” he asks of the book. Yes, word for word, I say. “Good, thank you. Did you like it? Did it surprise you?” It’s more an interrogation than a conversation. The Colour of Home provides great insight about his evolution into a can-do Conservative. Javid admired his bus driver turned shop-owner father and his mother, who got by despite not speaking English, but he wanted so much more for himself.One of five brothers, when the family moved house, 12-year-old Javid was so determined to stay at his old school that he got on his bike – Tebbit style – and cycled the 6.3 miles there. He was told that he was no longer on the school roll, so he pleaded with the deputy head to let him stay. When he was told he couldn’t do maths O-level (now maths GCSE), he pleaded again – this time with his father to pay for a tutor. And when he was told he could only do two A-levels at school, he left for further education college where he could do three and go on to university. “If I had to pick out a theme, from a very young age I would say I was positively stubborn.”View image in fullscreenJavid with his father at his wedding in 1997.Photograph: Courtesy of Sajid JavidHe also demonstrated a precocious if dodgy entrepreneurial initiative. And we’re not just talking about slot machines. When the government sold shares in nationalised industries, 16-year-old Sajid phoned up his father’s bank asking for an appointment while impersonating him. The manager was shocked when he arrived in his school shirt and tie, admitting what he had done, and asking for a £500 loan. The manager told him he couldn’t give him the money, but he offered to loan it to Javid’s father who could then pass it on to him. Javid ended up making more than £2,000 from the selloffs. Margaret Thatcher became his hero.In the book, racism is omnipresent. There’s his first fight at the start of secondary school because a boy in his class tells him, “You’re a Paki bastard. We don’t like Pakis”; the woman who nicks clothes from his father’s shop and runs off racially abusing the family; and the university “friend” who finds out that Javid has got a job at Chase Manhattan bank and he hasn’t, and asks him, “What the fuck is wrong with this country?” But the racism is multicoloured. There’s the man who tells his father he can’t let Javid’s brother Khalid go on a school trip to Israel because “he’ll be surrounded by Jews”. On another occasion, his father invites two Black friends for dinner and his mother worries what she’ll do with the plates after they have eaten off them.Most shocking of all is his family’s reaction to Laura when she became his first serious girlfriend. Javid’s father tells his son that he can’t marry Laura, a white Christian. When he asks why, his father says it’s because he is already engaged. His parents have not bothered telling him that they have arranged a marriage to his first cousin Amna, whom he loved as a sister. His parents finally agree to meet Laura’s parents, and he discovers that over a curry they told them that marrying their son would be the ruin of Laura. “Imagine that! My parents meeting with the parents of the woman I want to marry, and their message is ‘Don’t let your daughter marry our son, it will destroy her life.’” Javid’s horror is undiminished today.The accounts of his relationship with his father, who died in 2012, are fascinating. They love each other, but his beatings are brutal. The worst incident is when the oldest of the five boys, Tariq, steals money won by Javid on a slot machine, but tells their father that Javid stole the money from him. His father takes off his leather shoe and hits Javid on his arms, legs, stomach and face before attacking him with a vacuum cleaner. “There were moments of rage. It could be a shoe or a stick. As a kid, I thought I’m never going to do this to my kids because look how it makes me feel. I hate it. I justhateit.” He’s talking in the present tense, as if he can still feel the crack of that stick. “As a kid, I used to think, ‘How can you love somebody and hit them?’. But then a couple of days later, my dad would be as if nothing had happened and he’d show you so much love and affection. And you’d think, ‘How do you go from that to this?’”View image in fullscreenJavid and his wife, Laura, at the 2019 Conservative party conference in Manchester.Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesDoes he regard what his father did to him as abuse? “Yes. I forgave him, but, yes, I regard hitting a child as abuse. When I was in government I did a lot around child abuse and sexual exploitation, especially as home secretary. I introducedthe online harms white paper,as it was then. Some of the things I went through as a child made me think I could now do something to help children in terms of abuse.”Three of Javid’s brothers went on to successful careers. Tariq struggled, and in 2018 he took his own life. By then Javid was a high-profile politician, and it wassplashed all over the papers. Tariq’s suicide remains a source of huge pain for him. As health secretary, he hoped to draw up a 10-year mental health plan and a suicide prevention plan, but he never got time. Javid tells me that he is donating his profits from the book to the Samaritans.”After studying economics and politics at the University of Exeter, he went on to a fantastically lucrative career in banking. Is it true you earned £3m a year, I ask. “I’m not getting into what I earned …” He smiles. “I was paid well.” He left banking in 2009 to build a career in politics. A year later he was elected Conservative MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire. When campaigning, he said, “I entered politics to do my best for this country – the country that has done so much for me.” The first department he ran was culture, followed by business, housing, the Home Office, the Treasury and health. An impressive portfolio of posts. Yet he never seemed to stay long enough in one job to make a difference.View image in fullscreenJavid: ‘The basis of our democracy is at risk.’Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianHe enjoyed working for David Cameron, less so for Theresa May, and then there was Boris Johnson. Javid resigned twice from Johnson governments – as chancellor, when Dominic Cummingstold him to dismiss his special advisers(he told Johnson thathe was Cummings’ puppet), and as health secretary when it emerged that Johnson had been lying over Partygate. By then he’d had enough, and hefinally stood down as an MPin 2024.Was he disillusioned? “Yes, because there were so many things going wrong.” What was it like to work for a liar? “Well, look, Boris …” He pauses. “I don’t know if you’re referring to Boris, but the fact that I resigned on him twice speaks for itself. I thought, if I didn’t have confidence in the prime minister, I can’t work honestly with integrity for the government.”Did he feel tainted by association? “No, I didn’t feel tainted because, rightly or wrongly, I felt I had carved out enough of a personal image. After I resigned as health secretary, I had a pensioners’ fair in my constituency, and they were all high-fiving me, saying, ‘Well done, we’re so proud of you.’” Why? “For resigning!”Would he go back into politics? “No.” Why not? “I’m 56. I don’t think it’s for me any more. I still support my party, of course, but I’m just not involved in any activity any more.”I ask if he still has a relationship with Johnson? “We have a relationship,” he says gnomically. He insists it’s a good one when pressed. How did Johnson react when Javid said he was a puppet of Cummings? “Well, at the time, he said ‘Absolutely not.’” Was he angry? “No, he didn’t look it because he was more focused on trying to convince me to stay. What I will say is that he’s since told me that with Cummings I was absolutely right, and that he should have listened to me and others.”Javid has had a strange career in politics. Such a spectacular CV, and yet so little to show for it. Does he feel satisfied by what he achieved? “Given the opportunities I was given, it would be churlish to say I wasn’t satisfied. That said, did I achieve what I wanted to achieve? I wanted to be prime minister. And I tried.” He stood for the leadership in 2019 and finished fourth, with Johnson winning. “Obviously, I didn’t make it. But I’m pleased I tried. Had I not, I would always look back and think I should have given it a shot. Among the people who were putting their hands up for it, I thought I could have done the better job.”View image in fullscreenWith Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak in the House of Commons, London, September 2021.Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/AFP/Getty ImagesWhy? “Two things. So much of the challenge the country was facing was economic, and I just think I had a better handle on the economy, businesses and wealth creation. Second was the thing we’ve been talking about – the social challenges around class or race. Because of my lived experience, I could understand that in a way most politicians just can’t.”Javid now has several finance-based private sector jobs, but his most interesting work is in the charitable sector as chair of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and co-chair of the Independent Commission on Community and Cohesion. Are Labour or the Tories doing enough today to counter the politics of division preached by Reform? “No, they aren’t.” What should they be doing to improve social cohesion? “I would like all major political parties to be much more cognisant of the language they use and the issues they pick,and about how divisive they can be or they can be seen to be.” As home secretary, Javid disowned Theresa May’s term “hostile environment”,preferring “compliant environment”, though this was largely semantics – it didn’t lead to a more welcoming attitude to migrants. When reading the book, I can’t help thinking how much he would have hated the word compliant as a child, and how his parents would never have been allowed to migrate to Britain in the first place if today’s policies had been in place.View image in fullscreenEnd of the line … Javid during a press conference in London, July 2022.Photograph: Frank Augstein/APHe is aware that today’s rise in rightwing populism has disturbing echoes of his childhood, growing up in the heyday of the National Front. “I don’t want us to go backwards, but there is a danger we will,” he says. Last year, he argued that the mismanagement of immigration, cost of living pressures and social media-driven extremism were in danger of creating “a tinderbox of disconnection and division” in Britain. “Unless we find ways to defuse it, the basis of our democracy is at risk,” he said.Javid stands by this. But he believes his story is an example of how communities can heal divisions. He says his family is a microcosm of modern society – or how he’d like it to be. Forty years on, he and Laura are still together and have four children. In the end, his family not only accepted her but grew to love her. When Javid was an adult, his father told him he was ashamed of the beatings he had dished out and begged for forgiveness. As for his mother, she finally learned to speak English and now lives happily and independently.View image in fullscreenWith Yvette Cooper at a ceremony for Holocaust Memorial Day and the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau,  in London last year.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesFinally, there are Sajid and Bas, the two reprobates who were headed for a life of crime. Fast forward four decades from the day they were held in custody to 2019, and Javid finds himself as home secretary presenting Bas with his certificate at the College of Policing for graduating on the Strategic Command Course. “My mum was sitting there, and she said to us afterwards, ‘If only your dad was here now. Look what you two were doing before.’”He says that The Colour of Home is not a political book. And in a way he’s right. It’s an intimate childhood memoir. But at the same time it’s a parable of the Thatcherite dream. Distinctly unromantic because money is at the heart of so much of it and he (almost) rises to the top in the grubbiest of political times, and yet profoundly romantic because of how much he achieves against the odds. “It’s a story that hopefully will motivate others,” he says. “Particularly those born on the wrong side of the tracks.”The Colour of Home: Growing up in 1970s Britain, by Sajid Javid, is published by Abacus on February 5 at £25.

And this blockade has caused supply problems on the island,” said Sheinbaum. “Mexico has always shown solidarity and Mexico will continue to show solidarity.”The issue of oil shipments to Cuba is a fraught one for Sheinbaum, who is striving to show theTrump administrationthat Mexico is a partner on trade and security without alienating the left wing of her party, Morena.The Trump administration has recently repeated its threats of unilateral military strikes on drug trafficking cartels in Mexico, just as the two countries begin to renegotiate the trillion-dollar USMCA North American free trade agreement.“Whenever Sheinbaum gives mealy-mouthed answers, it’s not for lack of preparation,” said Alexander González Ormerod, a political analyst. “It’s because it’s probably an answer made by committee on the best way to avoid upsetting all the different constituencies within the Morena and the US-Mexico coalition.”“When the answer’s easy, she’s decisive,” he added. “When it’s not, she’s evasive.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoCubaVenezuelaClaudia SheinbaumOilDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite being a US citizen, she was deported on 11 January alongside her mother, Karen Guadalupe Gutiérrez Castellanos, toHonduras, a country Génesis had never known.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were acting on an administrative deportation order against Gutiérrez, 26, issued in 2019, before Génesis was born.“I kept telling them ‘the girl was born here’. They didn’t care, they picked up the child, just put a jumper on her and told me to get into the car with her,” Gutiérrez told the Guardian.The two were held for almost a week in a hotel 80 miles from their home, without access to a lawyer or a hearing before a judge, before being deported to the Central American country.Activists and analysts point to a string of procedural violations in the case and note similarities with other recent detentions of children, such as that of five-year-oldLiam Conejo Ramosin Minneapolis. They see it as a chilling indication of what may lie ahead as Donald Trump’s administration continues with mass deportations.Gutiérrez had been living in the US since 2018 after leaving Santa Cruz de Yojoa, a Honduran city of about 100,000 people, to “escape poverty and build a prosperous future”, she said. She received a deportation order a year later but remained in the country and in 2020 Génesis was born.Gutiérrez said she separated from the girl’s father after suffering repeated abuse and applied for aU visa, designed to assist non-citizen victims of qualifying crimes such as domestic violence and sexual assault. There is a severe backlog in processing such applications and, like tens of thousands of others, Karen’s case was still pending.Despite what she described as a “beautiful and stable life” in which Génesis was growing up surrounded by uncles and cousins, Gutiérrez, who worked as a cleaner, said she was living in constant fear amid an increase in ICE raids. “I would get into my car to go to work and I felt afraid that someone was behind me and would stop and arrest me,” she said.View image in fullscreenGutiérrez and her daughter have been staying with Gutiérrez’s mother in Honduras.Photograph: Claudia MendozaIn early January, Gutiérrez was hosting a friend who had also been a victim of domestic violence when the alleged perpetrator turned up, and the former couple had a heated argument.They went back inside and Gutiérrez said she was asleep in another room when officers from theAustinpolice department knocked on the door responding to the disturbance. According to a statement, police said they “discovered an active ICE warrant” and notified the agency.Mother and daughter were taken by ICE to the neighbouring city of San Antonio and held in a hotel, where Gutiérrez said she was not allowed to call her family until three days after being detained.Accordingto the Texas-based NGO Grassroots Leadership, which first reported the case, she was reportedly instructed not to share her location.An immigration attorney tried to intervene but ICE agentsreportedlysaid they could not locate the pair in the agency’s database, which some believe may have been a deliberate consequence of holding them in a hotel rather than a detention centre.Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said: “The inability to locate people in the system, and the fact that lawyers cannot reach them to provide proper representation, is unfortunately happening more and more, and it directly undermines immigrants’ rights.”ICE did not respond to a request for comment.Gutiérrez’s next call to her family came days later after she and Génesis had landed in Honduras. Since then, the two have been staying with Gutiérrez’s mother. Because Génesis is a US citizen, Gutiérrez said she had taken the “painful” decision to send the girl back to the US soon, accompanied by another relative.“She has her school there, her uncles, her cousins, her whole life, because she was born there and she doesn’t want to be here,” Gutiérrez said, adding that they had never been apart before. “The day I separate from my daughter will be the most painful of my life but I will do it for her future.”She vowed not to give up on returning to the US to reunite with her daughter. “I will seek help, lawyers, everything. I will fight until God tells me ‘that’s enough, Karen’.”Last May, also in Austin, a mother and her three children, two of whom were US citizens, were arrested by ICE agents anddeportedto Mexico.On inauguration day, Trump signed an executive order seeking to end the 150-year-old policy ofbirthright citizenship, but judges across the US issued injunctions blocking it, saying it violated the constitution, federal law and supreme court precedent. The court isexpectedto hear the case this year.The Migration Policy Instituteestimatesthat of the 6.3 million children under the age of 18 living with at least one unauthorised immigrant parent in the US, 5.3 million are US citizens.“Families are facing extremely difficult choices over whether or not to stay together,” Bush-Joseph said. She said that given Trump’sfocuson mass deportations, “I do unfortunately anticipate that there will be more of these very difficult situations where parents are being deported and their children are either left behind or removed from the lives they knew in the US”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)AustinTexasHondurasAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The first step was to get the underpants, then do nothing, but profit would accrue magically..“You still have this weird overhang of a view of China as economic opportunity. And if we can only unlock this and it’s a big economy and it’s still growing in all of these sorts of things, completely removed from the reality that there are very marginal gains to be made in a few areas,” says Small, the director of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.Others in Europe have seen their trade dependence on China raise big risks and in the last eight years figures show that China has had the upper hand in the relationship with the UK.China hada record trillion-dollar global trade surplus in 2025, despite Trump’s tariffs.In the UK’s case, the trade deficit with China has more than doubled from £17bn in 2018, the year of May’s visit, to £42bn in the year to the end of the second quarter of 2025.“It has been on a downward arc in terms of the opportunities or economic benefits to be extracted,” says Small.China has shown its willingness to use trade to advance its foreign policies, but its foreign investment policies are also seeing it de-risk in unexpected ways, something that could affect any decisions on trade in the UK.In December, the Chinese luxury electric car brand Zeekr delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after just one year, citing an “increasingly complex economic environment”.China wants its companies to list in Hong Kong, says Goodman, pointing to the likelihood of Shein, which had looked atlisting on the London Stock Exchange,now listing there.There are also questions about the asymmetric quality of Chinese investments in the UK and whether they do deliver jobs.View image in fullscreenChina’s luxury EV maker Zeekr delisted from the NYSE after only a year, citing an ‘increasingly complex economic environment’.Photograph: Nick Carey/ReutersSmall notes that Xi Jinping’s sense of power has only grown over the past year with his success in facing down Trump in the tariff war giving a sense of vindication that he can introduce export restrictions “without pushback” and that he can feel emboldened to use trade as a weapon “pretty openly”.In other words, doing business with China is now a double-edged sword.In an unpublished paper for the Centre for Statecraft and National Security at King’s College London as part of its ongoing work for the Cabinet Office, Goodman cites eight tactics deployed by China which weaponises their trading relationship.Among them are import bans and anti-competition investigations such as those against French brandy makers, Google and Nvidia.Last year, China nearly brought car production around the world to a halt, afterimposing export bans on Nexperia chips, used in Germany, Mexico, the UK and Japan, because of a row with the Dutch government.“Foreign businesses are seen as fair game and a useful pressure point to China” in terms of its relationship with foreign countries, says Goodman.Explore more on these topicsChinese economyChinaAsia PacificInternational tradeGlobal economySteel industryInvestinganalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s sad.”Panda loopThe pandas’ abrupt return was announced last month duringa diplomatic spatthat began when the Japanese prime minister, Sanae Takaichi,hinted that Tokyo could intervene militarilyin the event of an attack on Taiwan. Her comment provoked the ire of Beijing, which regards the island as its own territory.The animals, loaned out as part of China’s “panda diplomacy” programme, have symbolised friendship between Beijing and Tokyo since they normalised ties in 1972.Their repatriation comes a month before their loan period expires in February, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government, which operates Ueno zoo.View image in fullscreenPeople watching the giant panda Lei Lei eating on Sunday, the final day for public viewing before its departure for China.Photograph: Philip Fong/AFP/Getty ImagesGuo Jiakun, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said: “According to the relevant agreement between China and Japan, the giant pandas who were living in Japan, Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei, today began their return trip to China.“As always, we welcome the Japanese public to come see giant pandas in China.”Japan has reportedly been seeking the loan of a new pair of pandas.However, a weekend poll by the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper showed that 70% of those surveyed did not think the government should negotiate with China on the lease of new pandas, while 26% said they would like it to.On Sunday, Ueno zoo invited 4,400 winners of an online lottery to see the pandas for the last time.View image in fullscreenStaff members load the logistics crate carrying the giant panda Lei Lei on to a truck at the Ueno zoological gardens.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockView image in fullscreenVisitors lining up to see Lei Lei and Xiao Xiao on the final day of public viewing.Photograph: Louise Delmotte/APView image in fullscreenA staff member feeds Lei Lei before departure.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockWell-wishers wearing panda-themed clothes, hats and badges waited for hours on the streets lining the zoo two days later to say their final goodbyes.They called out to the animals as the windowless truck left the gates. “It’s so sad,” said Daisaku Hirota, a 37-year-old shop worker who said he tried to visit the pandas as often as he could on his days off. “I lost one part of my heart,” he said.Lei Lei and Xiao Xiao were delivered in 2021 by their mother, Shin Shin, who arrived in 2011 and was returned to China in 2024 because of declining health.View image in fullscreenThe giant panda twins, male Xiao Xiao, right, and female Lei Lei, 103 days after they were born at Ueno zoo in Tokyo in October 2021.Photograph: APSince late last year, China has discouraged its nationals from travelling to Japan, citing deteriorating public security and criminal acts against Chinese nationals in the country.Black and white and sent back over: end of panda diplomacy as Japan returns bears to ChinaRead moreBeijing is reportedly also choking off exports to Japan of rare-earth products crucial for making everything from electric cars to missiles.However, China routinely removes pandas from foreign countries and the latest move might not be politically motivated, said Masaki Ienaga, a professor at Tokyo Woman’s Christian University and an expert in east Asian international relations.View image in fullscreenA truck carrying Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei leaves the zoo.Photograph: Soichiro Koriyama/EPA“If you talk about [Chinese] politics, the timing of sending pandas is what counts,” and pandas could return to Japan if bilateral ties warm, Ienaga said.Other countries used animals as tools of diplomacy, including Thailand with its elephants and Australia with its koalas, he added. “But pandas are special,” Ienaga said. “They have strong customer-drawing power, and ... they can earn money.”Explore more on these topicsChinaJapanZoosAsia PacificAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The administration has yet to issue formal notices to enact the changes.South Korea scrambled on Tuesday to assure the US it remained committed to implementing the trade deal, after Trump and President Lee Jae Myung agreed in principle last July for Seoul to make $350bn of investments in the US.Pentagon to reduce its role in deterrence of North KoreaRead moreSouth Korea’s presidential Blue House said on Tuesday it had not been informed about the tariff hike plans in advance and that it would continue to take the required steps to finalise the deal.It said Lee’s chief policy aide convened an emergency meeting with officials and that the trade minister, Kim Jung-kwan – currently in Canada – would head to Washington for talks on the issue with the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick.South Korea’s trade envoy, Yeo Han-koo, said the government was still trying to figure out the background of Trump’s tariffs post and the measures Seoul could take. Yeo said he planned to visit the US soon and talk to his counterpart at the Office of the US Trade Representative in order to find a rational solution between the two governments.Trump’s apparent about-face comes months after Washington and Seoul struck thetrade and security deal last year, capping a period of tense negotiations. The agreement was finalised after Trumpmet Lee in Octoberand included the investment promises by South Korea in return for tariff cuts by the US.Since then, however, the deal has remained in something of a legal limbo in South Korea.Seoul’s presidential office insisted in November the deal did not require parliamentary approval, arguing it represented a memorandum of understanding rather than a binding legal document.But on Tuesday, the country’s ruling party said it would work with the opposition to speed up the passage of five pending bills that would allow the enactment of investment in the US.Officials in the national assembly said the five bills would likely be incorporated into a single proposed law, which would need approval from the finance and judiciary committees before it could go to a floor vote.Under the agreement, Washington would maintain tariffs of up to 15% on South Korean goods including vehicles, car parts and pharmaceuticals. Crucially, the deal’s terms brought US tariffs on South Korean carsdown from a 25% level imposed by Trumpearlier in 2025.Trump’s latest threat, if enacted, would reverse that.The auto industry accounts for 27% of South Korea’s exports to the US, which takes in nearly half of the country’s car exports. In the minutes after Trump’s announcement, shares in several South Korean carmakers fell as much as 5%, but clawed back their losses later in the day.Trump has used the threat of tariffs throughout his second termas an instrument of foreign policy. Economists have raised concerns about the approach and the policy also faces a test in an ongoing case in front of the US supreme court. Tuesday’s threat targeting South Korea is his latest against key trading partners in recent days.Over the weekend, Trump warned Canada that if it concluded a trade deal with China, he would imposea 100% tariff on all goods coming across the border. Earlier in January, Trump alsothreatened to slap tariffs on multiple European nationsuntil his purchase of Greenland is achieved. He has since backed off the threat.The chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, Josh Lipsky, said Trump’s action on South Korea reflected impatience with the pace of Seoul’s enactment of the framework trade agreement.“It’s just another reminder that the markets were wrong to believe we were going to get into tariff stability in 2026,” Lipsky said. “People say, ‘Oh, but he doesn’t follow through,’ and sometimes that’s true, but sometimes it isn’t. And the volatility alone – there is a price around that.”With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsSouth KoreaTrump tariffsAsia PacificDonald TrumpTariffsTrump administrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Even some of her supporters admitted the clock was ticking.Sussan Ley to announce Liberal-only frontbench as allies increasingly confident she won’t face spillRead moreAlmost a week on from the dramatic split, speculation is rife that Ley will be challenged – and defeated – by either Angus Taylor orAndrew Hastiein a leadership spill as early as next week.But there are two factors working in Ley’s favour, which could at least buy time, if not avert what many still view as the inevitable outcome.The first is that no Liberal MPs – aside from her harshest internal critics – disagree with the decision to accept the resignation of the three Nationals senators who crossed the floor on Labor’s hate speech laws, staring down Littleproud’s threat that it would effectively end the Coalition.Ley’s decision was endorsed by the Liberal leadership team, which includes Taylor and fellow top conservativesMichaelia Cash, James Paterson and Jonno Duniam.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailSome Liberals feel uneasy about the rushed process that led to supporting Labor’s hate speech laws. But the majority of the party room believed it was justified to outlaw neo-Nazi organisations and Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir.Most of Ley’s colleagues blame Littleproud for the ensuing crisis and none want to reward the behaviour by ceding to his not-so-subtle ultimatum that the Liberals replace their leader in order to reunite the Coalition.To Ley’s supporters, the events of the past week do not amount to a sackable offence.But the campaign to overthrow the party’s first female leader is not about a split over hate speech or even the management of the relationship with the Nationals.Ley and her allies know this.These were merely the pretext to launch a coup that was months in the planning, born out of hostilities that have lingered since Ley narrowly defeated Taylor in the post-election leadership ballot.At the end of last year, prior to the Bondi terror attack, conservative MPs were discussing plans to move on Ley if the Coalition’s dire polling wasn’t improving around the time of the federal budget in May – roughly 12 months into her tenure.But before any formal challenge would be launched, MPs agreed that Taylor and Hastie first needed to resolve which of them would run as the right faction’s candidate against the moderate-aligned Ley.That question is yet to be resolved: the second factor buying Ley time.The shadow leadership campaign run playing out in the media has exposed a split in the conservative faction – including on generational lines – that threatens to derail the coup.Hastie’s backers are adamant the former soldier has the faction’s support and want the older Taylor to step aside.Liberal sources said Taylor, the right’s most senior member, would not give up the chance to run and reportedly offered Hastie the deputy position as a compromise, which was refused.Ley’s supporters are confident the two factors combined – the Taylor/Hastie impasse and widespread reluctance to reward the Nationals’ belligerence – means the challenge won’t materialise.“Angus has the better claim (to be the right’s contender). Hastie has the numbers. And Sussan has the support of the party room,” one Liberal powerbroker said.“It is a genuine stalemate.”Dan Jervis-Bardy is Guardian Australia’s chief political correspondentExplore more on these topicsSussan LeyAndrew HastieAngus TaylorMichaelia CashLiberal partyCoalitionAustralian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Photographs posted online showed at least two carriages ablaze next to a snow-covered rail bed.Ukraine war briefing: Nato chief warns of ‘harshest winter’ in a decade as Russian attacks cut power in KharkivRead more“In any country, a drone strike on a civilian train would be considered in exactly the same way – purely as terrorism. There is not and cannot be any military purpose in this,” Zelenskyy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.He said the latest bombardment undermined peace efforts and urged allies to step up pressure on Moscow to end the war.“Every such Russian strike erodes the diplomacy that is still ongoing and undermines the efforts of partners who are helping to end this war,” he wrote on social media.Prosecutors said one drone struck the train and two more hit an area alongside it.In his post on Telegram, Zelenskyy said train was carrying more than 200 passengers, including 18 in the carriage that was hit.Prosecutors had said earlier that 155 passengers were on board the train. The deputy prime minister, Oleksiy Kuleba, had described the attack by three drones as a “direct act of Russian terror”.Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, chief of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine’s national railway, thanked rescue teams and fellow passengers who helped evacuate people, and pledged that trains would keep running.“Keeping things moving is becoming more difficult,” Pertsovskyi wrote on Facebook. “We are regrouping. There will be additional strict security measures in some places, but even on those most frightening days, we cannot give up.”A barrage of more than 50 Russian drones killed three people and wounded more than 30 in the southern city of Odesa, regional officials said.The Black Sea city, key for Ukrainian exports, has been routinely pummelled by Russian forces since they invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago. Regional governor Oleh Kiper said a woman, who was 39 weeks pregnant, and two girls were among the wounded.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Can’t we just say no to Trump for once? We can take care of their security ourselves. We don’t need ICE.”Alessandro Zan, a member of the European parliament for the centre-left Democratic party, said the presence of ICE agents would be unacceptable. “In Italy, we don’t want those who trample on human rights and act outside of any democratic control,” he wrote on X.Two small opposition parties – the Green and Left Alliance (AVS) and Azione – have started petitions calling on the Italian government and the Olympic organising committee to prevent the ICE agents’ entry and involvement in the security operations. “ICE is the militia that shoots people on the streets of Minneapolis and takes children away from their families,” AVS said.Speaking on the sidelines of a Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony in Rome, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, sought to play down concerns. “It’s not like the SS are coming,” he said, referring to the Nazi paramilitary organisation. “Let’s be clear. They’re not coming to maintain public order in the middle of the streets. They’re coming to collaborate in the operations rooms.”The confirmation of ICE’s role comes after RAI state TV aired a video of ICE agentsthreatening to break the windowof the vehicle its crew were using to report in Minneapolis.Italy’s interior ministry later issued a statement saying Matteo Piantedosi, the interior minister, had met Tilman J Fertitta, the US ambassador in Rome, during which the involvement of ICE’s investigative arm in the security detail at the Games was confirmed, “and therefore not the agency’s operational arm”.During the Games, the US will set up its own operations room at its consulate in Milan, “where representatives of US agencies potentially interested in the event will be present”, the statement said.“Homeland Security Investigation experts will also be employed in this room, but their role will be to support the management of major events abroad and to liaise with liaison officers,” the statement added, emphasising that ICE investigators “will not be operational personnel like those employed in immigration controls in the United States, but rather representatives exclusively specialised in investigations”.Agents from ICE’s investigative unit are present in more than 50 countries, the statement said, “including in Italy for years, but do not perform immigration control operations or services in foreign countries”.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Winter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

To qualify for regularisation, applicants will have to prove they do not have a criminal record and had lived in Spain for at least five months – or had sought international protection – before 31 December 2025.Announcing the decision after Tuesday’s weekly cabinet meeting, Elma Saiz, Spain’s minister for inclusion, social security and migration, said it was a “historic day”, adding the initiative was designed to “break the bureaucratic barriers of the past”.Saiz said the programme, which is being brought in by royal decree meaning it does not require parliamentary approval, would benefit Spain as a whole. “We’re reinforcing a migratory model based on human rights, on integration and on coexistence that’s compatible with both economic growth and social cohesion,” she said.The decree followed pressure from the socialists’ former allies in the leftwing Podemos party, which has a fraught relationship with the government.“We reached a deal with the [socialist party] for the extraordinary regularisation of undocumented people,” Podemos’s leader, Ione Belarra, wrote on social media on Tuesday morning. “No one else has to work without rights … Today and always, yes we can!”View image in fullscreenThe ageing population is one of the reasons that migrants have been welcomed in Spain.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianIn recent years, Spain has become a European outlier on migration.Addressing parliament in October 2024, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country was at a demographic crossroads and needed migration to grow its economy and sustain its welfare state.“Throughout history, migration has been one of the great drivers of the development of nations while hatred and xenophobia have been – and continue to be – the greatest destroyer of nations,” he said. “The key is in managing it well.”The announcement was welcomed by the Brussels-based Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (Picum).“Today’s decision by the Spanish government to adopt a broad regularisation measure is a powerful reminder that regularisation is not only possible – it works, and it’s the right thing to do,” said Laetitia Van der Vennet, a senior advocacy officer at Picum.“For thousands of undocumented people who have built their lives in Spain, this could mean dignity, stability and access to basic rights. At a time when a hostile environment against migrants is spreading on both sides of the Atlantic, this move shows both humanity and common sense. We hope more governments will follow this example and invest in policies that protect, empower and include people, and make societies stronger.”The decision also drew approval from Spain’s Regularisation Now! movement, which added it had come “in an international context marked by the tightening of immigration policies, border closures, and the criminalisation of migrants in much of Europe”.However, the move has been bitterly criticised by the conservative People’s party (PP) – even though the party ordered similar initiatives when in government – and by the far-right Vox party.The PP’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, accused the prime minister of using the announcement to deflect attention from the government’s response tolast week’s deadly rail crash, in which at least 45 people died. “Sánchez’s first response is a massive regularisation to distract attention, to increase the pull effect and to overwhelm our public services,” he said. “In socialist Spain, illegality is rewarded.”Vox, which is rising in the polls and outflanking the PP on the right with an explicitly anti-migrant discourse, went further by using familiar tropes aboutthe great replacement theoryand urging the mass deportation of migrants,euphemistically referred to by the far right as “remigration”.“Five hundred thousand illegals!” said its leader, Santiago Abascal. “Sánchez the tyrant hates the Spanish people. He wants to replace them – that’s why he’s using a decree to promote the pull effect and to accelerate the invasion. He must be stopped. Repatriations, deportations and remigration.”Regularisation programmeshave long been usedacross the EU, with 43 put in place by more than a dozen countries between 1996 and 2008. In Spain, nine such programmes have been carried out since the country’s return to democracy, with the PP conductingmore regularisation programmes than any other party.The roots of the current push lie in a citizens’ initiative,signed by more than 700,000 peopleand backed by about 900 social organisations, presented to parliament in 2024.Unemployment levels have fallen to theirlowest since the 2008 financial crisis,and Spain’s economy is outperforming those of its neighbours.Sánchez hailed the unemployment news in a post on X on Tuesday, saying: “For the first time since 2008, unemployment falls below 10%. Spain has almost 22.5 million people with jobs, a new record.”Even some of the most ardent critics of immigration have conceded its necessity: in June, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, the far-right leader whohas long calledirregular migrants a threat to Europe’s future, said her governmentwould issuenearly 500,000 new work visas for non-EU nationals in the coming years, in addition to the 450,000 granted since she took power.Explore more on these topicsSpainMigrationRefugeesEuropePedro SáncheznewsShareReuse this content"

But the exercise appeared designed to display the US ability to project force into the region as tensions withIranhave escalated.Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?Read moreCENTCOM announced on Monday that a large US naval deployment led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln had arrived in the region on Monday. The aircraft carrier, which has several dozen fighter jets and nearly 5,000 sailors, was accompanied by several guided missile destroyers that carry air defences to protect the carrier strike group.The US has also moved a squadron of F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jets to the region, according to the Washington Post, which come from the same unit that participated in strikes on Iran in April 2024. The UK has also moved Typhoon jets to the region in a “defensive capacity.”It was the first time that an aircraft carrier had been stationed in CENTCOM since the USS Gerald Ford was deployed to the Caribbean in October in the run up to the US operation to remove Venezuela’s strongman leader Nicolás Maduro.The carrier is “is currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability”, CENTCOM said in a statement on Monday.Trump in an interview with Axios this week said that the US has a “big armada next to Iran. Bigger than Venezuela”.But he also suggested that the US was open to talks, adding that Iran “wants to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions. They want to talk”.Trumpthreatened to attack Iran if the country carries out mass executions or killings of demonstratorsduring the protests that broke out over the devaluation of Iran’s currency in December. But he later appeared to pull back from that threat, at least temporarily, claiming that “the killing has stopped”.Trump stepped down his rhetoric on launching strikes against Iran earlier this month after he claimed that the country had reversed a decision on hanging 800 detained protesters. But as of last week, he had suggested that strikes could still take place, with the carrier strike group being sent to the region “just in case”.“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won’t have to use it,” he said.The US-based Human Rights Activists news agency has estimated that nearly 6,000 people have been killed, while the Iranian government has admitted to just over 3,100 deaths.Other activists have estimatedmore than 30,000 deathsin the government crackdown, but censorship and a nationwide Internet blackout have made details on the scale of the death toll difficult to confirm.CENTCOM has said that it would conduct the drills in partnership with nations in the Middle East and also announced plans to partner with Bahrain in a defensive drill that would include practising capabilities to down drones, a potential counterattack threat in the event of a US attack on Iran.But the deployments have also upset key US allies in the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates foreign ministry has said that it would not allow its airspace, territory or territorial waters to be used for an attack on Iran, saying that it would maintain neutrality and seek to promote regional stability.The US air force would “conduct all activities with host-nation approval and in close coordination with civil and military aviation authorities, emphasising safety, precision and respect for sovereignty”, the statement read.Explore more on these topicsUS newsIranDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They think we don’t deserve to know,” Lane said.But she said the UK and others could not easily ignore the issue after the US intervention. “I can’t see that western governments will allow their citizens to be put on trial inIraqwhere they have the death penalty and flawed trials.”She said if the authorities in Canada or the UK wanted to, they could charge Letts with terror offences on home ground as a condition for his return. “If there’s evidence, put them on trial. But there is no evidence,” Lane said.View image in fullscreenSally Lane and John Letts, the parents of jack Letts.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverOxford-raised Lettstravelled to Islamic State-controlled territory in Syria and Iraq aged 18, during the early phases of the terror group’s caliphate. He had converted to Islam aged 16 and dropped out of sixth form because of mental health problems.He was captured by Syrian Kurdish forces fighting against IS in May 2017 and has been held without trial ever since. British ministers removed his UK citizenship two years later, leaving him a Canadian national, the birth country of his father, John.Letts’ only contact with the world has been through a handful of television interviews. “I’m not going to say I’m innocent. I’m not innocent. I deserve what comes to me. But I just want it to be … not just haphazard, freestyle punishment in Syria,”he told ITVseven years ago.His last known location was in a prison near Raqqa in November 2024, when he was interviewed by Canadian television. Then he said he had not been a member of IS and he had rejected their Islamist ideology shortly after he arrived. “I was imprisoned by them three times,” he added.Lane has not known exactly where her son has been since then and has had no personal contact with him for more than a decade. But she believes he was or is being held in the Gweiran – or Panorama – prison in Hasakah, run by the Syrian Kurds.Last Wednesday, US Central Command (Centcom) unexpectedly announced it had started a planned airlift of prisoners previously held in Kurdish-run detention centres after the Kurds sustained a succession of battlefield defeats by the Syrian government. About 150 of the most dangerous inmates were flown out that day.Lane said she did not know if her son was one of those who had been rendered across the border but she believed he probably would not have been. “Jack’s small fry. He’s mostly been held in local prisons. He’s high profile only because he’s been in the news,” she said.View image in fullscreenLane has been unable to communicate directly with her son for a decade.Photograph: Family handout/PAOn Sunday Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, spoke to Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and thanked him for expediting the transfer of IS prisoners to “secure facilities” in Iraq.The two men also discussed “ongoing diplomatic efforts to ensure countries rapidly repatriate their citizens in Iraq, bringing them to justice”, according to a readout from the US state department after the call.Last week Centcom said the prisoner transfer would take “days not weeks”. Prisoners would be handed to the Iraqi authorities, Centcom added, but the US military would not confirm if Letts was being transferred from Syria.Yvette Cooper, the British foreign secretary, said in a BBC interview last Thursday that she had been “in touch” with Rubio about Syria. She said the UK and US had “shared interests in countering terrorism and extremism”, though she did not directly refer to the prisoner transfer.The UK has repatriated six women and 10 children since 2022. About 55 men, women and children with British links were believed to be in Kurdish detention before last week’s Syrian government offensive. One of those is Shamima Begum, still held at al-Roj camp, in one of the last Kurdish-controlled areas in Syria.This article was amended on 27 January 2026. An earlier version, owing to an edit, described Jack Letts as having “travelled to join Islamic State” aged 18; this has been changed to describe him as having “travelled to Islamic State-controlled territory”, because of the uncertainty about Letts’ intentions for the trip.Explore more on these topicsIslamic StateSyriaIraqForeign policyUK security and counter-terrorismCanadaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The area remained under a flood alert on Tuesday evening.Devon and Cornwall policeurged people not to travelin Exeter and east and mid-Devon unless they urgently needed to. Devon and Somerset fire service rescued people from 25 vehicles stranded in flood water, with a spokesperson confirming there were no casualties.View image in fullscreenWaves hit the Cornish village of Kingsand during Storm Chandra.Photograph: Mark Passmore PhotographyThe leader of Devon county council, Julian Brazil, told the Guardian the floods demonstrated how vulnerable the region was. “We feel a bit cut off down here. The south-west feels let down.”He said a good illustration was the rail network. Services between London and south-west England on Tuesday were cancelled, delayed or involved bus transfers because of flooding on the line between Taunton and Exeter.“We feel we’re being left behind,” Brazil said. “We’ve seen billions pumped in [to rail services] up north, and that’s about just shaving a few minutes off the times getting to London. What we’d like is to actually be able to get to London on the train at all.”His complaints echoed those of people in Cornwall this month, many of whom wereleft without power, waterand internetafter Storm Goretti.View image in fullscreenA flooded road in Helston, Cornwall.Photograph: Jory Mundy/Getty ImagesRichard Foord, the MP for Honiton and Sidmouth in Devon, said people were having a “horrendous” time and he predicted the number of properties flooded would increase.The Devon Wildlife Trust expressed concern for thebeaversthat live in and around the River Otter. A spokesperson said: “Despite being semi-aquatic mammals, rapidly rising and rapidly moving water is a threat to them, especially young, less experienced animals. Floods will overwhelm their burrows and lodges, the sheer force of the water can be too much for them to swim against and submerged debris represents a threat.”Residents of the Somerset Levels, a low-lying area very vulnerable to flooding, feared their homes could be at risk again. TheFloodingon the Levels Action Group (Flag) claimed the authorities had not funded maintenance of the waterways sufficiently. It also expressed concern that earlier this month, as heavy rain fell, a pumping station that removes water from the area was not operating because of planned electrical works.Flag’s spokesperson Bryony Sadler said there was concern homes could be flooded. “We’re tentatively starting to move stuff. I’ve rung neighbours this morning to tell them to move animals out,” she said.Extreme rainfall is becoming more common and more intense in many parts of the world because of human-caused climate breakdown. This is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding is also affected by human factors such as the existence of flood defences and land use.The Met Office said 105mm (4.13in) of rain fell on parts of Dartmoor in Devon in 12 hours. The strongest winds recorded were 75mph gusts at St Bees Head in Cumbria and 63mph at Machrihanish on the west coast of Scotland.By late evening on Tuesday there were 96 flood warnings in England, meaning flooding was expected, and more than 250 alerts, meaning flooding was possible, with heavy rain falling on already saturated ground. There were three flood warnings and 17 alerts inWales, with eight warnings and eight alerts in place across Scotland.View image in fullscreenWorkers assess the situation near an abandoned car in flood water near Fenny Bridge in Ottery St Mary.Photograph: Brook Mitchell/Getty ImagesThere was significant travel disruption because of rain, wind or snow in northern England and south Wales.Domestic flights were cancelled on routes serving Birmingham, East Midlands, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heathrow, Leeds Bradford, London City, Manchester and Southampton airports on Tuesday.Yellow weather warnings have been issued for ice on Wednesday morning covering much of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and southern and central Scotland.A yellow weather warning for rain is also in place for South West England on Thursday, with the Met Office saying that further rain could bring more flooding and transport disruption.In Devon, one man, Billy Vernon, described how he and his sons, 14 and 17, were trapped by flood water upstairs in a house close to the River Axe and he had to wade through waist-deep water to fetch supplies.He said water began coming into the house at 4am on Tuesday. “It was frightening. My son came running in panicking saying that the house was filling up with water. All of the furniture is destroyed and the walls are going to have to be redone.”The rail operator GWR said that after Storm Ingrid at the weekend a large sinkhole had appeared in Devon and would need to be filled, leading to a closure of the line between Exeter St Davids and Newton Abbott overnight on Wednesday and into Thursday.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherDevonCornwallHampshireDorsetFloodingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Surgery for cruciate ligament disease – a common procedure for dogs – can cost up to £5,000, and occasionally more.The CMA has been investigating the sector since 2024 andpublished its provisional findingsand remedies in October, with its final report due in February or March this year. The Defra announcement suggests ministers are keen to move swiftly, with many of the government proposals the same or similar to those put forward by the markets watchdog.Under the Defra plans, vet businesses will have to disclose who owns them so pet owners know if their local practice is part of a larger chain or is independent. It said this would increase competition and bring down costs over time.Meanwhile, every vet practice will need an official operating licence – similar to GP surgeries and care homes – and there are plans for an easier and more effective route for customers to raise concerns and complaints.Other proposals include introducing regulatory oversight for veterinary businesses, not just individual vets, and updating the processes for vet registration and “fitness to practise”.Specific measures proposed by the CMA in October included capping the cost of providing prescriptions at £16, prices in writing for treatments costing more than £500, and pricing breakdowns for pet care plans in an attempt to improve value for money. It also proposed creating a comprehensive price comparison website.Martin Coleman, the chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: “We welcome the government’s consultation … Our vets investigation is ongoing, but we have already set out our strong concern that the current rules are not fit for purpose.”Defra said clearer pricing “will help pet owners compare costs and shop around, saving families money”. Some of the measures will involve updating the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 “when parliamentary time allows”.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsPetsCompetition and Markets AuthoritynewsShareReuse this content"

He will meet China’s president, Xi Jinping, and the premier, Li Qiang, in Beijing on Thursday for talks.Starmer has faced criticism at home for pursuing a thaw in relations with China while the country remains a national security threat to the UK, with a decision to greenlight a newmega-embassyin London last week angering opposition politicians.China has also been accused of trying torecruit informants in parliament,harass Hong Kong pro-democracy activistsin the UK, suppress criticismby an academic at a British university, andengage in cyber-attacks.Downing Street said Starmer would maintain “guardrails” on national security, while discussing economic ties with China’s leaders. But they said he would not trade one for the other, and would raise areas of disagreement, including human rights abuses.The prime minister has argued the UK cannot afford to ignore the economic opportunities presented by China – the world’s second largest economy and the UK’s third largest trading partner, supporting 370,000 British jobs.As he becomes the first UK leader in eight years to visit Beijing, he promised to take a more pragmatic stance. “For years, our approach to China has been dogged by inconsistency, blowing hot and cold, from golden age to ice age. But like it or not, China matters for the UK,” he said.“As one of the world’s biggest economic players, a strategic and consistent relationship with them is firmly in our national interest. That does not mean turning a blind eye to the challenges they pose – but engaging even where we disagree.”The Conservatives have said that Starmer should not be travelling to China. The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, said: “The evidence is overwhelming that China poses a serious threat to our national security and it is clear Keir Starmer is going to China without any leverage. He lacks the backbone to stand up for Britain and is bending over backwards to appease Beijing.“Starmer has already surrendered to the CCP [Chinese Communist party] over their plan for a spy-hub super-embassy in the heart of our capital, and agreed to hand over British sovereign territory and £35bn of taxpayers’ money to an ally of China with his Chagos deal.“Britain cannot afford for him to make any more concessions, or for him to stay silent on China’s repression of dissidents like Jimmy Lai or the CCP’s attempts to undermine our democracy.”But a No 10 source said: “Sticking our heads in the sand and refusing to engage would be a staggering dereliction of duty. It would make the British people less safe, cut us off from opportunities, and weaken our ability to manage global challenges in areas like health and climate.”They pointed out that Trump met Xi in October and planned to visit China in April. Since early 2018, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has visited China three times while German leaders have visited four times but during the same period no British prime minister has visited China.Starmer will be accompanied on the three-day visit to Beijing and Shanghai by a delegation of about 60 British businesses and cultural organisations, including HSBC, GSK, Jaguar Land Rover and the National Theatre.The business secretary, Peter Kyle, who will also be on the trip, said: “For a decade, there has been a lack of serious engagement needed to capitalise on the opportunity of a better relationship with China.“We want to see trade flourish between us. From financial services to advanced manufacturing and the global energy transition, the UK’s strengths increasingly align with the rapidly evolving Chinese economy.“The first duty of government is security, and we protect ourselves best through active engagement and pragmatic cooperation, not by shutting the door.”After his trip to China, Starmer will travel to Tokyo to meet the Japanese prime minister, Sanae Takaichi.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerChinaTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

And I get why, in the face of all this tumult and noise, you might feel uncertain or skeptical about me and about what I’m aiming to do here,” Weiss said on Tuesday morning, according to an audio recording of her comments obtained by the Guardian.“So I’m not going to stand up here today in front of all of you and ask for your trust: I’m going to earn it, just like we have to do with our viewers. What I can give you is what I’ve always tried to give my readers and listeners as a journalist: and that is transparency, clarity and straight talk.”Weiss, who shared her broader strategy for the network for the first time since joining the network in October after her company The Free Press was acquired by Paramount Skydance for a reported $150m, said that her goal is to “makeCBSNews fit for purpose in the 21st century”.As part of the new strategy that Weiss laid out, CBS News announced the addition of 18 new on-air contributors, including prominent names from the world of politics, academia and culture – though some have faced controversy. The list includes medical expert Mark Hyman, historian Niall Ferguson, neuroscientist Andrew Huberman and former national security adviser H R McMaster.Ending her opening remarks, Weiss acknowledged that her plans might not be for everyone.“We are the best-capitalized media startup in the world,” she said. “We have the talent, we have the energy, and we have the mandate to transform CBS News. And if everyone here does their jobs right, and together, in a year’s time CBS News is going to look different. But startups aren’t for everybody. … If that’s not your bag, that’s OK. It’s a free country, and I completely respect if you decide I’m not the right leader for you, or this isn’t the right place at the right time.”She said the network’s transformation will be “one hell of a fight. But I don’t just think that we can win it, I know that we can. I took this job because I believe that in my bones, and because frankly, I don’t want to live in an America where there is no trust in our great institutions any more. And CBS News is one of those institutions.”She then provided some tough talk for her skeptical staff: “The honest truth is: right now we are not producing a product that enough people want.”Weiss said that “not enough people trust us”, referring to declines in trust in the mainstream media, and that CBS News was not sufficiently reaching viewers via new formats.“Our strategy until now has been: cling to the audience that remains on broadcast television,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that if we stick to that strategy, we’re toast. Starting now, we have to focus on what we’re building, not on what we’re maintaining.”Talking about the network’s editorial positioning, Weiss said that CBS News was “for the center, we’re for the center-right, and we’re for the center-left. And that is the vast majority of the company – that’s who we need to reach.”She also said the network plans to invest more resources in “producing revelatory journalism every day, which I think is the only kind that’s going to matter in the 21st century”.Asked by a staffer during the question-and-answer portion of the town hall about her decision to hold a 60 Minutes segment slated to air in December about Venezuelans sent to a notorious Salvadorian prison, Weiss seemed to evince some regret. “It’s always going to be my prerogative as editor of this newsroom to say that I want more information and to push to get new information,” she said. “Now, am I ever going to hold something again after it has been put out there with promos? I don’t want to make that exact same decision again. No, I do not.”The showultimately aired the segment on 18 January, but it still lacked an on-camera interview with a member of the Trump administration, which Weiss had pushed for.“As to why did I hold it … That specific logistical nightmare – that’s never going to happen again,” she said, telling staff she didn’t know the screening schedule for 60 Minutes segments because she is new to the company. “So please rest assured that nothing of that kind is ever going to happen again.”In response to another question, Weiss denied that Paramount Skydance’s chief executive, David Ellison, “pressured” her to hold the story. She said her only conversations with Ellison have been about “fairness”.One CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to comment, described Tuesday’s town hall as “so produced” and “so forced” – though Weiss took a number of employee questions and was greeted with a large round of applause as the event concluded.One of the questions posed to Weiss – which were submitted anonymously by employees – conveyedsome of the concerns that CBS News staffers have hadover the first three and a half months of her tenure.“Certain decisions and editorial choices have scared us,” a staffer wrote in the question, which was read aloud by an anchor at CBS News. “At Evening News, people are afraid for their jobs and afraid to even speak for fear of retaliation. There has been a chilling effect within our newsroom. It feels right now like if we offer feedback, alternatives, or constructive criticism, that we are asking for targets on our backs – or the answer is simply no.”The morning show host Gayle King offered something of a rallying cry for CBS employees near the end of the event, acknowledging and dismissing rumors about her potential departure.“We’ve had a lot of incoming,” King said. “People come and pet me like a puppy and say, ‘I’m so sorry that you’re leaving CBS. I won’t watch you guys again. And it’s not the same place.’ And when I come here, what I see every day are people who really love what they do.”King praised Weiss for laying out a vision for the network. “For many people, they’ve never even heard your freaking voice,” she said. “So it’s good for them to see you’re a real person and this is what you want and how you feel about us and how you feel about this job.”Explore more on these topicsCBSTrump administrationUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

UPS said it completed the retirement of the fleet in the fourth quarter.The company projected 2026 revenue to be $89.7bn, compared with the $88.7bn it reported last year.

One unnamed “Exec VP” from Elon Musk’s Tesla is also on the list.The killing of the 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by ICE agents over the weekend hasgenerated a widespread backlashfrom groups as varied as Redditusers, aunion of registered nurses, faith leaders and theright-leaning National Rifle Association.However, tech CEOs are seen as being uniquely placed to influence the course of the Trump administration’s policy. In October, Trump appeared tocall off a planned ICE surge in San Franciscoafter calls from tech leaders, in particular Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and the chief executive of Salesforce, Marc Benioff. “Friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” theUS president wrote on social media at the time.Whether they will act now is another question. Some tech leaders have come out against ICE, including Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, who wrote in a post on X on Tuesday about the importance of “preserving democratic values and rights at home”.James Dyett, OpenAI’s head of global business,wroteon X: “There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets. Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.”Neither OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Nvidia’s Huang nor Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, appear to have posted or written on Pretti’s killing. Tim Cook was one among a group of tech CEOs invited to the White House on Saturday for a private screening of the documentaryMelania,along with Zoom’s CEO, Eric Yuan.Tech workers have been largely silent about politics in the first year of the Trump administration.That tide is turning, say the petitioners. “It’ll be pretty hard to do good research in a ‘masked men execute civilians on the street’ political environment,”wroteone Google DeepMind researcher. “That possibility grows & you should plan for it.”Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Donald TrumpGoogleUS politicsMetaAmazonOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in TexasBlake MontgomeryTue 27 Jan 2026 07.57 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 14.05 ESTShareHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowedTeslato thrive.AI at DavosWhen they weren’t discussingDonald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.Up and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”At the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI willblanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.MeanwhileGooglewas showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.Away from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.In an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.Nadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.Just drama and dreams: AI companies without products still score billionsView image in fullscreenMira Murati, ex-chief technology officer of OpenAI Inc, during an interview on The Circuit with Emily Chang in San Francisco, California, on 4 April 2023.Photograph: Philip Pacheco/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as theWall Street Journalput it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.As dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.Thinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.The massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled inthe New York Timeslast week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, anugly website– and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.Humans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.Whatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.Teslas in Texas: the hands-off legislation of hands-free drivingView image in fullscreenA Tesla robotaxi drives on the street along South Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas, on 22 June 2025.Photograph: Joel Angel Juarez/ReutersMusk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.What Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state.“Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.Also surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.“Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”Meanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process ofconsidering new rulesthat could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the companydid not have authorizationto operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterDavos 2026AI (artificial intelligence)TeslaComputingElon MusknewslettersShareReuse this content"

Fans would miss out on seeing the sport’s pinnacle in their home towns (or somewhere nearby). Cities and businesses small and large would lose the financial benefits they had banked on. It would be a logistical and political nightmare on an international scale, the likes of which have never been seen before in sports. It would be eminently sad. And it would be entirely justified.It brings me no pleasure to say this. The United States has been eager to host a men’s World Cup for more than a decade and a half. The desire survived and even grew after 2010’s failure to out-bid Russia and Qatar (in public and behind closed doors) for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. With hosting rights for 2026 later secured alongside Canada and Mexico, the US soccer scene prepared to show off that the sport is now part of the nation’s fabric, 32 years after hosting the tournament for the first time in 1994. Soccer’s growing popularity in America has helped inspireother US sportsto try new formats, encouraged us to engage more fully with the world in a sporting context, and has been at the center of conversations about our society and culture. The 2026 World Cup was seen as the best chance for the world to fully experience not just how much the US has improved at soccer, but how much soccer has improved the US.Sepp Blatter suggests fans should not travel to US for World CupRead moreI have not been immune to this Pollyannaish outlook. Much of my career covering American soccer has been predicated on the idea that the sport will continue to growin the US. The 2026 World Cup is central to that hope. I can admit that I have a vested interest in this tournament’s success. As a lifelong fan, the World Cup landing here was a dream come true. As a professional, I hoped it would create millions of new North American soccer fans who will want to read and watch and listen to journalism about the sport for the rest of their lives.Perhaps I was naive. The tournament may create some of those fans, but at what cost?Exorbitant ticket priceshavecut outthe game’sgrassroots.Onerous demandson cities have siphoned public money. Fifa hasboostedanopenly corrupt administrationat every turn. Nowwanton federal violencehas made it difficult to justify having the World Cup here at all. Safety, justice, freedom, the continued functioning of society – these are all under threat. Even to many soccer fans in the US, the game once called “the most important of the least important things” now seems just plain unimportant.Federal agentshave killed two innocent peoplein Minneapolis in the last three weeks. Neither was threatening the paramilitary forces who shot them. We know these things because we have seen them play out on video after sickening video, from multiple angles, slowed down and refocused and analysed. Yet the most senior governmental figures want us to believe that Renee Good and Alex Pretti were “domestic terrorists”. That they were, in fact the aggressors – in cold contrast to the mountain of available evidence. It would be reasonable to assume that those who disregard the truth so blatantly can also not be trusted to host a safe and secure World Cup.And then there is the wider picture.Thirty-two people diedin US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2025 alone.The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to tracking US gun violence, reports that immigration officers shot at people 19 times since the start of the crackdown – figures it assumes are an undercount. These include three killings in 2025, now up to at least five with the Minnesota deaths. Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has resulted inmore detentions of people with no criminal recordthan any other category – despite its stated aim of ridding the country of criminals and claimed successes in doing so. The raids resulting in all of this have largely targeted Democratic-leaning metro areas – which 10 of the 11 US World Cup host cities are (the Dallas metroplex being the one outlier). Yet “the most important message that football can convey right now is one of peace and unity,” Fifa president Gianni Infantino said last year.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino holds the World Cup trophy as he attends the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersHow can soccer do that when its showpiece event is in a country led by an administration intent on division? A country that has captured a foreign leader,possibly in violation of international law. A country thathas threatened supposed allieswith military action over control of a foreign territory. A country that has picked seemingly endless fights, including with its World Cup cohosts – the very countries it’s meant to be standing alongside and welcoming the world’s soccer fans.Are these the actions of a safe country, prepared to handle an influx of foreign visitors? Is this the kind of place you’d expect someone would want to spend many thousands of dollars to visit, even before they’ve ponied up for the games themselves? I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but Isympathise with Sepp Blatteron this one.There have beendiscussions of a boycottin some form; a mild clamor, if that. If that actually happens among enough countries, Fifa’s hand could be forced. But as justified as that would be, that’s hard to even imagine. Holding World Cups in autocratic or destructive countries is nothing new. A boycott would mean revenue lost and a schedule that will be near-impossible to reconfigure. And there’s a feeling at soccer’s highest levels that, no matter which government Fifa cosies up to, the sport itself will escape unscathed.“With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them,” Concacaf president Victor Montagliani said last year at a conference. “Football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.”But in the meantime, football’s main event is at least partly under this administration’s control. Trump himselfsaid last yearthat if cities are deemed to be too dangerous, or otherwise unfit for hosting, “We’re going to move the event to some place where it’s going to be appreciated and safe.”Trump, of course, meant moving World Cup matches to other US cities. But it would be hard to argue if the World Cup was moved out of the US entirely.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fortunately, he is OK and did not sustain any serious injuries,” read a team statement. “In general, as a team we would like to urge fans on bikes to always put safety first. For both your own and others’ wellbeing, please allow riders to train and give them as much space and peace as possible.”Jay Vine recovers from kangaroo crash to win Tour Down Under for second timeRead moreVingegaard’s crash came to light after amateur cyclist Pedro García Fernández posted on his Strava account that he had followed the Dane, and also posted pictures of his own descent behind the 29-year-old. Fernández wrote that Vingegaard had “crashed while trying to drop me on the descent of Fuente la Reina” and, after stopping to check on the two-time Tour de France champion, said that Vingegaard “got angry with me for following him down the hill”.Fernández said in his post: “You can be a professional, but you can also be humble. He was going fast to drop me and ended up on the ground. I don’t make a living from this, and I’m just an amateur like most people, so I don’t understand his anger as a professional about it.”Another amateur cyclist claimed to be a witness to the aftermath of the crash. A Strava user named S.Enduro, commenting on Fernández’s post, claimed that he had found Vingegaard with a bleeding face on the side of the road.“You both passed me coming down, and as I was almost at the last bend, I found Jonas by the guardrail, his face bleeding in two places,” read the comment. “He must have hit it hard to drag his face along the ground. I stopped too and asked him if he needed help, and he told me no, to go away, very angry. Now I understand.“It’s clear he’s the professional and responsible for how he goes up or down, but I also think that people like him, who are professionals and have so much at stake, should be given their space and respected. They risk their lives, their salaries, and the livelihoods of many people around them. It seems to me he felt a bit pressured and went down faster than he should have on a road he doesn’t know well.”Incidents involving professional riders and amateur cyclists are common, especially in an age where amateurs attempt to film video content on the road. Last week, Vingegaard was seen on the roadwarning amateur cyclist Artem Shcherbyna about a blind corneron a two-way road as Shcherbyna tried to take a video of the Visma-Lease a Bike rider in training. Mathieu van der Poel, another huge name in cycling,narrowly avoided a nasty crashin December after agreeing to a sprint race with amateur Anatole Leboucher.Despite his crash, Vingegaard seems likely to recover for his season opener at the UAE Tour in mid-February. Vingegaard has already confirmed that he will race at this year’s Giro d’Italia in May for the first time in his career, as the Dane – winner of the Tour de France in2022and2023andVuelta a España champion last year– aims to become the first cyclist to win a career Grand Tour hat-trick since Chris Froome completed the feat in 2018.Explore more on these topicsCyclingJonas VingegaardnewsShareReuse this content"

London was selected as the optimal choice based on a range of strategic considerations.The first Women’s Champions Cup: what is it and should we pay attention?Read more“In line with Fifa’s commitment to growing the women’s game globally, key factors such as visibility, player experience, climate, accessibility for global fans and teams, media infrastructure, and commercial potential were thoroughly evaluated. London offers a world-class football infrastructure, a strong and diverse fanbase, and the ability to amplify the competition’s profile on a global scale. These criteria mirror the standard approach used for global event planning and align with Fifa’s strategic objectives to enhance the commercial value and audience reach of women’s football.”Arsenal are not alone in having a home advantage in a global club competition, with Inter Miami, Seattle Sounders and LA FC all competing in the men’s Club World Cup in the US. However, only Seattle played all three of their games at their home stadium with five of the 10 games played by US teams coming away from home.The public announcement that Brentford and Arsenal would host the semi-finals, third-place playoff and final of the inaugural Champions Cup didn’t arrive until 12 December. The timing of the competition means Uefa Champions League winners Arsenal and CAF Champions League winners AS Far will both be in mid-season form.NWSL Championship winners and Concacaf Champions Cup winners Gotham FC played their final game of the 2025 season on 22 November, and the 2026NWSLseason does not begin until 14 March. Copa Libertadores Femenina winners Corinthians played the second leg of the final of the Campeonato Brasileiro Feminino A1 on 14 September – although their season kicks off sooner after the Champions Cup with their Supercopa do Brasil against Palmeiras on 7 February.As a result of this mismatch, there has been disruption to transfer window activity and huge logistical issues around player availability for the Fifa-run tournament. For Gotham, and any future NWSL sides to compete in the tournament, calling players into pre-season early breaches the NWSL Players’ Association Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the league, with players entitled to a minimum of 28 days off during the offseason. However, sticking to that number would jeopardise player welfare by not giving those competing adequate time to get their bodies match ready. The decision to host a three-week training camp in Spain to properly prepare players has meant the club have had to, in negotiation with the NWSLPA, find a way to reallocate those protected days off elsewhere. Which, in turn, means a second pre-season period has also been cut short, affecting their buildup to the 2026 NWSL season.Michele Kang’s largesse for women’s football leaves Fifa open to bias claims | Tom GarryRead moreIn addition, Fifa only financially supports training for the three days before the first game, putting the onus on clubs to bear the financial burden of ensuring players are physically ready to compete. Four- to six-week preseasons are widely accepted to be necessary to properly bring players up to speed after a break of two weeks or more.For Corinthians, there was an added wait for players, with visa issues meaning Dayana Rodríguez, Gisela Robledo and Paola García could not travel until Sunday.Fifa also has not provided ice baths for the training bases of Gotham, Corinthians and AS Far. This is in line with any Fifa tournament, with the global governing body committed to paying for business class flights, accommodation, food and beverages and on-the-ground support. However, Arsenal benefit from access to these types of recovery resources as they are readily available at their training ground as normal and at no extra cost.With men’s teams operating on much larger budgets, facility discrepancies like this, at a tournament such as the men’s Club World Cup, are less of an issue and easily resolved by clubs themselves. But the growing cost of taking part in the Champions Cup for travelling women’s teams has begun to offset any financial benefits. While the Guardian understands that Fifa believes no team will be financially out of pocket due to their participation in the tournament, it is also understood that the costs Gotham have incurred, including those associated with the three-week training camp in Europe, means that only winning the competition would leave them in the black.Should Arsenal and Gotham reach Sunday’s final, attention will turn to the ever-present debate of which league, the NWSL or WSL, is the best in the world. Fans and players want that type of showdown to be on as level a playing field possible. We won’t necessarily have that on Sunday, but we can also expect evolution, a Fifa spokesperson telling the Guardian that it understands that, as with all its events, “this tournament will evolve and strengthen over time, just as we’ve demonstrated with the growth journey of the Fifa Women’s World Cup”.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballArsenal WomenNWSLWomen's Champions LeagueWomen's Super LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

He previously served as quarterbacks coach before taking over the offense after Ken Dorsey was fired midway through the 2023 season.Brady’s promotion came a little more than a week after Sean McDermottwas fired following a nine-year tenure.Brady, who has no previous head coaching experience, broke into the league with the New Orleans Saints, spending two seasons as an offensive assistant under Sean Payton. He left the Saints to serve as passing game coordinator on LSU’s 2019 national championship team. Considered an up-and-coming head coaching candidate, Brady returned to the NFL by taking over as the Carolina Panthers offensive coordinator before being fired late in the 2021 season.Sam Darnold: after five teams and plenty of mockery, ‘Ginger Cuz’ reaches the Super BowlRead moreAside from Buffalo, Brady interviewed for five otherNFLopenings, including still-existing vacancies in Arizona and Las Vegas. Buffalo met with nine candidates in an interview process led by general manager Brandon Beane, and which included franchise quarterback Josh Allen. Buffalo was the 10th and final NFL team to have a coaching vacancy this offseason, and missed out on interviewing John Harbaugh, who was hired by the New York Giants.Among the candidates were former Giants coach Brian Daboll, who was Buffalo’s offensive coordinator before landing the job in New York. The Bills also interviewed Jacksonville offensive coordinator Grant Udinski and 44-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers, who removed his name from consideration three days after meeting with Buffalo.Under Brady, the Bills offense took a far more balanced approach in part to take the burden off Allen. Brady also introduced what became known as an “Everybody Eats,” share-the-wealth approach to the passing game, which followed Buffalo trading leading receiver Stefon Diggs to Houston in April 2024.The approach worked the following season, with Allen earning AP NFL MVP honors for his 28 touchdowns passing (plus 12 rushing) and a career-low six interceptions and a receiving group led by Khalil Shakir’s 76 catches for 821 yards.This season, the Bills offense ranked fourth in the NFL in total yards and tied for fourth in scoring. Though Buffalo were knocked for a middling group of receivers, running back James Cook finished with 1,621 yards rushing to become the first Bills player to lead the NFL in rushing since OJ Simpson in 1976.It’s now on Brady to get the Bills over the hump in the postseason. In nine seasons, McDermott transformed a longtime loser – ending Buffalo’s 17-year playoff drought in his first season – into a franchise that became the NFL’s only team to qualify for the postseason in each of the past seven years.Buffalo had 10 or more wins in each of those seven years and enjoyed a five-year stretch as AFC East champions before going 12-5 and finishing second to Super Bowl-bound New England this season.On the downside,the Bills becamethe NFL’s first team to win a playoff round in six straight years but not make the Super Bowl. The closest Buffalo came were AFC championship game appearances in the 2020 and 2024 seasons, both ending in losses at Kansas City.The coaching change comes with Allen entering his ninth NFL season and set to turn 30 in May. The franchise is beginning a new era with the Bills moving across the street into a newly constructed $2.1bn stadium.Explore more on these topicsBuffalo BillsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Gauff had trouble with her forehand and serve throughout the match - she double-faulted five times in the first set alone – and hit 26 unforced errors to just three winners, losing in just 59 minutes. She also appeared to believe there was something wrong with her equipment as she struggled with her control, and had three of her rackets restrung in the opening set.After the match, the 21-year-old thought she had found some privacy to vent her frustration in a ramp away leading from Rod Laver Arena. She smashed her racket against the concrete floor but the incident was picked up by a camera andvideo of the incidentsoon flooded social media.Alcaraz survives early De Minaur onslaught and surges into Australian Open semisRead more“I tried to go somewhere where there were no cameras,” Gauff told reporters. “I kind of have a thing with the broadcast. I feel like certain moments – the same thing happened to Aryna [Sabalenka] after I played her in the final of the US Open – I feel like they don’t need to broadcast.”World No 1 Sabalenka smashed her racket in a training area after her loss to Gauff at the 2023 US Open. Footage of that incident also went viral after it was caught on camera.“I tried to go somewhere where they wouldn’t broadcast it, but obviously they did. Maybe some conversations can be had, because I feel like at this tournament the only private place we have is the locker room,” Gauff added.The 21-year-old said she prefers to take out her frustration on her equipment rather than her team.“I think for me, I know myself, and I don’t want to lash out on my team. They’re good people. They don’t deserve that, and I know I’m emotional,” Gauff said. “I just took the minute to go and do that. I don’t think it’s a bad thing. Like I said, I don’t try to do it on court in front of kids and things like that, but I do know I need to let out that emotion.“Otherwise, I’m just going to be snappy with the people around me, and I don’t want to do that, because like I said, they don’t deserve it. They did their best. I did mine. Just need to let the frustration out.”View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff struggled with her serve in Melbourne.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockGauff, the No 3 seed at this year’s Australian Open, was hoping to make the final in Melbourne for the first time, and she had won her two previous matches against Svitolina. She is the reigning French Open champion but suffered a shock defeat inthe first-round at last year’s Wimbledonand was knocked out in the fourth round of the US Open.Svitolina was in a more positive mood after reaching her first Australian Open semi-final, where she will face Sabalenka. The victory also guarantees she will return to the world top 10 for the first time since giving birth to her daughter, Skai.“After maternity leave, it was my dream to come back into the top 10,” she said. “Always been my goal. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen last year, I stopped after September [due to injury] and then when we were training in the off-season, I told my coach: ‘I want to come back to top 10 this year,’ so this was my goal this year.”Although Gauff and her compatriot, Iva Jovic, lost their quarter-finals, the US is guaranteed a semi-finalist at this year’s tournament. Two Americans, Amanda Anisimova and Jessica Pegula, face each other in Wednesday morning’s quarter-final in Melbourne. Jovic was easily beaten 6-3, 6-0 by Sabalenka, who has reached the semi-finals in 12 of her last 13 grand slam appearances and will be a formidable test for Svitolina.Explore more on these topicsCoco GauffAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenAustralia sportUS sportsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Probably not. Even if there had been, it almost certainly didn’t mean all that much. But that’s the way of the modern game: an extremely protracted clearing of the throat before the real business begins.Uefa will proudly tell the world that only six teams have nothing to play for in the final round of games on Wednesday, but whether it was worth 126 games to get to the mild peril of Napoli or Club Brugge possibly going out, or the questionable thrill of finding out whetherTottenhamor Atalanta will have to endure the playoff round, is debatable.That the reward for finishing in the top eight is not to have to play two further games is itself telling, an admission that there is too much football and that having to play a couple of extra games is now regarded not as a revenue-raising exercise but as an imposition.Champions League permutations: who needs what from final night of fixtures?Read moreAs tournaments have expanded and proliferated, so fatigue has become a defining force. It perhaps explains why, as Tariq Panja observed this week on the Libero podcast, only Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain of the game’s elite seem better now than they were five years ago. And it probably explains why Premier League teams are so dominant at this stage of the Champions League but win it relatively rarely.One image perhaps stands out from the group stage, which is that ofMicky van de Ven running the length of the fieldto score Tottenham’s third goal in their 4‑0 win against Copenhagen in November, opponents hanging off him like Lilliputians trying to bring down Gulliver. That was an extreme case, but there were plenty of examples across the group stage of Premier League sides bullying physically smaller European opponents: Newcastle did it to Athletic, Arsenal did it to Atlético, Liverpool did it to Real Madrid and Chelsea did it to Barcelona.To an extent, of course, that’s been true for at least 20 years, a reinvocation of the late 70s and early 80s, but with the advent of Long-Throw Britain, as English football has moved away from the Guardiola paradigm, it has become especially pronounced. Because Premier League clubs, en masse, are so much wealthier than the rest of Europe, they can buy the best players for their preferred model of play. That’s why, heading into this final round of games, there are six Premier League teams in the top 11, with onlyManchester City outside the top eightwho will skip the punishment round.View image in fullscreenLiverpool topped the group stage last season but lost to Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAGiven that level of domination, though, why have English clubs won only three of the past 10 Champions Leagues? A clue is perhaps offered by the experience of Italian clubs in the 90s, when Serie A was the dominant league in Europe. The situation was slightly different in that, barring the European champions, leagues were limited to a single participant until 1996-97, but between 1992 and 1998 there was an Italian team in the final every season.Only twoof them won.In part, of course, that’s the nature of knockout competition. There is a degree of randomness. But perhaps it was also the case that, come the final in May, the Italian team had been wearied by the exertions of the Serie A season in the way that, say, Ajax or Borussia Dortmund had not been by a season in the Eredivisie or the Bundesliga. That’s the issue English clubs now face.It was striking last week how straightforward Spurs found their Champions League game against Dortmund compared with the Premier League matches against West Ham and Burnley that fell either side of it.On the one hand there’s something viscerally thrilling about Djed Spence, pressed into service as a winger, tearing past Yan Couto every time he got the ball, but on the other it doesn’t feel quite right.A lower mid-table Premier League side shouldn’t be able to treat the second-best team in Germany like a sixth-former playing against third‑years. Which is not to say that Dortmund in the Premier League would be in danger of relegation, rather that the expansive way of playing that works for them at home leaves them horribly vulnerable to the intensity of even a struggling English side.When the quarter‑finals are played in April, though, Premier League teams are exhausted from a season of playing against other Premier League teams. That makes them vulnerable against the very best of the rest of Europe. It was notable that in the most recent Deloitte Football Money League, released last week, although there were six Premier League teams in the top 10, none of them is in the top four.Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain are able to compete financially with the best of the Premier League and by the business end of the Champions League, they have a significant advantage of freshness. That perhaps explains why last season Arsenal beat PSG comfortably in the group stage, but thenlost against them in the semi-finals.That example, of course, only underlines the futility of this stage of the Champions League. So long as a team get through, the group stage means very little.Liverpool didn’t benefitfrom topping the league last season, and it didn’t harm PSG that they finished 15th. All of this is essentially filler until we get to the real business of Euro giants against exhausted English clubs in the quarter-finals.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

Midway through the third set, the result all but a formality, De Minaur pounded an aggressive forehand down the line and flitted forward to the net.Against nearly any other player in the world, the Australian would have won the point. Against Alcaraz, the world No 1, De Minaur watched on helplessly as the Spaniard chased down the ball and slid to his right, whipping a forehand down-the-line pass that did not come back. De Minaur could not hide his rueful smile.Alcaraz survives early De Minaur onslaught and surges into Australian Open semisRead moreOver the past 10 days, the sixth seed has played some of the best tennis of his already incredibly successful career. He reached his second careerAustralian Openquarter-final by dismantling the former top 10 player Frances Tiafoe and the newest top 10 player Alexander Bublik in back-to back straight-sets wins. He had been clinical, rolling through his section of the draw with just one set lost in five prior matches.De Minaur’s progress in this tournament was a continuation of his upward momentum. Yet the fact remains that the No 6 and No 1 in the ATP rankings at times appear to be competing in different sports. At no point in his 7-5, 6-2, 6-1 win over the Australian did Alcaraz even appear to look uncomfortable.It did take the 22-year-old some time to settle down in the first set. Although he started well, the winner of six majors was eventually punished for not serving precisely enough and as De Minaur tried to target his opponent’s backhand, the Spaniard was unimpressive. He hit 10 backhand unforced errors compared to just one winner in the first set. Alcaraz led by a break on two occasions in the first set, yet cheaply handed the initiative back to De Minaur.However, Alcaraz simply has so many more options, weapons and ways to win a point, meaning it was only a matter of time before he took control. Whenever they were deadlocked in extended rallies, the younger man – he is 22 – broke out of the exchanges with devastating injections of pace or a drop shot. He used his peerless skills to move quickly from defence to attack. Once the first set was secured, Alcaraz rolled through the match.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz takes a break against Alex de Minaur in his straight-sets win.Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/APFor so long, the narrative surrounding Alcaraz was his tendency to lose focus in matches. One of the most memorable examples came when he inexplicablyfound himself in a fifth setwith the 38-year-old Fabio Fognini, who was ranked No 138 and on the verge of retirement, in the first round of Wimbledon. Things have changed quickly. Like in New York in September, Alcaraz has navigated his path to the semi-finals in Melbourne without dropping a set.He has not always played his best tennis, but despite being pushed to 7-5 and 7-6 sets five times during this tournament, he has found a way through each match in straight sets. “I’ve been working on this, on the concentration, the focus,” Alcaraz said. “Not having ups and downs in the matches has been one of my best or one of the main goals for me, which I’m just trying to put into work really every practice.Carlos Alcaraz powers past Jannik Sinner in four sets to win US OpenRead more“If I have a practice of two hours, two hours and a half, playing sets or playing against another player, I’m just trying to play the same level and having the same concentration, you know, point after point after point. I think the work pay off and I just have a great mindset and a great concentration during the whole tournament, which I’m just really proud about seeing all the hard work pay off.”The level he displayed in the final two sets against the 26-year-old De Minaur was of particular importance to the Spaniard due to his lack of match practice. He opted not to compete in the two weeks before the Australian Open and began the tournament searching for rhythm as a result. “My team told me, like, be patient. Your level, the level you want to play, is going to come, for sure. You got to just keep trying, keep pushing yourself, and you will get where you want to be.”Two wins away from securing the career grand slam, Alcaraz has begun to find the level he had been seeking. Now he must maintain it.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Carlos AlcarazAustralian OpenTennisAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Can’t we just say no to Trump for once? We can take care of their security ourselves. We don’t need ICE.”Alessandro Zan, a member of the European parliament for the centre-left Democratic party, said the presence of ICE agents would be unacceptable. “In Italy, we don’t want those who trample on human rights and act outside of any democratic control,” he wrote on X.Two small opposition parties – the Green and Left Alliance (AVS) and Azione – have started petitions calling on the Italian government and the Olympic organising committee to prevent the ICE agents’ entry and involvement in the security operations. “ICE is the militia that shoots people on the streets of Minneapolis and takes children away from their families,” AVS said.Speaking on the sidelines of a Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony in Rome, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, sought to play down concerns. “It’s not like the SS are coming,” he said, referring to the Nazi paramilitary organisation. “Let’s be clear. They’re not coming to maintain public order in the middle of the streets. They’re coming to collaborate in the operations rooms.”The confirmation of ICE’s role comes after RAI state TV aired a video of ICE agentsthreatening to break the windowof the vehicle its crew were using to report in Minneapolis.Italy’s interior ministry later issued a statement saying Matteo Piantedosi, the interior minister, had met Tilman J Fertitta, the US ambassador in Rome, during which the involvement of ICE’s investigative arm in the security detail at the Games was confirmed, “and therefore not the agency’s operational arm”.During the Games, the US will set up its own operations room at its consulate in Milan, “where representatives of US agencies potentially interested in the event will be present”, the statement said.“Homeland Security Investigation experts will also be employed in this room, but their role will be to support the management of major events abroad and to liaise with liaison officers,” the statement added, emphasising that ICE investigators “will not be operational personnel like those employed in immigration controls in the United States, but rather representatives exclusively specialised in investigations”.Agents from ICE’s investigative unit are present in more than 50 countries, the statement said, “including in Italy for years, but do not perform immigration control operations or services in foreign countries”.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Winter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Arteta’s side have finished as runners-up in the past three seasons and Arsenal have now spent 884 days at the summit since Arsène Wenger’s Invincibles were crowned champions in 2004.David Squires on … Manchester United giving Arsenal the title wobblesRead moreBut after their meeting on Monday, when he and the players discussed the challenges they will face between now and the end of the season, Arteta is confident his players can and will embrace the pressure. “The reaction has been excellent,” he said.“We took a moment to bring the temperature down, to pause and to reflect and ask two questions. One is: ‘How do we feel, and how do I feel myself?’ And then: ‘How are we going to live the next four months?’ It was so encouraging and beautiful because what came out of that is very simple.“We have earned the right to be in a great position in four competitions, and in the next four months we’re going to live and play with enjoyment, with a lot of courage and with the conviction that we’re going to win it.”Asked whether anxiety from the home crowd during the second half against United had affected his players, Arteta said: “That’s why I encouraged them to jump in this boat because it’s going to be fun. Because the excitement, that conviction, that energy, that will is the way you have to live when you want to achieve a dream.“For me that’s the only way to live it because we’re going to give absolutely everything. We’re going to prepare in the best possible way and the best chance to deliver what we want is putting all the energy and channelling the energy into that direction.”Arsenal’s co-chair, Josh Kroenke, is in London for the Champions League meeting against the Kazakh side Kairat on Wednesday when the hosts will bid to become the first club to win all eight matches in thenew league phase format, which was introduced last season. William Saliba and Jurriën Timber will miss out because of minor injuries, but Christian Nørgaard – who has yet to start in the Premier League sincejoining from Brentford in the summer– looks poised to make a third Champions League start of the season, replacing Martín Zubimendi in midfield.Arteta denied Zubimendi needs a rest after his mistake against United led to Bryan Mbeumo’s equaliser, while Nørgaard was adamant that he has no interest in leaving this month after being linked with Ajax. “I am really, really happy here,” the Dane said.“It is a learning curve for me as well. I need to also improve and show the tactics that Mikel is showing are getting under my skin. Hopefully, coming into the last part of the season I can contribute more on the pitch.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

Slot’s defensive options will be limited against the team from Azerbaijan with Ibrahima Konaté absent following the death of his father and Joe Gomez injured.Adli scrambles last-gasp winner as Bournemouth take down LiverpoolRead moreWhen asked whether he would like a bigger squad in future, Liverpool’s head coach surprisingly claimed the reduced workload that followed Liverpool’s last-16 exit to Paris Saint-Germain in March helped his team win a 20th league championship. Liverpool were 15 points clear and had nine league games remaining when theylost on penaltiesto the eventual Champions League winners.“This is not going to be a popular opinion but maybe the reason we won the league last season is that we had to play Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16, because they beat us and we had every time a [full] week to prepare for our next game,” said Slot, who expects Andy Robertson to remain at Liverpool for the rest of the season. “Maybe that helped us. Every manager is aware that the bigger squad you have, the better equipped you are for so many games.”Liverpool have lost four away games in the Premier League this season after playing in the Champions League in midweek, supporting Slot’s contention that injuries have taken a toll on his resources. His team were again poor defensively and wasteful against Bournemouth, and the coach admits improvement is essential to rescue this campaign. “It’s impossible to shut down the noise at a club like this if you are not competing for the league,” Slot said.“For me it’s so simple. In between the boxes we are a very good team. If we have chances then be clinical and finish it off, that is something we have to improve. And in the other box other teams arrive there three or four times a game, but too many times it leads to a chance and sometimes a goal. That’s a very bad cocktail we are having.“If we improve in both boxes, I think we are able to win something this season. If we only improve in one box, it is going to be really difficult to win something this season. And if we can’t improve in both boxes, there is going to be a lot of noise throughout the whole season.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

Chelsea’s head coach has not felt the need to seek assurances from the club’s hierarchy about the England international’s future and he could not have been firmer when asked if the 23-year-old is untouchable.“Yes,” Rosenior said. “It’s simple, Cole’s an incredible player. I’m not surprised at the timing. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there’s people unsettled. It’s not true. Cole’s here, he’s very happy and I can’t wait to see him back on the pitch.“There’s no reason for assurance. It’s so unrealistic. It’s come from nowhere. There’s nothing in it. There’s no reason to have the conversation. That’s where I’m at. Cole is very happy. I’ve had numerous conversations with him. Our thoughts are on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him. He loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player. You can’t stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth. There’s no point in having a discussion about it.”Injuries have disrupted Palmer’s season but he has returned to the squad for Wednesday night’s Champions League game against Napoli. Chelsea head to Naples needing a win in the final round of the group phase to give themselves a realistic chance of a top-eight finish and direct qualification into the last 16. There is more pressure on Antonio Conte’s injury-hit Napoli, who are at risk of a humiliating early exit from the competition.However, while the Italian champions are missing up to 11 players, Rosenior knows that Chelsea will have to be at their best if they are to secure their first away win in the Champions League in over three years. “Napoli are a great team,” Rosenior said. “They proved that last year with a fantastic title. They have outstanding individual players, they have a world-class coach. They’re still in the position where they can get through.”Chelsea are edging towards an agreement for Raheem Sterling to leave the club before the transfer window shuts. Sterling has 18 months left on a contract worth £325,000 a week and has not played this season. He has interest from Fulham and Crystal Palace.Jacob Steinberg2.Howe hopes ‘warrior’ will return for PSGA groin injury dictates that Newcastle will be without Joelinton for the next few weeks but Eddie Howe is hoping Bruno Guimarães passes a late fitness test before Wednesday night’s pivotal Champions League match at Paris Saint-Germain.“Joe’s had a scan,” said Newcastle’s manager after finally arriving in Paris following a three-hour delay to his flight caused by adverse weather. “He’ll possibly be out for a few weeks. He’s going to get a second opinion just to make sure we’re on the right lines with that. He’ll miss quite a few games just because we’ve got so many fixtures.”Win in Paris and Howe’s team will finish in the top eight of the European showpiece’s league stage and proceed straight to March’s round of 16, thereby avoiding the strain of a two-legged playoff next month.Their cause will be helped should the injured ankle that kept Guimarães out of the 2-0 Premier Leaguedefeat at home by Aston Villalast Sunday be judged to have healed sufficiently. “Bruno’s a very rare player these days, in the respect that he wants to play every minute of every game,” said a manager well aware that his side have won none of the 11 Premier League games Guimarães has missed through injury. “He’s got that warrior attitude.“Bruno’s biggest quality for me is that he wants the ball in every moment. He will go hunting the ball because he’s brave enough to take responsibility. But I think we do have to learn to play if he’s not available.”View image in fullscreenBruno Guimarães took part in training on Tuesday night but faces a fitness test ahead of the PSG match.Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPAHowe could also do with Anthony Gordon adding to his tally of six Champions League goals this season when Newcastle face Luis Enrique’s holders. The England winger has struggled domestically and failed to score from open play for a year in the Premier League but tends to shine in European matches.“I don’t care for people’s opinion, whether they love or they don’t like me, it doesn’t bother me either way,” said Gordon. Asked why he tends to come alive in the Champions League, he said: “I just think it’s the biggest, it’s the best.”He also had a riposte for his domestic critics. “I know I’m doing the right things every day. I’m always playing against elite right-backs so I know people expect a lot from me, but they’re also quite good players and they get paid well to stop me. It [criticism] is part of trying to be great at something. If you can’t take people’s opinions you’re not meant to be great. I think I take it quite well. I don’t take it personal. I’m not a very sensitive person.”Louise Taylor3.Guardiola denies having dinner with HaalandPep Guardiola has claimed he does not know if Erling Haaland will be fresh for Manchester City’s final Champions League group game against Galatasaray on Wednesday because they “did not have dinner last night”.City are 11th with 13 points before hosting the Turkish champions, one of eight teams with the total. These include Chelsea, who are eighth, the last position that secures automatic qualification to the last-16, the goal difference of Rosenior’s side being superior by two.This means victory by a wide margin would give City the best chance of avoiding a two-legged playoff for a second successive season, so a return to goalscoring form by Haaland would be welcome. City’s top scorer was dropped for Saturday’s 2-0 win over Wolves and did not register after coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute, meaning he has not scored from open play in his last seven appearances.Guardiola was asked if Haaland will be fresh after only featuring as a substitute at the weekend. “I didn’t have dinner with him last night so I don’t know. We will see,” said the manager. “It’s the team. We have to play better: create more chances and he will score. Never underestimate the goalscorers because they will always make you silent.”Asked if he would speak to Haaland about his comparative goal drought, Guardiola said: “I’m an overthinking manager, I’m not a man manager. The new generation of managers are just videos. I haven’t talked with the players for the last three years. Less problems.”Guardiola apologised for his criticism of referee Farai Hallam after he did not award City a penalty against Wolves. Hallam, on his Premier League debut, was sent to the pitchside monitor by VAR after deeming Yerson Mosquera had not illegally handled the ball after it struck his outstretched arm as Omar Marmoush tried to scoop it behind the defender. Hallam stuck with his on-field decision.“I’m so sorry,” Guardiola said. “If he feels offended, I’m so sorry. I know it’s not easy on debut. And it’s happened. Everyone is so sensitive, I know that.”Guardiola insisted that he rarely criticises officials and never after losing. “Take a look when we have had defeats over the last 10 years,” the manager said. “When we lose in the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup – the first statement is to congratulate the opponent all the time. But when you say one or two times over 10 years that I am the type [to complain] then OK, it’s fine, everyone defends his position.”Jérémy Doku returned from a leg injury to play the last 18 minutesof the Wolves win. He sustained the problem when Diogo Dalot fouled him in the 2-0 defeat at Manchester United the previous Saturday, the right-back receiving a yellow card when, by common consensus, he should have seen red. “You guys know my feelings about it,” said Doku. “I could have [been out for a long time]. Thanks to the Lord I didn’t get injured badly.”Nico González will have a late fitness test regarding his availability for the visit of Galatasaray.Jamie Jackson4.Conte faces crunch in midst of injury crisisNapoli are on the brink of being eliminated from the Champions League as the troubled Italian club face Chelsea on Wednesday, racked by a deep injury crisis and a faltering Serie A title defence. Sat just inside the elimination zone on only eight points from seven matches after last week’s miserable 1-1 draw at Copenhagen, Napoli must beat Chelsea to scrape a place in next month’s playoffs.“For us [injuries are] something that we have to accept, it’s a difficult situation which is not easy to manage,” said Scott McTominay. “It’s difficult for the staff and the players to continue with that rhythm.”Conte has lost the first-choice goalkeeper, Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, to a hamstring injury while the winger David Neres flew to London for ankle surgery on Monday which could keep him out until April. Kevin De Bruyne has been out since October and won’t be back until the spring after surgery on his right hamstring, while another key midfielder in Frank Anguissa was supposed to be back on Sunday from another hamstring injury but was left out due to back problems.Reuters5.Flick targets top-eight spot for BarçaBarcelona welcome Copenhagen, knowing a top-eight finish and direct ticket to the last 16 are on the line in their final group fixture. Hansi Flick’s side moved up to ninth on 13 points after last week’s dramatic comeback win at Slavia Prague, leaving them level with seven other sides battling for a top-eight finish, suggesting goal difference is likely to be a major factor in deciding the final placings.Their Danish visitors, who are 26th and currently in the elimination zone on eight points, will hope to secure a playoff spot, being tied with four other teams targeting a top-24 finish. Barça’s task has grown in difficulty as they prepare to navigate the match without two key midfielders. Creative linchpin Pedri is sidelined with a muscle injury sustained against Slavia, which will keep him out for several weeks, while Frenkie de Jong is suspended.Flick acknowledged the challenge of the crucial fixture, but expressed optimism about his squad’s depth and determination. “I hope the team is feeling good and confident,” said Flick. “We have to respect Copenhagen. The most important thing is that we do our job and play at our best. It won’t be an easy match. The goal is to finish in the top eight.”ReutersExplore more on these topicsChampions LeagueThe talkShareReuse this content"

Odobert was following behind in a separate vehicle and stopped to check on him. The players were making their way from the Spurs training ground to Stansted airport for the team flight to Frankfurt. Frank said neither had boarded it and they had to take a different flight to Frankfurt later on Tuesday night.It was a less than ideal detail for Frank, who is under heavy pressure after the Premier Leaguedraw at Burnleyon Saturday when he was again barracked by the Spurs support – especially as he digested the setbacks for Porro and Van de Ven.Porro is out for four weeks with a hamstring injury, having come off at half-time against Burnley, while Van de Ven’s problem, according to Frank, is less serious. The manager did not specify what it was but said it was not a hamstring – the muscle that the centre-back had problems with last season. Frank said Van de Ven could return for the league game at home against Manchester City on Sunday.Frank did have some positive news on the selection front, with João Palhinha back from injury and Pape Sarr available after illness. But the manager is down to the bones of his squad – with only 11 available outfield players.View image in fullscreenRandal Kolo Muani crashed on the motorway following a tyre blowout but escaped unharmed.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty Images“Kolo Muani and Wilson Odobert are both fine,” Frank said. “Unfortunately they were both involved in a minor accident … everyone else involved in that accident was fine. It was a tyre blowing up and so the two of them are a little bit delayed. But they will land later tonight. I haven’t spoken to them personally yet. The first message is that they are fine and nothing happened. I fully expect both to be available for tomorrow.“Then, Pedro hasn’t travelled. Unfortunately, he picked up a hamstring injury to be out for four weeks. Micky has not travelled. It’s a minor thing. It’s possible he’s available for the weekend.”Spurs have been tracked to Frankfurt by dreadful domestic form. Out of both cups, they have won just two of their past 14 league matches to sit 14th. TheChampions League, however, has offered respite with Spurs fifth in the table. They are guaranteed at least a playoff spot and, if they beat Frankfurt, who are in turmoil after sacking their manager, Dino Toppmöller, on the Sunday before last, they would qualify directly for the last 16.“I’m very happy that the team and club are in a position where, with a win tomorrow, we can finish top eight in the best club tournament in the world,” Frank said. “Those results and some of those performances are also what we need to take going forward and build on that.“It’s my job to look a little bit in the bigger perspective. Even though we haven’t won as much as we want, it’s [only] very, very few things that need to go our way, the small margins. We need to keep doing the right thing.”Spurs faced Eintracht here last season in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final, having drawn 1-1 with them in London, and there are clear parallels between then and now. Ange Postecoglou, the manager at the time, was under heavy pressure, his team’s league form having crashed. Out of both domestic cups, Spurs lagged 15th in the table.There was the feeling that if Spurs lost, Postecoglou could be sacked. As it was,his team won 1-0with a Dominic Solanke penalty en route to winning the competition. Postecoglou even took a defensive approach that night.Frankfurt, who finished third in the Bundesliga last season to qualify for the Champions League, have endured a frustrating campaign this time out. The pressure on Toppmöller grew to intolerable levels and the club took the decision to replace him on an interim basis with Dennis Schmitt, the manager of their under-21s.Schmitt has lost his opening two games, the first away against Qarabag in the Champions League when his team threw away a 2-1 lead with 10 minutes remaining to lose 3-2. Frankfurt are fourth from bottom with only four points and cannot qualify for the knockout round. They are eighth in the Bundesliga. In each of their previous five matches in all competitions, they have conceded three goals.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankEintracht FrankfurtChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Regulations state they must receive a minimum “contact time” of 20 hours a week excluding matchdays and mealtimes. For players aged 23 and over, the minimum salary is £26,900.The first Women’s Champions Cup: what is it and should we pay attention?Read moreUnder UK law, any employee aged 21 or over must be paid at least £12.21 an hour, which equates to £23,810 a year based on a typical working week of 37.5 hours. An 18-year-old, on the national minimum wage of £10 an hour, should be paid £19,500 if working 37.5 hours a week. Thereal living wageof £13.45 an hour equates to £26,227 a year on a 37.5-hour week. In London the figure is £14.80 an hour.Holly Murdoch, the chief operating officer of WSL Football, said when the minimum salaries were announced in September: “We wanted to make sure that they could focus on being a footballer, not focus on a part-time job.”The minimum salaries are a marked enhancement on previous seasons, when for example Blackburn were reportedly paying some players £9,000 a year. The Lancashire clubwithdrew from the second tierbefore this season, saying the “demands placed on second-tier clubs have become unsustainable”.It is understood many WSL2 clubs are comfortably exceeding the minimum salaries and that the vast majority of WSL2 players aged 18 to 20 are at least 15% above the floor level.The minimum amounts were put in place after consultation with the Professional Footballers’ Association and have largely been welcomed as a step forward. Sources with knowledge of the discussions said a careful balancing act had to be struck to ensure long-term financial sustainability. A significant proportion of lower-paid WSL2 players were reliant on having second jobs before this season.In the top tier, the minimum salaries for WSL players are higher: £42,500 for players aged 23 and over, £34,700 for 21- and 22-year-olds and £26,900 for 18- to 20-year-olds.“This initial floor establishes a baseline and it’s a foundation we are fully committed to building upon,” a WSL spokesperson said. “There was no salary floor for players up until this season, and minimum salaries have been implemented as the result of an 18-month consultative process involving key stakeholders. The floor is higher than the minimum wage for an equivalent age, based on 20 hours per week.”There are also salary-cap rules in place this season. These state that the player wage bill must not exceed the two following figures combined: 80% of the club’s revenue, plus up to £4m or a further 25% of the club’s revenue (whichever is higher). It means a cash-rich WSL2 owner can spend £4m of their money on player wages without breaching the cap.For most clubs, £4m is substantially more than 25% of their revenue.Deloitte saidonly Arsenal (£22.2m) and Chelsea (£22m) among WSL clubs had revenue of more than £16m in the 2024-25 season, with Manchester City next on its list with £11.2m.Any club found in breach of the cap could face a fine and points deduction, it can be revealed. A top-flight team can have a point deducted for every £100,000 of overspending, with a deduction of 10 points or more for an overspend of more than £900,000. In WSL2, one point can be deducted for every £50,000 of overspending.On Tuesday, the company running the WSL and WSL2 published its first accounts since the leagues started being run independently of the Football Association. They show an operating loss of £8.2m between 24 April 2024 – when the company was incorporated – and 31 July 2025, much of which is attributed to the costs associated with building a new business, and is said to be “in line with the business plan”. The accounts showed a cash balance of £10.7m.Revenue totalled £17.4m and has climbed this season, such that as of earlier this month, commercial revenue is understood to have trebled since the split from the FA.The company drew down £6.1m from £20m loan from the Premier League, which will not start to be repaid until the 2030-31 season. A further £4.4m has been drawn this season, and the accounts reveal the Premier League will be repaid at an interest rate 2% above the Barclays Bank base rate at the time of the drawdown.The highest-paid director, who is not named but is expected to be the chief executive, Nikki Doucet, was paid £531,000 including pension contributions. The directors and senior management team combined earned £1.37m.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballWomen's Super League 2Women's Super LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s through humour. That’s another area of why he’s going to be a great leader because he has that side to him as well.“He showed his calmness, his clarity under pressure. He also showed humour as well. Hopefully, it’s received in the right way. Definitely no malice behind it. He’s just trying to have a bit of a joke with his teammates.”Root hailed Brook’s captaincy after Sri Lanka got off to a rapid start in their chase of 358. “They got off to an absolute flyer in that second innings and he was very calm and knew what he wanted to do,” the 35-year-old said. “A team’s throwing a few punches at you and to be able to stay calm, keep in control of everything was another example of why I think he’s going to be an excellent captain.”The pair had worked closely together in the nets on Monday and brought their work to the middle, their unbeaten partnership worth 191. “We were just talking about angles, using our sweeps, being able to pull the ball from different lines, maybe slightly unconventional to what you do in England or other parts of the world, that can be really effective here.“When you’ve got his ability and his skill level he can put it into practice straight away and it’s just phenomenal to see him take that from yesterday into today. And that’s what we want from any team, you want to be sharing ideas and experience and if there’s anyway you can add to the guys around you and help them that’s your role as a senior player within the team.“I enjoyed watching it from the other end and I’m sure everyone enjoyed watching it in the stands and on the TV as well.”Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamJoe RootHarry BrookCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the host union wants to move it to a neutral venue to maximise the revenue they receive from gate receipts.The Breakdown | So much at stake and Six Nations just the start in ‘massive year for rugby union’Read moreSteve Borthwick’s side had originally been scheduled to play Fiji in South Africa before travelling to Argentina to play the Pumas for their final summer fixture on 18 July, but the Fiji Rugby Union is understood to have asked permission from the Nations Championship organisers to switch it to England.World Rugby, the Six Nations and Sanzaar have all given their blessing on the proviso that the game is not held at England’s home ground of Twickenham for integrity reasons.While the contract has yet to be signed, Everton’s new stadium is understood to be the preferred option for all parties, with negotiations over the terms of the agreement still ongoing. There are relatively few other options available, as Wembley, the Emirates Stadium and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium all have gigs booked during July, while neither Manchester United or City have been approached.England games away from Twickenham are relatively rare, and the Rugby Football Union is privately delighted at being given an unexpected opportunity to take the national team on the road. England played a World Cup warm-up match at Newcastle’s St James’ Park in 2019, and a pool game in the 2015 competition against Uruguay was held at the Etihad Stadium.World Rugby is understood to have sanctioned the switch due to the lack of suitable venues in Fiji and a desire to help the financial growth of the smaller unions. The venues for Fiji’s other notional Nations Championship home games this summer against Wales and Scotland have also yet to be announced.Everton have moved quickly to establish Bramley-Moore Dock as a leading multi-sport venue since the 53,000-capacity stadium at the start of the season. A rugby league Ashes Test match between England and Australiaattracted a sell-out crowd in November, the sport’s Magic Weekend involving all 14 Super League clubs will take place there in July, while Scotland this week announced it as the venue for an international friendly against Côte d’Ivoire on 31 March as they prepare for this summer’s World Cup. Everton and the Six Nations declined to comment.England’s preparations for the upcoming Six Nations have suffered a setback with the announcement that second-choice loosehead Fin Baxter must undergo foot surgery.Baxter was set to travel to Girona for the squad’s pre-tournament training camp before their opener against Wales on 7 February after being included on a list of five players who were to undergo rehabilitation for injuries in the hope they would recover in time for the opening rounds. However, no date for Baxter’s return has now been set.Senior tighthead Will Stuart had already been ruled out of the entire Six Nations because of a ruptured Achilles while Asher Opoku-Fordjour is also unavailable for the campaign after undergoing shoulder surgery.Harlequins back row Jack Kenningham has been added to England’s training squad for the trip to Spain with Ben Curry staying at Sale as part of his rehabilitation from injury.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionNations ChampionshipEngland rugby union teamFiji rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

A target of 358 was monstrous, and Sri Lanka gave it a serious go up top, reaching 100 inside 10 overs.Pathum Nissanka, with a 24-ball half-century, and Kusal Mendis, 20 off his first eight deliveries, laid into Jamie Overton in the powerplay. But the quick also managed to attract the fatal big shot: the former pulled to the catcher in the deep, the latter found Brook at mid-off. The partnerships did not build even as the boundaries continued, regular wickets and more catches for Brook giving England control.Pavan Rathnayake, 23 years old and playing just his seventh international match, was the consolation for Sri Lanka, the right-hander’s promise leading to a first century for his country. A single through extra cover off Liam Dawson in the 43rd over brought the Premadasa great joy, and Rathnayake refused to give in, threatening to do it all himself. His was the final wicket to fall as England celebrated their first ODI series victory abroad in three years.After losing the toss in England’s six previous ODIs, Brook finally had it go his way and elected to bat. Having called the ragging Colombo pitch on Saturday “probably the worst” he’d played on, he was critical once again when speaking before the start: “We’d like a nice pitch, but I don’t think it’s going to be a nice pitch.” Pressed by the commentator Russel Arnold on what a “nice pitch” would entail, Brook replied: “High-scoring, boundaries everywhere.”View image in fullscreenEngland’s squad pose with the trophy after becoming the first away team to win an ODI series in Sri Lanka for five years.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APBut variety – turners in Asia, bouncy ones in Australia – elevates the game, and watching an endless stream of big hits can get tiring. Having got his wish, the entertainment value of Brook’s pyro-party was higher than usual because of the challenges presented earlier in the series, when each run scored was precious.Another 200-something total seemed the limit when England were reduced to 40 for two inside 11 overs. Ben Duckett’s reverse-sweep, usually one of his superpowers, went straight to cover while Rehan Ahmed – opening once again as the tourists stayed unchanged – pulled Wanindu Hasaranga to midwicket for 24.Hasaranga, the home side’s main weapon with the ball, had been rested for the previous two games and it took just three deliveries for him to strike. But that would be his only breakthrough of the afternoon as Root and Bethell settled in for a 126-run stand.Root commands respect in all conditions but the numbers are something else in Sri Lanka, where he has three Test hundreds and now averages 76 in ODIs. The cushioned reverse-sweeps were particularly brilliant in his latest effort, and the speed of his footwork when spotting a drag-down stood out, too. Bethell displayed his range against pace in the 30th over, bowled by Asitha Fernando. Four boundaries went to different corners: a clip through mid-on to bring up his half-century, a late cut, a blistering pull and the cover drive to finish.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook hits a six during his explosive century.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APBethell perished just as he begin to crank things up, lacing Jeffrey Vandersay to deep midwicket. Brook entered with less than 19 overs to play, there to help out as Root advanced to his century – celebrated with the 35-year-old’s now trademark shrug. Instead, the England captain turned himself into the headliner.His first stroke was a four behind point but it was his work over extra cover that stunned. Even Dunith Wellalage, whose tight left-arm spin went at under five an over, felt Brook’s force through that region as the right-hander ascended to another level. After reaching his half-century off 40 balls, it took just 17 more to get to his third ODI century. Fittingly, England’s innings closed with another Brook six over cover, Fernando the bowler punished. England had their highest total away from home since the 2023 World Cup.Sri Lanka, initially, made it look paltry before the tumble of wickets. A fifth-wicket stand between Rathnayake and Janith Liyanage kept them in with a shout, but hesitancy while running cost them, the latter perishing before he could get back to the striker’s end. Wellalage, impressive all series, hung around for 22 before Rathnayake’s milestone moment. Hope remained till the end because of the centurion, but the result, confirmed when Sam Curran finally found a way through Rathnayake, was unfamiliar to Sri Lanka – this is their first ODI series defeat at home in five years.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamHarry BrookJoe RootnewsShareReuse this content"

However, down 1-6, 0-3, 0-30 on Tuesday night and sinking quickly, the 21‑year‑old has rarely looked as helpless on a tennis court as when she expressed her despair to her support team. “She’s outdoing me in everything,” she said.This time, there was no way back for the third seed as Elina Svitolina ended a courageous, focused performance by securing the most significant result of theAustralian Openso far, dismantling Gauff 6-1, 6-2 to reach her first semi-final in Melbourne.Svitolina, the 12th seed, will next face Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, and two‑time Australian Open champion. Earlier on Tuesday, Sabalenka eased past the 29th seed, Iva Jovic, 6-3, 6-0 to reach her fourth consecutive semi-final here.A former world No 3, Svitolina is one of the most accomplished players of her generation and the 31‑year‑old has now reached four major semi‑finals from 14 quarter‑finals. This victory is particularly special, however, as it means she will return to the top 10 for the first time since returning to competition in 2023 after giving birth to her daughter, Skai. Svitolina has started the 2026 season supremely well, winning the Auckland Open and now 10 matches in a row. This is her second consecutive win against a top-10 player after defeating the world No 7, Mirra Andreeva, in the previous round, and she still has not dropped a set.“After maternity leave, it was my dream to come back into the top 10,” she said. “Always been my goal. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen last year, I stopped after September [with injury] and then when we were training in the off-season I told my coach: ‘I want to come back to top 10 this year,’ so this was my goal this year.”This was an excruciating performance from Gauff, who struggled badly from the first game. After her defeat, Gauff walked off the court and destroyed her racket, smashing it more than five times on the floor in the tunnel that connects Rod Laver Arena to the stadium. She later criticised the Australian Open organisers for broadcasting such a private moment.“I don’t think it’s a bad thing,” said Gauff. “I don’t try to do it on court in front of kids and things like that, but I do know I need to let out that emotion. Otherwise, I’m just going to be snappy with the people around me, and I don’t want to do that, because like they don’t deserve it. They did their best. I did mine. Just need to let the frustration out.”View image in fullscreenElina Svitolina celebrates after defeating Coco Gauff  in their quarter-final match at the Australian Open.Photograph: Dita Alangkara/APFrom the beginning, Gauff navigated familiar difficulties with her serve and forehand, serving five double faults five times in the opening set. However, no part of Gauff’s game was functional, not even her trustworthy two-handed backhand. She haemorrhaged unforced errors from all parts of the court, finishing with 26 to only three winners. “I credit it to her because she forced me to play like that,” said Gauff. “It’s not like I just woke up and, yeah, today was a bad day, but bad days are often caused by your opponent. So she did well.”While Gauff looked like a shadow of herself, this result was a testament to the significant improvements Svitolina has made in the second half of her career. She did not put a foot wrong. During the early days of her career, the 31-year-old would have played passively and prayed for her opponents to miss, particularly in the grand slam tournaments when she often struggled. Here, she planted herself on top of the baseline and robbed time from Gauff by taking the ball early, putting the American under constant pressure with her bold aggression.Svitolina also served well, hitting her spots on her first delivery and she continually looked for chances to attack on her forehand, which averaged an immense 78mph halfway through the second set and guided her to a well-deserved victory. “I tried to trust myself, and my coach always tells me that I have to trust myself,” said Svitolina. “When I’m fresh, when I’m mentally ready to face difficult situations, then I can play well. I can be tough on the court.”View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka hits a return against Iva Jovic.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockEarlier, Sabalenka bulldozed the 18-year-old Jovic to continue her run through the draw . She continues to extend one of the great grand slam records of this century. She has now reached the semi-finals in 12 of her past 13 majors, the one anomaly being her grim experience at the French Open in 2024 where she was desperately struggling with food poisoning during her quarter-final defeat against Andreeva. Even then, she only narrowly fell, losing in three tight sets.“When I’m in the tournament, I’m not thinking about that, but sometimes we all stop for a second and we think the level we were able to reach, it sounds really incredible and tough to believe,” Sabalenka said. “For sure, sometimes I just think that it’s unbelievable what I was able to achieve.”Australian Open insulates tennis from extreme heat but still faces million-dollar hitRead moreExplore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenCoco GauffTennisAustralia sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Four continental champions – Arsenal, Gotham FC, Corinthians and AS Far – will meet in Brentford on Wednesday for a place in the final, which will be held at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.With $2.3m (£1.68m) in prize money and a shiny new trophy on the line, it is far from insignificant for the teams involved. For the wider public, however, there remains a lack of understanding about what it really is and how it came to be introduced into an already crowded football space.Michele Kang’s largesse for women’s football leaves Fifa open to bias claims | Tom GarryRead moreThe arrival of this tournament marks Fifa’s first attempt to dip a toe into women’s club football. The quadrennial Women’s Club World Cup, first mooted by Gianni Infantino in 2019, was projected to start this year but was postponed until January 2028.To fill the gap, they brought forward the introduction of this secondary competition that will act as an “annual touch point for clubs across the world” according to Fifa’s director of elite women’s football, Sarah Booth. It will be held every year bar when there is a Women’s Club World Cup and features six confederation champions. The opportunity to see teams who do not normally play each other will be the biggest draw of this competition.In this inaugural edition, Wuhan Chegu Jiangda (AFC Champions League 2024-25 winners) beat Auckland United (OFC Women’s Champions League 2025) in the first round. They then faced AS Far (Caf Women’s Champions League 2025) in the next round in December.The Moroccan champions came through that encounter in dramatic fashion, thanks to Hajar Saïd’s 89th-minute equaliser and Sanaâ Mssoudy’s extra-time winner to set up a semi-final date with Arsenal. The 26-year-old highly decorated forward will be one of the players the Gunners defence need to keep an eye on, having played a key role in the club’s success for the best part of a decade. Safa Banouk is another who is enjoying a strong season.Renée Slegers’ side qualified automatically for the semi-finals after theirChampions League victoryover Barcelona last May. Along with Gotham FC, they will be among the favourites to take the title. While their form has been inconsistent recently, they come into Wednesday’s game off the back of aconfidence-inducing victoryagainst Chelsea.View image in fullscreenJenni Hermoso of Tigres vies with players from Gotham FC during the Concacaf Champions Cup final.Photograph: Jorge Mendoza/APThe NWSL champions, Gotham FC, booked their spot in the tournament after narrowly beating Tigres in the final of the Concacaf Champions Cup. There is no doubt how seriously Juan Carlos Amorós’s side are taking this opportunity despite it happening in the off-season. They have spent the last couple of weeks on a training camp in Spain in order to prepare and possess plenty of world-class experience, including Rose Lavelle, Jaedyn Shaw, Esther González and Ann-Katrin Berger.They take on Corinthians for a place in the final. The São Paulo-based side have won five consecutive Brazilian titles. Their penalty shootout victory over Deportivo Calí saw them win their fourth successive Copa Libertadores to qualify. Andressa Alves, Duda Sampaio and Tamires are among their household names back in Brazil while Jhonson and Victória were in fine goalscoring form.“I do think the actual product will be compelling,” Jill Ellis, Fifa’s chief football officer, said. “So many players that play club football who don’t play for the national teams have never played against international competition before … I think there’s going to be some interest.”“People have to understand that we’re growing this … so I think we’re excited to want to push for a high level but also a little bit realistic. We had a short runway. We’re trying to get this off the ground, but I think ultimately it will be a compelling product.”The “short runway” was a reason why the venues for finals week were only announced in December, partnerships are still being announced and why the prize money was only confirmed on Friday. It also explains why the tournament has perhaps passed under the radar.Meanwhile, controversies remain. One strong point of contention is the ongoing scheduling issue. England’s WSL Football said that the 2028 Women’s Club World Cup set to be played from 5-30 January“could be catastrophic”despite Fifa saying they had consulted key stakeholders. While a separate tournament, it only adds to the increased feeling that the calendar is already overcrowded at the top level. Another source of debate came when they announced that Kynisca, Michele Kang’s multi-club ownership organisation, would be a presenting partner of the inaugural tournament,raising potential conflicts of interest.Those debates will no doubt rumble on but for this week, at least, the focus will turn to the action on the pitch. With the unknown comes the potential for new narratives and stories to be told and, at the end of it all, there will be a new champion, a chance for a club to claim that they are the best team in the world, for a short while at least.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Last week, the company published an 80-page “constitution” for Claude in which it set out how it wanted to make its AI “broadly safe, broadly ethical”.Amodei co-founded Anthropic in 2021 along with other former staff members from OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT. A prominent voice for online safetyknown for warning consistentlyof the dangers of unrestrained AI development, he wrote that the world was “considerably closer to real danger” in 2026 than it had been in 2023, when the debate over existential risk from AIraced up the political agenda.He alluded to the controversy over sexualised deepfakes created by Elon Musk’s Grok AI thatflooded the social media platform Xover Christmas and the new year, including warnings that the chatbot wascreating child sexual abuse material.Amodei wrote: “Some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualisation of children in today’s models, which makes me doubt that they’ll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models.”View image in fullscreenCEO and co-founder of Anthropic, Dario Amodei.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe Anthropic CEO said powerful AI systems that could autonomously build their own systems could be as little as one to two years away.He defined “powerful AI” as a model that was smarter than a Nobel prizewinner across fields such as biology, mathematics, engineering and writing. It could give or take directions to or from humans, and although it “lived” on a computer screen it could control robots and even design them for its own use.While acknowledging that powerful AIs could be “considerably further out” than the two-year timeframe, Amodei said recent rapid progress made by the technology should be taken seriously.“If the exponential continues – which is not certain, but now has a decade-long track record supporting it – then it cannot possibly be more than a few years before AI is better than humans at essentially everything,” he wrote.Last year, Amodei warned that AI couldhalve the number of entry-level white-collar jobsand send overall unemployment rocketing to 20% within the next five years.In his essay, Amodei cautioned that the economic prize from AI, such as productivity gains from eliminating jobs, could be so great that no one applied the brakes.“This is the trap: AI is so powerful, such a glittering prize, that it is very difficult for human civilisation to impose any restraints on it at all,” he said.However, Amodei stated he was optimistic about a positive conclusion. “I believe if we act decisively and carefully, the risks can be overcome – I would even say our odds are good. And there’s a hugely better world on the other side of it. But we need to understand that this is a serious civilisational challenge.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingTechnology startupsTechnology sectorProductivitynewsShareReuse this content"

Simply pointing a phone’s camera at their intended target and scanning the person’s face allows Mobile Fortify to pull data on an individual from multiple federal and state databases, some of whichfederal courts have deemed too inaccuratefor arrest warrants.The US Department of Homeland Security has used Mobile Fortify to scan faces and fingerprints in the field more than 100,000 times, according to alawsuitbrought by Illinois and Chicago against the federal agency, earlier this month. That’s a drastic shift from immigration enforcement’s earlier use of facial recognition technology, which was otherwise limited largely to investigations and ports of entry and exit, legal experts say.The app’s existence wasfirst uncovered last summer by 404 Media, through leaked emails. 404 Media also reported, in October, aboutinternal DHS documentsthat say people cannot refuse to be scanned by Mobile Fortify.“Here we have ICE using this technology in exactly the confluence of conditions that lead to the highest false match rates,” says Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s speech, privacy and technology project. “A false result from this technology can turn somebody’s life totally upside down.” The larger implications for democracy are chilling, too, he notes: “ICE is effectively trying to create a biometric checkpoint society.”Use of the app has inspired backlash on the streets, in courts, and on Capitol Hill.Protesters are using a variety of tactics to fight back. They include recording masked agents, using burner phones and donated dashboard cameras, according tothe Washington Post.Underpinning resistance to ICE’s use of facial recognition are doubts about the technology’s efficacy. Research has uncoveredhigher error rates in identifying women and people of colorthan for scans of white faces. ICE’s use of the technology is often occurring in intense and fast-moving situations, which makes misidentification more likely. Those being scanned may be people of color. They could be turning away from officers because they don’t want to be identified. The lighting could be poor.The Illinois lawsuit against the DHS takes particular issue with the federal agency’s use of Mobile Fortify and argued that the app goes far beyond what Congress allows with regards to the collection of biometric data. The complaint cited several examples in which federal agents appeared to take photos or scans of US citizens across Illinois without their consent.Democratic lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill on 15 January that would outright ban the homeland security department from using Mobile Fortify or similar apps, except for identification at points of entry. This follows aSeptember letter, sent by senators to ICE, asking for more information about the app and declaring that “even when accurate, this type of on-demand surveillance threatens the privacy and free speech rights of everyone in the United States”.The DHS said in a statement that Mobile Fortify does not violate constitutional rights or compromise privacy. “It operates with a deliberately high matching threshold and queries only limited CBP immigration datasets. The application does not access open-source material, scrape social media, or rely on publicly available data,” a spokesperson said.According to404 Media, the app’s database consists of some 200m images. “Mobile Fortify has not been blocked, restricted, or curtailed by the courts or by legal guidance. It is lawfully used nationwide in accordance with all applicable legal authorities.”Observers, experts, andat least one congressmanhave said federal immigration agents frequently do not ask for consent to scan a person’s face – and may dismiss other documentation that contradicts this data. ICEhas been documentedusing biometrics as a definitive determination of someone’s citizenship in the absence of identification.This means that ICE is not required to conduct additional vetting of facial scans or checks to avoid a misidentification. 404 Mediareported earlier this monththat Mobile Fortify misidentified a detained woman during an immigration raid; the app came up with two different and incorrect names.“Facial recognition – to the extent it should be used at all – is really supposed to be a starting point,” says Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the security and surveillance project at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT). “If you treat this as an endpoint – as a definitive ID – you’re going to have errors, and you’re going to end up arresting and jailing people that are not actually who the machine says it is.”Laperruque says that even police departments across the country havepushed backagainst an over-reliance on facial recognition, treating it as a lead, at most. Atleast 15states are cautious about using it all, and have laws limiting police’s use of the technology. In 2019, San Francisco became the first major US city to ban facial recognition technology by police and all other local government agencies.The DHS issued a directive in September 2023 requiring that the bureau test the technology for unintended bias and offer US citizens the choice to opt out of scans not conducted by law enforcement. That directive appeared to be rescinded in February last year.ICE’s stops – whether they involve face-scanning or not – have been subject to litigation as well. They have often been referred to as “Kavanaugh stops” after the supreme court justice wrote in a concurring opinion that Hispanic residents’“apparent ethnicity” can be a “relevant factor”for ICE to stop them and demand for proof of citizenship. The ACLU sued the Trump administrationearlier this month, accusing federal immigration authorities of racial profiling and unlawful arrests.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyFacial recognitionICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)featuresShareReuse this content"

Meta said the money had been allocated to the Alan Turing Institute before any ban was floated.Announcing the $1m deal, Meta said it was “proud to help bring top British AI talent into government, fast-tracking the transformation of public services”.DSIT said: “People across the UK could benefit from faster, safer and more reliable public services as leading British AI specialists join government to modernise critical systems used every day – from public safety to transport maintenance.”But the tech justice campaign group Foxglove asked: “What’s Meta getting for its million dollars?” It added: “When it comes to big tech, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.”‘Wake up to the risks of AI, they are almost here,’ Anthropic boss warnsRead more“This is yet more evidence of the UK government’s alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants,” said Donald Campbell, Foxglove’s advocacy director. “It’s deeply worrying that ministers are still naive enough to swallow this kind of lobbying from a handful of Silicon Valley plutocrats – who have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt they do not have the British public’s best interests at heart.”Daisy Greenwell, a co-founder of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, said the deal “highlights an uncomfortable reality: tech giants spend vast sums to gain access and influence in policymaking”.She added: “That makes it even more important that decisions about children and online safety are shaped by independent evidence and the public interest, not by the companies whose products are under scrutiny.”The government also announced a new partnership with the San Francisco AI company Anthropic, which will build and pilot a dedicated assistant tool for public services on gov.uk, starting with a model that will give jobseekers career advice “and help to lock down a job”. Anthropic said the project implementation work was “pro bono”.DSIT said the technology was “part of a cutting-edge plan to use AI agents for national government services, with a pilot expected to begin later this year”. In October, Anthropic announced that the former prime minister Rishi Sunak wastaking an advisory roleat the$350bn startup. The former Downing Street chief of staff Liam Booth-Smith is a policy and communications adviser to Anthropic.The deals come as ministers wrestle with policy decisions that directly affect Meta and Anthropic. As well as launching a consultation last week on banning social media use for under-16s, they are also due to set out changes to how creatives’ copyrighted works are protected from being mined to build AI models, such as those made by Anthropic.Beeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer who campaigns on child protection and copyright, said: “This government is walking into dependence on Silicon Valley, is undermining the chance to build a UK AI sector, and above all is busy giving away some of the most precious datasets in the world to Silicon Valley, who could well afford to pay.”The Meta-funded AI experts will be tasked with using AI to develop models that analyse images and videos, enabling councils to prioritise transport infrastructure repairs more effectively. They will also “develop cutting-edge AI solutions which run offline or within secured networks to support national security and defence teams to make vital decisions while safeguarding sensitive data”, the government said.Explore more on these topicsMetaAI (artificial intelligence)Social mediaInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

Newsom’s accusation on Monday came as a number of users on TikTok reported abnormalities and accused the platform of censoring their posts.Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Law, said a video he recorded about reports federal immigration officers could use sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant had been placed “under review”.Casey Fiesler, an expert in technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado told CNN it was “not surprising that there’s a significant lack of trust” in TikTok’s new ownership. She told the outlet that she had problems uploading videos that alluded to the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.Last week’sTikTok deal was a milestonefor the firm after years of battles with the US government over Washington’s concerns about risks to national security and privacy under Trump and former President Joe Biden.ByteDance said TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC would secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures,in a deal praised by Trump.With more than 16 million followers on his personal TikTok account, Trump credited the app with helping him win the 2024 election.The deal provides for American and global investors to hold 80.1% of the venture while ByteDance will own 19.9%.Each of the joint venture’s three managing investors, cloud computing giant Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, will hold a stake of 15%.The US and Chinese governments had signed off on the deal, a White House official said.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsTikTokGavin NewsomDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowedTeslato thrive.AI at DavosWhen they weren’t discussingDonald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.Up and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”At the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI willblanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.MeanwhileGooglewas showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.Away from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.In an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.Nadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.Just drama and dreams: AI companies without products still score billionsView image in fullscreenMira Murati, ex-chief technology officer of OpenAI Inc, during an interview on The Circuit with Emily Chang in San Francisco, California, on 4 April 2023.Photograph: Philip Pacheco/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as theWall Street Journalput it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.As dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.Thinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.The massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled inthe New York Timeslast week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, anugly website– and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.Humans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.Whatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.Teslas in Texas: the hands-off legislation of hands-free drivingView image in fullscreenA Tesla robotaxi drives on the street along South Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas, on 22 June 2025.Photograph: Joel Angel Juarez/ReutersMusk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.What Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state.“Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.Also surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.“Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”Meanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process ofconsidering new rulesthat could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the companydid not have authorizationto operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterDavos 2026AI (artificial intelligence)TeslaComputingElon MusknewslettersShareReuse this content"

Traditionally, international tourists start to arrive with the blossoms in spring – but thanks to the opening of Pokémon’s first ever amusement park on 5 February, this year, they are likely to come earlier.Unlike the rollercoaster-filled thrills of Tokyo Disney Sea or Universal StudiosJapanin Osaka, PokéPark Kanto is essentially a forest populated by models of the creatures from the perennially popular games. Nestled in the quiet Tokyo suburb of Inagi, half an hour from the city centre, the park is a walkable forest with more than 600 Pokémonin it. Where the Mario-themed Super Nintendo World slots neatly into the massive Universal Studios Japan, PokéPark Kanto is hidden in the back of the less glitzy, funfair-esque Japanese theme park Yomiuri Land.Taking up 26,000 sq metres, the family-friendly attraction is divided into two main areas: Pokémon Forest and the plaza-esque Sedge Town. Tickets for the park are bought via a lottery system – and currently sold out for the next three months – ranging between ¥7,900 (£38) for a standard adult ticket and ¥14,000 (£66) for a queue-skipping priority pass.The park’s creative direction has been overseen by one of the original Pokémon creators, Junichi Masuda. Visitors roam a series of explorable habitats, littered with endearingly lifelike statues of hundreds of Pokémon, arranged in fun tableaus where various species are interacting with each other. Walking through PokéPark Kanto feels akin to becoming a Pokédex-clutching David Attenborough, a re-creation of what it would be like to observe these fantastical creatures in the wild. Beaver-esque Bidoofs use their two front teeth to cut down a real tree. Worm-like Diglett burrow above the soil to greet a smiling Eevee.Each Pokémon is presented in full scale too, making the larger creatures especially awe-inspiring. From a lorry-sized re-creation of the rocky behemoth Onix to a herd of rhinoceros-sized Rhyhorns lining the main path, each habitat is a joy to behold, with hidden creatures dotted throughout the trees and grass as a reward for eagle-eyed kids.View image in fullscreenEach Pokémon is presented in full scale … PokéPark Kanto.Illustration: PoképarkIn many ways, it’s surprising it has taken this long for a permanent Pokémon theme park to be erected. With Pikachu and pals celebrating their 30th anniversary this year, Pokémon is still comfortably the highest-grossing media brand in the world: its total estimated lifetime revenue of $150bn comfortably surpasses Disney properties such as Star Wars and Marvel. The Pokémon company’s profit rose to ¥70.3bn in the year ending February 2025 – roughly £337m – and with a range of new games, merchandise and the new theme park, its profits in 2026 are only likely to increase.After clearing the Pokémon forest, visitors are greeted by a Pokémon parade in Sedge Town square, where there are also Pokémon-themed versions of fairground games such as ring toss, Pokémon-themed food, and an Eevee-themed carousel. Visitors can also walk into a real-life Pokémon Centre (an iconic building from the games and anime) and grab a seat at a gym where they can watch a live Pokémon battle that blends human performers with cutting-edge animatronics.The Pokémon Company has numerous Pokémon Centre shops all over Japan selling exclusive merchandise. PokéPark Kanto will continue this lucrative trend, selling plushies and clothing that people will have to travel there to own. Video games are huge business in Japan, one of the country’s main cultural exports – but theme parks based on the country’s virtual stars are a newer phenomenon. Since Super Nintendo World first opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in 2021, it has been transplanted to Universal’s parks in Hollywood and Florida, with all locations helping to drivemulti-billion dollar quarterly revenues.Thanks to a weak yen post-pandemic, recent years have seen tourists flock to Japan. While it has been a boon to the economy, the flood of incomers has led to tension. Fromphone-camera-weilding influencers behaving badly, to overcrowded streets inconveniencing locals, the 42 million visitors who arrived in Japan in 2025 have come alongsidea notable nationwide rise in anti-foreigner sentiment. Newly appointed prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is already doubling down on anti-tourist legislation. It’s safe to say that PokéPark Kanto, with its family-friendly international appeal, will only increase visitors to Japan’s overcrowded capital.Explore more on these topicsGamesPokémonTheme parksJapannewsShareReuse this content"

But one faithful stood out for her quiet determination, despite a ceaseless onslaught of suspicion and accusation. That person was Jade Scott, and I wasn’t at all surprised when, quite early on in the series, she revealed she was a keen gamer.“Minecraft was my way in, when I was 15,” she says. “I made loads of friends at school playing that.” From this innocent introduction, however, she moved on to darker titles: the first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and the multiplayer battle-arena game Dota. “That’s where my interest in strategy gaming really kicked in,” she says.The Traitors is, after all, a game in a way that other reality TV shows aren’t. It’s heavily inspired by the parlour game variously known as werewolf or mafia, in which participants use social deduction skills to identify a murderer in their midst. Indeed, the original version of the show, the Dutch series De Verraders, emerged after the first Covid lockdown, during which hundreds of thousands of people had discovered the multiplayer online game Among Us, in which a group of players have to carry out menial tasks on a spaceship while working out which of them is a killer. So a video game player would have an advantage in The Traitors, right?View image in fullscreenSurvival adventure … Project Winter.Photograph: Other Ocean InteractiveIn the year up to appearing on the show Scott had been playing two indie games based around social deduction: the survival adventure Project Winter and the office satire, Dale & Dawson Stationery Supplies. Both require groups of players to carry out a range of tasks in a high-tension environment, while a select few are there to sabotage progress. The honest workers must discover and unmask the miscreants before it’s too late. She was, effectively, in training to be a faithful.“I always wanted to go in as a faithful,” she confirms. “My opinion has changed on this since leaving the castle, but I always thought the game was way harder for the faithfuls and I like playing games on a harder setting. As a faithful you’re trying to solve who the traitors are, but as a traitor, I thought you lost out on that puzzle-solving aspect. My strategy was to go in and immediately garnersomesuspicion, because that way you’re protected from murder … I just didn’t realise how much suspicion I would get!”Indeed, Scott was a constant target of accusations and suspicion. It was difficult. With gaming, you sit behind a screen, and communicating via Discord, so you just start talking and build friendly relationships with people, but with The Traitors, you have nothing to hide behind. It was a very different environment in which to think about strategy and how I communicate with people.”So did the tactics she’d learned playing games such as Project Winter and Dale & Dawson immediately fall apart? “I was quite good at defending myself at the roundtable,” she says. “A lot of that came out of the practice I got with social deception games. The second you approach the table with some logic and reasoning, and say, ‘I understand why you think that, but I have done nothing to suggest it’, they have nothing to argue with. I also didn’t feel I had anything to prove to anyone – I think, when you’re on the defensive, it makes it worse if you go around and try to mingle. I was thinking, if I go up and speak to this person does it just look like I’m trying to get in their good books?”View image in fullscreenConstant target … Jade Scott (third from left, top) at the roundtable in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAOne aspect Scott definitely took from playing strategy sims was observing the mechanics of the game and making notes. “I had different formats,” she says. “Every day I had a sort of traffic light system of how I felt about each person. Green indicated who I thought was a faithful, although you’re never 100 per cent sure – and inevitably those people would just get murdered! Red was who I was more convinced was a traitor at that point. I also wrote everyone’s names on a piece of paper and then I’d draw lines between them, based on who I saw having conversations – a bit like those cork boards TV detectives use, with the red lines between photos. I’ve alluded to this previously, but I’d stare and stare at that page and the only contestants I hadn’t drawn lines between were Rachel and Stephen. I was so busy working out ways to defend myself … you just miss the obvious, don’t you?”The Traitors to get ‘bold and surprising’ adaptation for stageRead moreSince leaving The Traitors castle, Scott says she hasn’t played a social deduction game – perhaps she’s done with fielding other people’s suspicions. Now she’s moved on to games such as Outer Wilds and Blue Prince, which pitch you against strange puzzling environments rather than other human beings. There’s been another interesting effect of her time on The Traitors, though. Currently studying for a PhD, she thinks her experiences at the sharp end of the roundtable have been extremely useful for one particular aspect. “Something I’ve been really apprehensive about, and I think a lot of PhD students are the same, is the viva,” she says. “You literally sit in a room with examiners and have to defend your thesis. Well, I’ve really learned how to defend myself and argue a point!”Explore more on these topicsGamesTelevisionThe TraitorsSimulation gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We used to have a name for thisMarina HydeTruly, I am the country’s biggest fan. But in the spirit of free speech its leaders apparently love, here’s a few things the rest of the world needs them to knowTue 27 Jan 2026 08.43 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareWe in the rest of the world have had to hear a lot –sucha lot – about what this US government and its hardcore fanbase thinks about us. So you know they’ll be super-relaxed and free-speechy about hearing some thoughts about how they look from the outside. Let’s use last Saturday as a single snapshot. In Minneapolis, they had the shooting by ICE agents of a protesting nurse who posed no threat – an event promptly, provably and blatantly lied about at the highest level by Donald Trump’s politburo. Then that evening in Washington, a lot of those same politburocratsturned out for the White House premiereof a ridiculous propaganda film about the president’s wife, also attended fawningly by bloodless Apple oligarch Tim Cook. And he’s not even the oligarch who paid an insane amount for the film. Top line, guys: all this makes you look like what your president likes to call a “shithole country”. Sorry! I assume it’s fine to use officially licensed vocabulary?Obviously, it’s not a proper shithole country until the soft-skinned puppetmasters in the presidential palace cut some grizzled local warlord off at the knees for following orders, so it’s good to learn overnight that border patrol “commander at large” Gregory Bovino has beenpulled out of Minneapolis, possibly locked out of his social media accounts, and may soon “retire”, presumably a fall guy for the likes of stage 4 homeland security tumour Stephen Miller. Bovino’s the guy who’s literally got the same haircut and outfit as the Sean Penn character in One Battle After Another. But hey, at least he wears a uniform. Again, what are international outsiders to make of the spectacle of ICE’s federal officers coming masked and frequently dressed in civilian clothes, while images from protests across the States show resisting civilians increasingly drawn to military-style clothing? Can Trump’s storm detachment not at least be issued with matching shirts? They don’t have to be brown, but Maga chic desperately needs to make even a first step to getting itself together. In the entire history of the movement, only one follower –the QAnon shaman– has ever had true style.With death threats being the sign of a deeply articulate and sophisticated political culture, I have cleared my inbox to make space for them. But I should say I have always truly loved America. I’ve visited 38 of its great states in my time, and always dreamed of completing the set, but … not currently, let’s be honest. I note US tourism is currentlyexperiencing a downturnin visitors from previously enthusiastic markets. Who among us can imagine why? Still, no doubt numbers from Nato countries in Europe will rally if Trump (a five-time draft dodger) continues topiss on their military graves. Reminder: Nato has activated its collective defence clause precisely once since its inception – at the request of the United States, in the wake of 9/11. Our troops fought and died in all their stoopid wars – but now, apparently, we have to listen to Trump’s whiny little rants about how nobody really put themselves on the line.Anyway, back to the events of Saturday and their fallout. Hard to pick the most mindboggling reaction to the shooting of Alex Pretti, who never produced the gun he was carrying, for which he had a licence, before it was taken off him. But there’s a strong argument for going for the statement from the National Rifle Association, which reacted to all the Maga zealots saying Pretti was always likely to have been shot for legally carrying a gun he had a licence for bythundering backthat carrying a licensed gun is famously constitutionally allowed, and calling for a full investigation into the killing. Maybe Trump’s base are now more rightwing than the NRA? Or more leftwing, I can’t tell. Are Maga now too woke on gun control for the NRA? Such are the sentences one can end up typing when we’re this far through the looking-glass.Speaking of the political upside-down, Saturday’s other notable event was the Melania premiere at the White House, which, though flowing with champagne, was in some ways as grotesquely down and dirty as the scenes in Minneapolis. Consider the guests, which included the usual regime stalwarts but also, intriguingly, Tim Cook. Days before, Cook had been posting on one of the other oligarchs’ platforms about Martin Luther King’s “commitment to justice”, only to watch videos of Pretti’s execution proliferate across that same platform, but still pop on his bow tie and toddle off toclink glassesat the premiere. Melania is the forthcoming “documentary” about the president’s wife, for which she serves as executive producer and has been paid an unspecified sum, while the entire thing has been bought by Jeff Bezos’s Amazon for $40m (£30m) – a sum so staggeringly beyond whatsuch a film should cost, by so many orders of magnitude, that it can only be read as a naked gift to the regime. A further $35m has been spent on marketing for its preposterous theatrical release.But I guess that as the OGs in Russia have shown us, oligarchs have to take their turn to do expensive things, just so they can stay in the gang. At least they’re getting something out of it. Much more tragic are the ordinary-folks footsoldiers dutifully coming out to defend the ICE shooting. I can barely think of anything more beaten than spending the day typing variations on the theme of “it is good that law enforcement officers in my country shoot civilians who are no threat”. What a bunch of bootlickers. They might be too far gone to see it, but much of the rest of the world can.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionTrump administrationUS politicsMinneapolisTim CookMinnesota ICE shootingscommentShareReuse this content"

Being ugly is a lot easierDave SchillingThe internet has enabled a golden age of techno-vanity. But hating your looks is a time-honored traditionTue 27 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 11.03 ESTShareTake a second before you read this to look in the mirror. Go on, it’ll be worth it. I’ll be here when you get back.OK, how’d that go? Did you like what you saw? Probably not. Feeling a bit puffy? See a zit in a conspicuous area? Did you want to punch yourself for the sin of experiencing the natural course of ageing? These feelings are normal. Being disappointed in how you look is a time-honored tradition; it’s just that now, we have the means to fix all that. GLP-1s mean you can lose weight quickly, without doing much more than shoving a needle in your bum a few times a month. Plastic surgery, Botox, fillers, Turkish hair plugs. We live in the golden age of techno-vanity, where “self-improvement” can be had for a few bucks (and days and days of living in bandages like a hipster mummy). The odious trend of “looksmaxxing” is the natural nadir of our collective obsession with not being ugly.Within the fetid petri dish that we call the internet, looksmaxxing has taken hold with a subsection of otherwise functioning individuals. To be a looksmaxxer is to purposefully carve up your face, inject steroids into any willing orifice, and occasionally using crystal meth to suppress your appetite. This is not as appealing as it sounds, folks, because it also comes with a healthy dose of racism!It’s bad enough that someone is compelled to smash their own jaw to look likeBruce Campbell in the movie Escape from LA, but doing it because you want to embody some fictional European ideal is the cherry on top of the turd. Don’t be surprised if a feature of extreme physical manipulation ends up being eugenics. It’s not just about racial homogeny, though. It’s also about heights of bodily perfection that require, again,using crystal meth.One of the most prominent influencers in the looksmaxxing community is 19-year-old Braden Peters, who refers to himself unironically as “Clavicular”. Remember when nicknames sounded cool? What happened to all the “Dukes” or “Jimbos”? I would take a “Clem” any day of the week at this point.Peters referred to Vice-President JD Vance as “subhuman” (don’t blame me, I didn’t say it) on a recent Daily Wire podcast. Peters, who only recently became old enough to vote, claimed he’d vote for Gavin Newsom over Vance in the 2028 presidential election because Newsom is tall and classically handsome. I sort of understand the perspective. I voted for John Edwards in the 2004 primary because of thecrossing-guard helmet he called his hair.Besides the obvious absurdity of this phenomenon, there’s the very depressing idea that anyone is listening to what a19-year-oldhas to say about anything. It’s been said that the children are our future, but the operative word is “future”. The future is not right now. It’s hopefully at least 20 years from now, when I’m even older and uglier.The attention economy of the internet has meant that people are taking advice from someone too young to rent a car. I have an eight-year-old and I don’t ask him for advice on anything. He only eats chicken nuggets and wears Crocs every day. He can’t even tie his own shoes, but if I gave him a YouTube channel and he got 500,000 subscribers, he might convince an entire generation to walk around barefoot.I do wonder what all this digital insanity will do to my kid’s brain one day. Will he start demolishing his own jawline in order to better resembleDolph Lundgren? Will he hand out meth at cocktail parties? I suppose the best I can do is model a different sort of masculinity for him – a masculinity that involves being the naturally hideous troll that we are all destined to become. We are given one life to live, and I don’t intend to spend it chasing a mythical sense of aesthetic perfection. I’d rather read books, see films, go bald and gain weight in all the worst places. Realuncbehavior.Being ugly is also easier. Trying to chase perfection is difficult, requires thousands and thousands of dollars of disposable income, and hurts quite a bit. Plus, it’s unfulfilling, because that sort of perfection is not actually possible. It also seems to involve more drugs than I’m willing to experiment with. Life is frustrating enough without adding someone taking a hammer to your face on a semi-regular basis to the regimen. It seems the only benefit to all of that effort is getting attention on social media, a pursuit I outgrew along with my skinny jeans and the music of the Arcade Fire. Besides, history shows us that ugly people have been in control of the world for most of its existence. No one was asking Napoleon to pose for the “Dictators of the Month” calendar. Churchill looked like a bald mole that just saw sunlight for the first time. All the energy spent making yourself conventionally attractive could be better spent making positive change in the world, creating great art, and also sleeping.This is the legacy I want to pass down to my child: loving, living, and periodically passing out in front of the TV because you ate a very heavy sandwich. That form of perfection is a lot closer than you think.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsFashionOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

It’s like a free-floating focus group.On Monday morning, I was at a restaurant counter finishing my breakfast when a middle-aged man sat down next to me and said he didn’t want to intrude. (He just had, so I put down my knife and fork, wiped my mouth with my napkin, and turned toward him.) He wanted me to know that although he’d been a lifelong Republican, the events of the past weeks had caused him to leave the Republican party.“I’m happy to hear that,” I said with a smile, and turned to finish my breakfast.“I’m from New Hampshire and many of my Republican friends are leaving the party, too,” he said. “Minneapolis was the last straw.”I put down my fork and turned toward him again. “I assume you’re talking about the behavior of ICE and border patrol agents there, and the killings?”Masked government thugs snuffed out Alex Pretti’s life in broad daylight | Moira DoneganRead more“All terrible, of course,” he said, shaking his head. “But what really finished me were the lies – Noem. Miller, Bovino, Vance, Trump.” He frowned. “They lied through their teeth. I saw the videos! Can’t trust them ever again. None of them. Pack of liars.”I agreed and then excused myself, explaining I had to finish my breakfast and get to an appointment.But his words stuck with me.There are two ways to look at what’s happened in Minneapolis – two different tipping points for America.The first is to see the nation tipping more deeply into Trump’s fascist police state. ICE and the border patrol have become vehicles of state terror. They’re engaged in extrajudicial killings with apparent impunity.The tipping began with Trump’spurging of federal prosecutorswho tried to hold him accountable for his attempted coup. It continued with his pardons of the January 6 rioters, pardons of his allies and wealthy friends, his criminalprosecutions of James Comey and Letitia Jamesand thecriminal investigation of Jerome Powell.Now, we’re full tilt with the Trump regime’s occupation of Minneapolis by inadequately trained, trigger-happy goons with rifles and in riot gear – who have bullied, beaten and killed residents. And the regime’simpeding of a state investigation into the killings, itswildly false accusations about the victims, and its claim,since walked back, that federal agents responsible for the killings have total immunity from prosecution.But there’s a second way to see what’s happened in Minnesota – a tipping point of a different kind. The fellow from New Hampshire who sat next to me at breakfast typifies it.It’s a tipping point toward mass revulsion over Trump and the people around him.To be sure, the Republican party in America has been in a death spiral since Trump emerged in 2016; it’s held together chiefly by Trump’s lies.But his latest lies – and those of his surrounding sycophants – are so blatant and disgusting that some, like my breakfast companion, are abandoning the GOP altogether.It’s also a tipping point toward Americans coming together to defeat Trump’s fascism. Coming together as they’ve come together in Minneapolis – across race, class and ethnicity.I hear from friends and former students in Minneapolis about the extraordinary outpouring there of cooperation and mutual aid. Residents participating in neighborhood watches. Messaging about where agents are lurking. Taking videos of ICE’s atrocities and sharing them widely.They’re organizing deliveries of food and other necessities to families afraid to leave their homes. Picking up groceries for immigrant families. Standing guard outside a local mosque during Friday prayers. Driving vulnerable families to doctor’s appointments. Driving immigrant kids to school.One friend tells me he’s lived in Minneapolis for 40 years and has never felt the city as closely bound together. “I think we’ve discovered the real meaning of community,” he wrote.A former student says that despite the sub-zero weather, he and everyone he knows have been involved in organizing against ICE and for one another. “This goes far deeper than a protest,” he says. “It’s a new way to live here.”This isn’t limited to Minneapolis. I’m hearing from friends and former students across America who are seeing something similar where they live.“You wouldn’t believe how this community has come together,” writes an old friend from Portland, Maine. “I’ve lived here for more than 20 years and don’t recall a time when we felt as united.”Both tipping points may be true. We’re tipping into Trump’s fascist police state at the same time as we’re tipping into a new era of solidarity. The second may be the consequence of the first.All I can say with any confidence is that the events of the last weeks are changing America profoundly.What comes next?I don’t buy the predictions of a second civil war. I think Americans are better than that. If polls are to be believed, most oppose the way Trump has been implementing his immigration policies. Most don’t accept his fascist police state.America may be tipping into that police state, nonetheless.But we’re also tipping into unity against it. We’re moving into a solidarity that could give new meaning to the ideal of self-government – a system of, by, and for the people.I’d like to believe the second tipping point will outlast the first.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Fans would miss out on seeing the sport’s pinnacle in their home towns (or somewhere nearby). Cities and businesses small and large would lose the financial benefits they had banked on. It would be a logistical and political nightmare on an international scale, the likes of which have never been seen before in sports. It would be eminently sad. And it would be entirely justified.It brings me no pleasure to say this. The United States has been eager to host a men’s World Cup for more than a decade and a half. The desire survived and even grew after 2010’s failure to out-bid Russia and Qatar (in public and behind closed doors) for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. With hosting rights for 2026 later secured alongside Canada and Mexico, the US soccer scene prepared to show off that the sport is now part of the nation’s fabric, 32 years after hosting the tournament for the first time in 1994. Soccer’s growing popularity in America has helped inspireother US sportsto try new formats, encouraged us to engage more fully with the world in a sporting context, and has been at the center of conversations about our society and culture. The 2026 World Cup was seen as the best chance for the world to fully experience not just how much the US has improved at soccer, but how much soccer has improved the US.Sepp Blatter suggests fans should not travel to US for World CupRead moreI have not been immune to this Pollyannaish outlook. Much of my career covering American soccer has been predicated on the idea that the sport will continue to growin the US. The 2026 World Cup is central to that hope. I can admit that I have a vested interest in this tournament’s success. As a lifelong fan, the World Cup landing here was a dream come true. As a professional, I hoped it would create millions of new North American soccer fans who will want to read and watch and listen to journalism about the sport for the rest of their lives.Perhaps I was naive. The tournament may create some of those fans, but at what cost?Exorbitant ticket priceshavecut outthe game’sgrassroots.Onerous demandson cities have siphoned public money. Fifa hasboostedanopenly corrupt administrationat every turn. Nowwanton federal violencehas made it difficult to justify having the World Cup here at all. Safety, justice, freedom, the continued functioning of society – these are all under threat. Even to many soccer fans in the US, the game once called “the most important of the least important things” now seems just plain unimportant.Federal agentshave killed two innocent peoplein Minneapolis in the last three weeks. Neither was threatening the paramilitary forces who shot them. We know these things because we have seen them play out on video after sickening video, from multiple angles, slowed down and refocused and analysed. Yet the most senior governmental figures want us to believe that Renee Good and Alex Pretti were “domestic terrorists”. That they were, in fact the aggressors – in cold contrast to the mountain of available evidence. It would be reasonable to assume that those who disregard the truth so blatantly can also not be trusted to host a safe and secure World Cup.And then there is the wider picture.Thirty-two people diedin US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2025 alone.The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to tracking US gun violence, reports that immigration officers shot at people 19 times since the start of the crackdown – figures it assumes are an undercount. These include three killings in 2025, now up to at least five with the Minnesota deaths. Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has resulted inmore detentions of people with no criminal recordthan any other category – despite its stated aim of ridding the country of criminals and claimed successes in doing so. The raids resulting in all of this have largely targeted Democratic-leaning metro areas – which 10 of the 11 US World Cup host cities are (the Dallas metroplex being the one outlier). Yet “the most important message that football can convey right now is one of peace and unity,” Fifa president Gianni Infantino said last year.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino holds the World Cup trophy as he attends the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersHow can soccer do that when its showpiece event is in a country led by an administration intent on division? A country that has captured a foreign leader,possibly in violation of international law. A country thathas threatened supposed allieswith military action over control of a foreign territory. A country that has picked seemingly endless fights, including with its World Cup cohosts – the very countries it’s meant to be standing alongside and welcoming the world’s soccer fans.Are these the actions of a safe country, prepared to handle an influx of foreign visitors? Is this the kind of place you’d expect someone would want to spend many thousands of dollars to visit, even before they’ve ponied up for the games themselves? I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but Isympathise with Sepp Blatteron this one.There have beendiscussions of a boycottin some form; a mild clamor, if that. If that actually happens among enough countries, Fifa’s hand could be forced. But as justified as that would be, that’s hard to even imagine. Holding World Cups in autocratic or destructive countries is nothing new. A boycott would mean revenue lost and a schedule that will be near-impossible to reconfigure. And there’s a feeling at soccer’s highest levels that, no matter which government Fifa cosies up to, the sport itself will escape unscathed.“With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them,” Concacaf president Victor Montagliani said last year at a conference. “Football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.”But in the meantime, football’s main event is at least partly under this administration’s control. Trump himselfsaid last yearthat if cities are deemed to be too dangerous, or otherwise unfit for hosting, “We’re going to move the event to some place where it’s going to be appreciated and safe.”Trump, of course, meant moving World Cup matches to other US cities. But it would be hard to argue if the World Cup was moved out of the US entirely.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And while the Howard government also typically held leads over Labor on national security and immigration, the foundation of their electoral success was its differentiation from Labor on economic management which was the most salient issue among swing voters.In the last Australian Financial Review opinion poll conducted by RedBridge Group and Accent Research in December 2025, only 19% of voters believed the then Coaliton was the best party to deal with cost of living and housing affordability, which are currently the two most important vote drivers in the electorate.Sussan Ley has two factors working in her favour as rumours of a Liberal leadership mutiny swirlRead moreIf it’s going to be competitive again, the focus of a reformed Coalition needs to be on repairing its performance numbers on economic management and housing.A good place to start is by looking at what John Hewson started and John Howard and Peter Costello finished: recovering from its 1980s dysfunction by unifying around a singular organising principle on economic reform.But that is going to require a significant internal mindset change from both the Liberal and National parties. Over the past decade, the Nationals have increasingly become the tail wagging the dog when it comes to its Liberal party partners. Today’sNational partyis no longer the party that Tim Fischer once led, which fought for better services and infrastructure in the regions but also recognised that concessions needed to be made in those urban seats where the great majority of Australian voters live.The modern National party no longer makes those concessions and instead has been playing a zero-sum game that is making both centre-right parties increasingly irrelevant to voters in their respective constituencies.Some commentators accuse the Liberal party of being Labor-lite but the truth of it is the Liberals have become Nationals-lite.If no one offers a plausible path to security, you vote on identity and resentment insteadAnd because the modern Liberal party is now Nationals-lite, it has limited electoral appeal in urban seats. Indeed, the Liberal party now only holds nine out of 88 urban seats (as defined by the Australian Electoral Commission) in Australia.So while it’s true the Liberal party can’t win government without the National party, at the moment the Liberal party can’t win government with the National party because their pervasive influence over policy makes them so uncompetitive in urban seats.Compounding this challenge is that the Liberal and National parties are also currently losing vote share toOne Nation. While this particular vote transfer is an emerging trend, it is also symptomatic of a fragmented electorate producing fragmented voting patterns which is turning Australia into a nation of smaller and smaller tribes.The 2nd of March this year marks the 30th anniversary of John Howard’s win over the Keating Labor government. At that election, the combined non-major party vote was 14%. Over the subsequent 10 federal elections, the non-major party vote has grown to 33.6%, with only two-thirds of the electorate voting for the then two major parties. In our most recent national poll, before the Coalition split, the non-major party vote was at 37% and expanding.A lot of that non-major party growth is occurring in the One Nation vote segment, which in our last round of our research was at 18% nationally and highest at 26% in the gen X male cohort. In other words, just over one in four male gen X voters at the time of the survey would give their primary vote to One Nation.The primary component behindthe bleeding of this vote to One Nationis not the culture wars (though that is a component for some). The underpinning factor is a broken economic promise. In recent decades the Liberal party were very competitive with male gen X working-class conservatives in particular, on the promise of aspiration – that economic growth would create opportunity for those willing to work.And for most of the period of the Howard government that promise and its reward was there in these assessment of these voters.But over the past decade the (then) Coalition, and more recently Labor, steadily lost the confidence of these voters as housing became more unattainable, employment less secure and wage growth anaemic and no longer able to provide the life that work was supposed to provide. At the same time, another cohort of older, non-university-educated voters in regional Australia weren’t just anxious about the risk of falling behind, they knew they had already fallen behind.For those that were former Coalition voters, in their evaluation in our qualitative research, the Liberal and National parties have nothing material to offer, and while they don’t think One Nation offers real hope, they credit them for at least recognising their grievances. In politics, if no one offers a plausible path to security, you vote on identity and resentment instead.Guardian Essential poll: One Nation’s primary vote soars to record high amid Coalition chaosRead moreSo how do the Liberal and National parties expand their electoral maps?Economic anxiety should be fertile ground for the Liberal party in particular.In both the last and current electoral cycles, our research found a pervasive negative mood sentiment in the electorate, which is typically a good diagnostic indicator of a mood for change.There is other data that speaks to this entrenched pessimism. In our most recent round of research, 49% of voters believe Australia is heading in the wrong direction. A separate question found that 55% of voters think the next generation will have a worse standard of living than their parents’ generation. This research also found that just 35% of voters believe the Albanese Labor government is focused on the right priorities, while 47% disagree with that proposition.But despite this protracted negative mood sentiment, the then Coalition had no equity leads on the most salient issues. When we asked voters who is best to manage cost of living and housing affordability, Labor won both contests.When we ask former Coalition voters why they have changed their voting behaviours, many cite a lack of definition around the Coalition’s values and therefore a lack of confidence in its ability to deliver on economic promise, as well as concerns around behaviours and disunity.There is simply no way back to government for the conservative parties unless they can unite behind a bold economic reform project that offers persuadable voters a new economic compact underpinned by promise and hope, especially in urban seats, and including the teal seats. It also means a return to the principles and values of the successful Coalition partnership led by Howard and Fischer, where the coalition parties made internal trade-offs and accepted compromise to broaden electoral appeal.That means the Liberal and National parties need to stop searching for shortcuts and competing with themselves by creating and chasing noise. It also means moving away from the extremities of public debate and unifying as a coalition with an economic reform narrative that is pitched at Coalition-coded voters, particularly the younger professional and urban cohorts. If it fails, Anthony Albanese’s recently stated ambition to make Labor the natural party of government really will become reality.Tony Barry is a former Liberal party strategist who has worked for Christopher Pyne and Malcolm Turnbull.

For ‘doomsayers’ like us, it is the ultimate vindicationTue 27 Jan 2026 11.52 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 11.55 ESTShareIknow it’s almost impossible to turn your eyes away from the Trump show, but that’s the point. His antics, ever-grosser and more preposterous, are designed to keep him in our minds, to crowd out other issues. His insatiable craving for attention is a global-threat multiplier. You can’t help wondering whether there’s anything hewouldn’tdo to dominate the headlines.But we must tear ourselves away from the spectacle, for there are other threats just as critical that also require our attention. Just because you’re not hearing about them doesn’t mean they’ve gone away.Why are they not salient? Partly because countries – and not just Trump’s – seem determined to keep us in the dark. The most important document published by the UK government since the general election emerged last week only through a freedom of information request. Thenational security assessmenton biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse was supposed to have been published inOctober 2025, but the apparatchiks in Downing Street sought to make it disappear. Apparently there weretwo reasons: because its conclusions were “too negative”, and because it would draw attention to the government’s failure to act.When the report at last appeared, thanks to an FoI request lodged by the Green Alliance, The Timesreported thatit had been significantly “abridged”, I expect by the same goons. Some of its starkest conclusions had been omitted. Even so, the assessment – believed to have beencompiled by the joint intelligence committee(on which the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ sit) – is not exactly reassuring.It echoes warnings some of us have made for years, only to be dismissed as nutters, doomsayers and extremists. It tells us that “ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions. Every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse (irreversible loss of function beyond repair).” This presents a threat to “UK national security and prosperity”. It says “the world is already experiencing impacts including crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks. Threats will increase with degradation and intensify with collapse.” The results will include geopolitical and economic instability, increased conflict and competition for resources. “It is unlikely the UK would be able to maintain food security if ecosystem collapse drives geopolitical competition for food.” It also warns that “conflict and military escalation will become more likely, both within and between states, as groups compete for arable land and food and water resources”.It provides a powerful vindication of certain messages that, whenvoiced by environmentalists, have been greeted with hatred, fury and denial. For example, it tells us that “food production is the most significant cause of terrestrial biodiversity loss”, that “animal farming at current levels is unsustainable without imports” and that “the UK does not have enough land to feed its population and rear livestock: a wholesale change in consumer diets would be required”. I’d be lying if I wrote: “I hate to say, ‘We told you so.’” After years of insults and abuse, I say it with pride.But what was cut from the report is, according to The Times, even graver, including a warning that the shrinkage of glaciers in the Himalayas, causing declining river flow, would “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, leading to the possibility of nuclear war. Again, some of us have beentrying to persuade governmentsto focus on this threat with little success.It’s almost reassuring to know we’re not alone in being stonewalled. If even the security services are gagged when they tell the government what it doesn’t want to hear, perhaps our communication style, or our modes of protest or our dress sense, are not, as we keep being told, the problem. The report, notably shorter than most of its kind, gives every appearance of having been hastily and crudely truncated.I wonder whether the full assessment might also have named some other pressing security threats. One is the way in whichfossil fuel, meat andlivestock producershave been funding far-right movements, to stifle environmental protection measures that would reduce their profits. Such funding is a major driver of the fascistic politics that we now witness in the US.It’s not hard to see how inconvenient this report is for Starmer’s government, which has repeatedly sought toinvent a conflictbetween prosperity and environmental protection. Its war on the living world (a world it reduces, according to the “cauldron principle”, to bats, newts, spiders and snails) is a major element of its appeal to the “hero voters” on which it believes its success depends. Never mind that these votersmight not actually exist: we’ll bring our ghost army back from Reform UK by attacking wildlife, which everyone in Britain famously hates. That’s bound to work. So when the security services say that environmental protection is in fact essential to prosperity, their report must be suppressed.Against the assessment’s advice that tropical forest ecosystems are crucial to the UK’s security, our government has decided so farnot to investone penny in theTropical Forest Forever Facility, despite helping to establish this global funding mechanism. But rest assured: it tells us it’s “incredibly supportive” of the initiative. It seems determinedto dumptheinternational climate finance programmethat the Tories established – to help poorer countries protect themselves and halt the collapse of ecosystems – when the current fund expires this year. Let’s ignore not just those eco-loons but the former military leadersarguingthat climate finance is an essential element of national security.At home, the government appears to have quietly given up on the target set by the Conservatives of “30x30”, which means 30% of our land and sea protected for nature by 2030. The national security assessment lists this as one of the essential measures needed to avert catastrophe. Labour’s new target? 30xnever.And, as the Office for Environmental Protectionpoints out, Starmer’s government is on track to miss even the dismal, risible targets for protecting and restoring wildlife established in the 2021 Environment Act, when George Eustice was environment secretary. Yes, the situation is actually worse than in the darkest days of Tory rule.I know this government exists only to disappoint us. But its environmental failures are even more striking than its failures on other issues. When the ruling party compares unfavourably with the one that brought us Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, it’s worse than a betrayal. It’s a threat to our survival.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionBiodiversityConservationWildlifeKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

It’s something we all could learn fromRanjana SrivastavaHer mother, like too many Australians, missed out on quality and timely end-of-life care. Once associated with giving up, early palliative care is better for patients and their loved onesTue 27 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 17.58 ESTShareSome time ago, a friend requested my advice. Her mother was in hospital for the seventh time in one year. The tests just kept coming but the patient was no better. Her body was failing and her cognition faltering. The doctors were openly pessimistic on their daily rounds. And yet, after three weeks, there didn’t seem to be a clear plan, or at least one the family understood.“Why can’t someone tell us the big picture?” my friend said. Her mother’s downward trajectory was evident, but she felt guilty thinking “bad” thoughts. However, if her mother was dying, she wanted to take her home.“What you need is palliative care,” I said.I explained that, judging by her account, her mother was nearing the end of life. Doctors commonly struggled to identify this, and specialist palliative care was best equipped to pull things together. A doctor or nurse would facilitate conversations about the goals of care, manage troublesome symptoms and help figure out the venue of care. If going home mattered, palliative care would help, but if things didn’t work out, they could initiate admission to hospice.When the time comes to die, what end-of-life care would doctors choose for themselves? | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreI rattled off this advice as routine for an oncologist, but to my friend it felt like an epiphany. She had heard of palliative care but had little idea of what they did – and no idea she could request it.Sadly, my friend’s mother died three days after our conversation. Months later, my friend rued that she did not regret her mother’s death as much as the missed opportunity for better end-of-life care.As the population ages, I suspect this is going to be a more common lament.Australia’s universal healthcare system is well regarded and widely envied. But the latest evidence paints a serious picture of the state of palliative care.In 2021-22, there were 132,000 predictable deaths of people aged 65 and over. The median age of death was 85, which makes the word “predictable” worth noting. In other words, these were expected deaths associated with stepwise decline. Over half of people were using at least one aged care service in the last year of their life and just under half (47%) were in organ failure.Let’s turn to thelast year of life.If you are the glass half-full kind, the good news is that today 60% of cancer patients receive palliative care and the younger you are, the more likely you are to receive it. However, only 28% of people with organ failure and a dismal 22% of those with dementia and frailty receive palliative care.You don’t even have to be the glass half-empty type to appreciate that most vulnerable elders and an awful lot of cancer patients are going without a service which, when properly administered, is known to mitigate the physical and emotional distress of dying for all parties.Pair this with the evidence that the cost of healthcare in the last year of life is 14 times higher than usual care (10 times higher for those over age 80) and does not include the huge intangible costs, and it’s hard to neglect the practical implications for a society that wants to pride itself on healthcare from cradle to grave.When I was training, cancer surgeons and even oncologists conflated palliative care with giving up. Today we acknowledge that palliative care can and should go hand in hand with other forms of cancer treatment.Palliative care is such a regular feature of my work I wouldn’t have guessed that the first specialist palliative care service occurs a median of just 12 days before death. This, when experts say that a three-to-four-month input is ideal to spot needs, marshal resources and prepare stakeholders.Like my friend’s mother, 68% of dying people had an unplanned admission in the last year of life. Many died in hospitals, and worse, emergency departments. Increasingly, they are people with dementia and organ failure; despite their progressive deterioration being documented by multiple providers, it seems no one thought of palliative care.As my patient was dying, this is how we failed her | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreAdvance care directives are an essential document for all nursing home residents. But despite specifying quality of life over aggressive measures, dying residents are commonly bundled into hospital. When we suggest that residents stay in nursing homes rather than languish in hospital, relatives decline out of fear that nursing homes aren’t equipped for good end-of-life care. The data supports them.People living in residential care have far less access to specialist palliative care, compared with people using home care and residential respite care (21% v 49%) and receive their first specialist intervention just eight days before death. Some of this gap may be filled by GPs and community providers, but we would want to be sure before getting comfortable.Thanks to modern medicine,more cancer patientsare living longer. Palliative care is no longer synonymous with cancer.But staggering numbers of people will develop dementia, now theleading cause of deathin Australia. And organ failure for most people will be slow and irreversible.Hence the need for palliative care expertise, which is compassionate, measured and importantly, tailored to the longer trajectory of these conditions compared with cancer.Better funding, awareness and advocacy is required to include all the people who are missing out.Earlier and better palliative care is better for patients and their loved ones. It also helps professionals who bear witness to suffering. If we could achieve all this while saving on even a fraction of healthcare costs, all of society would win.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

But even more could be done to save lives and protect us from deadly toxins in the airTue 27 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 13.03 ESTShareBreathwork is everywhere, whether it’s in yoga studios, corporate retreats or self-help reels. We’re told to “just breathe”. Be mindful. Lower our stress levels. Inhale. Exhale. In the yogic tradition, bringing clean air into our lungs and our body (pranayamain Sanskrit) is about purifying and detoxing, and then exhaling what we don’t need. That all sounds great if you live on a remote island or in the middle of a forest – but what if that air isn’t cleansing us, but making us sick?According to theWorld Health Organization, 99% of the global population is exposed to air-pollution levels that exceed its health-based guidelines and air pollution is now the world’s single largest environmental risk, linked to nearly 7 millionpremature deathseach year. This isn’t an issue of future climate collapse or one that will affect future generations. This is about today – and the damage polluted air is doing to our hearts, lungs, brains and blood vessels.In some places, air pollution has reached a crisis point. Those places are a warning to other cities across the world of what unregulated and unmitigated air pollution looks like. Take New Delhi, which many consider to be themost polluted capital in the world. During peak pollution periods, PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi regularly exceed WHO guideline levels byroughly 24 times. According to theAir Quality Life Index, that exposure is estimated to reduce life expectancy by almost 12 years. Exposure at these levels is associated with increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, chronic respiratory disease and impaired brain development in children. The result is that15% of all deathsin Delhi can be attributed directly to air pollution. It’s a slow and invisible poison, which is why it attracts far less attention than more immediate health threats.When the air becomes so dangerous, the supreme court orders lockdowns – not because of any pandemic, but because of harm to health from breathing the air outside.One justice, Arun Mishra, said: “The world is laughing at us. You are reducing the lifespan of people. Why are people being forced to live in gas chambers? Better to get explosives and kill them all in one go.” A local doctor, attending to patients with respiratory distress, compared the air in Delhi on a bad day to smoking50 cigarettes a day.This isn’t a problem that affects just Delhi. The Royal College of Physicians recently published a study suggesting that30,000 deaths a year in the UKwere linked to air pollution. And what would London look like today if low-emission zones (LEZ) and ultra-low-emission zones (ULEZ)hadn’t been brought in? Road transport remains a major source of nitrogen oxides and particulate pollution in urban areas, particularly from diesel vehicles.In London, nitrogen dioxide levels declined by nearly half between 2016 and 2023, with air quality improving at99% of monitoring sitesacross the city. Acity hall reportfound that in 2024, nitrogen dioxide was down by about 27% overall across London and PM2.5 from vehicle exhausts was 31% lower in outer London than it would have been without ULEZ expansion. Across the UK, air quality has been improving, buta recent studyshowed that as of 2024, many areas still breached safe limits far too often.On a personal note, I would like to see two more improvements in Britain. First, more drivers turning off their engines instead of keeping them running while waiting. A running engine significantly increases the concentration of exhaust fumes in the immediate vicinity. This is damaging to the drivers, passengers and nearby pedestrians alike. How many times have we seen a large SUV waiting with its engine running near a school or park? The driver might have spent an hour in the gym or eating organic but all those health gains would have been wasted – and reversed – by idling their engine, poisoning both themselves and everyone around them.Second, wood-burning stoves and open fires are frequently marketed as upmarket, sustainable and cosy, yet they produce substantial amounts of fine particulate matter indoors and outdoors. The World Health Organization categorises this as indoor air pollution, a risk factor it has spent decades trying to reduce in low-income countries where people cook over open fires. In wealthier countries, the same exposure is often reframed as a lifestyle choice, despite evidence of harm to respiratory health, especially for those sitting in front of the fire. Arecent UK studylinked wood burning to nearly 2,500 deaths andmore than 27,000 yearsof life lost annually, and thousands of new cases of asthma and diabetes.While we can do what we can individually, what ultimately matters most for public health are the air quality policies implemented by cities and governments. Emissions standards, clean air zones, transport planning and regulation of domestic combustion all have measurable effects on exposure and health outcomes. The benefits are immediate and local. Mindfulness is trendy and asks us to use our breath to reduce stress and improve our health. But no amount of calm awareness can offset air that is quietly damaging our health. You can drink green smoothies, practise breathwork or go for a run, but the health impact of those choices is likely to be outweighed by the quality of the air you are breathing while doing them.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghFit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyondOn Wednesday 28 January 2026, join Annie Kelly, Devi Sridhar, Joel Snape and Mariella Frostrup, as they discuss how to enjoy longer and healthier lives, with expert advice and practical tips.

No wonder Labour is running out of roadTue 27 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 07.18 ESTShareOn its own terms, Keir Starmer’s factionblocking Andy Burnham from standing in the upcoming Gorton and Denton byelection is perfectly rational. It is screamingly obvious that the mayor of Greater Manchester sought a return to Westminster so that he could overthrow the prime minister, once Labour is battered in the May elections.Burnham promised he“would be there to support the work of the government, not undermine it”. But if, come spring, a new Plaid Cymru first minister of Wales is grinning like a Cheshire cat, the prince over the water could plausibly argue that keeping Starmer in No 10 is what is undermining the work of the government.Starmer’s move is a rational decision, perhaps, if factional survival is your priority. But what about the widerLabourparty’s survival? It has long been clear that Starmer’s cabal would rather burn the party to the ground than allow it to move in a more progressive direction.The key argument cited for blocking Burnham is the risk of Labour losing Greater Manchester’s mayoralty to Reform UK. Just sit with that for a moment. In May 2024, Burnhamwon more than 63% of the vote. Reform came fourth with 7.5%. If defeat in a core Labour heartland is even remotely plausible, then Labour’s existence as a national political force is already in doubt.So what exactly is the masterplan of Starmer’s faction, led by his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney – and what do they actually want? After all,as it was claimed they bragged to journalistsa year ago, they see the prime minister as their frontman: a useful idiot who thinks he’s driving the train, while actually sitting at the front of London’s driverless Docklands Light Railway. It was reported that they settled on a man who wanted the premiership for its own sake – a blank canvas they could paint as they pleased.Why is Andy Burnham such a threat to Keir Starmer? Everyone likes him | Zoe WilliamsRead moreDid they really come into politics to scrap statesupport for pensionersanddisabled people, introduce one of the harshest asylum systems in Europe while raiding therhetoric of Enoch Powell, decimatethe foreign aid budgetandlock up elderly peopleholding placards opposing genocide? The truth is more banal. Many of them forged their worldview in student politics, labelling anyone to the left of Peter Mandelson as a “Trot”. They imagined themselves as characters in The West Wing, with all of the machiavellian skullduggery and none of the idealism. In short, their politics consists of defining themselves against the left and craving power as an end in itself.Factional control is all they excel at. They ruthlessly stitched up parliamentary selections in favour of ultra-loyalist drones. A notable foreshadow of the current debacle was when – on the eve of the general election – Starmer’s candidatesblocked Faiza Shaheenfrom standing in Chingford and Woodford Green. A local, working-class Muslim woman and an excellent communicator who defied the odds to become an economist, she was the ideal candidate. But a talented leftwinger was the Starmerites’ worst nightmare. The inevitable result? Shaheen stood as an independent, the vote split, and Iain Duncan Smith triumphed. For them, that was infinitely preferable to Shaheen winning.Yet despite remaking the parliamentary Labour party in their own image, MPs endlessly complain that they are treated as“too stupid”by a hostile No 10. Could it be that the party’s masters belatedly realised that they prioritised blind loyalty over quality?If McSweeney’s crew were capable of self-reflection, they would ask themselves searching questions. Starmer obligingly adopted the Labour right’s political prospectus wholesale – so why did they only secure roughly a third of the vote ona record low turnout, the lowest since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1928, despite the Tories self-immolating? If competence is their USP, why is their administrationdefined by U-turns? If bashing migrants and welfare is the recipe for electoral success, why does their stooge prime minister have a net favourability rating of-57?Starmer is finished, but keeping Burnham out leaves ultra-Blairite torchbearer Wes Streeting in pole position. Beloved by the commentariat,disliked by the public, he will offer the same toxic political prospectus. But that suits Labour’s masters just fine. They’d rather the party sink than stay afloat under a leader who isn’t as rightwing.That the party is briefing thatit fears the Greenswinning in Gorton and Denton more than Reform is instructive – Labour is terrified of Caerphilly-isation. In thatrecent Senedd byelection, Labour came third with 11% of the vote. They’d won that constituency inevery Westminster or Senedd election since 1918, but Plaid Cymru triumphed on an unashamedly progressive platform, positioning itself as the only real alternative to Reform.Labour is betting its survival on spooking progressive voters into believing it is the only bulwark stopping Nigel Farage from ending up in No 10. Gorton and Denton was in thetop 15% biggest Labour majoritiesat the last elections: if the Greens win here, that emotional blackmail will no longer work. Zack Polanski’s party reports that Labour’s support has collapsed on the doorstep, leaving a straight fight between it and Farage. That is a message the Greens need to hammer home, not least given a vicious smear campaign is undoubtedly heading their way.Suella Braverman’sdefection to Reformshould boost the Greens. They can tell disillusioned Labour voters that the “alternative” is Rishi Sunak’s old cabinet, just led by Farage. And, indeed, what exactly are the reasons voters should march to polling stations to vote for Starmer’s party? It is this question that dooms Labour. The party has been overrun by soulless hacks who have decided that it would be better for the party to burn than lose control. Fine. Let it burn.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerAndy BurnhamMorgan McSweeneyReform UKGreen partycommentShareReuse this content"

This will be the first trip of this kind by a British prime minister since Theresa May’s three-dayvisit to Beijingin 2018. Since then, relations between London and Beijing have become increasingly fraught, caught between growingsecurity concernsand deep economic interdependence. Allegations of espionage and influence operations have sharpened political and public suspicion in the UK, even asdeep trade linksand supply chains on which the country depends make disengagement unrealistic. As fierce debate about the recentapproval for the new Chinese embassyhas shown, there are strong opinions about how to best manage relations with Beijing – as well as what, precisely, constitutes a threat and what is an opportunity. The result is an uneasy balancing act in which caution and cooperation coexist, often uncomfortably.These security concerns are grounded in recent experience. In December, the Foreign Office disclosed it had been the target of asustained cyber-attacktwo months earlier that was suspected to be the work of a Chinese group known as Storm 1849. This followed investigations into alleged espionage involvingparliamentary researchersand repeated warnings from security agencies about technology transfer and data exposure in sensitive industries.Starmer will surely need a stiff drink on the plane to Beijing as he works through what cards he has to play. For all the current mood of malaise and low confidence, the UK is still a key part of the global geopolitical architecture. As a permanent member of the UN security council, a state with nuclear capability and a G7 country (even if at the bottomwith regards to total investment), it retains significant clout.China, however, also arrives at the table with formidable leverage: it isthe world’s second-largest economyand a central hub in global manufacturing and supply chains, giving it weight on issues ranging from the climate crisis to financial stability, and making cooperation with it unavoidable. Moreover, Beijing’saims are clear: securing a more predictable and less adversarial posture from the UK and Europe, limiting criticism of its internal and regional policies, maintaining access to British financial markets and deepening cooperation in education, research, green technology and investment.For the past 30 years or so,Chinahas worked systematically to build its own networks around the world by investing heavily in infrastructure, energy and transport, often in places where western capital has been reluctant to go. In Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America, China has paired finance with diplomacy, trade and development assistance, presenting itself as a partner focused on growth rather than governance or political reform. Over time, this has translated into influence: access to markets and resources, diplomatic support in international forums and a stronger voice across much of the global south.History does not always count for much, but it counts for something if you can create a narrative that explains the benefits of cooperation and how to build for the future.That is at heart of what Starmer needs to be thinking about when he touches down in Beijing. What do China and the UK have in common, and what are the areas where we can, or cannot, collaborate? Perhaps most importantly, how does the UK sees its place in a changing world: as a gateway to Europe, a sop to the US or a country that is in decline and “decaying” (asDonald Trump has called Europeas a whole)?View image in fullscreenDemonstrators gather outside the Royal Mint Court in London to protest against plans to open the new Chinese embassy, January 2026.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesThe beliefthat the west is volatile, unreliable and imperialistic is one reason that China has worked hard to embed itself in global supply chains, while reducing its own dependencies on others at the same time. It has done so by targeting strategic sectors: ports and railways, energy, mining, telecommunications and manufacturing, using state-backed finance to place Chinese companies at key points in trade and logistics. This has expanded its access to markets and resources abroad while strengthening its ability to insulate itself from external pressure at home.While the UK has long agonised over its own energy strategy – and paid the price for being dependent on global markets – China set about solving the problem of relying onoil and gas from the Middle Eastand elsewhere by fostering a cradle-to-grave ecosystem that has created a near monopoly on photovoltaic cells, wind turbines and batteries. Clean energy is good for the environment, of course. But the incentives to dominate these technologies were also underpinned by the desire to ensure self-sufficiency in an age that Beijing considered to be one of rising geopolitical turbulence long before Trump’s first election.With similar steps taken across a host of other sectors, including rare earths, biotechnology, data analytics and artificial intelligence, China’s emphasis onopen-source modelshas helped accelerate adoption and diffusion at scale, strengthening its position globally. For countries such as Britain, this matters because Chinese companies now sit deep inside supply chains that underpin everything from energy transition and manufacturing to consumer goods and digital infrastructure.All this, then, means that others need China more than China needs others.That much is clear from the most recent trade data. It shows that this year, China is on course torecord a trade surplusof $1.19tn. This is in spite of Trump’s attempts to throttle Beijing byimposing tariffsas well as restrictions on the export of a slew of products. These have beensidestepped by shipping throughcountries such as Mexico and Vietnam, or by dumping cheap goods in other markets, including those in Europe.For Britain, the implication is stark: reliance on China directly constrains policy choices. Decisions on security, human rights or technology are weighed not only on their merits, but against the risk of disrupted trade, higher costs for consumers and businesses, and retaliation against key sectors. Like the US under Trump, Beijing is willing to use coercive tools to settle scores: it imposed tariffs of up to 42.7% on the EU dairy industryjust before Christmas in response to Europe protecting its car industry at the expense of Chinese manufacturers.This all makes China a formidable competitor and means that Starmer needs real clarity of vision to work out what he wants from China and what he can offer in return. That is complicated by an age in which the UK’s national security is at its most vulnerable since the end of the second world war.How Starmer navigates the opportunities and challenges of this visit will not define his premiership. But it is part of the wider question of what precisely the prime minister’s vision is for the UK at a time of change. Many are still waiting to see what that is. The Beijing trip offers the chance to articulate it.Peter Frankopan is professor of global history at the University of Oxford.

But this is not inevitableMon 26 Jan 2026 22.07 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 00.45 ESTShareAustralians are struggling through one of the most brutal heatwaves and hottest summers on record. Day after day, temperatures into the high 30s are turning homes into ovens, workplaces into hazards, and everyday tasks into endurance tests.All of us are feeling it. But spare a thought for the millions of renters trying to survive this heat in homes that were never designed to cope with it.Across the country, renters are living in properties with no insulation, poor sealing, broken or inadequate fans or no cooling options at all. Others technically have air conditioning, but they are in such extreme rental stress they can’t afford to turn it on. In the midst of a housing crisis, even basic cooling has become a luxury.Heat is Australia’s ‘silent killer’. Here are the symptoms to watch out forRead moreThis is not a minor inconvenience. It is a serious public health risk.A recent survey by Everybody’s Home paints a confronting picture of how renters are coping. Large numbers report that their homes become dangerously hot in summer, yet many are forced to ration electricity use or go without cooling altogether because they can’t afford the power bill if they want to pay the rent. People describe choosing between running the air conditioner and buying groceries, or sitting in stifling heat because they’re terrified of the next bill.For people with chronic illness, disability, or heart and respiratory conditions, this can be life-threatening. For older people, babies and young children, prolonged heat exposure dramatically increases the risk of hospitalisation. Heatwaves already kill more Australians than any other natural hazard or disaster. As global heating worsens, that risk is only growing.Yet renters are expected to endure these conditions silently.Many are afraid to ask for repairs or upgrades because they fear a rent increase or eviction. In the middle of a rental crisis, tenants know how replaceable they are. When vacancy rates are at record lows and rents are soaring, asserting your rights can feel like gambling with your home.This is what happens when housing policy ignores livability.Governments have created a system where landlords can charge record rents for homes that trap heat, leak air and offer no protection from extreme weather. At the same time, they have failed to put meaningful limits on rent increases, leaving renters trapped in a vicious cycle: rising rents, rising energy bills and falling standards.This is not inevitable. It is a policy choice.Some governments are starting to acknowledge that this is a problem. In South Australia,the state government saysit is working to improve rental standards to better protect tenants from extreme heat. That recognition matters – but it also underlines how far behind policy has fallen. Renters are already living through dangerous conditions this summer, not in some distant future.Minimum rental standards should guarantee that every rental home is safe and livable in extreme heat. That means proper insulation, effective ventilation and fixed cooling where it is needed. These are not luxury upgrades. They are basic protections in a warming climate.At the same time, limits on rent increases are essential. Without them, any improvement risks becoming an excuse for another rent hike, putting decent housing even further out of reach. Renters should not have to choose between safety and affordability.Extreme heatwave may break records in Victoria as firefighters warn of bushfire risk in ‘very dry’ stateRead moreAs summers get hotter and heatwaves become more frequent, doing nothing is not a neutral position. It is a decision to expose renters to harm.Governments often talk about resilience and adaptation in the face of climate change. But resilience starts at home. If they are serious about protecting people from extreme heat, they cannot keep ignoring the conditions inside rental properties.Australians deserve homes that keep them safe, not homes that put their health at risk. If governments fail to act on minimum standards and rent limits, they are not just neglecting renters. They are choosing to leave people at risk as the country grows hotter, one summer at a time.Maiy Azize is the national spokesperson for Everybody’s Home, a campaign to end Australia’s housing crisis, and deputy director of Anglicare AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralia weatherOpinionHousingRentingHealthClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

How did she feel about playing the blond gamine in some of cinema’s best loved scenes?Jonathan RomneyTue 27 Jan 2026 11.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareRichard Linklater’s latest film Nouvelle Vague is not so much a re-enactment of cinema history, but a celebratory tribute act – joyously reliving the spirit of the early French New Wave, as it re-imagines 1959 Paris and the chaotically innovative shooting of Jean-Luc Godard’s epoch-making Breathless (A Bout de Souffle). Most of the cast are newcomers, but there’s one familiar face: American actor Zoey Deutch. She plays Jean Seberg, already a Hollywood star when Godard cast her as expat student and newspaper vendor Patricia. Seberg’s stroll with Jean-Paul Belmondo on the Champs-Elysées, in T-shirt, slacks and ballet flats, is one of the legendary duets of French cinema.Deutch has Seberg’s style down impeccably: her awkward American-accented French, her balletic bounce in that scene, her exuberant shout of “New York Herald Tribune!” On a Zoom call from Los Angeles, Deutch – Seberg’s blond gamine cut now grown out into symmetrical black bangs – admits that when Linklater first suggested she might play the role, she knew nothing about Seberg, or about Breathless. That was way back in 2014, when they were shooting Linklater’s college baseball comedy Everybody Wants Some!! “I was 19,” says Deutch, “and I know there are plenty of 19-year-olds who are cinephiles and know a ton about that world, but I didn’t.”The FBI planted false rumours in the press that Seberg was pregnant by a Black PantherNouvelle Vague is in French: Deutch spent two years learning the language, and perfecting Seberg’s distinctly transatlantic delivery. But on first watching Breathless, Deutch admits, she didn’t quite get what was so extraordinary about the film, since its innovations – its improvisatory openness and staccato rhythms – had long been absorbed into the language of mainstream cinema. “I was mystified. I don’t think I understood how punk rock it was at the time.” If anyone still doesn’t understand, she suggests, they should watch Godard’s film alongside Linklater’s as a double bill: “You get how different and bold Breathless was when you watch it with ours.”Iowa-born Seberg was discovered as a teenager and, inexperienced though she was, twice played lead for the notoriously demanding Otto Preminger. She was Joan of Arc in his 1957 Saint Joan, for which Seberg said she was “burned at the stake by the press”, then starred in Bonjour Tristesse, in which her ingenue energies impressed critics, including Godard’s comrade-in-arms François Truffaut.View image in fullscreen‘Different and bold’ … Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo stroll through Paris in Breathless.Photograph: Nana Productions/SIPA/ShutterstockLinklater’s film shows Seberg at a turning point: living in Paris, sceptical about Godard’s potential as a director, but eager for new possibilities. In Nouvelle Vague, Deutch’s Seberg may be mystified and infuriated at Godard’s unpredictability and gnomic pontifications, but she gives as good as she gets, mischievously deflating him, often to his delight.“She acknowledged his genius,” says Deutch, “and was so grateful for this opportunity that changed her life. But she said in later interviews that he really viewed her more as an idea than a person, ‘He wasn’t interested in who I was, just in what I could represent.’ I think that’s very deep – and certainly the experience of a lot of young women in this business.”Seberg’s post-Breathless career was busy but variable, most famously starring in 1964 melodrama Lilith, as a patient in a mental hospital who becomes the object of obsessive desire for a staff member, played by Warren Beatty; and appearing with Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood in the 1969 musical Paint Your Wagon. She also made two features directed by her second husband, French novelist Romain Gary, which both objectified her cruelly, 1968’s Birds in Peru making her the centre of a tawdry concoction of Euro-erotica.View image in fullscreenBegan acting at the age of five … Deutch.Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock for ASTRA AwardsHer later life was depicted in the 2019 biopic Seberg, starring Kristen Stewart. When she died at the age of 40 in Paris in 1979, it was presumed to be suicide, after a brutal harassment campaign by the FBI in response to her support of the Black Panther Party. At a press conference afterwards, Gary said the FBI had planted false rumours in the press saying that Seberg’s pregnancy by a Mexican revolutionary called Carlos Navarra in 1970 was actually by a Black Panther.Deutch studied much of this, although none of it fed directly into Nouvelle Vague. “I always want to look at the big picture,” she says, “but Rick [Linklater] was very insistent in reminding us that we were depicting a moment in time.” The director would say to Guillaume Marbeck, who plays Godard: “You’re not an icon yet – these people are just young, ambitious, kooky artists doing their thing. They are not who we know them to be now.”When Deutch worked with Linklater on Everybody Wants Some!!, she had the only significant female role in (unusually for the director) an aggressively male film, about college baseball players raising hell and “chasing chicks” in early 80s Texas. “I think he got a vibe that, at 19, I would be able to hold my own with all these macho dudes – like no one would push me around.”You can well imagine that Deutch would be no pushover, as a Hollywood insider from birth. Her father, Howard Deutch directed the beloved Pretty in Pink; her mother is Lea Thompson, who starred as Lorraine in the Back to the Future trilogy. Thompson was also in Howard the Duck, a notorious flop based on the cult Marvel Comics character, a cigar-chomping, wisecracking waterfowl from another planet. When I joke that perhaps there was a family ban on mentioning that at table, Deutch plays scandalised: “Absolutely not! There’s justpure embracingof Howard the Duck.”View image in fullscreenShe gives as good as she gets … Deutch as Seberg and Guillaume Marbeck as Godard in Nouvelle Vague.Photograph: Jean-Louis Fernandez/Courtesy of NetflixShe remembers being very protective of her mother. “You have to imagine being a little kid and there’s strangers coming up, thinking that they know her and saying really inappropriate things, having no boundaries. And then also really lovely people who are just big fans and appreciate her work – but as a kid, you can’t separate the two.” She has continued to back her mother up, including professionally: in 2017, she and her elder sister Madelyn co-starred with their mother in Thompson’s directing debut The Year of Spectacular Men. A comedy-drama about a young woman navigating post-college adulthood, it was written by Madelyn and produced by Zoey.There’s a brief interruption – a scratching at the door and: “Mabel, stop! Mabel!” Mabel, out of shot and otherwise inaudible, is Deutch’s dog. “Mabel is the star of my life,” Deutch says. Or one of them, at least: last September, she announced her engagement to actor, comic and YouTuber Jimmy Tatro.Deutch, now 31, has had no shortage of roles since her debut at 15, in Disney’s kids-on-a-cruise-ship sitcom The Suite Life on Deck, although so far only a few have caused major ripples. Well established as a romcom stalwart, she has increasingly collected harder-edged roles: notably, in period gangster drama The Outfit, with Mark Rylance, and in Clint Eastwood’s courtroom thriller Juror No 2. She also made her Broadway debut in Thornton Wilder’s 1938 ensemble classic Our Town, the New York Times praising her “apple-cheeked and wild-souled” Emily. “I have loved this play so much that it stood on my nightstand for my whole life,” she says. “There are certain texts in all of our lives that just ground us. This was one of them.”Then there was one of her tougher movies, last year’s Anniversary, with Polish director Jan Komasa. Given her sheer insouciance in Nouvelle Vague, Deutch’s ferociously intense breakdown scene here comes as quite a shock. Anniversary is a bleak dystopian parable about the emergence of a new authoritarian America. And indeed, this week in Sundance, where she is premiering a new comedy, Deutch spoke out against the brutality of ICE and expressed solidarity with the people of Minnesota: “I feel so proud to be an American, seeing the way communities and people are coming together during this time. But I feel so ashamed at the same time to be an American, seeing how our government is handling things.”View image in fullscreen‘She acknowledged his genius’ … Seberg and Godard.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesNouvelle Vague has every likelihood of pushing Deutch definitively into the limelight. Seberg, playing Joan of Arc at 18, might not have been prepared for fame, but Deutch has been practising since the age of five, when she started acting classes. She was encouraged rather than pushed, she says, but admits it was her mother’s idea to enrol her for “kid improv”.Deutch says: “At a young age, I learned that if you say ‘No’ to adults, they have to explain things to you. So ‘No’ got me more communication and more of an opportunity to be treated like an adult. And then my mother said, ‘What’s the opposite of no? Yes –yes and!’ So she put me in improv and it totally changed my life. I have ‘Yes’ actually tattooed on my foot, so that I can look down and say ‘Yes’ to the world.”By way of illustration, Deutch hauls her foot into the Zoom frame to display it. After Nouvelle Vague, perhaps it’s time to get the other one tattooed with a bold “Oui!”Nouvelle Vague is in cinemas 30 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmRichard LinklaterJean-Luc GodardfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, Marty Supreme and Hamnet are close on their heels with 11 nominations each, and Frankenstein and Sentimental Value have eight nods apiece.Bafta has caught the zeitgeist with One Battle After Another, but let’s hear it for The Ballad of Wallis IslandRead moreBritish Tourette comedy I Swear earned a surprising five nominations, including a best actor nod for Robert Aramayo; there were also three nominations each for British musical comedy/drama The Ballad of Wallis Island and the Bromley-set BDSM biker romance Pillion.Shock snubs were largely absent from the announcement, in part because Bafta’s acting shortlists number six, rather than the Oscars’ five – allowing space for names such as Hamnet’s Paul Mescal – and because loins had already been girded for high-profile shut-outs such as Wicked: For Good.In fact, the blockbuster sequel did not fare as badly as it did last Thursday, when it came home from the Oscar nominations empty handed, instead picking up nods for costume design and hair and makeup, but there was no love for either Cynthia Erivo or Ariana Grande.Other A-listers who failed to make the cut include Jennifer Lawrence for Die My Love, George Clooney for Jay Kelly, Sydney Sweeney for Christy, Dwayne Johnson for The Smashing Machine and Julia Roberts for After the Hunt.While Leonardo DiCaprio remains the second favourite to take best actor, after Marty Supreme’s Timothée Chalamet, his seventh mention in the category does mean he now shares an all-time Bafta record with Michael Caine, Daniel Day-Lewis, Peter Finch, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Lemmon and Laurence Olivier. And, given his age and work rate, DiCaprio also appears the most likely of that number to break the record.Aramayo is the dark horse in the category, but the nomination will significantly boost the profile of the 33-year-old previously best known as the young Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. In I Swear, he plays pioneering Scottish Tourette syndrome campaigner John Davidson. Kirk Jones’s much-lauded biopic – which also proved a moderate box office hit – is additionally up for outstanding British film, original screenplay, supporting actor for Peter Mullan and casting.Actor Robert Aramayo: ‘Like anybody who hasn’t had the education, I thought Tourette syndrome was all about swearing’Read moreThe success of that film, Bafta chair Sara Putt told the Guardian, was testimony to public appetite for “moving and authentic stories of lived experience which really resonate”. Meanwhile the continued dominance ofSinnersand One Battle further suggests audiences are eager to find points of connection in “a fractured and confused world”.“Those two films are also a triumph for cinema,” she said. “What you see on the big screen today is an elevation of genre film-making to something that is instructive, moving and thought-provoking – while also being a big, popcorn-movie blast.”This year’s nominations skew slightly in favour of homegrown films, even outside the outstanding British film and debut categories, with nods for Emily Watson and Carey Mulligan for supporting actress and Pillion and Wallis Island in the adapted screenplay category.But save for Aramayo, none of this year’s leading acting nominees are British, and nor are any of the six directors up for that award. Only two of these – Coogler, and Hamnet’s Chloé Zhao – are not white, and Zhao is the only woman.This result, said Putt, “shows there’s still a journey to go on for female directors, and demonstrates the importance of us retaining intervention at the longlist stage”. As part of Baftas’ huge backstage overhaul in 2020, the organisation introduced measures including quotas to ensure gender parity for directors in the initial selection.This marks the Oscars’ first year introducing some of its own version of such innovations, including an award for casting as well as mandatory viewing in order to be able to vote in a second round category. The Baftas’ insistence that voters watch 15 randomised films continues to bear fruit in terms of the spread of titles in contention: 46 in 2026, up four from 2025.Deputy chair of the film committee Anthony Andrews added that he was encouraged to note that more than half of this year’s documentary shortlisted films had female directors.This year’s Baftas take place in a ceremony on 22 February, hosted by Alan Cumming, taking over from David Tennant. The Oscars follow three weeks later, on 15 March, hosted by returning MC Conan O’Brien.Explore more on these topicsBaftas 2026BaftasOne Battle After AnotherSinnersnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s rather a lot to ask of a key-grabbing hand, a dancing parasol and some melting iceEddy FrankelTue 27 Jan 2026 12.51 ESTLast modified on Tue 27 Jan 2026 12.53 ESTShareOne of the worst things contemporary art can make you do is think serious thoughts about stupid things. Sure, sometimesa urinalis beautiful,a shedis interesting, andan empty roomis a container of countless ideas. But sometimes, it has no deeper meaning worth seeking out. Sometimes it’s just a bit silly.Brazilian conceptualist Laura Lima would rather call it absurd. Her show at theICA– her first solo presentation in the UK despite decades of international exhibitions and biennale appearances – is filled with surreal encounters, all of which are meant to jostle you out of your mundane, staid mental rut (“our habitual modes of attention”) and find meaning in the unexpected.How unexpected you find a life drawing class in an art gallery depends on your expectations, obviously. Quite expected, I’d imagine. But this one is different: not only are you allowed to participate, but everything is on wheels. Crazy. The easels and models are all placed on moving wooden platforms, which autonomously meander around the room, making you crane your neck and spin your noggin to see the model.View image in fullscreenSomewhat random … Parasol Deux at Laura Lima: The Drawing Drawing.Photograph: Anne TetzlaffIt’s all about randomness and chaos, says the handout, but how random and chaotic is it really? All the references to chance, unpredictability and “Epicurus’s atomist theory” are undermined by the fact that the platforms are all giant roombas with sensors. They spin around a predefined area in a preprogrammed way. It’s only chaotic and unpredictable if you don’t actually think about it.And if the idea instead is to make you look at things from different perspectives, I’d argue that doing it by making you sit at a giant spinning easel is pretty heavy-handed.There are a set of keys on the floor in the next room, with a human arm poking out under the wall trying to grab them. At first it just about works: it’s absurd, funny. But then you start looking for the meaning that’s meant to be hidden in the periphery and it just falls apart. Is the idea that meaning is just out of reach, there but ultimately ungraspable? Then why does the hand eventually reach the keys, grab them and then chuck them back out? All it’s saying is that meaning is only out of reach because you’ve made it bloody difficult for yourself.View image in fullscreenDifficult to grasp … Ascenseur at Laura Lima: The Drawing Drawing at the ICA, London.Photograph: Anne TetzlaffUpstairs, a red parasol on motorised wheels dances around the gallery. Next door a fridge holds images frozen in ice which you’re meant to take out and defrost in order to see. It’s not hugely worth it.Lima is big on making you find significance in the unexpected without nudging you towards any actual substance. But that’s a convenient way of making meaningless work while telling viewers they’re just not looking hard enough.If she said “Hey, this is just absurd, surreal and poetic”, it would be fine. But the whole show is so heavily loaded with half-baked philosophy and shoddy conceptualism that you don’t get to enjoy it for what it is. It’s all meant to be about process and discovery. I don’t have a problem with the form of any of it, I just don’t think it means much, says anything – or looks that good.I sat there watching people on giant roombas drawing a naked bloke with an umbrella and tried to think about Epicurus and atoms and chance. I stared at the spinning parasol, I defrosted some trays of ice. I really tried to figure it out, to find meaning and beauty. I thought serious thoughts, but only found silly art.Laura Lima: The Drawing Drawing is at the ICA, London until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtInstallationDrawingICAreviewsShareReuse this content"

The man pulls his partner towards him but she spins away, landing face to face with another woman. Now the two women dance and everything is different: bright and playful as their eyes meet. It ends in a clinch behind a bookcase. The great love is not between the woman, Mariana, and her husband, but between Mariana and Anne Lister, also known as Gentleman Jack.I’m watching this play out in a rehearsal room at Northern Ballet in Leeds, where choreographerAnnabelle Lopez Ochoais in the midst of creating a ballet version of Gentleman Jack, as popularised inSally Wainwright’s hit TV series(Wainwright is a consultant on the ballet). Lister was a 19th-century landowner running her family’s estate in Halifax, but is better known for the diaries that revealed her passionate lesbian love affairs and for boldly living an unconventional life for the times.The teacher turned around and said to me: ‘You with your big mouth – you’re gonna get into trouble’Lopez Ochoa, who is Belgian-Colombian and lives in Amsterdam, had never heard of Lister when the ballet was proposed to her, but after binge-watching the series she said yes. “The woman, I mean, she’s a force!” says Lopez Ochoa. “She is audacious. She is in her power. She’s unafraid, inspiring. There is a little bit of edge to her. She’s not very kind, she’s not a hero – but that’s what makes her interesting.”The ballet focuses on the two most important women in Lister’s life. Mariana Lawton was Lister’s great love across 20 years, but she followed convention (and financial security) and married a man. Later came Ann Walker – she and Lister took holy communion together, in an act of commitment before God they considered a “marriage”, and lived together until Lister’s death in 1840.View image in fullscreen‘She used her brains to get what she wanted’ … Suranne Jones in the TV version of Gentleman Jack.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyWhat Lopez Ochoa appreciates about Lister is her smarts: “How she behaved around men to get what she wanted. She really used her brains. This I could relate to, in this male-dominated choreographic world, where I had always the feeling that I had to prove myself.”Lopez Ochoa could also relate to not being “conventionally” feminine. As a child, she would wear her brothers’ clothes, and people often thought she was a boy. “The kids of the neighbourhood were trying to feel my crotch to check,” she says. “So I was sent to ballet – because I did not behave nor look like a girl.” You can see in photos, she says, how after two years of dancing her body had changed. “The physiognomy of my face, everything – I looked more feminine.” She lifts her chin in a balletic pose.Lopez Ochoa didn’t lose her assertiveness, though, and nor did people stop telling her to change. She remembers being 17, in a ballet class, and saying out loud that the choreography was uncomfortable. “The teacher turned around and said, ‘You with your big mouth, you’re gonna get into trouble.’” But Lopez Ochoa got into choreography instead. “Nothing can really change you,” she says. “I’m still the tomboy. I just don’t look like it. But your thought process stays the same.”Over the last two decades, she has created more than 100 dances for companies around the world, including ballets based on the lives ofFrida Kahlo, Coco Chanel and Eva Perón, so she knows about making portraits of strong and complicated women. In terms of creating Lister through dance, Lopez Ochoa says it came step by step as they developed the work, rather than being decided in advance. The dancers cast in the lead role (Gemma Coutts, Amber Lewis and Nida Aydinoğlu) are women who “dared to take up the space”, says Lopez Ochoa. “They were fearless, and not afraid of being ‘ugly’ in classical ballet terms.”View image in fullscreenNo pointes … Annabelle Lopez Ochoa in rehearsals.Photograph: Colleen MairIn the same way that the real Lister wore men’s clothes, the dancer playing Lister will wear flat shoes rather than pointes (except for in the communion scene), which means she can be more grounded when partnering the other women. The women can’t do the same big lifts a man would, so they’re having to work out other ways to create climactic moments.Romantic female pas de deux are a rarity in ballet and Lopez Ochoa is aiming to avoid cliche, including the acrobatic splits you often see in passionate duets. “It’s just going to be different, curvier, more sinuous,” she says. Do they kiss? Not yet, she says, there are movements to express love better, but perhaps after the “wedding” scene. Are the dancers cool with it? “Yeah, I thought they were going to be much more reserved,” she says, “but I came here last year to workshop with them and they were like, ‘Let’s get raunchy!’”The TV series has an ardent fanbase. It has even beenlife-changing for some womenwho’ve realised – or made peace with – their own sexuality after hearing Lister’s story. Lopez Ochoa hopes the same thing could be true for ballet, where there are many out gay men but, for example, a lesbian dancer Lopez Ochoa knows still feels she can’t widely come out. “When I told her I was doing Gentleman Jack as a ballet,” says Lopez Ochoa, “she was bawling.”Gentleman Jack is atLeeds Grand theatre, 7-14 March; thentouringExplore more on these topicsDanceBalletNorthern BalletSally WainwrightTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

People are groping about in the darkness, waiting for their eyes to adjust, though most give up and start navigating by the light of their smartphones, trying to find Pierre Huyghe’s new work without quite realising they are already in it. Huyghe’s Liminals is more than just a film projected on a towering screen in a gutted power station. It is a quantum experiment, a mythological journey and a terrifying vision, set to a shifting thrum of gut-wobbling vibrations, a sizzling aural rain of dancing particles and sudden ear-splitting crackles which ricochet everywhere. You can’t always tell what’s happening on the screen and what’s happening in the cavernous space around you.View image in fullscreenDistances are hard to gauge … film still from Pierre Huyghe’s Liminals, at Halle am Berghain, Berlin.Photograph: Pierre Huyghe. Photo  Andrea Rossetti © VG BildI could feel the vibrations even on the street outside, looking up at the brooding hulk of the defunct 1950s power and heating plant that once serviced the socialist paradise of postwar East Berlin. Now the home of the world’s most famous techno venue,Berghain, it also hosts a queer sex club, dark spaces and bars, while the plant’s former boiler room, the Halle am Berghain, with its columns and suspended coal chutes, has currently been taken over by theLAS Art Foundationto stage a number of exhibitions, including Huyghe’s Liminals.Light comes and goes on the screen, never quite enough to let you sense the volume of the space you have entered. Distances are hard to gauge. A delicate hand emerges on the screen, not quite in colour, not quite in black and white. There’s a body here that’s almost human, in a bleak, desiccated landscape utterly devoid of life. It might as well be Mars. A female face with short cropped hair appears: except there is no face, just a yawning dark cavity scooped out between chin and brow. This is more than disconcerting. Suddenly everything tilts and there’s a roaring, flickering abyss opening up, and we see the same figure tiny and distant on the rim of an even greater, all-consuming void. Globs of light turn in space and are gone again. There is a great deal of aural and visual interference and everything hangs for a moment on the brink of total collapse. These anomalies and glitches in space and time are to do with Huyghe’s engagement with quantum mechanics, and the conversations he has been having, through the LAS Foundation, with physicists and philosophers. Artists often read or misread philosophy or science – whether it isMartin HeideggerorWerner Heisenberg– as if it were poetry, and there’s nothing wrong with that.View image in fullscreenAll too human … film still from Pierre Huyghe’s Liminals, at Halle am Berghain, Berlin.Photograph: Pierre Huyghe/VG Bild-Kunst, BonnWatching Huyghe’s more or less human character navigate an entirely indifferent world is a painful experience. They seem all too human, as the camera homes in on their dirty hands and mottled skin, their cuts and grazes, their breasts and a caesarean scar, their vulnerable nakedness, made somehow more awkward and unsettling by being coded female. Sometimes going on hands and knees, sometimes walking purposefully, sometimes as inert on the ground as a beached fish, sometimes furrowing the ground with their head, or hitting their forehead against the earth, sometimes sitting and contemplating their hands with the eyes they don’t have; the sounds of scurrying and crawling, of granular sifting and the displacement of small stones make the whole thing both believable and extremely abject. Is this a person or an avatar? At one point they approach a gnarly outcrop of rock and penetrate the void in their head with it, moving back and forth, a cyclical, rhythmic motion that is both bizarre and awful to watch. Is this to do withHeisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle? Search me. At another point the figure’s hands become unnaturally malleable, their fingers curling and twisting the wrong way and becoming peculiarly attenuated.The camera dwells on shapes in the rocks, on shadows and silhouettes. I see a human profile here, a pair of lips and a whole face there, accidental gargoyles staring back, not unlike Willem de Kooning’s sculptures, or Francis Bacon’s painted heads. Seeking out expressions, we project them on to the inanimate. Something else shimmers in the murk, but it is less likely gold than a turd. I also thought of Samuel Beckett’s How It Is, and of endlessly crawling through mud, and good old-fashioned existential dread. Speaking with Huyghe after spending an hour in Liminals, he said it was good to take one step towards cliche, but never two.View image in fullscreenGlobs of light turn in space and are gone again … film still from Pierre Huyghe’s Liminals, at Halle am Berghain, Berlin.Photograph: Pierre Huyghe/VG Bild-Kunst, BonnSo much of this new work relates to earlier sculptures and films by the French artist. I thought of the macaque monkey, dressed as a waitress and wearing a female, human mask in his 2014 filmUntitled (Human Mask), set in an abandoned restaurant near the Fukushima nuclear exclusion zone, and the concrete replica of a 19th-century reclining nude sculpture byMax Weber, with its head encased in a live beehive, as part of Huyghe’sUntilledat Documenta 13 in 2012.What’s on the screen and what’s happening in the space around me get confused. What is happening in the here-and-now of Liminals relates back to Huyghe’s earlier work, an entire world becoming more rounded with each new work. This is deliberate on Huyghe’s part. For all the talk of quantum mechanics, of the collapse of the wave form, of waves and particles (which is how we’ve always been thinking about light) what seems to me to matter here is a kind of porousness, between past and present, things and images, insides and outsides. One of the reasons the artist wanted to show at Berghain was to echo the activities elsewhere in the building, the bodies dancing, people desiring and craving and losing themselves in music and in sex, in spaces that are both limitless and bounded. Liminals has lodged in my head, and won’t go away. How alive it all is, how unhinging.Pierre Huyghe: Liminals is at Halle am Berghain, Berlin, until 8 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtBerlinreviewsShareReuse this content"

Traditionally, international tourists start to arrive with the blossoms in spring – but thanks to the opening of Pokémon’s first ever amusement park on 5 February, this year, they are likely to come earlier.Unlike the rollercoaster-filled thrills of Tokyo Disney Sea or Universal StudiosJapanin Osaka, PokéPark Kanto is essentially a forest populated by models of the creatures from the perennially popular games. Nestled in the quiet Tokyo suburb of Inagi, half an hour from the city centre, the park is a walkable forest with more than 600 Pokémonin it. Where the Mario-themed Super Nintendo World slots neatly into the massive Universal Studios Japan, PokéPark Kanto is hidden in the back of the less glitzy, funfair-esque Japanese theme park Yomiuri Land.Taking up 26,000 sq metres, the family-friendly attraction is divided into two main areas: Pokémon Forest and the plaza-esque Sedge Town. Tickets for the park are bought via a lottery system – and currently sold out for the next three months – ranging between ¥7,900 (£38) for a standard adult ticket and ¥14,000 (£66) for a queue-skipping priority pass.The park’s creative direction has been overseen by one of the original Pokémon creators, Junichi Masuda. Visitors roam a series of explorable habitats, littered with endearingly lifelike statues of hundreds of Pokémon, arranged in fun tableaus where various species are interacting with each other. Walking through PokéPark Kanto feels akin to becoming a Pokédex-clutching David Attenborough, a re-creation of what it would be like to observe these fantastical creatures in the wild. Beaver-esque Bidoofs use their two front teeth to cut down a real tree. Worm-like Diglett burrow above the soil to greet a smiling Eevee.Each Pokémon is presented in full scale too, making the larger creatures especially awe-inspiring. From a lorry-sized re-creation of the rocky behemoth Onix to a herd of rhinoceros-sized Rhyhorns lining the main path, each habitat is a joy to behold, with hidden creatures dotted throughout the trees and grass as a reward for eagle-eyed kids.View image in fullscreenEach Pokémon is presented in full scale … PokéPark Kanto.Illustration: PoképarkIn many ways, it’s surprising it has taken this long for a permanent Pokémon theme park to be erected. With Pikachu and pals celebrating their 30th anniversary this year, Pokémon is still comfortably the highest-grossing media brand in the world: its total estimated lifetime revenue of $150bn comfortably surpasses Disney properties such as Star Wars and Marvel. The Pokémon company’s profit rose to ¥70.3bn in the year ending February 2025 – roughly £337m – and with a range of new games, merchandise and the new theme park, its profits in 2026 are only likely to increase.After clearing the Pokémon forest, visitors are greeted by a Pokémon parade in Sedge Town square, where there are also Pokémon-themed versions of fairground games such as ring toss, Pokémon-themed food, and an Eevee-themed carousel. Visitors can also walk into a real-life Pokémon Centre (an iconic building from the games and anime) and grab a seat at a gym where they can watch a live Pokémon battle that blends human performers with cutting-edge animatronics.The Pokémon Company has numerous Pokémon Centre shops all over Japan selling exclusive merchandise. PokéPark Kanto will continue this lucrative trend, selling plushies and clothing that people will have to travel there to own. Video games are huge business in Japan, one of the country’s main cultural exports – but theme parks based on the country’s virtual stars are a newer phenomenon. Since Super Nintendo World first opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in 2021, it has been transplanted to Universal’s parks in Hollywood and Florida, with all locations helping to drivemulti-billion dollar quarterly revenues.Thanks to a weak yen post-pandemic, recent years have seen tourists flock to Japan. While it has been a boon to the economy, the flood of incomers has led to tension. Fromphone-camera-weilding influencers behaving badly, to overcrowded streets inconveniencing locals, the 42 million visitors who arrived in Japan in 2025 have come alongsidea notable nationwide rise in anti-foreigner sentiment. Newly appointed prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is already doubling down on anti-tourist legislation. It’s safe to say that PokéPark Kanto, with its family-friendly international appeal, will only increase visitors to Japan’s overcrowded capital.Explore more on these topicsGamesPokémonTheme parksJapannewsShareReuse this content"

It’s all great, but if you want to see how impactful Dunbar’s playing was on the sound, head straight to the title track. The beat he plays is complex, a world away from the “one-drop” rhythm that had predominated in reggae: so complex, in fact, that Dunbar claimed other drummers initially refused to believe he’d actually played it, assuming some kind of studio trickery was involved. “Then everybody started trying for that style,” he added, “and it soon become established.”Sly Dunbar, reggae drummer and producer with Sly and Robbie, dies aged 73Read moreJunior Murvin – Police and Thieves (1976)The sound of Sly without Robbie – the bass here was played by veteran reggae artist Boris Gardiner, alas best-known in the UK for his fairly drippy 1986 No 1 I Wanna Wake Up With You. With astonishingly tight fills, Dunbar drumming provides a solid foundation beneath Murvin’s eerie, careworn falsetto and a backing track that seems to shimmer with echo. Dunbar also said he played drums on Bob Marley’s PunkyReggaeParty, a song inspired by the Clash’s cover of Police and Thieves.Culture – Two Sevens Clash (1977)Sly played drums on Culture’s Two Sevens Clash, unequivocally one of the greatest roots reggae albums ever made. It’s packed with incredible songs – I’m Alone in the Wilderness, Black Starliner Must Come, Calling Rasta Far I – but the greatest of the lot is the title track, which prophesises an apocalyptic event on 7 July 1977 “when past injustices would be avenged” according to the sleeve notes, and is sung in full belief that the world was about to be transformed. It wasn’t, but the sheer force of Culture’s faith – their sweet harmonies interrupted by singer Joseph Hill’s shouts and imprecations – can still knock you backwards.Grace Jones – Pull Up to the Bumper (1981)You can honestly take your pick of any of the tracks Sly and Robbie recorded withGrace Jonesas part of Compass Point Studios’ house band – from their surprisingly funky reinvention of the Normal’s Warm Leatherette to the fabulously tough Nipple to the Bottle – but let’s plump for the most famous. The genius of the music on Pull Up to the Bumper is the way it exists in a space bordered by dub, disco, electro-pop and post-punk, but that is ultimately entirely its own: it just doesn’t sound like anything else. And Sly’s drumming is magnificent, from the bursts of martial snare that open the track to the implausible humid-sounding groove he conjures up, that marries a hint of reggae lope to an insistent dancefloor pulse.Bob Dylan – Jokerman (1983)As sessioneers, Sly and Robbie were incredibly adaptable, so their discography is nothing if not eclectic – it takes in everyone from Bunny Wailer to Britney Spears. But nonetheless, there’s something pretty unexpected about their period as Bob Dylan’s rhythm section (they were, apparently, recruited at Dylan’s own suggestion). On the opening track of 1983’s Infidels, they gently infuse the biblical imagery with Jamaican spirit: it’s done so beautifully, with such a light touch, that it feels organic and natural, the opposite of the clumsy lunges at reggae made by a lot of rock artists in the 70s and 80s.Gwen Guthrie – Padlock (1985)Sly and Robbie produced Gwen Guthrie’s early albums – and Dunbar programmed the drums on Guthrie’s big hit, Ain’t Nothin’ Goin’ on But the Rent, but the Padlock EP, featuring Larry Levan’s remixes of tracks from her album Portrait, is the real jewel among her Compass Point All Stars-assisted work. Its title track is just magnificent: it was a superb song to start off with, and Levan’s mix clearly bears the influence of dub, stripping the music back, drenching everything in echo and foregrounding Dunbar’s unshowy, but supremely funky drumming, a decision that seems to be reflected on the sleeve, where Sly’s name appearsabovethat of the singer.Sly and Robbie – Boops (Here to Go) (1987)Sly and Robbie’s biggest UK hit as artists was both supremely cool and utterly irresistible: featuring a splendidly laconic rap by Shinehead, it wasn’t hip-hop, although, with its interpolations from both Rossini’s Barber of Seville and Ennio Morricone’s theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, it definitely felt at least slightly adjacent to the sample-heavy collages of Double Dee and Steinski. And the rumbling funk of the rhythm track is fantastic.Chaka Demus and Pliers – Bam Bam/Murder She Wrote (1992)Sly and Robbie were all over Tease Me, the album that briefly turned dancehall duo Chaka Demus and Pliers into mainstream stars: largely co-produced and co-written by Shakespeare and Dunbar, it spawned five UK Top 20 singles. It was a concerted push for crossover pop success but that didn’t preclude experimentation: both the cover of “Toots” Hibbert’s reggae standard Bam Bam and Murder She Wrote use a riddim that features Sly alone – there’s no bass at all, just a beat that bears the audible influence of Indian tabla playing – and which subsequently turned up on countless reggae tracks in 1992.Explore more on these topicsReggaePop and rockGrace JonesBob DylanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But one faithful stood out for her quiet determination, despite a ceaseless onslaught of suspicion and accusation. That person was Jade Scott, and I wasn’t at all surprised when, quite early on in the series, she revealed she was a keen gamer.“Minecraft was my way in, when I was 15,” she says. “I made loads of friends at school playing that.” From this innocent introduction, however, she moved on to darker titles: the first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and the multiplayer battle-arena game Dota. “That’s where my interest in strategy gaming really kicked in,” she says.The Traitors is, after all, a game in a way that other reality TV shows aren’t. It’s heavily inspired by the parlour game variously known as werewolf or mafia, in which participants use social deduction skills to identify a murderer in their midst. Indeed, the original version of the show, the Dutch series De Verraders, emerged after the first Covid lockdown, during which hundreds of thousands of people had discovered the multiplayer online game Among Us, in which a group of players have to carry out menial tasks on a spaceship while working out which of them is a killer. So a video game player would have an advantage in The Traitors, right?View image in fullscreenSurvival adventure … Project Winter.Photograph: Other Ocean InteractiveIn the year up to appearing on the show Scott had been playing two indie games based around social deduction: the survival adventure Project Winter and the office satire, Dale & Dawson Stationery Supplies. Both require groups of players to carry out a range of tasks in a high-tension environment, while a select few are there to sabotage progress. The honest workers must discover and unmask the miscreants before it’s too late. She was, effectively, in training to be a faithful.“I always wanted to go in as a faithful,” she confirms. “My opinion has changed on this since leaving the castle, but I always thought the game was way harder for the faithfuls and I like playing games on a harder setting. As a faithful you’re trying to solve who the traitors are, but as a traitor, I thought you lost out on that puzzle-solving aspect. My strategy was to go in and immediately garnersomesuspicion, because that way you’re protected from murder … I just didn’t realise how much suspicion I would get!”Indeed, Scott was a constant target of accusations and suspicion. It was difficult. With gaming, you sit behind a screen, and communicating via Discord, so you just start talking and build friendly relationships with people, but with The Traitors, you have nothing to hide behind. It was a very different environment in which to think about strategy and how I communicate with people.”So did the tactics she’d learned playing games such as Project Winter and Dale & Dawson immediately fall apart? “I was quite good at defending myself at the roundtable,” she says. “A lot of that came out of the practice I got with social deception games. The second you approach the table with some logic and reasoning, and say, ‘I understand why you think that, but I have done nothing to suggest it’, they have nothing to argue with. I also didn’t feel I had anything to prove to anyone – I think, when you’re on the defensive, it makes it worse if you go around and try to mingle. I was thinking, if I go up and speak to this person does it just look like I’m trying to get in their good books?”View image in fullscreenConstant target … Jade Scott (third from left, top) at the roundtable in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAOne aspect Scott definitely took from playing strategy sims was observing the mechanics of the game and making notes. “I had different formats,” she says. “Every day I had a sort of traffic light system of how I felt about each person. Green indicated who I thought was a faithful, although you’re never 100 per cent sure – and inevitably those people would just get murdered! Red was who I was more convinced was a traitor at that point. I also wrote everyone’s names on a piece of paper and then I’d draw lines between them, based on who I saw having conversations – a bit like those cork boards TV detectives use, with the red lines between photos. I’ve alluded to this previously, but I’d stare and stare at that page and the only contestants I hadn’t drawn lines between were Rachel and Stephen. I was so busy working out ways to defend myself … you just miss the obvious, don’t you?”The Traitors to get ‘bold and surprising’ adaptation for stageRead moreSince leaving The Traitors castle, Scott says she hasn’t played a social deduction game – perhaps she’s done with fielding other people’s suspicions. Now she’s moved on to games such as Outer Wilds and Blue Prince, which pitch you against strange puzzling environments rather than other human beings. There’s been another interesting effect of her time on The Traitors, though. Currently studying for a PhD, she thinks her experiences at the sharp end of the roundtable have been extremely useful for one particular aspect. “Something I’ve been really apprehensive about, and I think a lot of PhD students are the same, is the viva,” she says. “You literally sit in a room with examiners and have to defend your thesis. Well, I’ve really learned how to defend myself and argue a point!”Explore more on these topicsGamesTelevisionThe TraitorsSimulation gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is an offer of Peace and Love. All the music I have made during the last 62 years is yours to hear. You can renew for free as long as you are in Greenland. We do hope other organisations will follow in the spirit of our example. LOVE EARTH.”On 22 January, US president Donald Trump walked back his insistence on claiming “right, title and ownership” of Greenland and said that the“framework of a future deal”with the territory had been reached. He also withdrewthe threat of tariffsagainst eight European countries after Nato allies deployed troops in response to Trump threatening to take the Arctic island by force.Young’s offering came as he reiterated his objection to Amazon on the basis of CEO Jeff Bezos’s support of Donald Trump. In 2024,Amazon donated $1mto Trump’s inaugural fund. In October, Young announced he would be removing his music from the corporation’s streaming platform, Amazon Music (his CDs and vinyl records remain available to buy).“Amazon is owned by Jeff Bezos, a billionaire backer of the president,” Young wrote this week. “The president’s international policies and his support of ICE make it impossible for me to ignore his actions. If you feel as I do, I strongly recommend that you do not useAmazon. There are many ways to avoid Amazon and support individual Americans and American companies that supply the same products. I have done that with my music and people who are looking can find it in other places.”Young advised would-be listeners to purchase his LPs and CDs from record stores and to find alternative digital options to stream his music – although he has previously spoken out against most of the major streaming companies.In 2022, Young removed his music from Spotify in protest at Joe Rogan’s podcast, which the platform then hosted exclusively, after the presenter spread misinformation about Covid. In 2024, however,Young returned to Spotify, shortly after Rogan’s podcast became available on platforms including Amazon, Apple and YouTube.Our 2026 listening resolutions: from Radiohead to Kendrick Lamar, critics try to get into music they’ve never likedRead moreAt the time, Young wrote on his website: “My decision comes as music services Apple and Amazon have started serving the same disinformation podcast features I had opposed at Spotify. I cannot just leave Apple and Amazon, like I did Spotify, because my music would have very little streaming outlet to music lovers at all, so I have returned to Spotify.”In his new post, Young wrote that his decision to pull his music from Amazon Music was “unfortunately harmful to my record company in the short term but I think the message I am sending is important and clear.”Earlier this month, Young made three posts deploring the actions of ICE in Minneapolis, including the fatal shooting of Renee Good.Young wroteof Trump that “every move he makes is to build instability so he can stay in power”.Young recently announced aEuropean summer tourkicking off at the Eden Project in Cornwall on 17 June.

I’ve got to programme shows that sell tickets. I’ve got to have a narrative.”The story she’s telling at the National seems to be one of bold, inventive theatre that is not afraid to court big names and take risks by putting someone like Oh, who recently made heroperatic debut at the Metin New York at the Met and has been playingOlivia in Twelfth Night at the Delacortein Central Park, on her stages.Rubasingham said: “From bold new voices to international collaborators, this is a year that celebrates the full breadth of talent on our stages and behind the scenes. It’s a privilege to stage work that theatrically explodes, surprises and challenges us to see the world anew.“Bringing this range of exhilarating productions to audiences in the UK and around the globe is what the National Theatre is all about.”War Horse, which premiered in 2007 and has been on an extensive tour, will also return to the Southbank in May with a run on at the Olivier Theatre as it approaches its 20th anniversary.There will also be two Broadway transfers with Robert Hastie’s Hamlet and Alexander Zeldin’s The Other Place trying their luck on this side of the Atlantic.Explore more on these topicsNational TheatreTheatreCate BlanchettLetitia WrightLesley ManvilleEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In this climate, the Lit in Colour campaign is even more essential to ensuring that books by authors of colour are on the curriculum.”Lit in Colour, led by Penguin Random House and the Runnymede Trust thinktank on race equality and race relations, is a partnership between educational and cultural organisations and England’s four exam boards.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “As part of the government’s response to the curriculum and assessment review we will ensure that alongside classic English literature the curriculum will allow space for teachers to choose a wider range of texts and authors.”Meanwhile, Lee Child, the bestselling author of the Jack Reacher series of thrillers, has been named as the first prison reading laureate. The role, which covers prisons in England and Wales, has been created to highlight the importance of improving literacy among prisoners to help prevent reoffending.Child plans to expand a literacy pilot programme he has beenrunning in a number of prisonsand will be inviting more authors to participate.“This isn’t about being soft on crime, it’s about being smart,” he said. “Improving literacy is an evidence-based, practical approach that works. When people leave prison better equipped to read and learn, they’re less likely to reoffend. That makes communities safer for everyone.”The new one-year role has been created as part of the National Year of Reading, a UK-wide campaign to boost reading among children and adults.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsEnglish and creative writingGCSEsCurriculumsBernardine EvaristoRaceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Both raised by the sea in Busan, they studied in Seoul before entering the city’s famously brutal rat race, Sunwoo as a fashion journalist, Hana as a copywriter. They shared the same taste in music and books, and importantly, both had rejected marriage. No wonder. In South Korea’s stubbornly patriarchal culture,women in dual-income families spend nearly three hours more a day on household chores than men. Instead, Sunwoo and Hana joined thelarge numberof South Koreans living alone. At first, independence felt exhilarating. By middle age however, loneliness was beginning to gnaw, and their boxy studio apartments felt oppressively small.Two Women Living Together, a 2019 South Korean bestseller that spawned a popular podcast, charts Sunwoo and Hana’s decision to buy a sunlit house together and live not as a romantic couple but as friends. Across 49 warm, chatty essays, they invite us into the life they share with four cats, reflecting on everything from the food they love to their retirement fantasies.Like any couple, theirs is a life of quiet joys and outsized irritations. Hana is a minimalist; Sunwoo, like a “crow that collects shiny things”, owns so many clothes her wardrobe breaks. They bicker about laundry protocols, New Year rituals, whether the house must be ruthlessly tidied before a big trip (of course it must!). Much is amusingly recognisable. After one argument, Sunwoo retreats to her room scrolling property apps and fantasising about leaving. Only when she realises she cannot face the hassle of uprooting herself does she slink out to make amends. Yet, as Sunwoo writes, we “may be stuck in an endless cycle of disappointment and forgiveness, but we never stop pinning our hopes on each other”.Beneath the warmth lies a radical proposition: that their partnership should be treated like any family. When Sunwoo is hospitalised for surgery, Hana becomes her “primary guardian”, yet is ineligible for the free flu vaccine offered to employees’ families at Sunwoo’s workplace. Their relationship is invisible on official paperwork. “If only there were an option that connotes greater responsibility and trust than ‘friend’,” they write – “‘life companion’, perhaps.” In South Korea, where same-sex marriage is not recognised, those living in households with friends or as unmarried partners do not have access to equal tax benefits, welfare support, authority in medical emergencies or even the right to act as “chief mourner” at funerals.In 2025, progressives introduced a billto secure rights for cohabiting partners and friends, arguing that widening the definition of “family” could address the effects of the plummeting birthrate, including an epidemic of loneliness and a care-gap. The conservative government blocked it. Still, there are green shoots:a recent changeallows census respondents to describe themselves as “cohabiting partners”, a victory for LGBTQ+ groups that nevertheless leaves people like Sunwoo and Hana unrecognised.The book is not without its frustrations. Some essays feel like filler. A proud cat-owner, even my patience was tested by the pages devoted to their pets. As a portrait of friendship, it is generous and witty; as an examination of a growing social phenomenon, I wanted more context. Is there a tradition in South Korea of unmarried, divorced or widowed women living together for mutual support, as happenedin Britain and Europe for centuries? How do neighbours respond? Do people assume it’s a same-sex relationship? Are single men making similar choices, or is this kind of cohabitation even more taboo for them?Interest in “platonic partnerships” is growing worldwide, as people try to cope with soaring housing costs and the unravelling of family-centred care. In France, cohabitating friends and couples can already enter aPacte Civil de Solidaritéoffering legal protections. Germany’s previous government proposedVerantwortungsgemeinschaft(“responsibility companionship”) allowing up to six non-related people to pledge mutual care, though the new coalition is unlikely to pursue it. In the absence of legal recognition, stories like Sunwoo and Hana’s matter, making visible the growing number of people turning to friends as their primary source of stability, companionship and care, and demonstrating all the many ways of being a family.Two Women Living Together by Kim Hana and Hwang Sunwoo, translated by Gene Png, is published by Doubleday (£16.99).

While the Seasonal Quartet playfully anatomised the social fracture of post-Brexit Britain, and immediate predecessorGliffdealt with the violence of the securitised state, Glyph, in its explicit engagement with the Israeli government’sapartheidandgenocidein Palestine, raises the ethical stakes decisively. To engage in a Smithian pun – this is Art in the Age of Mechanical Mass Destruction.As with most Ali Smith novels, Glyph’s primary power comes from its commitment to excavating the sediments of language; its etymological resonance and inference. For example, the primary relationship of Petra and Patch is lightly drawn: playful, delicate and tender. But it was their names rather than their characterisation that lingered with me long after reading. Petra, from the Greek for stone, with its echoes of scale, solidity, authority; contrasting with Patch, meaning to repair, with its echoes of care, survival, persistence. In a novel so actively engaged with one of the “longest and deadliest military occupations in modern history”, their names provide a perpetual and deeply affecting drumbeat, stark and dissonant.In Glyph we see a major British writer answering the call of the day when so many others have equivocated or turned awaySimilarly, two of the central images of the novel draw their potency directly from the everyday horror of expansionist slaughter. The two sisters hear a story from the second world war, about a young soldier flattened by a tank whose body is left to rot in the road. Later they begin to half-seriously communicate with his ghost, calling him Glyph. On the one hand, Smith is playing with the question of what makes a character “flat” versus what makes one three-dimensional. On the other, especially when many readers will haveimages and reportsof similar deaths in Palestine so firmly in mind, Smith is raising ethically substantive questions about representations of the dead, about who gets to speak and who is decisively silenced. When Patch’s teenage daughter watches a distressing video of a horse trapped under tons of rubble, she notes that it was “probably Gaza”; as readers,we are left in little doubt.Nor are we in any doubt when we encounter exasperated, despairing descriptions of thethousands of people killed in Gaza while seeking “aid”: “did you hear about the people queueing for food and the snipers shooting at them and how the snipers doing this aren’t just shooting at people randomly, they are also playing a kind of shooting game? So some days they shoot people in the hands, some days the heads?”That quote continues on, listing various other body parts; an incredulous, horrified, breathless tumble of words. Smith’s tonal skill as a writer is also used to great effect when dealing with the bureaucratic, authoritarian absurdity of the British state. Patch’s daughter, presumably keen that the government do something other than write a strongly worded cheque in response to Israeli war crimes, is arrested for waving a scarf “aggressively”. Her mother is later informed that “scarf waving is not in itself a specific criminal offence unless the waving of a particular scarf relates to a proscribed organisation … it was thought that the scarf waved like a flag by your daughter could have been said to be in tacit support of a newly proscribed organisation and officers at the scene must now consider any gesture toward this new proscription in this light”.It is a bold move to be so morally unflinching, especially in the face of a perceived aesthetic orthodoxy that so often privileges distance and irony, but in Glyph we see a major British writer answering the call of the day when so many others have equivocated or turned away. There is also something about Smith’s relentless focus on language that makes her particularly well suited to the task. As Orwell reminded us: “political language ... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind”. Smith’s sensibility is fine-tuned to grapple with the avalanche of passive-voice headlines, asymmetric categorisations, outright linguistic inversions and semantic absurdities that have accompanied the increasingly desperate attempts to justify the unjustifiable.Glyph is described as “family” to its predecessor, Gliff, connected mainly by a mood and a homophone. It is typical of Smith that from the title onwards, we are drawn in by a playful flourish, a pun, only to have the heart of the matter revealed to us once we engage fully with the language itself. Gliff, a vernacular Scottish word meaning to glimpse briefly, or to be startled suddenly, sits alongside Glyph, which means to carve, mark or engrave. From the outset, then, we are in no doubt: we have moved from the fleeting to the permanent, from the passing image to the inscribed and the indelible. We have moved from observers to witnesses. No matter the darkness, we can never say we did not see.Glyph by Ali Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton (£20). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Once again, he’s not the protagonist but a sinister figure first met literally in the shadows, making ominous pronouncements in that posh-boy accent. When finally revealed, he is dipping his chin and looking up with those uncannily blue eyes like a vogue dancer catching the spotlight. If he keeps at it with roles like this, he could be the Peter Cushing of modern horror, but with catwalk-queen hair, or the goth equivalent of the young Ralph Fiennes in his rent-a-villain era. What’s not to love?View image in fullscreenJamie Campbell Bower as Alexander Babtiste in Witchboard.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyWhen Campbell Bower’s creepy antiquities expert Alexander Babtiste isn’t around, though, Witchboard reverts to its cheap and doleful resting form, in which B- and C-list actors play doltish young people bewitched by a proto-Ouija board that summons the spirit of a 17th-century French witch (Antonia Desplat). Somehow, the board has found its way to today’sNew Orleans, where main girl Emily (Madison Iseman) finds it in the forest while foraging for mushrooms with her hipster-chef boyfriend Christian (Aaron Dominguez). At the urging of Christian’s slinky ex-girlfriend, Brooke (Mel Jarnson), who crashes their party, Emily tries out the board, and is soon having flashbacks to a life she never lived.Tacky as all this is, the fact that the flashbacks are in French adds a slight tang of authenticity, as do the scenes in Christian’s kitchen, where he and his crew prepare for their restaurant to open. (Someone on the production did some research, or at least watched a few seasons of The Bear.) Much less convincing are the shots involving a malevolent maine coon that attacks a drug dealer and turns into a blur of fake cat and visual effects. But the moment is so gloriously cheesy and ridiculous that on its own it almost makes this something worth paying for.Witchboard is on digital platforms from 2 FebruaryThis article was amended on 27 January to correct the star rating.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsNew OrleansreviewsShareReuse this content"

Based on afreak August 1967 tragedyin which two women were separately mauled to death by grizzlies in Montana’s Glacier National Park (described here as a “trillion to one” occurrence), Burke Doeren’s debut grips in tooth’n’claw terms, but is considerably less sure-footed when it comes to people.Down at the park, fire season is all the rangers think they have on their plate, but they’re not reckoning with wayward teenagers and rogue bears. At the giftshop, Michele (Ali Skovbye) leans on Paul (Jacob Buster) to join her posse and help her shoo off an unwanted suitor at Trout Lake. So he leaves colleague Julie (Brec Bassinger) to a sexy bivouac with boyfriend Roy (Matt Lintz) in a separate location. Meanwhile, with smoke plumes occupying the rangers, rookie Joan (Lauren Call) is commandeered to lead a tour group heading out to a remote lodge.The initial attack – with Julie and Roy caught prone in sleeping bags – conveys with horrendous immediacy what being at the mercy of a quarter-ton of fur and muscle must be like. And Doeren further hammers home the verisimilitude, using the visitors’ lodge to firmly establish the geography and vulnerability of the nervy rescue mission – protected only by a fire bucket – to reach screaming Julie. Doeren cranks up this near-forensic grasp of the predicament by his focus on the inflicted injuries: doctor-in-the-house John (Oded Fehr) battles to stop Roy bleeding out, while it falls to Paul to pick up the pieces at Trout Lake.Given the unsparing realism in the heat of the moment, it’s a pity the framing for the creature feature is so unconvincing. Shot with the overlit streaming-era sunburst look, the 1960s setting feels ersatz – and the various teen entanglements supposedly there to endear/bug us into caring about the bait are Scooby-Doo level stuff. Only Joan’s trial-by-fur to prove herself a leader carries any emotional or moral heft, though the final finger-wagging about sensible conservation is hard to disagree with. Doeren clearly has a feel for the bear necessities, but the human interest hardly gets its boots on.Grizzly Night is on digital platforms from 2 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersHorror filmsWildlifereviewsShareReuse this content"

This sobering true-life drama is a blow-by-blow account of their years-long fight for justice. The story is told with restraint, in meticulous detail – possibly too much detail – without any Erin Brockovich-type feelgood emotion, never losing sight of the heartbreak and devastation.The film begins with agonising scenes before the accident: the miners get ready to go underground, good-naturedly ribbing each other – a familiar morning routine – with no clue of what’s coming, although in cinematographer Gin Loane’s foreboding camerawork the spectacular landscape of forests and mountains looms threateningly. In the hours after the first explosion rips through the mine, the company’s CEO (Jonathon Hendry) confidently says there is enough air underground to last several days. “But we’ll have them back before then.” The lies told to families were staggering.The film centres on a friendship that develops between Anna Osborne (Melanie Lynskey) and Sonya Rockhouse (Robyn Malcolm) during the weeks and months they sit through royal commissions and public inquiries, clutching photographs of their dead. Anna’s husband and Sonya’s 21-year-old son are among the victims; one of their goals is simply to recover the bodies from the mine.At times, it feels hopeless. But eventually the victories come, sometimes from unlikely quarters, such as the family-run concrete business that refuses to supply concrete to fill the entrance of the mine. There’s a surprise cameo waiting at the end of the film. I watched the final scenes thinking that the film-makers did solid work finding someone to play a certain superstarNew Zealandpolitician – but it turns out she did the job herself.Pike River is on digital platforms from 9 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsNew ZealandMiningPeriod and historical filmsAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

His film is a gorgeous fairytale glutted with gut-wrenching moments of violence that make it strictly not suitable for kids. In one scene, a medieval feudal lord burns peasants alive in a grain store; in another, a teenage princess lashes the back of a general she blames for her father’s death to a bloody pulp.It opens in a place called Another World, an afterlife stopover for humans who have died, on their way to reincarnation. In this netherworld we meet a troupe of adorable pint-sized spirits called soul keepers, whose job is to guide the dead to the next life. The dead leave their unresolved resentments behind in Another World; they become knots tied in beautiful threads of red silk. The place is run by Goddess Mira, who despairs that after millennia of untying knots she has failed to eradicate human hate and cruelty. It’s a world beautifully animated in a kaleidoscope of trippy pastels, with some breathtaking images.One of the soul keepers, Gudo, is curious about human emotions, and the film tells the stories of the dead he helps. There is Yuri, a young girl who spends her time in Another World searching for her missing brother; and Princess Goran, mad with grief after the death of her father. Little Gudo dedicates himself to stopping a seed of evil planted in the heart of Princess Goran from sprouting, with devastating consequences for Earth and Another World.The movie is about how people ruin everything with their destructiveness, but also about the beauty of the human heart. It’s so inventive and imaginative that I wanted to love it more, but in the end found it a little bit psychologically uninvolving, perhaps because of its nonstop swirl of ideas and stories.Another World is in UK and Irish cinemas from 30 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmAnimeAnimation in filmScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

This year’s stoic and sensitive drama Frank & Louis takes us behind bars, a place we’ve been many times before at this festival, but to shadow the taxing work of inmates taking care of those who have dementia, a specifically difficult job in an already difficult place. Petra Volpe, the Swiss writer-director, who last explored a far more known form of caregiving in Late Shift, an exhausting nursing drama, makes her English-language debut with a film inspired by the “Gold Coats” peer support program at the California Men’s Colony state prison.Union County review – an affecting Will Poulter lifts quiet addiction dramaRead moreAs with her previous film, there’s real rigour to how she zeroes in on the grind of under-appreciated labour, but while Late Shift was more naturalistic and experiential, Frank & Louis is far more formulaic and emotional, a clearer bid for the heartstrings. It’s a topic that’s hard not to get emotional about, the slow loss of one’s mental abilities, something many of us might be horribly familiar with, and it’s a tough, rather hopeless experience to witness on screen.It’s one that Frank (Kingsley Ben-Adir) is inexperienced with, moving to his umpteenth prison while serving a decades-long sentence for murder. But he signs up to a care program as he awaits his parole hearing, hoping his involvement might soften the hard edges of his crime. It’s caregiving as a form of rehabilitation and I was reminded of last year’s far darker HBO documentary The Alabama Solution, which showed how inmates were forced to take on the role of rehab counselor – former addicts trying to save the lives of those still in the grip. This is far more structured but there’s a similar sense of the untrained tackling a role that would typically require a huge amount of training. Frank is thrown in at the deep end and expected not to drown, warned by a no-nonsense counselor (Indira Varma) that failure could impact negatively on his file.He’s paired with Louis (Rob Morgan), whose aggressive resistance to any form of help, even as his condition rapidly worsens, leaves Frank in a difficult spot. The two men slowly find a bond, the toughness of their learned and necessary facades slowly melting as Louis realises he needs to accept care and Frank figures out how to effectively provide it. Volpe finds poignance in their increased physical closeness – the power of a hand helping to steady – and as we learn more about their past crimes and their fractured families, she raises thorny questions. Frank discovers Louis was someone who once violently ruled the yard, making enemies, some of whom still haunt him, waiting for revenge. But Louis can barely recall the facts of his life, let alone the worst things he’s done within it, so is it right for someone to be punished for something they can’t remember doing? One of Frank’s fellow carers is a Latino man (Puerto Rican rapper Residente) having to look after a swastika-tattooed racist. How much care does he deserve?In sticking to a more conventional structure, Volpe’s film often feels a little too by-the-book. She might have found an unusual way in, but she’s still taking us to a place we know well, at least from afar. The scenes of Frank away from Louis can often feel a little too generic, and unrevealing, and at times, it feels as if the story, with an inevitable end signposted early on, doesn’t have quite enough to power a full movie. Volpe wisely keeps her direction unfussy, and her continued interest in caregiving is unusually admirable, yet I found some of her score to be a little flat and anonymous, absent strings failing to lift some of the more emotive last act scenes. It works when it works because of its two central performances. Ben-Adir is handed a somewhat standard-issue prison character – quiet, keeps to himself, reserves his strength until it’s absolutely needed – but he avoids the strong, silent stereotype, controlling his understandable waves of anger, fear and upset, adding depth to a character who, on the page, is in need of some.Morgan is the perfect example of a recognisable, but not widely famous character actor who has deserved a bigger, better chance. He’s found a home at Sundance, with roles in Pariah, Mudbound, Monsters and Men and The Last Black Man in San Francisco, and the nature of this particular role and the heart-wrenching strength of his performance feels like enough to edge him into new, possibly awards-worthy territory. His moments of grim realisation – that something is shifting, fading, dying – are pretty wrecking to watch, a man no longer able to protect and sustain himself as he always has, growing to rely upon and eventually love a caregiver who isn’t family or even friend. Frank & Louis is a solidly made drama, but Ben-Adir and Morgan are something special.Frank & Louis is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewSundance film festivalKingsley Ben-AdirDrama filmsFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Will Pound explains why playing by ear is his greatest strengthWill PoundTue 27 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareI’m a harmonica and accordion player and one half of folk-classical duo Stevens & Pound. As a multi-instrumentalist I am rooted in a folk tradition that is oral, aural and communal. Music and song are passed down by ear, either through recordings or – more fun – traditional music sessions. Here, players and singers get together to share, swap and play tunes, drawing from a repertoire that is always evolving. While collections of tunesare certainly notated, their scores act as a skeleton – providing the basic architecture of pitch and rhythm but rarely offering explicit guidance on how the music should be played.Delia Stevens and I are about to head out on tour, performing with the Britten Sinfonia andRobert Macfarlanein a new work called The Silent Planet, a recomposition of Holst’s Planets suite. It’s the culmination of 18 months of rehearsals and revisions, and the score for this 60-minute work, orchestrated by Ian Gardiner, totals 165 pages and includes Earth, an entirely new composition.View image in fullscreenRobert Macfarlane has written new words for Earth, part of the Silent Planet, Stevens & Pound’s ‘recomposition’ of Holst’s The Planets.Photograph: Mark WormaldI have co-written this piece, but have never read the score; in fact, I do not read music.I am hardly alone in this. The non-reader tradition boasts a star-studded cast, including Paul McCartney, Hans Zimmer, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix andTaylor Swift. No one could claim these musicians have been held back by their inability to read music.Aural mastery can be just as potent a force as visual literacy.For me, reading music was a skill that simply never took root, compounded by my challenges with dyslexia. I spent years believing that this was a permanent barrier, locking me out of engaging with complex scores or longer pieces of music. After all, a classical work by a composer such as Bach or Handel is conceived as a comprehensive blueprint – the notation, often layered with Italian performance terms, explicitly tells the performer how to approach dynamics, tempo, articulation and expression. It is a full instruction manual.The challenge is intensified in large-scale collaborations. My early experience with the brilliant Sinfonia Cymru brought this into sharp focus.We were rehearsing a project that included my work The Reckoning and Stevens & Pounds’ arrangements of Ralph Vaughan Williams’The Lark Ascending, which toured last year across Wales. I found myself adrift when the conductor used terminology that was unfamiliar to me. I had to be clear with the ensemble that I was a beginner in this new language of tuttis and legatos, and they could help me out by replacing or translating classical terms. That said, the gap in jargon works both ways. The folk world has its own detailed lexicon of terms: jigs, hornpipes, slip jigs, reels, slides and polkas to name a few. These distinct tune types are differentiated primarily by their rhythm and time signature, and they correspond to various regional folk and céilidh dances, often possessing nuanced sub-classifications essential to a deeper understanding of the repertoire.View image in fullscreen‘Aural mastery can be just as potent a force as visual literacy’… Will Pound.Photograph: No creditI like to think of Stevens & Pound, the duo classical percussionist Delia Stevens and I formed in late 2022,as multilingual in spirit. Since then we have been on a mission to rethink major classical works. Our goal is not simply to play cover versions, or compensate for my lack of reading, but to lean into the dynamism and freedom that playing by ear brings. Taking The Planets, The Lark Ascending and other pieces into the sub-genre we have created recreates them in unexpected ways. We intentionally reimagine familiar works, whether they’re from the classical canon or other genres, because it gives the audience an immediate point of connection before we take them on a completely fresh, transformative musical journey.The Lark Ascending was our first foray into this territory. Its meditative, improvisatory nature made it a relatively safe starting point, and it was here that we developed our system for re-engaging with the original scores, based on voice-note recordings from Delia that I learn by ear.Perhaps lulled into a false sense of security, we decided to follow this up with Holst’s monumental masterpiece.This has proved the biggest test yet for our system – and my brain. The technical demands are so great that I had a wide range of custom harmonicas built by Seydel, Suzuki and other harmonica companies, so rather than just playing the work on a chromatic harmonica I gained different timbres, techniques and sounds to bring the pieces to life.The same goes for my accordion: I had to develop new techniques and learn different scales and chord progressions that wouldn’t usually be played on a diatonic instrument. Even more daunting than the technical hurdles was the psychological obstacle of tackling such a complex score without the ability to read it.Yet learning by ear and resisting the explicit instructions of a score has become my greatest strength: it forces me to approach the music laterally, bringing my own sound world and a unique, personal voice to the work – a voice that is not confined by the dots on the page.View image in fullscreenBritten Sinfonia at Saffron Hall, Saffron Walden in 2024.Photograph: Tom LovattThis is not a question of right or wrong: I’ve always challenged the notion that classical players can’t play folk, or folk musicians can’t play classical. Whether you call our tour dates gigs or concerts, the two genres are far more interlinked than we have been led to believe.Two amazing composers who recognised and embraced these connections feature in the first half of our programme: Percy Grainger and Benjamin Britten. Despite their mutual admiration – Britten dedicated his Suite on English Folk Tunes to Grainger – the pair only met once: at Cecil Sharp House in London, the headquarters of theEnglish Folk Dance and Song Society.

Here, the Water of Leith river meets the sea, and on bright days, when pubs and restaurants spill out to the Shore area, there’s nowhere quite like it. I moved here 13 years ago, and it has been a joy to watch the area evolve and reinvent itself. Today it’s the city’s creative heart, full of artists, musicians, designers and startups, with a thriving food and drink scene. The arrival of the tramline from Edinburgh city centre in 2023 has given it a big boost too.View image in fullscreenThe Shore, Leith.Photograph: Robert Harding/AlamyAlthough the Leith immortalised in Irvine Welsh’s Trainspotting is long gone, to call it fully gentrified would be failing to pay attention. Two recent campaigns, both successful, have galvanised locals: one to stop Waterstones opening near the independent Argonaut Books; and the other to return the benches used by day-drinkers on the Kirkgate, which had been removed by the council. There’s space for both in Leith.What keeps me here is the strong, village-like community spirit, paired with the ever-changing energy of a city. One day I can get stuck into digging on the Community Croft; the next I’m immersed in art galleries, gigs and fine dining. For visitors, Leith offers a slice of real Edinburgh, with no bus tours, shops selling tartan tat, or out-of-tune bagpipes.Where to eat and drinkView image in fullscreenBarry Fish restaurant opened in early 2025Leith’s food and drink ranges from Michelin-starred restaurants to community cafes, old-men’s pubs to smart cocktail bars. Over the past few years there has been a flurry of openings that mirror the creativity of the area. “Leith has the perfect mix of old and new: places that have been here for decades, and new energy coming through,” says chef Barry Bryson. “It’s multicultural, rich and varied, and serves a community of diners, not just one demographic.” Bryson opened his first restaurant,Barry Fish, on the Shore in early 2025. Immediately it became one of my favourite places to eat. I recommend cosying into the calm green interiors and ordering the trout pastrami and lobster agnolotti.Chef Roberta Hall-McCarron and her husband, Shaun McCarron, opened the cafe-barArdfernin 2024, next door to their fine-dining restaurant The Little Chartroom. I’ve eaten there at every hour, enjoying lazy brunches, birthday lunches, early evening oysters and long dinners with friends. The hash browns are non-negotiable, most recently topped with sprout kimchi, fish sauce aioli and nori. “It’s inspiring to be part of a supportive, creative community,” says Shaun.View image in fullscreenA dish at Ardfern.Photograph: AwAyeMediaThat emphasis on community is echoed atDogstar, newly opened by chef James Murray along with Michael Lynch and Kyle Jamieson of Nauticus bar. After years cooking at the highest level and earning a Michelin star at Timberyard, Murray found an increasing sense of disconnect with the world of fine dining. “The next stage for me was wanting to live and work in my community, so choosing Leith was intentional,” he says. “There’s a pride to people down here. If it’s a Leith spot cooking for Leith people, they get behind you.” Sitting at the bar watching dishes spin in the kitchen, eating shellfish straight from the coals, and dunking warm focaccia into anchovy sauce, I’m certainly behind this restaurant.Cultural experiencesTo discover Leith’s artistic community, visitCustom Lane, a collaborative design space in the old Custom House building on the river, with artists’ workshops, galleries and an excellent cafe. Onsite,Bardis a gallery and shop designed to look like the home of a collector. Husbands Hugo Macdonald and James Stevens travel across Scotland bringing contemporary Scottish design to Leith, inviting the curious to explore the integration of high-end design in a domestic environment. Regardless of your interiors budget, it’s not to be missed.Across the river isBrown’s of Leith, the newest outpost of Custom Lane. This vast three-storey Victorian warehouse has been transformed into a multi-use creative space by GRAS architects. On the ground floor, three food businesses – ShrimpWreck shellfish bar, Haze for wine and top-tier snacks, and Civerinos pizza – share a relaxed dining area, with more residents, events and collaborations imminent. “At Brown’s we identified a need for spaces that genuinely support and celebrate creativity,” says architect Gunnar Groves-Raines of GRAS. The restaurateurs are equally enthusiastic. “Leith has a strong sense of identity: independent, creative and rooted in its history,” says Joseph Radford of Haze. “Our intention is to respond to that rather than overwrite it.” I visit early in the evening when the lights are low, the music perfectly pitched and the atmosphere a relaxed buzz. Soon our table is full of oysters, bowls of mussels and tinned fish on toast. It’s a lot of fun.View image in fullscreenGRAS architects at Brown’s of Leith, a Victorian warehouse that’s now a creative space.Photograph: Richard GastonFurther collaborative art spaces across Leith are also worth exploring. BetweenDrill Hall,The Biscuit FactoryandCoburg House Art Studios, there’s always something interesting going on. And there’s more to come – after years of tireless volunteer fundraising and campaigning,Leith theatrehas been awarded lottery funding to restore the beautiful 1932 art deco building to its former glory. Pop-ups in the space, including a past Edinburgh international festival residency, have offered a thrilling glimpse of the future.Where to shopLeith is home to some great independent shops.Argonaut Books, inside the old train station, is run by people passionate about reading, and has a lovely cafe and regular events. Arty gift shops includeLogan Malloch,FluxandHandselon Leith Walk – all sell work by local artists. For interesting wine, head to the tiny independentBludge.Don’t missTheRoyal Yacht Britanniaattracts hundreds daily, keen for a glimpse of how the monarchs holidayed. But I prefer thePort of Leith Distillery, an impressive-looking “vertical distillery” where whisky production takes place from top-to-bottom over nine storeys. Tours of the stills are fascinating and the views over the Firth of Forth to Fife from the cafe and bar are unmatched. Take a stroll along the Water of Leith path, perhaps followed by a visit to a taproom for a fresh pint. Leith has a flourishing craft brewery scene, andMoonwake,CampervanandNewbarnsall have welcoming taprooms.StayMalmaison Edinburghhas smart riverside rooms (from £77 room-only), or push the boat out (pun intended) and spend the night on boardFingal(cabins from £269 B&B), a former lighthouse tender turned luxury hotel, permanently moored in Leith.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh holidaysZoning inScotland holidaysCity breaksShort breaksFood and drinkShopping tripsUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To counterbalance the intake of cake, she tends to look for “something salty, spiced and crisp”, and, if time is on her side, that usually means homemade tortilla chips. “Chop corn tortillas into triangles, brush with olive oil and seasonings – flaky salt, za’atar, dukkah, garlic granules, or everything bagel seasoning, which is elite.” Bake until nice and crisp, then dunk into hummus. Her fellow Guardian regularGeorgina Haydenis also rarely found without a tub of that creamy chickpea dip, whether it’s homemade or shop-bought: “I usually drizzle chilli crisp oil over the top of my hummus, then scoop it up with crudites [celery, carrot, cucumber, say]. That’ssogood – andsoeasy.”If Hayden’s trying “to be fancy”, however, her attention turns to gildas, – “an olive, a little anchovy and a pickled green chilli on a cocktail stick – or just a lovely, salty, anchovy-stuffed olive”. You could, of course, thread any antipasti you have knocking around on to said stick: “Sun-dried tomato, artichoke heart or one of those gorgeous, marinated onions.” Having a batch of that in the fridge feels “like a treat, but less indulgent”, she adds.Our columnists often say cheese, too, whether that’s simply a cube (*waves at Ebuehi*) or, forRukmini Iyer, mixed into some homemade dough and baked: “I mean, it’s still a biscuit, but you can flavour it with whatever you want,” she says, be that with rosemary or sage, or nigella, fennel, caraway or cumin seeds. They’re easy, to boot: “Blitz cheese in a food processor, add spelt flour and butter, and blitz again into a dough. Roll into a log, wrap in baking paper and pop in the fridge.” Iyer usually does this prep in the evening, then, the next morning, she turns on the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, slices the cheesy log into slim discs, transfers those to a lined oven tray and bakes for 10 minutes, until golden. “You’ve then got freshly baked snacks for the day, which are as good for adults as they are for children.” In a similar vein, cheese pinwheels and straws are another hit chez Hayden: “Lay out a sheet of puff pastry, spread it with Marmite and a bit of butter, then grate over any hard cheeses you have in the fridge.” Cut into strips, gently twist each one into a spiral and bake: “Those last well, too.”Thomasina Miers’ tactic, meanwhile, is to go nuts: “Toast fennel seeds, then toss them with chilli flakes, sea salt and chopped rosemary. Toss that with some olive oil and honey, then use it to coat a mix of your favourite nuts and seeds.” Roast at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for about 20 minutes, until golden, and the job’s a good ’un. Alternatively, up your snack game with a savoury granola, which Ebuehi whips up by mixing nuts, oats, honey (“for a little sweetness”), sesame seeds and seasoning (“za’atar, garlic powder, chilli, for example”), then baking until golden. Eat by the pawful or sprinkle over yoghurt – no, it’s not quite a Hobnob, but it’s pretty damned good nonetheless.Got a culinary dilemma?

January is a time for turning on the oven and cooking without having to think too much, and this is the sort of dish that more or less looks after itself while you get on with your evening. The kitchen feels warmer, the smell changes and you know that dinner is sorted. This is simple, honest food, and not remotely trying to be clever. It’s just something to put in the middle of the table, cut into and share, which is exactly what you want when the days are cold and nights are long.Slow-roast celeriac with rosemary and crisp chorizoPrep5 minCook2 hr+Serves41 large celeriac2 sprigs rosemary, leaves picked2 garlic cloves, peeled1 tsp smoked sweet paprika2 tbsp olive oilSea salt and black pepper125g chorizo, chopped2 tbsp apple cider vinegar2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 small handful chopped flat-leaf parsley, to finishHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Wash and trim the celeriac, then pierce it all over with the tip of a sharp knife and put it in an ovenproof dish.Put the rosemary, garlic, paprika and olive oil in a mortar, add some salt and pepper, then crush to a coarse paste. Coat the outside of the celeriac with the rosemary mixture. Put a splash of water in the bottom of the dish, then cover the celeriac with tinfoil and roast for two to two and a half hours, until tender to the point of a knife.When the celeriac is cooked, put a frying pan on a medium heat, then fry the chorizo until golden and crisp. Pour the vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil into the hot chorizo pan and stir to combine and reduce.Cut the celeriac into 1cm-thick slices, then arrange these on a platter and spoon on the chorizo dressing. Scatter over the parsley and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodSpanish food and drinkMain courseVegetablesSausagesrecipesShareReuse this content"
